### Hong Kong Government Explains Evacuation Plan, Hong Kong's Atmosphere Slightly Relaxes, Border Begins to Close, Refugees Swarm to Hong Kong, 2,000 Japanese Troops Retreat to Shenzhen to Build Roads

Hong Kong. After the Hong Kong government explained that the evacuation of women and children was a "purely precautionary measure" and informed sources generally believed that a serious emergency was unlikely to occur, the atmosphere here has greatly eased, and confidence has been largely restored. Registration for the evacuation of women and children continued today. Rumors of bank runs continue to circulate today, but have decreased significantly compared to yesterday. It is also reported that the government is currently finding ways to evacuate British and Portuguese women and children, and is providing registration convenience for Chinese families who wish to leave. According to various newspapers, the Hong Kong government has issued an order requiring approximately 63 Italian priests to prepare to leave Hong Kong before June 26. It is reported that Bishop Valtorta is currently negotiating this matter with the Acting Governor. This order does not apply to female missionaries running schools and hospitals here. A small number of German and Austrian refugees have requested the authorities to find ways to evacuate them as soon as possible. (Reuters, 2nd)

Hong Kong. This afternoon, a British Royal Airways plane evacuated the company's staff and their families from Hong Kong to Bangkok (Siam). Major British shipping companies have also begun to relocate their staff and their families to Singapore. According to the Hong Kong Telegraph, 2,000 Japanese troops have concentrated in Shenzhen, and it is reported that the Japanese authorities there are currently recruiting male and female laborers to build the road from Shenzhen to Nantou, as this road has been destroyed by recent floods. It is also reported that the Japanese army is blocking Chinese refugees evacuating from Hong Kong from entering the mainland, only those who go to Dapeng Bay and do not return home are not stopped. Local authorities say that the Hong Kong border may be completely closed at 4:00 PM today, and no entry or exit will be allowed from that time onwards. As a result, countless Chinese refugees are flocking to Hong Kong before the closure. Currently, 3,000 women and children have registered with the authorities for evacuation. This group of women and children will board ships to leave Hong Kong on Friday. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Hong Kong. Overseas reports that the Hong Kong government declared a state of emergency before ordering the evacuation of women and children have been denied here today. It is said that the only state of emergency existing in Hong Kong is the one declared on September 3 last year when the European war broke out. It is reported that Japanese newspapers are strongly criticizing the misreporting that the Hong Kong government has recently declared a state of emergency. (Reuters, 2nd)

Hong Kong. After the Hong Kong government explained the evacuation plan, people's hearts gradually calmed down. British women and children continue to register, preparing to evacuate on the 5th. 100 American businessmen evacuated to the Philippines on the evening of the 1st. Very few refugees in the New Territories. The border will begin to close on the 3rd. (Telegram, 2nd)

Hong Kong. The American President Coolidge sailed towards Manila last night at midnight. In addition to passengers, there were countless women and children refugees on board. After the American Consul General urged all American women and children to leave Hong Kong, the Coolidge was temporarily overcrowded. The move to urge American citizens to leave Hong Kong was triggered by the Hong Kong government notifying the American consulate yesterday that the situation in Hong Kong might become increasingly serious. The Japanese Empress has already transported 1,900 family members of British army officers to Manila before the Coolidge. The cabins of these two ships were filled with military cots, with only a few inches between each bed. The refugees on the Japanese Empress tasted the flavor of war for the first time last night, as they only received soldiers' wartime meals. At the same time, the plan to evacuate European and American women and children remaining in Hong Kong is proceeding rapidly today. Although the previous two ships were already full of refugees, the British government declared that future ships would be able to carry even more refugees. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Manila. 2,000 people who came here from Hong Kong to seek refuge today, half of them will stay in Manila, and the rest will live in Baguio. The American army authorities are currently preparing for their landing here. It is generally believed that the first batch of refugees are family members of soldiers and will only stay in the Philippines to await dispersal to Australia. (Reuters, 2nd)

Hong Kong. Since the British and American expatriates in Hong Kong began to evacuate, the Chinese residents in Hong Kong have also been evacuating one after another, and the number has been increasing daily. (Telegram, 2nd)

Hong Kong. The American ship President Coolidge carried 100 American expatriates to the Philippines at 12:00 last night. Although the American Consul was ordered by the State Department to advise American expatriates in Hong Kong to leave, there was no order for forced evacuation. Therefore, some American expatriates, considering that the situation did not appear to be deteriorating, have decided to stay in Hong Kong. (Telegram, 2nd)

### Kaifeng Street Fighting Not Yet Over

Chongqing. Today, we received a telegram from Qian Huaifang in Henan Province stating that the street fighting in Kaifeng has not stopped. The Chinese army is currently fiercely attacking the eastern part of the province. After the Chinese army entered Kaifeng on June 30, the Japanese army launched a counterattack from the south gate. It is reported that the Chinese artillery bombarded the southeastern part of the city fiercely, and several places caught fire. At the same time, other Chinese troops are attacking Guidezhai (transliteration) southwest of Guide, and street fighting is taking place in Luyi south of Guide. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Britain Does Not Allow Interference in Burma

London. The British government last night denounced Japan's accusation that Britain had sold out Japan's military actions in China to the Chinese side as "completely untrue." The British offense was announced last week by the Japanese Southern China Command. The Japanese Command pointed out that British troops around Hong Kong were informing the Chinese army of Japanese military actions. Based on this accusation, the Japanese army announced the abandonment of the agreement with the British authorities in Hong Kong that British and Japanese troops must notify each other 24 hours before entering the Kowloon Leased Territory border. The British government stated last night that it does not pay attention to Japan's suspension of the practice in the agreement. Recently, British authorities stated that the main reason for the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong was the fear of food problems caused by the Japanese blockade of Hong Kong. Attention here is focused on the British response to Japan's request to block the Burma Road soon. It is generally believed that Britain will not allow Japan to interfere in its policies in Burma, as Burma is 3,000 miles away from Tokyo. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Singapore Intensifies Defenses

Singapore. The official gazette states that the authorities are taking steps to ensure that Singapore's defenses reach a higher state of readiness in view of the general situation in the Far East. Defense plans for Penang and various parts of Malaya are being finalized. These steps should not be regarded as a sign of any immediate danger to Malaya, as this is merely the normal military precaution necessary at present. (Reuters, 2nd)

Singapore. In view of the threat to the situation in the Far East, the British authorities are rushing to build other defense projects in Singapore, Penang, and throughout Malaya. Obstacles along the south of Singapore Island have been destroyed separately, and barbed wire has been erected in Singapore and elsewhere. As for other defense works, they have not been announced by the authorities due to military secrecy. However, according to orders received by the British Defense Forces, Singapore and the entire Malaya are in the final defense position. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Reports of American Warships Sailing to Hong Kong Are Inaccurate

Manila. Naval authorities here say that the rumor that American destroyers are currently sailing from Manila to Hong Kong is completely false. If more warships need to be stationed in Hong Kong, warships from the China Fleet will be dispatched. Six large submarines departed for China last week, but this move is only to replace the six old-style submarines that are currently sailing back to Manila. (Reuters, 2nd)

Rangoon. The Governor of Burma has issued an order under the Burma Defense Regulations prohibiting the listening to any propaganda or news reports from German or enemy areas in public places during the war, but listening to such broadcasts in private homes is not restricted. (Reuters, 2nd)

Daily Newspaper Commentary Hong Kong Situation

According to the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun," the measures taken by Hong Kong to evacuate residents and strengthen defenses are a strategy for Britain to divert the United States' attention and focus it on the Far East issue. The sudden return of the American fleet to Hawaii is related to the situation in Hong Kong. Japan's recently announced foreign policy regards the southwestern Pacific as part of East Asia. Japan should be prepared to deal with possible conflicts with the United States. Japanese diplomats should closely monitor the trend of cooperation between Britain and the United States on the Far East issue. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

### British Cabinet Meeting Held to Discuss the Far East Situation, Recognizes That the Shanghai International Settlement Remains Inviolable

London. Britain, which feels threatened by aggression at home and faces difficulties with Japan in the Far East, held a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss the Far East situation. Informed sources expect that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, will soon receive Britain's response to Japan's request to block the road between Burma and Chongqing, and it is believed that a small number of British troops stationed in Shanghai may be transferred to Hong Kong. However, it is said that Britain will also clearly state that the transfer of troops is not a sacrifice of treaty rights, and the Shanghai International Settlement remains inviolable. Officials here are very satisfied with the recall of American warships to Hawaii last week, but said that at this time, the US Navy should quickly concentrate on the Atlantic. It is believed here that the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong is a precautionary plan, the main purpose of which is to prevent the risk of food shortages once the Japanese army imposes a blockade. The government here insists that Britain does not want to sacrifice China to satisfy Japan. Britain hopes that the United States will provide moral assistance to East Asia. Japan's request to stop the transportation of munitions to Chongqing through Hong Kong will not cause difficulties for China, because the recent activities of the Japanese army in the region have completely closed the gap between Hong Kong and the interior. Traffic between Hong Kong and the interior has ceased since the Japanese army's activities. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Editorial

### The Evolving International Situation

After the armistice agreements between Germany and France, and Italy and France, were formally announced one after another, the war on the European continent can be considered to have ended. At that time, most people expected the next scene to be a large-scale German and Italian invasion of the British Isles, or that Germany and Italy would begin a "peace offensive." But the facts now show that it has gone beyond the scope of the three warring countries and triggered a wider upheaval in the international situation.

Both sides of the warring countries are clearly watching the evolution of this international situation; because Japan's threat to Hong Kong and Vietnam, the Soviet Union's advance into Romania, and the United States' large-scale expansion of armaments are by no means a few unrelated actions, and their results will all affect the warring countries. Based on some information we have been able to obtain, we can analyze the current situation for reference.

First, the issue of Britain's attitude is the most important of all the current international factors. After the end of the war on the European continent, Britain has three possible paths: (1) Make peace with Germany and Italy, sacrificing some of the interests of the British Empire in exchange for a compromise with Germany and Italy, seeking a considerable period of peace with each other. This would mean that the victory of the entire European war belongs to Germany and Italy. (2) Preserve the interests of the British Empire itself in a completely narrow sense, acquiesce in the established facts on the European continent, and from now on, concentrate on using its invincible navy to defend itself, taking a "do not offend me, I will not offend others" attitude towards all countries. This would mean that the war would temporarily come to an end. (3) Continue to hold up the banner of fighting for freedom and justice, and lead the like-minded people of other European countries in a thorough war of resistance. From the news transmitted from various sources in recent days, the possibility of the first path has completely disappeared. Even former Prime Minister Chamberlain, who was considered by all parties to be the most likely to represent this faction's views, has made two impassioned statements in just three days. This shows how widespread and deep the opposition to compromise is in Britain today. As for the second path, Britain must first stop the active activities of supporting the governments of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Netherlands, and especially no longer recognize the group led by General de Gaulle as representing France; but the facts are exactly the opposite. Therefore, it can be inferred that Britain is taking the third path. Following this path, Britain will inevitably righteously and sternly condemn all aggression in the world and never recognize established facts; only in this way can it win the support of all justice- and freedom-loving people around the world, win further assistance from the United States, and gain the understanding and goodwill of the Soviet Union. Just looking at Britain's rapid efforts to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong in the past two days shows its spirit of not hesitating to confront the aggressive forces in the East, and also indirectly proves its determination to take the aforementioned third path.

Second is the attitude of the United States. From the perspective of the United States, if Britain takes the first path mentioned above, then the United States will have no other actions that can help the European situation unless it goes to war with Germany and Italy. If Britain takes the second path mentioned above, then the power of the isolationist faction in the United States will also expand accordingly. After that, all the United States' facilities and measures will only focus on the so-called defense of the Western Hemisphere. Now, because Britain insists on its position, the theoretical basis and observational basis of the American isolationists have all fallen through; and in the future, no one will raise objections to the principle of aiding the countries resisting aggression. Under this atmosphere, the advocacy of restraining aggression will naturally be gradually implemented. The backbone of this faction is the so-called "Great Navy Doctrine," which advocates taking care of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the same time; therefore, what will benefit from this in the future is not only Europe; and during the period when Britain holds the sea power, the United States' great navy can also play a role in stabilizing the situation in Asia.

Third is the attitude of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's basic attitude towards the wars currently in progress in both Europe and Asia has been repeatedly stated very clearly. Simply put: for the Sino-Japanese War in Asia, as long as the war exists for one day, the Soviet Union will assist China for one day under any circumstances; for the war in Europe, it maintains the greatest possible angle that can be left, right, or neutral under various different circumstances and with different interests. However, the advances of Germany and Italy have reduced the Soviet Union's supportive component of Germany to an extremely low level, and it can even be asserted that from now on, whether in Europe or Asia, the Soviet Union will never become an ally of the so-called "anti-communist" countries. What is currently worthy of attention is how the Soviet Union and the United States will get along? This is something that no one can predict and needs to be explained by future facts. Currently, we can only specifically point out this point to prompt readers to observe quietly.

### The United States Worries About the Far East Situation, May Increase Pressure on Japan, Hull Refuses to Criticize Arita's Statement, Possibility of War Greater in the Far East

Washington. Secretary of State Hull told reporters here yesterday that the United States' Far East policy has been stated repeatedly and is clear to the world, requiring no further elaboration. Hull refused to criticize the "Monroe Doctrine" speech for East Asia delivered by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. When asked whether he understood that Japan's new policy applied to the Philippines, Hull replied that he had repeatedly explained the position of the Far East in the past, and "I do not want to discuss it at present." At this time, Washington officials are maintaining complete and calm silence on the diplomatic policy announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Some observers said that the government believes that empty talk and protests about the Far East have become a thing of the past, so officials will not criticize Japan's Monroe Doctrine. The content of last week's talks between the British Ambassador, the Australian Minister, and Hull here remains confidential. It is reported that what they discussed was the situation in Hong Kong, but the results of the talks have not been announced. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Washington. Informed sources here have an attitude that can be described as anxious about the meaning of the Far East situation. Cautious observers now believe that although the United States is not in the mood to go to war anywhere, the chance of the United States being drawn into the vortex of war in the East is greater than in Europe. However, many people in civil and military agencies feel that Japan's ambition to seize hegemony in the East is a starting point and not an end, and predict that if Japan's plan succeeds, it will put the countries of the Americas in a dangerous position of being subject to all-round commercial and military attacks from the West under the state of Germany's continued victory, and the same attacks from the East. The fleet is currently stationed in the Pacific, and the prospects are worrying, and the raw materials and commerce needed for the defense of the Americas also come mostly from the East, which is also worrying. Although officials do not express definitive opinions, there is reason to believe that American diplomacy is not idle. The United States holds strong weapons in its hands, such as immediately cutting off at least 60 percent of the supplies that Japan has used for war in China in the past three years. Most of these weapons are metal products and transportation materials. Song Ziwen is currently in Washington and will soon visit President Roosevelt and several cabinet members. It is reported that Song plans to seek loans or unrestricted credit lines for China, but it is not easy to know whether this move will be successful. (Reuters, 2nd)

London. The Daily Telegraph's Washington dispatch said that the US government is closely watching the Soviet Union and Japan's renewed aggressive strategies, and is paying particular attention to Japan. Although the incompatibility of the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East may temporarily benefit democratic countries, in essence, the "rogue states," including other dictatorial countries, will eventually collude with each other. Therefore, the United States government has been under strong pressure for the past three weeks to reach an understanding with Japan, which has been rejected by the State Department. President Roosevelt's recruitment of Colonel Stimson into the cabinet has clearly shown that he does not agree with abandoning the non-recognition doctrine first announced by Colonel Stimson. Those who advocate compromise with Japan believe that the main threat comes from Germany. If the United States once adopts a friendly attitude towards the Japanese fleet, the US Navy can concentrate on the Atlantic to deal with any Nazi plot against Latin America. The departure of the US battle fleet from Hawaii last week has led to rumors that the authorities have indeed transferred the fleet to the Atlantic. The US government has not tried to stop this rumor, and seems to be encouraging its spread. (Reuters, 2nd)

### President Roosevelt Meets with Song Ziwen, Song Does Not Announce the Content of the Meeting, and Plans to Meet with Finance Minister Morganthau

Washington. President Roosevelt met with Song Ziwen, former Minister of Finance of China, at the Executive Office of the White House yesterday. Hu Shi, the Chinese Ambassador to Washington, also accompanied him. After the meeting, Song avoided all questions about the purpose of his trip to reporters, saying only that he was visiting the United States on behalf of the Bank of China. He met with President Roosevelt when he visited Washington in 1933. He said that yesterday's visit to the White House was "just another happy gathering." Song said that he may meet with Peerson, President of the Export-Import Bank, and Finance Minister Morganthau again, but he refused to disclose the topic of the talks. Song also said that the Sino-Japanese war will reach three years on July 7. When asked whether China still maintains a strong defensive position, Song replied, "If the war can be prolonged for so long, then this war may be fought to the end." Song replied to reporters that he did not believe that General Chiang Kai-shek would move the capital because of repeated Japanese bombings. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Japanese Army Minister Hata Shunroku Delivers a Speech, Encouraging Army Ministry Personnel to Adapt to World Situation

Tokyo. Army Minister Hata Shunroku recently delivered a speech to the personnel of the Army Ministry yesterday, stating that the evolution of the current world situation and the implementation of our country's various policies are quite favorable. We should not easily let go of this opportunity. You must keep two things firmly in your minds: (1) the comprehensive and reasonable solution of the "China Incident"; (2) the reorganization and strengthening of domestic institutions. You should always take these two things as your responsibility, and adapt to the situation based on the evolution of the future world situation in order to achieve this month. As for certain third countries that disregard the policies currently being implemented by Japan and recklessly obstruct them, we must confront them with a stern attitude. Needless to say, although we do not engage in unnecessary disputes, we also do not want to let this golden age go to waste. In short, all Japanese actions must adhere to the great spirit of the empire, without any doubt, and act as the guardians of justice, and never advocate fraud. In addition, when the Army Minister spoke, he reportedly expressed his support for Prince Konoe's recent resignation from the position of President of the Privy Council and his efforts to organize a party movement. (Havas, 1st)

### British Times Comments on Arita's Main Argument, Saying It Is Broad and Not Concrete

London. The Times' Washington dispatch mentioned the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks on the future of East Asia and the South Seas countries, saying that the more Washington people study Arita's remarks, the more they feel that the words are broad and not concrete, and they feel that Tokyo knows that various problems need to be solved before this kind of organization takes shape. It is believed here that the world is paying great attention to the scope and significance of the Soviet Union's actions in both Balkans. If the Soviet Union and Germany cause a conflict, Japan will quickly move towards the Axis powers and seek to seize or blockade Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's access to the Pacific. If the Soviet Union and Germany continue to cooperate, Tokyo will be panicked and try to improve its relations with Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 2nd)

### U.S. Forbids Storing of Munitions, Supplies to Britain, Roosevelt Signs Bill

New York: According to the New York Times' Washington correspondent, President Roosevelt has signed the bill prohibiting the supply of munitions and stores belonging to the U.S. Army and Navy to Britain. These stores can only be sold to or transported to foreign governments if the Secretary of the Navy or the Army certifies that they are not necessary for U.S. defense. As it is believed that the Secretaries of the Army and Navy may not be willing to bear the responsibility of certifying that these items are not useful for national defense, Allied munitions purchasing agents in the U.S. are paying close attention to this matter. They recently thought that war supplies that could be transported to aid the Allies and are currently stored would now lack any hope of being purchased. Although the U.S. has adopted this plan, South Ireland is still exploring the possibility of purchasing cannons and rifles from the U.S. to defend against foreign invasion. (2nd Reuters)

### U.S. Envoy to Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, U.S. Government to Withdraw

It is believed that there is no other obvious solution. It is reported that consuls in various locations will continue to reside in order to look after the interests of the American people.

### German Foreign Affairs Magazine Reviews Future of Europe and America, Says America Should Not Interfere in European Affairs

Berlin: According to an article published in the foreign policy journal "Berlin Rome Tokyo" titled "America and Europe," the author has close ties with the German Foreign Ministry but has not disclosed their name. The article states that Europe is still at war and hopes not to be cut off from other economic regions due to Britain's despotic measures. Europe will be forced to secure and organize necessities that cannot be obtained from other regions. Whether this plan will be implemented will depend on America's friendly or hostile attitude. The interests of America and the interests of Europe are mutually compatible. American common sense will not sacrifice the vital interests of the American countries for the sake of risking Britain's failure. The article claims that attacks between Europe and America have no hope of success, let alone conquest. However, it is reasonable for American patriots to advocate strengthening military power. However, it is incomprehensible to claim to feel threatened due to insufficient military equipment while assisting other countries with the latest weapons. The article also mentions the words of Führer Hitler, stating that "How America conducts its life is no concern of anyone. The development status of America's military equipment plans is also no concern of Germany. America is for Americans, and Europe is for Europeans." The article continues to say that adhering to the Monroe Doctrine requires not only Europe not to interfere in American affairs, but also America not to interfere in European affairs. This is the position of Germany and its allies, and it is also the position of the new Europe. Countries around the world should understand the situation in the new Europe. (30th Huitong dispatch)

### Berlin Chinese Society Holds Lecture

Berlin: The Chinese Society here held a lecture last night, and many celebrities from all walks of life attended. In addition to Navy Admiral Reitz and Dr. Hippel, who are the president and vice president of the Society and naturally attended, Chinese Ambassador to Germany Chen Jie, German Minister of Transportation Dorpmüller (who once served as the chief engineer of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway), and representatives from various party and government agencies also attended.

### Romania Abandons British and French Guarantees, Adopts Pro-Axis Policy, Hitler Sends Special Envoy to Bucharest, Romanian-Hungarian-Bulgarian Disputes to be Localized

London: According to sources in London, Romania has declared the abolition of the security guarantees provided by Britain and France on April 13, 1939. According to diplomatic opinions, this guarantee was unilateral in nature, so Romania's decision does not affect the British government's freedom to decide whether or not to implement this guarantee. According to news from Bucharest, the Romanian cabinet unanimously approved the abolition of the British guarantee. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Bucharest: Romania, under pressure from three sides, broke its ties with the Allies last night and threw itself into the arms of Führer Hitler. After ending his diplomatic activities, the Romanian Foreign Minister declared that Romania had abandoned the British and French guarantees of Romania's territorial integrity. It is believed that Romania's move has obtained Germany's guarantee to deal with military aggression. It is reported that several important special envoys of Führer Hitler arrived here last night in connection with seeking German protection for Romania. The identity of the German special envoys was unknown last night, but diplomatic sources said that their visit was related to Romania's formal abandonment of British and French protection of Romania's territorial integrity. Whether Romania succeeded in obtaining German protection was not clear last night. Although there were reports of clashes along the Hungarian border, government officials seemed to have slightly reduced their tension. King Carol of Romania met with several leaders of the Special Committee for several hours yesterday, but the content of the discussion was not announced. As for Carol's whereabouts at the end of last week, it was not announced either. At that time, it was rumored that he went to Rome to visit Prime Minister Mussolini. Recently, German sources here reported that negotiations have begun to prepare for the joint withdrawal of Romanian and Hungarian troops to avoid border conflicts. It is reported that the agreement on this withdrawal will be completed in the next few days. Government officials are said to have left the provinces of Bessarabia and Bukovina last Saturday. (2nd United Press dispatch)

Rome: It was reported here last night that Italy and Germany are now preparing to jointly attack Britain. Officials believe that the "Balkan interlude" that followed France's surrender has come to an end for Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. The contact between the Romanian border guards and the Bulgarian and Hungarian armies is regarded here as a local event. Before the general offensive against the British Isles is launched, it is believed that the Balkans will not be the cause of war. It is believed here that if Romania can abolish the Allied guarantees of its territorial integrity, Italy and Germany will decide to guarantee that it will not be attacked by other countries again. Italian officials claimed last night that they could not confirm the news that the Romanian King had visited Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome. It is believed in some quarters that Prime Minister Mussolini may have encouraged Führer Hitler to intervene in the Balkans. It is recalled here that a report was previously received stating that the German special envoy stationed in Bucharest could arrive in Bucharest last night. It is believed that Führer Hitler has advised Hungary and Bulgaria not to make demands on Romania at this time and to withdraw their troops from the Romanian front to avoid new border wars. (2nd United Press dispatch)

### Germany's Only Diplomatic Achievement in the Balkans

London: Diplomatic sources here recently stated that Germany's diplomatic policy in the Balkan Peninsula has seemed to be in a relatively passive position recently. The reason for this is that Britain is determined to fight to the end and focus its efforts on defending the British Isles. Germany's only diplomatic achievement in the Balkan Peninsula is to promote Romania's abandonment of the security guarantees provided by Britain and France. This achievement is very ordinary. Even if Turkey can still cooperate with Britain, it is difficult for Britain to fulfill its guarantee obligations to Romania. As far as Romania's original intention is concerned, it seems to prefer Germany to the Soviet Union between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany originally knew this because the Romanian authorities believed that once the war in Western Europe was finally resolved, the Romanian issue would also be resolved accordingly. At that time, the benefits that Germany can give to Romania must be greater than those that the Soviet Union can give. In short, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula has no major relationship with the general political situation in Europe, and the outcome of the war in Western Europe is the key to the fate of the entire European continent. (1st Havas dispatch)

Bucharest: Romania's foreign policy has obviously changed greatly, which is attracting much attention. According to reliable intelligence obtained here, the parallel policy pursued by Germany and the Soviet Union before no longer exists. It is expected that Romania's policy will rapidly enter the German sphere of influence thereafter. The underlying situation can be seen in the secret leaflets distributed in the streets of Bucharest. It is said that the Soviet Union was instigated by the British and Jews to make its demands, and the British and Jews hoped to promote a war between the Soviet Union and Germany. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Bucharest: According to the "Romania Daily," the Versailles Treaty was the origin of the current war. No new order was established after the World War. The guarantee treaties of the past 22 years have not been effective. We have not achieved security based on the foreign policy of wrong ideas, and we must pay the price of territory. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

### Border Clashes, Hungary and Romania Conduct Troop Withdrawal Negotiations

Budapest: Two border disputes occurred near Ruste, on the Hungarian-Romanian border. Border guard units of the two countries exchanged fire, but there were no casualties. Hungary has protested to Romania. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

Sofia: Last night, on the Bulgarian-Romanian border, Romanian soldiers fired at Bulgarian territory. According to the Bulgarian semi-official news agency, Bulgarian military authorities, who were investigating the matter, felt that the situation was abnormal and sent troops to a certain place on the border. Seeing this, Romanian troops fired several shots at the Bulgarian side. The Bulgarian border guards did not return fire. The night was very peaceful. The next morning, it was seen that the Romanian soldiers had returned to their barracks, obviously withdrawing at night. No one from the Bulgarian side crossed the border, and no one fired. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Budapest: Today, the situation on the Hungarian-Romanian border has eased because Hungary has stopped general mobilization. The Hungarian cabinet held a four-hour meeting last night, but no mobilization order was issued, and the meeting ended at 10:30 p.m. (2nd United Press dispatch)

Budapest: The Hungarian News Agency today denied foreign reports that clashes had recently occurred on the Hungarian-Romanian border. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

Sofia: The Bulgarian News Agency stated today that no clashes occurred on the Romanian-Bulgarian border the night before last, and there was absolutely no firing. Foreign reports that changes occurred on the Romanian-Bulgarian border have no basis in fact. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

Bucharest: The Hungarian government yesterday asked the Romanian government to explain the reason for declaring general mobilization, pointing out that concentrating troops on the border easily causes incidents. The Romanian side believes that mobilization is entirely for domestic reasons. It is understood that the two governments are currently conducting negotiations on troop withdrawal from the border. The Hungarian Minister has left for home yesterday. Well-informed sources hope that an agreement on troop withdrawal between the two countries can be obtained within days. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

### Hungary Prepares for War, Intentions are Intriguing

Budapest: Hungary again conscripted many levels of reservists yesterday. Soldiers could be seen everywhere in the streets and stations, but the authorities have not yet issued a public announcement. The newspapers in Budapest also did not mention a word about this military preparation. (2nd Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Budapest: A document here states that the services of Hungary's national airline and bus company are restricted for passengers, and the government has even requisitioned a large number of people's horses and vehicles for the use of reservists. The Minister of Commerce has also restricted the sale of gas masks and other items needed for air defense. Preparing for a rainy day, its intentions are intriguing. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

### Romania Stipulates Today as National Mourning Day

Bucharest: Because the last batch of Romanian troops will leave Bessarabia and Bukovina on the 3rd of this month, the Romanian authorities have designated that day as a day of mourning for the Romanian people. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

Bucharest: The Romanian Ministry of Interior issued the following communique on evacuation measures yesterday: "The evacuation work in Bessarabia and Bukovina is now proceeding according to schedule. Eighty trains and many vehicles were used for evacuation last Friday. Aftermath committees, shelters, and information posts have been set up in the evacuated cities. The Romanian authorities are cooperating extremely well with the Soviet authorities in the evacuation work." (2nd Huitong dispatch)

### Red Army Uses Paratroopers to Completely Occupy Romanian Ceded Areas

Bucharest: Soviet troops have now completely occupied the areas ceded by Romania. In some places, Soviet troops crossed the new border, and then immediately retreated to the border agreed upon by both sides. Soviet troops completed the occupation of the area two and a half days earlier than expected because the Soviet side used paratroopers in several places. For example, the town of Porborlai in Bessarabia was occupied by Soviet paratroopers before Romanian troops withdrew. In other places, the Soviet mechanized units advanced very quickly, perhaps the Soviet side wanted to see the nature of the Romanian military deployment, rather than intending to seize the Romanian military deployment. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Bucharest: A communiqué issued here states that conflicts occurred in several places where Soviet motorized units caught up with retreating Romanian troops, but these conflicts were satisfactorily resolved after consultation between the commanders of both sides. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Moscow: In Bessarabia, Soviet troops have reached the Romanian border and completed their defense along the Danube and Prut rivers. Also, in Northern Bukovina, the Red Army also reached the new border the day before yesterday. It is also reported that everything in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina has returned to normal, and railway, telegraph, and telephone services have been restored. No fewer than hundreds of engineers and technicians have been sent to work there, and at the same time, a large number of materials have also been transported. It is also reported that the Soviet Representative Executive Committee has been established in the city of Kishinev in Bessarabia. Water, electricity, municipal administration, and transportation have all returned to normal. All stores have also reopened, newspapers are published, and cinemas are showing the best Soviet films. (2nd TASS dispatch)

### Soviet Ships Discovered in Black Sea, Galatz Workers Riot

Bucharest: According to reliable sources, there are Soviet warships off the Romanian Black Sea coast. It has now been officially confirmed that there were 2,000 workers in conflict with the army at the port of Galatz in the Black Sea on Sunday. According to a communiqué from the Romanian Ministry of Interior, on the evening of June 30, 2,000 workers were waiting for trains to Bessarabia under the supervision of the army. Because the trains were late, the workers planned to hold a demonstration and disperse. The army ordered them to stop and eventually opened fire, killing and wounding several people, but order was quickly restored. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Rome: Italian newspapers have detailed accounts of the riots of Jews in Galatz, and openly announced the conspiracy of Jews to sabotage the Romanian oil fields, so that Germany and Italy cannot obtain oil supplies. According to the "Italian People's Daily," the riots of Jews in Romania this time were instigated by the London Zionist Congress. Although it is impossible to confirm that Jews attempted to cause a civil war in Romania, the attempt by Jews to sabotage the oil fields is already very obvious. (2nd Huitong dispatch)

### Soviet Union Advances Step by Step, Seeks to Extend to Black Sea

Istanbul: Well-informed sources believed last night that in the near future, Stalin may suggest to Turkey to defend the Black Sea, Aegean Sea, and the Dardanelles, and said that Turkish officials believed that Turkey could reach an understanding with Moscow on the question of what kind of fleet should be used in the future in the Straits. However, another group of people is not very optimistic, saying that if the Soviet conditions are too harsh, Turkey may be forced to resort to war. However, all parties believe that Turkey will never give up its sovereignty, so the outcome of the problem will depend on whether the conditions can be agreed upon by each other. Also, a government spokesman last night denied that the Soviet Union had suggested to Turkey to defend the Dardanelles, saying that they were not aware of this. At the same time, reliable sources said that if Bulgaria attempts to recover Dobruja from Romania and participates in the Balkan war, Turkey will still maintain neutrality.

### German Army Uses Blitzkrieg Tactics to Occupy the British Channel Islands, Plans to Attack Gibraltar Via Western Territory and Destroy Britain's Mediterranean Lifeline

London - The Information Department announced that German forces have landed on Jersey and Guernsey in the already demilitarized Channel Islands. Telegraphic communications have been severed, and no other news has been received. (Reuters, 2nd)

Berlin - The German official news agency stated that German forces have occupied all of Jersey and part of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. The German air force launched a surprise attack, resulting in the occupation of a portion of Guernsey. Jersey was also occupied with "equal unexpectedness." During the German air force's attack on Guernsey, two British fighter planes were shot down. (Reuters, 2nd)

London - After the Führer Hitler's expeditionary forces occupied the Channel Islands yesterday, they completed the initial phase of their blitzkrieg against Britain. This marks the first time British territory has fallen into German hands since the start of the European war. The German occupation of the islands closely followed the British withdrawal last week. Before landing, the Germans sent a large squadron of aircraft to bomb the islands, resulting in numerous civilian deaths. Local announcements stated that before the islands fell, British forces had taken away all livestock, and many residents retreated with the army, taking food and valuables. The German occupation of the islands protects the German-occupied coast and allows the German air force to base itself 100 miles from Plymouth. The German occupation of the Channel Islands coincides with their recent intense air raids on Britain. (Associated Press, 2nd)

London - British commentators predict that Führer Hitler may send troops to Spain to attack Gibraltar and destroy Britain's Mediterranean lifeline. They noted that while Spanish leader General Franco has maintained neutrality since the war began, the fall of France and the subsequent German occupation of French territory up to the Spanish border have changed the situation. The "Daily Mail's" diplomatic correspondent stated yesterday that Germany is threatening Spain, saying that if Spain does not grant Germany passage to transport soldiers and supplies, Germany will invade both countries. The correspondent added that Germany's planned attacks on Gibraltar through Spain and control of Tangier, Ceuta, and the southern shore of the Strait from Spanish Morocco via air are apparent. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters - This afternoon, the German war report stated that German forces occupied the British island of Jersey the day before yesterday and Guernsey yesterday. A German reconnaissance plane shot down two British fighter planes. Yesterday afternoon, while German aircraft were conducting reconnaissance flights over the Channel, a ship not far from the British coast was attacked and set on fire east of Torquay. German aircraft bombed Wick harbor in northern Scotland. British aircraft attacked northwestern Germany last night. Some bombs fell into the Kiel Canal, but damage was minimal, and several civilians were killed. Five enemy planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two more were shot down by anti-aircraft guns on warships while bombing the Kiel Canal. Three German planes are missing. It has been confirmed today that the number of enemy planes shot down in air combat in the past two days is actually 23. (Haitong, 2nd)

### German Aircraft Groups Raid the British Coastline, Two Shot Down by British Air Force

London - Local people here today believe that Führer Hitler's long-delayed blitzkrieg strategy against Britain is about to be realized, as large groups of German planes swarmed over again last night and this morning. At least eleven people have died and many have been injured in air raids on Wales and the southwestern and eastern regions of England, and more than a dozen buildings caught fire in heavy bombing this morning. Over thirty people were killed and injured in air raids during the day yesterday. At the same time, with the German occupation of the Channel Islands, over 60,000 British residents are trapped under German control, and the gateways to Britain's east and south are also threatened. The Channel Islands are the first piece of British territory to fall into German hands since the outbreak of the European war. German forces bombed the islands severely the previous week. After the German air raids, the Ministry of Home Security immediately issued a statement saying that the damage was minimal. One bomb landed in the Bristol area of the Channel, injuring four people. The British Air Ministry announced that a large group of German aircraft attacked the southwest coast last night, and bombs landed in Bristol. British anti-aircraft guns immediately fired on the aircraft group. (Associated Press, 2nd)

London - Officials announced that two of the German bombers that attacked the northeast coast of Britain on Sunday night were shot down by British Air Force fighters. German planes crossed the coast at several points, dropping incendiary bombs along the northeast coast, which was bombarded by anti-aircraft guns. That night, an enemy plane dropped a high-explosive bomb on a town on the northeast coast of Scotland, destroying a row of houses, killing nine people and injuring twenty. (Reuters, 2nd)

Stockholm - According to reports from London, after midnight last night, more German aircraft flew over the southwest coast of England and dropped bombs on Bristol. British anti-aircraft guns fired, but it was not specified whether any German aircraft were shot down. (Haitong, 2nd)

### Graziani Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Italian Forces in North Africa, British and Italian Forces Continue Contact in the Desert Area, Naval Battle Occurs in the Sea of Crete

Rome - Former Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, General Graziani, has now been ordered to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, Navy, and Air Force in North Africa. It is said that during the Abyssinian campaign, Graziani captured the Korahei fort, overcame several economic, climatic, and geographical difficulties, and defeated the troops of Dambatos in the Duniya Canal, achieving the first major victory in the war of conquest of Abyssinia, and was therefore promoted to General. He then succeeded Badoglio as the Governor-General of Abyssinia. Graziani has had the deepest relationship with Africa throughout his life, having served as a Captain in Libya during the World War. (Haitong, 2nd)

Cairo - Army Headquarters issued a statement saying that contact engagements between advanced units are currently continuing in the Sidi Aziz and Gapuzzo areas of the Western Desert. There are no new events to report on the Eritrean and Italian East African borders. (Reuters, 2nd)

Enemy aircraft attempted to bomb Massawa but were shot down by two Italian fighter planes and one by anti-aircraft guns. The enemy aircraft fled in panic. One enemy aircraft was shot down while attacking Augusta. Three civilians in the city were injured, and material losses were minimal. (Haitong, 2nd)

### Italy's Air Force Weaknesses, New York Newspaper Publishes Article

New York - The New York Daily Mirror carried an article today discussing the weaknesses of the Italian Air Force, stating that the Italian Air Force had tested its strength in Spain and Albania with good results. However, judging from the performance of Italian pilots, their aiming ability is particularly poor, and their flying is also particularly scattered. There are even greater weaknesses, namely that most of the Italian Air Force's aircraft are outdated. Due to limited resources and industry, Italy has not been able to keep pace with the rapid progress of military aviation in the past few years, resulting in the Italian Air Force's 3,200 aircraft feeling too old. Two years ago, the Italian Air Force was at the forefront, but today it is not worthy of being called that. However, the biggest weakness of the Italian Air Force is the design and manufacture of engines. None of the engines currently used in Italy have more than 1,200 horsepower. The largest engine in the testing factory is only 1,500 horsepower. To increase the speed of aircraft, greater horsepower is needed. Unless Mussolini's engineers can build larger engines, Italy's air power cannot pose a first-class threat to British fighter and pursuit planes. Another weakness is the lack of adequate training facilities for new pilots. Italy lacks both gasoline and coal (for refining gasoline). Mr. Mo is actively engaged in experimental work to eliminate this weakness, but this work is still in its initial stages and has limited effect. Therefore, in the first twenty days of the war, Italian aircraft only operated in the Mediterranean and bombed Toulon and Marseille, and made scattered attacks in Africa, which made Mussolini not dare to make a major move in the Suez Canal. (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Bomber Squadrons Continue to Attack German Territory

London - An Air Ministry statement said that although visibility was poor, bombing raids continued against military targets in Germany. The Hamburg oil storage tanks were hit and caught fire, and fires and explosions occurred in several areas of the Darsdan district. Railway parking lots in Osnabrück and Hamm were also bombed, causing large fires. Other railway junctions and airfields were also hit. All our planes returned safely. (Reuters, 2nd)

State City - Twelve bombs fell in the Swiss Jura region near the French border yesterday, but there were no casualties and minimal material damage. (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Mobilization Plan Implemented, Great Combat Power, Nearly Three Million Men and Women Registered for Service, Regular Army Not Yet Included

London - According to well-informed sources, regarding the use of manpower and material resources to conduct war, some say that Germany mobilized completely at the beginning of the war, while Britain did not. This statement is incorrect. In fact, the structure of British society has already been transformed due to various combat plans. However, this plan is being implemented gradually to avoid social chaos. Although Germany has been actively preparing for war for six years, it has only been able to mobilize 100 divisions, which are not yet fully equipped. Since the outbreak of the war, the rate of manpower mobilization in Britain has been higher than in Germany. If manpower mobilization is solely for the purpose of gathering troops, it is easy to be misunderstood. The British armed forces include one million volunteers, many of whom are over the prime military age. Therefore, although those over 28 years old have not been incorporated, the average age of the army is 26. The total number of registered military personnel is 2.75 million, not including regular soldiers, national guards, and volunteers. Mobilization is not limited to the military. The industrial sector needs at least 14 people to support one person on the battlefield, and one aircraft in the sky needs about 40 people to maintain it. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of people of military age are indispensable for wartime industry. The Ministry of Labor is currently using its great power to recruit workers in factories and strictly controls the private employment of workers. There are currently 50,000 women serving in women's volunteer organizations, 150,000 serving as civil nurses, and a large number employed in agriculture. In addition, there are 500,000 women serving in military auxiliary services, such as cooks, drivers, and clerks, in order to free up men to perform important tasks. Britain is now making progress every day towards the ultimate goal of the complete national mobilization in combat efforts. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Britain and Ireland Should Adopt a Joint Defense Policy, Belisha Delivers Speech

London - Former Secretary of War Belisha recently delivered a speech in Taiwan Port, advocating that Britain must adopt a common defense policy with the entire Ireland (referring to both Northern and Southern Ireland). He said that if this could be achieved, it would not only be a diplomatic victory but also have a significant impact on the United States. As for the French fleet, we must find a way to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, and we must also prevent French colonies, especially the French port of Djibouti in East Africa, which is the throat of Italian Abyssinia, from being occupied by the enemy. In addition, our country's mobilization work should be expanded to make every British citizen able to use guns. (Havas, 1st)

### No Other Country is Allowed to Invade French Mandated Territories in the Near East, The British Government, to Safeguard its Own Interests, Declares it Reserves the Right to Take Free Action

London - London issued a responsible statement yesterday, saying that the British government is now aware that General Mittelhozer, commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Near East, has announced that the war in Syria has ceased. The British government believes that this announcement does not mean that if Germany and Italy want to occupy Syria or Lebanon, the French forces do not intend to resist. To dispel possible doubts, the British government hereby declares that Britain will never allow enemy forces to occupy Syria or Lebanon and use it as a base for attacking the Near Eastern countries that Britain wants to protect. Therefore, it reserves the freedom to take any action it deems necessary in this environment to protect its own interests. Any action that Britain is compelled to take in the future to fulfill this declaration will not affect the future status of the territory currently under French mandate. (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Colonial Squadrons Prepare for War, 200 Aircraft of Various Types

London - The Colonial Squadrons, consisting of 40 heavy bombers capable of dropping 100 tons of high explosives daily and 160 Spitfire fighter planes, are now ready for war. These squadrons were purchased with over £1.6 million donated by colonial residents to Britain in a matter of weeks. All matters related to these squadrons will be handled as much as possible by colonial personnel. Therefore, the commander and personnel of this team will all be colonials, and each aircraft will carry the name of the colony that donated it. (Reuters, 2nd)

He drove to Paris overnight, arriving almost at the same time as the German forces. However, before the German forces entered Paris, he had destroyed several secret plans and blown up a national defense factory, then abandoned his private car on the roadside and escaped from Paris, arriving in Marseille.

### Suspension of Maritime Defense and Land Transportation, Clearance of Inland Goods in Progress, Estimated Value of Goods in Warehouses is Tens of Millions, Part of Which is Planned to be Shipped Back to Shanghai

Since the European war and the German-French armistice, the Japanese army has taken the opportunity to act, first negotiating with Vietnam, resulting in the dispatch of supervisors to Haiphong, Hanoi, and other places to monitor inland goods. Then, they threatened Hong Kong, causing Chinese and foreign residents to leave Hong Kong one after another. Therefore, in recent days, the defense situation in Hong Kong has been extremely tense. The situation in both places is of great concern to all sectors. Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Haiphong via Hong Kong. According to those who came from Haiphong on the ship, the ship left Haiphong on the 26th of last month and went to Hong Kong. Since the Japanese army made the negotiations, rumors have been rampant in Haiphong, and people are panicked. Transportation has been suspended, and trains only go as far as Hanoi and no longer move forward. Since the Chinese War of Resistance, the market in Haiphong has gradually prospered and has now become the commercial center of the southwest. Now, it has suddenly changed to depression. The estimated value of the goods piled up and not yet transported inland is around tens of millions of yuan. Clearance is currently underway, and a list is being drawn up. Part of it is planned to be shipped back to Shanghai, but it has already been followed, so it is feared that only a small number will be shipped back in the future. As for the defense of the area, the French Navy only has two small warships stationed in the port, and there is also a Japanese warship anchored on the sea. According to people from Hong Kong,

Passengers are Crowded on Flights to Shanghai

The Hong Kong authorities are heavily guarded, and the defenses are solid. Chinese and foreign residents are preparing to leave Hong Kong. American citizens have also been ordered to retreat to Little Luzon. Most British and French citizens are going to Singapore, and a few Chinese are also planning to go to the Philippines, but most are retreating to the mainland and Shanghai. The Tai Sang Wheel carried more than 300 passengers from Hong Kong, and Taikoo's Sichuan Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Hong Kong, carrying a large number of passengers. As for the Shanghai-Hong Kong defense flight routes, there is no concern for the time being. Taikoo's Sichuan Wheel and Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang Wheel will still go to Hong Kong and Haiphong from Shanghai tomorrow (4th) according to the scheduled route. Yesterday, Changxing Company's Asia Queen went to Hong Kong's Little Luzon. There were also 170 or 180 passengers from Shanghai to Hong Kong, so the number of people going to Hong Kong has not decreased.

The Old Street Iron Bridge Has Been Destroyed

In Lao Jie, across from Haiphong, there is a large iron bridge connecting to Kunming in the mainland, which has been destroyed by the French side in Haiphong. Therefore, the goods passing through Haiphong to Yunnan are currently suspended. According to news from the shipping industry, the passengers and goods transported by the Tai Sang Wheel last time were not allowed to land because they had not opened a list and reported to the Vietnamese authorities. Part of the goods has been returned to Hong Kong, and another part is being returned to Shanghai by the ship. As for whether the inland transportation of goods from Haiphong to Kunming will be interrupted, according to reporters, if it does not belong to prohibited items, it can still be transported inland. However, the French and Japanese sides have not yet decided on the names of the inland transport goods.

The Burma Road Has Not Been Blocked

Regarding the issue of whether the Burma Road will be blocked, the Dazhong News Agency reporter specifically visited a senior official of the British Embassy yesterday to inquire about the British attitude, who said that the Burma Road is not currently blocked. The Japanese demands are currently being considered by London, and a decision will be announced after the results are clear. It seems too early to make a definitive statement at this time. Britain's policy towards China remains its past friendliness and sympathy, and we have no reason to expect any change in this policy.

The Current Situation in Shanghai is Not Affected

As for the situation in the Shanghai concessions, it is not as serious as the tense situation in Hong Kong. The British official in Shanghai has not made any preparations to evacuate the British citizens in Shanghai, and there have been no reports from the officials of various countries stationed in Shanghai that they will evacuate the expatriates. This is enough to prove that the rumors in Shanghai Concessions are not as serious as rumors suggest. The Chinese authorities in this city believe that the two concessions must provide strong protection for legitimate Chinese, because the vast majority of the taxes in the two concessions are paid by Chinese. Since the residents have fulfilled their tax obligations, the authorities should bear the responsibility of protecting them in order to abide by the neutral status of the two concessions.

The Japanese Side Expressed Future Actions

Zilin Bao said that at a press conference held by the Japanese side yesterday (1st), when asked about the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated that the Japanese action to blockade the supply route to Chongqing has not reached the stage of using force. Japan intends to use diplomatic methods to blockade the supply route. Bombing Mudian or Hong Kong is not within the actions that Japan intends to take. If the diplomatic talks have no results, he could not predict what specific actions Japan will take. Regarding the Japanese army's gathering near Kowloon, he knew nothing, but as far as he knew, there was no need for Japanese citizens in Hong Kong to evacuate at this time.

### North Henan Road: Japanese Troops Establish Posts and Deploy Defenses; Iron Wire Barricade on North Jiangxi Road Removed; Rumored Signs of Baoshan Road Intersection Opening; Japanese Claim Special Rights to Expand Defense Lines

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the area controlled by the Japanese in the northern district of the Public Concession initially lacked clear boundaries, leading to constant rumors and anxieties among residents. It wasn't until around July of last year that the Japanese set up a continuous iron wire and wooden frame barricade on North Jiangxi Road, starting from the waterworks bridge in the south and extending to the shooting range intersection at the road's end in the north. Those wishing to enter or exit Hongkou East were only allowed to pass through the gaps at Haining Road and Wenshui Road. After the Japanese firmly erected an English and Japanese sign at the eastern end of North Henan Road reading "Anglo-Japanese Guarded Area Boundary," people from all walks of life, especially merchants and residents in the northern district, finally understood that the Japanese intended to firmly control the area east of North Jiangxi Road. Although the boundary was set at North Henan Road, Japanese troops never crossed the iron wire and wooden frame barricade on North Jiangxi Road. Therefore, outside speculation arose, suspecting that the Japanese might be using the section west of North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road as a

Buffer Zone

without stationing troops. Whether this observation is accurate is not something outsiders can definitively say. However, since the placement of obstacles on North Jiangxi Road, most of the shops on the east side of the road and residents in the lanes relocated, creating a desolate atmosphere. Since last winter, due to the overcrowding and high rents in other areas, some lower- and middle-class individuals, unable to bear the burden, moved into the wired area, requiring only a certificate of epidemic prevention for inspection when entering and exiting. Consequently, the area has recently begun to flourish again. But last week, the Japanese military suddenly sent engineering soldiers to dismantle the iron wire and wooden frame barricade that had been in place for a year along the entire length of North Jiangxi Road. After three or four days, it was

Completely Dismantled

The shops and residents in the lanes on the east side of the road, seeing the complete removal of these military facilities, were overjoyed at the prospect of liberation from their constraints. They believed that wide, open roads would soon appear, not only allowing for freedom of movement but also stimulating commerce. However, the facts showed the opposite of what was expected. Yesterday morning, the Japanese sent several groups of engineering soldiers again, carrying chisels and axes along with carts loaded with long wood and iron wire, to redeploy defenses and extend the defense line westward to the "Anglo-Japanese Guarded Area Boundary" previously erected at North Henan Road. However, the type of iron wire and wooden frame now being erected is quite different from before. The ones on North Jiangxi Road were continuous, but now they are only being placed strategically, and the number of posts has greatly increased. In total, the entire North Henan Road, from the northern end of Tianhougong Bridge to the intersection of Bazilu, has

Established Posts

at the following six locations: (1) the northern end of Tianhougong Bridge, (2) the east side of the intersection of Qipu Road and North Henan Road, (3) the east side of the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Henan Road, (4) the east side of the intersection of Wenshui Road and North Henan Road, (5) the Bai Dun intersection at the eastern end of the intersection of Haining Road and North Henan Road, and (6) the east side of the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu. Each location has two wooden guard posts facing north and south, each manned by an armed soldier. Passersby still need to remove their hats to show respect. Outside the guard posts, by 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, three of the alleys on the east side of North Henan Road had been blocked: (1) the small alley opposite Jingxingli leading to Taoyuanfang, (2) the small alley next to Huiquanchi Bathhouse at the southern end of the Xiaocai market, and (3) the main alley of Heleli. These were completely blocked with iron wire and wooden frames, cutting off all traffic for pedestrians and vehicles. As for the other iron wire and wooden frame projects, they require site selection and take more time, so they had not been completed by nightfall. When they were carrying out the deployment work at the various locations, those within the planned defense line were all panicking. The Public Utilities

Telephone Company

at the corner of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, will now be entirely encircled within the new Japanese defense line. All the trolleybuses running on North Henan Road have not been affected and are running smoothly. However, the British and American defense forces stationed on the west side of the road have become increasingly opposed to the Japanese posts in several places. The post at the northern end of Tianhougong Bridge on North Henan Road is still guarded by Chinese and Western constables from the concession. Two Japanese soldiers stand at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and North Henan Road, in front of the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company. Two or three Indian constables from the concession police station are also guarding nearby. However, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, in addition to the two Japanese soldiers on guard, there were also six or seven Japanese soldiers wandering around the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company, and the situation seemed slightly more tense than before. The Japanese Marine Corps' sentry posts were moved to the Burton Road area yesterday. Many of the businesses east of North Henan Road that have

Machinery and Equipment, have temporarily moved west or south of Suzhou Creek, as they are wary of the potential difficulty of moving later. In general, however, since the Japanese soldiers at the sentry posts allow people to come and go at will and do not conduct inspections, the situation is still considered stable. According to a Japanese spokesperson, the Japanese military's relocation of the posts is their prerogative, but they simply had not exercised it in the past. As for why this move was suddenly made and the construction along North Jiangxi Road was removed, the reasons are not known to the outside world. One theory is that the Japanese action may be a sign that the Baoshan Road intersection will be opened.

### Land Bureau Files to Be Transferred by Resolution of the Consular Body; To Be Handled by the Japanese Consul-General; Formal Negotiations Not Yet Finalized

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that it learned from responsible sources today (the 2nd) that the 312 boxes of files from the Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau that were left in the custody of the concession authorities at the beginning of the Shanghai war in 1937 will be transferred to "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an within a few days. This will end the dispute involving the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Japanese authorities in the city, the "Municipal Government," and the Shanghai Consular Body, which has lasted for seven months. It is reported that the Consular Body, at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, discussed the matter for three weeks and finally agreed to hand over the files. Mr. Tsurumi, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, told reporters this morning that these documents will first be transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Yoshiteru Miura, within a few days. It is reported that this procedure is being taken to facilitate the delivery of the documents to the "Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau." The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a

brief statement this afternoon: "The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently negotiating the transfer of land files through the Japanese Consul-General, but formal negotiations have not yet been finalized." Official sources said this morning that these files relate to the entire Shanghai area, as they contain the registration of properties owned by Chinese and foreign landlords in the city. Since 1937, there have been many real estate transactions in Shanghai, but apart from a few registered with the consular authorities, most have not been registered. Therefore, the transfer of these files is expected to have repercussions in the city.

### French Concession Strengthens Defenses

In order to maintain security within the French Concession, in addition to the ordinary work of assigning police officers to strictly inspect pedestrians on major roads, the police force has recently tightened the curfew. Each night, extra Western detectives are dispatched, wearing helmets and patrolling the streets. At the same time, most of the Western detectives who used to carry pistols are now carrying box cannons.

### Individuals on "Arrest Warrant" Protected by Police Authorities; All Are Law-Abiding Citizens

According to reports from well-informed foreign sources last night, Chinese residents and officials here were surprised to learn yesterday that Wang Jingwei had issued an "arrest warrant" for the detention of 83 Chinese leaders in Shanghai, including journalists, bankers, lawyers, officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and customs officials. Those in charge pointed out that in view of the frequent occurrence of terrorist incidents, the issuance of "arrest warrants" from Jiangning will result in even greater unrest in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The "arrest warrant" was published in the "Zhonghua Daily." Foreign administrative authorities told foreign reporters yesterday that they had not received any notification regarding the "arrest warrant" issued by Jiangning. All they had heard about the "arrest warrant" was from Wang Jingwei's Shanghai media. A senior police official said that he could guarantee that Wang Jingwei would not receive the cooperation of the police authorities here in carrying out his intended arrests. The official added that he would like to point out that all those listed on the "list" are outstanding individuals who are working hard in their respective fields, and at the very least, they are all law-abiding citizens. Well-informed sources said that if any of the 83 people listed on the "arrest warrant" feel that they are in danger at any time, the authorities will provide them with special police protection.

### Dates for Drawings and Payments for Unified, Revival, Jin-Chang Bonds

A reporter from the New Voice Society inquired yesterday with a management committee for national bonds regarding the following: (1) Principal and interest payments for the Unified Public Bonds (ninth installment) will begin on July 31st, totaling 14,980,000 yuan for the redemption of principal in categories A, B, C, D, and E, and 41,510,700 yuan for interest payments, for a total of 56,490,700 yuan in principal and interest. (2) The drawing for the Revival Public Bonds will be held on July 10th, and payments will begin on August 31st, totaling 1,700,000 yuan for the redemption of principal and 9,792,000 yuan for interest payments, for a total of 11,492,000 yuan in principal and interest. (3) The drawing for the Jin-Chang Public Bonds will be held on September 10th, and payments will begin on September 30th, totaling 1,125,000 yuan for the redemption of principal and 379,687.50 yuan for interest payments, for a total of 1,504,687.50 yuan in principal and interest.

### Germany Strictly Neutral in Sino-Japanese War

Regarding yesterday's report by the Associated Press from London, stating that Germany was planning to conclude an alliance with Japan to guarantee Japan's free actions in the Far East, a reporter from the Great China News Agency visited Mr. Corder, the information specialist at the German Embassy, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth. It was stated, "This is indeed a rumor," and it was added that "the German government's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War is the same as the Chinese government's attitude towards the European War. In short, it is to strictly maintain neutrality."

### Amid Rising Rice Prices, Fixed-Price Rice Sales to Begin; Evaluation Committee to Be Established on the 5th

In order to actively carry out fixed-price rice sales, the Shanghai Fixed-Price Rice Committee held its eleventh standing committee meeting at 59 Guangdong Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yu Qiaqing was publicly elected as chairman and reported the purpose of the meeting. It was then resolved that: (1) The fourth phase of fixed-price rice sales will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month, and 60 members of the rice merchants' association in the two concessions will be entrusted to handle it (30 to sell tickets and 30 to distribute rice). (2) 15,000 bags of rice currently in stock for fixed-price sales will be used to start the program. Once the fixed rice arrives, it will be connected. If the rice in stock is sold out and the fixed rice has not arrived, it is planned to temporarily suspend the sales for a few days. (3) Rice will be sold at four catties per yuan, equivalent to two sheng and five ge. Each household will distribute 50 bags of rice per day, with each person limited to buying one yuan, until it is sold out. (4) Due to the hot weather, it is planned to change the time for buying rice to the morning. The time when the sales will begin each morning will be decided by the rice merchants' association at a meeting.

Evaluation Committee to Be Established on the 5th

The Bean and Rice Trade Association, upon receiving instructions from the authorities to find ways to suppress rice prices in Shanghai, convened a joint meeting with the Miscellaneous Grains and Oilcake Trade Association to discuss specific measures. In order to actively proceed, the two associations held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday to discuss how to organize the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. It was resolved to organize the committee with members from the following groups and the number of members to be nominated: Bean and Rice Trade Association: Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Hongbin; Miscellaneous Grains Association: Cao Xingeng, Zhu Youzhang, Pan Zhenyu, Shen Shoutang, He Quansheng, Fang Yusheng; Zhichengtang: Chen Shide; Jiyuantang: He Xianggu; Chao Sugar Association: Guo Yirong; Rice Market Management Committee: Fu Qiangeng, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhang Lizhong; Rice Merchants' Association: Zhang Niandong, Qu Zhenhua; South Gang Association: Yan Jiyun; Chang Gang Association: Shi Zufu; Rice Milling Association: Zhu Zhaoqi; Retailers Association: Zhang Songtao; Shanghai North Rice Merchants United Association: Jiang Shizhi, etc., totaling 21 members.

### Shao Xubai Assassinated; Funeral to Be Held Tomorrow; Destitute Circumstances of Elderly Mother, Wife, and Children; Devoted His Life to Labor Movement and Disaster Relief

The Great Light Society reports that Mr. Shao Xubai, the president of this society, was unfortunately ambushed by thugs who fired four shots at him near his residence in Mingdeli, Fuxu Road, at 7:00 PM on the 1st. Upon hearing the news, Shao's family immediately called for an ambulance from the police station to rush him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The doctors did their best to perform surgery to remove the bullets, and the recovery seemed to be going well. However, internal injuries suddenly developed, and he immediately lost consciousness. He succumbed to his injuries at midnight and died. The body was immediately moved to the autopsy room on Talas Road. At 10:00 AM yesterday, a judge from the Second Special District Court arrived. After the police officers in charge reported the circumstances of the assassination, they examined the body and confirmed that the death was caused by gunshot wounds. It is reported that the police authorities attach great importance to the case and have strictly ordered their subordinates to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Mr. Shao's body has been moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home, and the funeral is scheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow.

Last Words

After Mr. Shao underwent surgery at the hospital, although he was very conscious, he knew that his injuries were serious and feared that he would not survive. Therefore, with a great spirit of love for the country and the nation, he urged the doctor to write down his last glorious words before his sickbed. In a tragic and solemn state, he murmured intermittently, "A true man should be unafraid of death. I only wish for the victory of the resistance war. My personal sacrifice is also worthwhile." He then entered a state of delirium. Not long after, he smiled and closed his eyes and passed away. Yesterday, Shao's friends who came to pay their respects read his last words and were all moved to tears.

Funeral Tomorrow

The news of Mr. Shao's assassination spread, and people from the news media throughout the city, as well as Shao's relatives and friends, rushed to Shao's residence to inquire about the circumstances of the assassination and then went to the Shanghai Funeral Home, where Shao's body was placed, to mourn his passing. Shao's family has scheduled the funeral for 10:00 AM tomorrow (Thursday) at the funeral home. Those who care about Shao and his friends during his lifetime will all attend the funeral. It is expected that the occasion will be marked by mourning and great honor, with people wearing mourning clothes.

Surviving Widows and Orphans

A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the funeral home at 3:00 PM yesterday. The mourning hall was very quiet. The body looked lifelike after the makeup was applied. Shao's wife, Ms. Zheng Peibi, and her children were weeping behind the curtains, and the scene was heartbreaking. Shao also had an elderly mother, who was already 60 years old, Shao's wife, Ms. Zheng Peibi, who was 28 years old, his eldest daughter, Manli, who was 10 years old, his second daughter, Manfen, who was 6 years old, his third daughter, Manfang, who was 4 years old, and his son, Fengshan, who was just one year old. Shao's wife is also four months pregnant. In addition, there is also a younger sister named Jingxian, 22 years old. The family's circumstances are very difficult.

Shao's Brief Biography

Shao Xubai, courtesy name Quanpin, was from Yin County. He was born in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu. He graduated from Jinling Junior High School at the age of sixteen. He then dropped out of school due to family poverty and engaged in business. He especially promoted the revolution and the labor movement. After September 18th, he founded the Shanghai General Labor Union. Shao was appointed as an executive committee member and secretary-general. When the January 28th Shanghai War broke out, Shao participated in the work of the Ten-Man National Salvation Group. When the League of Nations Investigative Commission, led by Lord Lytton, came to Shanghai, Shao compiled a report on the Shanghai War, collected facts, and provided detailed opinions for the commission's reference. Later, in the name of the General Labor Union, he contacted the city's chamber of commerce and other organizations to hold a charity performance for the relief of Northeast refugees in the winter of the 21st year, raising more than 100,000 yuan, all of which was submitted to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to be remitted to the volunteer army. When the Rehe War broke out in the 22nd year, all sectors of Shanghai launched a delegation to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers. Shao, representing the General Labor Union, went to Gubeikou and other places to express condolences. At the third general election of the General Labor Union, Shao was elected as a standing committee member and continued to serve as secretary-general. The municipal government also hired him as a labor representative on the Labor-Management Dispute Arbitration Committee. He also served as the deputy director of the Dagong News Agency, the executive committee member and director of the publicity department of the Journalists Association, and a director of the Navigation Safety Association. When the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, Shao immediately engaged in the work of resisting the war and saving the nation. He organized a worker battlefield service team, leading Shanghai workers to the front line to provide services. At the same time, he intensified the work of rescuing refugees, serving as a member of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. After the fall of Greater Shanghai, he engaged in business development, serving successively as the assistant manager of the Ningshao Insurance Company and the deputy manager of the Shengli Soda Factory, as well as the president of the Dagang News Agency and other positions.

### Datong Yin Bank Manager Kidnapped; Du Xuezhuan's Whereabouts Unknown

Du Xuezhuan, the manager of the Datong Yin Bank at 200 Beijing Road in the Public Concession, a native of Chongming, 45 years old, residing at No. 1, Lane 672, Hurd Road, left home at 9:00 AM yesterday as usual to go to the bank to work. Unexpectedly, while passing near Connaught Road at 9:30 AM, four kidnappers suddenly appeared, armed with weapons, and forbade him to make any noise. They forced him into a car that was parked there and sped away, and his whereabouts are unknown. At the time, a passerby witnessed the incident and reported it to the police, who then learned of Du's kidnapping. The case is currently under investigation.

### Second Branch of Higher Court's Criminal Division Moves Back to Original Location

The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court temporarily moved to No. 55, Lane 1, Weihaiwei Road, after the outbreak of hostilities, and has remained there until now. The two courtrooms of the branch have been occupied by Scottish troops. As of the 1st of this month, the criminal division of the court has moved back to its original location on North Zhejiang Road, while civil cases and the administrative offices remain on Weihaiwei Road.

### Zhu Jicheng Shot; Suffers Five Gunshot Wounds, Critically Injured

Zhu Jicheng, 35 years old, nicknamed "Dead Mouse," who lives at a certain number in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, western Shanghai, was eating at home at around 5:00 PM yesterday when four or five uninvited guests suddenly arrived. They asked him if he was "Dead Mouse." Before the words were out of their mouths, one of them pulled out a pistol and opened fire on him. Zhu fell to the ground in response, suffering five gunshot wounds: one to the left face, one to the left chest, one to the right chest, one to the right abdomen, and one to the right leg. He was bleeding profusely and was barely breathing. The assailants left in a hurry. He was later taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment by car. His injuries are critical. It is rumored that Zhu works for the puppet organization.

### China Bank's Head of Administrative Affairs, Yu Xinan, Kidnapped

Not the Deputy Manager of the Bank

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that Yu Peter (transliteration), the deputy manager of the Central Bank, was kidnapped. A reporter from the New Voice Society inquired with banking circles yesterday and learned that the person kidnapped was actually Yu Xinan, the deputy director of the administrative affairs department of the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, and not the deputy manager of the bank. He specializes in the bank's general affairs. The rumor that Yu was in charge of the keys to the bank's important vaults is also inaccurate. There have been no reports of another person, Cao, disappearing at the same time.

### Kidnapper Dies Bumping Head; Victim Still Missing

Yang Liantai, 15 years old, son of the late overseas Chinese from Fujian, residing at 804 Bubbling Well Road, studies at the Bubbling Well Primary School on Columbia Road. On June 8, when he was dismissed from school at noon, a maid received him and took him home by rickshaw for lunch. When the rickshaw was passing the intersection of Columbia Road and Bubbling Well Road, he was suddenly kidnapped. The kidnappers sent a letter demanding 50,000 yuan, which was later reduced to 10,000 yuan. After the incident, the police sent detectives to wait at Yang's home in the hope of obtaining clues about the kidnappers. A relative of Yang's, Shi Guozhen from Jiangbei, often went to Yang's home to inquire. The detectives, suspecting him, arrested him. When he yielded under interrogation, they successively arrested five other accomplices: Dong Xiaowuzi, Zheng Rusong, Lin Shuangquan, and the female gangster Chen Wangshi. However, the victim is still missing and cannot be rescued for the time being. The police transferred Shi and the others to the court for interrogation and detention. However, the kidnapper Dong Xiaowuzi, during police interrogation, was overwhelmed with guilt and fear and injured himself by hitting his head against the wall. He died after unsuccessful medical treatment. The case was continued yesterday by Judge Liao. The police lawyer requested a postponement for further investigation to find out the whereabouts of the victim. The court ordered a postponement to July 11 for further interrogation, and the defendants were returned to custody. The police are now making every effort to arrest the fugitive accomplices and track down the whereabouts of the victim.

### Gangsters Rob Weapons on Haig Road; Shoot and Injure Vietnamese Constable; One Rifle and Two Pistols Stolen

At 2:50 AM yesterday, Chinese Constable No. 966 and Vietnamese Constable No. 352 of the French police were on duty at 753 Haig Road, Houjiatai, Xujiahui, when suddenly five or six gangsters wearing short coats, holding two box cannons and one hand grenade, surrounded the two constables and said, "Be good, lend us your guns." The Chinese constable was the first to be attacked, and his service pistol was stolen. Seeing this, the Vietnamese constable knew that he had encountered gangsters and tried to draw his pistol to defend himself, but one of the gangsters immediately fired a shot at the constable, hitting him in the head. The constable was injured and fell to the ground. The gangsters then snatched the constable's rifle and pistol from his shoulder and back and fled without a trace. After the police received the news, they immediately dispatched detectives to the scene of the incident and sent the injured constable to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also ordered a strict search for the gangsters and brought them to justice. It is reported that the injured Vietnamese constable's injuries are very serious.

### Extorting Woolen Merchants; Attempted Kidnapping Failed; 19 Gangsters Arrested; Guns and Ammunition Seized, Interrogated, and Detained

Zhou Yongfa, a dealer in foreign woolen goods, lives at 212 Haig Road, western Shanghai. His brother works at the Meifa Foreign Firm at 159 Beijing Road. On the 29th of last month, Zhou Yongfa suddenly received an anonymous letter, the words of which generally instructed Zhou to pay special attention in the next two months,

lest an accident occur. But until the day before yesterday, a sudden, uninvited guest broke into Zhou's house and said that he belonged to the same gang. He has had problems with a man named Xiaolin, and so he would give Zhou a tip that the gang was planning to kidnap Zhou’s thirteen-year-old son Zhou Lexuan. At the time Zhou’s family gave him a two-yuan reward, but unexpectedly the day before yesterday at noon, the uninvited guest returned to the Meifa Foreign Firm on Beijing Road,

using the same ploy again. The matter was reported to the Jing'an Temple police station, which dispatched detective Xie Futang, detectives Liang Junshan, Shen Zhufang, Wu Wenxiang, etc., to arrest the uninvited guest. Upon interrogation, they learned that his name was Jin Bing, also known as Zhang Xiaoyi. Then, based on the clues, they continued to arrest Jin Gao, a woman from Pudong, Wang Fusheng from Haimen, Shen Chaofeng, Lan Shunlong, Cai Shaoting, and Ren Shi from 16, Lane 307, Jiangxi Road.

A pistol and three bullets were seized from Yu Gao's person. Later, they also joined forces with detectives from the French police station and went to Room 12 of the Chunjiang Hotel at 315 Avenue Edward VII to arrest Chen Mingxiang, Ni Maomao, Sun Wenming, He Hugen, Qian Qingyi, Zhang Jinsheng, Shi Yingou, Fang Longsheng, Zhang Yulong, Zhang Jingnan (i.e., the monk), Chen Changgen, Fang Linsheng, etc. In total,

nineteen people were arrested and taken to the police station for detention. They were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, stating that the case needed to be investigated and requesting permission for detention. After Judge Fu Lin interrogated them, he ordered that they be detained for further investigation and verification.

### Young Woman Raped; Commits Suicide Out of Shame; Zeng Weisheng Arrested for Defiling Female

Li Peifang, a 17-year-old woman from Guangdong residing at 430 Sanheli, Jiangxi Road, works at the Jishi Industrial Society on Avenue Edward VII. On the 29th, she suddenly took poison and committed suicide. After her family sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment, the General Police Station was informed and immediately ordered Chinese detective Zhang Guanying to rush to investigate. According to her brother, Li Yuejun, the reason for his sister's suicide was related to Zeng Weisheng from Jiangxi, who lived in the same house and ran a packing factory. It was rumored that his sister had been defiled by Zeng, and she committed suicide out of shame. The detective then brought Zeng to Renji Hospital to confront Li. According to the woman's identification, she was indeed raped twice by Zeng. The police then detained Zeng and sent him to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the situation and requested that Zeng be temporarily detained because Li could not leave the hospital to appear in court today. Zeng completely denied the accusations during the interrogation. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered that Zeng Weisheng be detained for further interrogation at a later date.

### Feng Bingnan's Memorial Speech for His Mother's Birthday (6) Actively Promote Simple Moral Standards; Three Major Events Held to Commemorate Mother's Birthday

There should be no unemployed people. The existence of such shortcomings in society is a disgrace to society, a sign of imperfect social organization, and a social pathology. The issues of clothing, food, and housing may be too serious to be easily resolved. The Social Welfare Enterprise Society plans to establish a dedicated department to study this issue. The findings will be contributed to areas where effective solutions can be found to improve health and provide assistance for the self-reliance of the unemployed. It is not impossible to urgently seek relief measures. Among the three matters mentioned above, the first two, compiling a complete book on the introduction to the Five Teachings and translating the works of Smiles, can be undertaken by me alone. As for the Social Welfare Enterprise Society, it would require the wealth of figures like Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate of the United States, and John D. Rockefeller, the oil magnate, to handle it independently. Currently, our country does not have individuals with such abundant wealth, so there is no one who can independently organize this matter. However, if we can pool our wisdom and efforts, gathering the strength of hundreds of thousands or millions of people, it is not impossible to create a Carnegie or a Rockefeller. The organization of these undertakings must adhere to the principle of meeting needs, ensuring that those who should not receive do not receive more than they deserve, and those who deserve it do not receive nothing. Therefore, detailed plans must be made, and rash actions are not allowed. Even the health mutual insurance association is extremely complex and difficult. After eighteen months of research, the plan has not yet reached perfection. This shows how difficult other aspects are. I am of humble ability and have limited strength, how dare I take on such a significant task? However, the reasons for initiating this matter without considering my virtue or measuring my strength are: firstly, I want to do something more meaningful to commemorate my mother's birthday, instead of meaningless toasts and exchanges of courtesies. Secondly, I deeply feel in my heart that this is an urgent need of society, an urgent need of humanity, and something we are morally obligated to do, without waiting for others. Thirdly, although I am aware of my weak health, frequent illnesses, and limited abilities, I still hope that the initiation today can gradually be realized in the future. The implementation of a social undertaking must first make society aware of the undertaking, then become interested in it, feel the need for it, and then support it. I sincerely hope to promote society's awareness, interest, and need for such undertakings, thereby gaining social support and assistance. If such undertakings are organized in every human collective, from a village, a town, a city, a province, a country, to the entire world, then human society can easily progress towards goodness and perfection. Cruel and tragic events can gradually decrease, eventually ceasing to exist. The scale of this undertaking is vast, and I dare not expect it to be completed quickly. I only seek to work towards the goal, like the Foolish Old Man moving mountains, gaining an inch for every inch, a foot for every foot. I will feel at peace and satisfied if the great achievement is completed in two or three years, or twenty or thirty years, or two or three hundred years. (The End)

### The Fourth Day of the Five Teachings Lectures: The True Meaning of Islam

Lecturer: Imam Hader Cheng. Today, Jiang Zhuzhuang will lecture on Buddhism.

The Five Teachings Lectures are a celebration of Mr. Feng Bingnan's mother's birthday. They have been held continuously at the YMCA in Bassen Road since the 29th of last month. Yesterday was the fourth day, and the lecture was on the essence and morality of Islam, given by Imam Hader Cheng. Lectures on Islam are rarely seen in Shanghai, as the religion has historically had limited external promotion. However, many non-Muslims desire to understand the true meaning of Islam. Therefore, after 3 p.m., the audience arrived in a steady stream. By the time the lecture started at 5:30 p.m., there was no space left inside. The people from the Feng residence were extremely busy with reception duties but still felt unable to cope. Dozens of seats were temporarily added, but it was still insufficient, and those who arrived later were willing to stand and listen attentively. Fortunately, the Five Teachings Lectures are broadcast daily by the Aviation Radio Station, and those with radios can listen without hindrance at home. People of all ages gathered in the hall, all silently holding their breath and listening attentively to the lecture. Mr. Hader is deeply learned and virtuous, a benevolent figure, and his voice was also exceptionally clear. The gist of his speech was that although the beliefs of various religions differ, their aim to promote good and discourage evil is the same. Islam emphasizes filial piety, not unlike Confucianism, and considers it the greatest of all virtues. Muhammad once said, "Paradise lies at the feet of mothers," which is the extreme expression of respect for filial piety. He then described the origins of Islam, stating that every religion is closely related to the customs and sentiments of its place of origin. Islam originated in Arabia, where the people are simple and forthright. Therefore, the religion is deeply influenced by this. He then described the journey of the Prophet Muhammad, who was an uneducated orphan who received revelations from God. At the age of forty, he received the Quran, sent down by God, and passed away at the age of sixty-three. The Quran is the only scripture of Islam, and its contents can be divided into four points: (1) creeds and rituals, (2) warnings, (3) using stories to convey truth, and (4) admonitions based on current affairs at the time. The Quran covers everything from the creation of the universe to daily life. The word "Islam" is the Chinese name for the religion, while Arabs call it "Islam." He further elaborated on the meaning of Islam and finally presented eight words: "Revere God, love people, transform oneself, attain truth," stating that the true meaning of Islam is fully contained within these words. Today's lecture is on Buddhism, given by Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang.

### Arrested for Carrying a Handgun

Mo A'du, a native of Nanxiang who previously served in the Nanxiang Self-Defense Force in Xujiazhai, Nanxiang, was found carrying a handgun with seven bullets at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road at 5:30 a.m. yesterday. He was apprehended by the Jing'an Temple Police Investigation Team and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. When questioned, Mo A'du confessed that he carried the handgun with the intention of selling it. Judge Fu verified the confession and ordered Mo to be detained for seven days pending further investigation.

### Strike by Vendors at Bassen Road Market

Over a hundred vendors in the Bassen Road Market in the French Concession have recently initiated a strike due to the French Municipal Council's plan to cancel all existing vendor stalls in order to expand the market stalls. This has caused panic among the vendors regarding their livelihoods. According to the vendors, expanding the stalls does not necessarily require moving the existing ones. They have been operating stalls, paying taxes, and conducting business in the market for years. These tax-paying and legitimate vendors deserve the full protection of the concession authorities.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong, this area, and the East Sea would be cloudy and hot, with localized fog and southeastern to southwestern winds. Localized thunderstorms are expected in the evening. Furthermore, the local temperature in the 24 hours leading up to 3 p.m. yesterday was a high of 92.7 and a low of 77.5. Last year's corresponding day had a high of 78.3 and a low of 73.4.

### Letter

To the editor,
I am writing to you regarding a recent news item in the Education News section of your newspaper on July 1, regarding Jinghua Primary and Middle School. The item mentions that Yang Gan, the director of the primary school division, initiated the establishment of a summer economic tutoring class. However, Yang Gan is not the director of our school's primary school division, which is inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected.

Sincerely,
Jinghua Primary and Middle School, Shanghai

### Helison Cup Charity Basketball: Paramount defeats Union, Union weakens after a strong start and succumbs; Moore clinches victory over Nanyang in the final minute

In the third act of the Helison Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, the match between Moor and Nanyang in Group A2 was a closely contested affair. With one minute remaining, the score was tied at 29-29. In the end, Moor's Liang Genbao made two free throws, leading to a 31-29 victory. In the final match, Paramount defeated Union. Union initially showed strength, but eventually Paramount took the lead. However, the game remained close until the final nine minutes, when the score gradually widened. In the end, Paramount won 68-54. The details are as follows:

Union took an early lead, with Fan Qingxian scoring the first basket. Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan each made free throws, tying the score at 2-2. However, Fan Qingxian was particularly active, quickly adding seven points. But Union's dazzling momentum was fleeting. After Paramount calmly responded, Zhang Shaoqing, Lu Zhongen, Chen Xianglong, and Bao Songyuan all scored in quick succession, bringing the score from 9-9 to 16-11. At the end of the first half, Paramount led 28-25.

After the break, Paramount continued to score, quickly making it 35-27. Union's Fan Qingxian was soon penalized for his fourth foul and was forced to leave the court, greatly weakening their strength. Chen Xianglong took the opportunity to score two points, bringing the score to 38-41. With nine minutes remaining, Li Zhenzhong and Zhang Shaoqing suddenly became active, scoring eleven consecutive points. Union relied on Lu Shunzhen's three shots to narrow the gap to 46-54, but their morale was already low and their attacks were ineffective. Paramount continued to score, winning 68-54.

### Food: The Municipal Council Relaxes Price Limits Again, Allowing Only Small Increases, Not Large Ones, Based on the Closing Price of June 29. As a Result, the Market Responds with Mid-Grade Goods, Still Exceeding the Limit by One or Two Yuan. The Repeated Relaxation of Price Limits: The Effect is Predictable.

The rice market was closed for two days and resumed business as usual yesterday. However, in light of the rapid rise in rice prices in the past week, the British and French Municipal Councils, deeply concerned about the future of the people's food supply, implemented measures to suppress and stabilize rice prices. They issued a notice to the Rice Market Management Committee, instructing all rice merchants that all buying and selling in the market must be transacted at the limited prices based on the closing prices of June 29 and must not be exceeded arbitrarily. Violations will be severely punished. After this head-on blow, the rice merchants were stunned and uneasy, feeling trapped in a dilemma with no way to proceed. The market did not open until 10 a.m., and trading was sparse. Apart from some actual sales to meet demand, most hoarding and speculative traders had disappeared. As a result, the market lacked vitality. The market was only open for one hour throughout the city. The results showed that all opening prices were similar to those of the previous week. Grade 1 aged Saigon was still 66 yuan to 66.5 yuan, Grade 2 was 65 yuan, Grade 1 Siam was 66 yuan, Grade 2 was 65 yuan to 64.5 yuan, Huowen was 66 yuan to 65.5 yuan, Xiaojiao was 64 yuan to 63.6 yuan, Tokyo sharp tip was 61 yuan, mixed broken rice was 53.5 yuan, and decided at 52 yuan, rice green bean was 55 yuan and 6 yuan.

Imported rice was traded only for half a day yesterday morning, with no market in the afternoon. However, the suppliers, citing the Hong Kong-Vietnam issue, were trying to raise prices, but they did not sell due to the restrictions. As a result, only mid-range and lower-grade goods were traded in the market. Grade 1 Saigon only opened at 66.25 yuan and 66 yuan for mid-range goods. High-grade goods required an additional one or two yuan, so the rice could be sold. However, Grade 2 was opened at 65.5 yuan, Xiaojiao at 64.4 yuan, and rice green bean at 56 yuan, broken rice at 54.5 yuan, which were all one or two yuan higher. Therefore, the prices limited on that day were actually broken immediately. Twenty-six bundles of reclaimed Grade 2 Siam rice, from the original stock of 25 tons of Shen Ji Foreign Firm, were 67.5 yuan, and another 18 bundles of large rice were 72-73 yuan, totaling 50 tons. It is reported that about 6,000 bundles of imported rice were sold yesterday, mainly for actual sales.

It is also reported that a large amount of imported rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Yihua Foreign Firm's Taisheng vessel arrived from Haiphong with 650 bundles, and 17,051 bundles arrived from Hong Kong, totaling 17,701 bundles, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. (Reporter Zu)

The arrival of japonica and glutinous rice from domestic sources was limited, with a total of 1,400 to 1,500 bundles arriving over three days. Therefore, it is rumored that the off-market trading remains tight. Changbang special Qing japonica was 74-5 yuan, Sukun Changzhou white japonica was as high as 73.5 yuan, decided to go to the heat was 70 yuan, Qingsi special thin rice was 74-5 yuan, and the general market was 72-3 yuan, Nangang early rice was 71 yuan, decided at around 70 yuan. Jinli special yuan glutinous rice was 62 yuan 7-8 corners, Changdan white yuan was 61-2 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were around 60 yuan.

### Oil Cakes　Oil Prices Rise

Soybean cakes also up by 10 to 20 cents

Raw soybean oil: The oil cake and miscellaneous grains market will only be open for morning trading starting yesterday, causing some unease among people. The overall market remained stable. The oil cake market continued the positive trend from last Saturday, with prices rising. Oil prices increased by one to two yuan. Transactions included 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, prices detailed in the market price section; 10 barrels of Qingdao raw oil; 1,000 cans of Yantai canned raw oil; 200 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil; 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil; 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil; 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil; and 100 loads of Dayouyu factory soybean oil.

Additionally, 650 pieces of soybean oil arrived from Qingdao yesterday, along with 450 packages of soybeans and 400 cans of raw oil. 1,285 cans of raw oil also arrived from Yantai.

### Sugar Market　Xinghua White Sees New Prices

Foreign sugar also shows tightness

Yesterday, domestic sugar was very tight. Xinghua merchants offered 114 bags of special-grade Xinghua Qi White at a price of 95 yuan, a new record. 40 bags of Xinghua White sold for 91 yuan, and 80 bags of Gao Xinghua Qing sold for 66 yuan. Guangdong merchants offered 120 bags of Hainan Red at 51.5 yuan. Foreign sugar was tight due to the tense situation in Hong Kong, with war risk insurance rising from 0.5% to 2%. This created a universally bullish sentiment. Spot 24 coarse white was traded by the guild, with goods from this firm at 70.08 yuan. Goods from other firms rose from 70 yuan to 70.05 and 70.08 yuan in the morning, and 70.5 yuan in the afternoon. Transit goods were at 56 yuan to 56.5 yuan in the morning and 56 yuan in the afternoon. July 10 delivery was at 56.8 yuan. Taikoo car white was even tighter due to the Hong Kong situation, with B-mark East Warehouse at 80 to 81 yuan and West Warehouse at 81.5 yuan, up 2 yuan. DY-mark East Warehouse was at 79 yuan, HX-mark was at 78 to 78.5 yuan, Dutch red was at 57.7 yuan, up 0.9 yuan, wood factory snow white was at 70.5 yuan, No. 1 ice was at 92.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was at 94 yuan, up 1.5 yuan.

Also, 4,100 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and 515 bags arrived from Xiamen.

### Dried and Sundry Goods　Orchid Bamboo Twigs Rise

Recently, orchid bamboo twigs have been scarce, resulting in a severe shortage in the market. Scarcity has made them expensive, with prices rising again and again, up 40 to 50 yuan from the lowest price. Checks show that existing stock is nearly exhausted, and the market will only stabilize when new goods arrive.

### Finance　Big Bulls Cover Shorts and Rise

According to a London cable from one day prior, the spot price for large silver bars was up 0.0625, and the forward price was up 0.3125. Short positions were covered, and speculation was limited to those buying forward and selling short. Trading was light, and the market was flat. The market stabilized after closing. A New York cable reported that the US silver price was unchanged. A Bombay cable reported that the spot price for Indian silver was up six annas, and the futures price was up five annas. The market was flat, with a total of 150 contracts traded.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Legal Tender Exchange Rates

The Hong Kong Shen Exchange rate (i.e., the Shanghai legal tender equivalent of 100 Hong Kong dollars) is telegraphed to Shanghai daily. This newspaper publishes it daily. However, in the Hong Kong market, both Hong Kong dollars and legal tender are used. When Hong Kong banks remit legal tender to Shanghai, the exchange rate is between 30 and 40 yuan per thousand. That is, 1030 to 1040 Hong Kong dollars are exchanged for 1000 yuan of Shanghai legal tender.

### Hardware　Iron Nails Plunge

Recently, the local factory-made iron nail market has seen no business from Southeast Asian merchants. In addition, buyers from North China and the Yangtze River region have also been very sluggish. Although construction businesses and occasional small buyers still make transactions, the volume is very small. Therefore, the market currently has an oversupply, and hoarding firms are constantly releasing stock. The market is well-supplied, and sentiment is very weak. Currently, each barrel of Bessemer nails is quoted at 49 yuan, a sharp drop of about 10 yuan compared to before.

### Miscellaneous　Firewood Sales Slow

Only five boats of firewood arrived from the river towns, so sellers remained firm in their prices. Early morning quotes were very high, but local stores had limited capacity, and few customers inquired, leading to a price decline. Large white firewood was priced at 1.27 yuan per two bundles, medium Taiwan firewood at five bundles, Chuanshan Huangyun firewood at five and a half bundles, and Long Firewood at six bundles. Delivery by rickshaw from the pier is subject to additional handling fees.

### Father and Son Reunited

The other day, in the Baoshan Street Western-style teahouse, a Tianjin groom named Yu Fengting was sitting and drinking tea when he saw a boy, no more than twelve or thirteen years old, dressed in tattered blue clothes, who appeared to be a wanderer. They looked at each other closely. Yu asked where he lived and what his name was. The boy replied that his surname was Yu and he lived in the Fifty-Second Hutong of Hongbei, Tianjin. He had been abducted by bandits at the age of five. Yu had lost a son years ago. Now that they knew they were father and son reunited, their fellow villagers all congratulated them.

### Water Standing

At noon on the sixth day of this month, it was heard that the water in the West Lake east of the Yuehu Bridge in Ningbo suddenly rose more than ten feet high. It hung in the air, standing like a wall, for a while, reaching the entrance of the Central Government Office. It lasted for about two to three quarters of an hour before subsiding. The residents there all saw it and found it very strange! It is not known what good or bad omen this indicates. We wish to ask those knowledgeable in such matters.

### City Howl

On the seventeenth of last month, there was heavy wind and rain in Suzhou. Near Xumen (胥門), a sound suddenly arose from the top of the city wall, resembling thunder but not thunder, resembling cannons but not cannons. Those who heard it said it was the city howling. It was also heard that about twenty people entered Xumen together. Upon reaching the city gate, they were as if bound, standing still for half an hour, unable to advance or retreat. After a while, they awoke. This is also not known why.

### How to Respond to People's Inquiries

— Zhuang Sen

Recently, I bought a book by Carnegie on interpersonal skills. After reading a few pages about business correspondence, I was reminded of something that happened to me, which prompted me to write this article. My purpose in reporting this event is not to do free advertising for anyone, but simply to tell a truth worth promoting and to provide a small supplement to the book.

Last year, before Christmas, a friend urged me to translate the autobiography of the great French writer Gide. Because Gide's writing is not easy to read, I wanted to refer to an English translation in addition to the original French. So, I hurriedly wrote three postcards with the same content, inquiring at three well-known foreign bookstores in the area about whether they had the book in stock and its price. All three bookstores replied, saying they did not have the book. The first reply I received was from ×× Book Company. It was written in pencil, with messy handwriting, and simply answered my two questions honestly, without saying anything else. Perhaps because the handwriting was too messy and the wording was not tactful, I felt a bit disgusted as soon as I saw it. Therefore, after the replies from ×× and □□□ arrived one after another, I immediately tore up that letter. Because the other two replies were more considerate, ××'s reply was detailed enough, and □□□'s was even more satisfactory and comfortable to read. It told me the full title of the book, the translator's name, the publisher, and two prices (the other two letters only stated one price). The reply could not have been more detailed. The ending included the necessary inquiry: "If you would like us to order it for you, please let us know so that we can process it as soon as possible." In addition to the company seal, the name also included the respondent's personal seal, which clearly showed seriousness. In addition, the letter included a flyer for children's books that could be given as Christmas gifts, which was a very timely use. I still keep this reply, as it left a good impression on me. I sometimes think that in the future, if I need to inquire about or buy Western books, I will definitely consult them first.

Several years ago, when I lived in a small town in Suzhou County, the National Bibliography of Life Bookstore had just been published. I purchased the book by mail for a price of 75 cents. I found that this catalog was very convenient for researching and checking the books I wanted to read. Moreover, it was such a thick book, and the price was so cheap. One day, I can't remember which English translations of French writers' books I wanted to know the titles and translators of, etc. From the National Bibliography, I thought that there must be similar inexpensive national publishing catalogs in Britain and America. It would be convenient to have one on hand and check it when needed, and I wouldn't have to write letters to inquire from afar. So I wrote to ask □□□. The reply stated that the price of the book was several hundred yuan, which shocked me. In addition, the letter indirectly advised me not to buy it, saying that such catalogs were most suitable for libraries to collect. Of course, even if they didn't say it, I wouldn't recklessly spend a large sum of money to buy such a catalog that I would only occasionally flip through just to save the trouble of writing letters. But I was grateful for their attitude of not only pursuing profit, not just wanting to attract business, but also thinking for the buyer. This matter still exists in my memory, simply because of their loyal service attitude.

Based on the above small personal matter, I believe that when answering people's inquiries, especially in business, it is best to adopt the latter method, being detailed, serious (if it is a verbal reply, be kind and pleasant), so that people will be happy and satisfied, create a good impression, and thus the business will prosper.

### The Recession in the Library

— Nai Liu

The best place to provide mental food is of course the library, especially for me. I don't have any pocket money at home, and I don't have any income myself, so don't even talk about buying famous works, even buying a newspaper every day is a problem! As a result, going to the library has become something I must do every day.

After lunch, I take my notebook and pencil and set off for the New Asia Library. Because of the long distance, I often arrive around 2 PM. When I look at the door of the reading room, unfortunately, I always see the sign "Full," so I have to wait outside. When I see someone come out, I happily go in.

When I enter the reading room, the first thing I do is read the newspaper. But because there are so many people, it's not easy to get a newspaper, so I look around on the long bench, preparing to take it as soon as someone is done reading. However, during this time, I noticed that a very small number of readers were sleeping on the newspapers. Although there was no snoring, it was still sweet enough. A few people next to me who were waiting to read the newspaper were staring blankly at the reader who was napping. Most of them were afraid of waking up the good dream, so they didn't dare to take the newspaper being used as a pad. At that time, I volunteered to go over and tugged at the newspaper being used as a pad a few times. The person woke up, and I said:

"Thank you, can I take a look at this newspaper?"

The answer was: "No, I haven't finished reading it yet." So he pretended to read the newspaper, but after a while, he fell asleep again. At that time, I didn't have the courage to disturb the sleeping reader anymore. But seeing that there were still several people outside the reading room who couldn't get in because it was full, and those inside the reading room were waiting because they had no newspaper to read, I felt that the readers who came to the reading room to take naps were too selfish. I almost wanted to shout out: "Sir, please go home to sleep!"

In the reading room, I usually read the newspaper for about an hour and a half, and the rest of the time is spent reading practical texts, literary creations, or magazines.

The magazine racks are often empty, of course, the biggest reason is that there are too many readers, and a few magazines are not enough to distribute. But there are several readers who seem to have taken the reading room of the New Asia Library as their own. One person takes three or four magazines, goes to a place by the window to find a seat, and then slowly prepares to read the magazines one by one, regardless of the other readers waiting in front of the empty bookshelves. As a result, the few magazines in the reading room are monopolized by a few people, and the word "circulation" has become an empty name.

The above are the most obvious signs of the recession in the library. I hope the reading room administrators pay attention to this. And the readers of the reading room understand the following two points:

This is a public reading room!

In addition to yourself, there are other readers too!

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Final Destination of the Stage

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

As soon as these words came out, Ni Jinshou's face also changed. He was clearly holding high hopes, hoping that the secret of this case would be revealed immediately. I must also honestly admit that I had the same inclination as him. However, Hawthorne still showed no expression on his face.

He just followed her tone and asked, "Quarreled? When?"

Jinmei said, "We quarreled several times. The last time was on the day when Manager Li came here."

"Ah, then it's been eight or nine days since then. Has he ever been back?"

Jinmei's lips moved, as if she wanted to say something, but finally she held back and just lowered her eyes and shook her head.

Hawthorne said, "He hasn't been back? Good, do you at least know what they were arguing about?"

"I don't know - maybe -"

"Maybe what?"

"About that Zhao Boxiong."

"Zhao Boxiong?" As Hawthorne spoke, he hurriedly reached into his pocket again. He took out the second two-inch small photo. "Is it this person?"

The woman raised her eyes slightly and nodded again.

As Hawthorne put the photo back into his chest pocket, he said, "I guess this Zhao Boxiong is also a friend of your master, and probably comes in and out here often. Since Manager Lu doesn't live here every day, your master has every opportunity to let this Zhao Boxiong stay here overnight. Is that right?"

Jinmei shook her head and said, "No, he has never lived here, but he comes in and out here a lot. This has only been happening for the past half month. He also came last night."

Ni Jinshou's head suddenly lifted, clearly unable to bear it anymore. He put down his pen and asked, "This Zhao Boxiong also came last night? What time?"

"Around seven thirty." (33)

### YMCA/YWCA　Subsidy for Impoverished Students　Registration Procedures Start on the First

— Simon

The Shanghai YMCA/YWCA, seeing the extreme seriousness of the problem of students dropping out of school, jointly organized a student relief association after "August 13th." Each semester, a portion of the funds is allocated to subsidize impoverished students, and registration is held as usual at the beginning of the semester. This decision is no exception. From July 1st to the 8th, it is the registration period.

The registration place is still at the YWCA at 999 Jingansi Road, the intersection of Moore Road. Anyone from an impoverished family who wants to receive this subsidy must go to the YWCA within the prescribed eight days to apply for registration according to the registration regulations. First, get an application form, then fill out the application form, and submit it to the registration office along with the report card or other supporting documents and two photos.

After receiving the applications, the committee will review the results and hold written and oral examinations for those who are considered qualified. The written test focuses on testing general knowledge and current affairs. If you do not participate in this test, you will not be able to receive the subsidy. According to the regulations of the association, only students above the high school level are eligible to apply for registration. After review and examination, high school students can receive a subsidy of 30 yuan per semester, and college students can receive 50 yuan.

In the past three years, the number of impoverished high school and college students who have received subsidies from the relief association has indeed been quite large. Many people apply during each registration period. However, students subsidized by the association must be from impoverished families or whose economic situation has been damaged by the war. If no one subsidizes them, they cannot enter school, and they must have always been academically excellent and enthusiastic about extracurricular activities to be eligible to apply.

On the application form, in addition to proof from the original school, the applicant must prepare a budget for the next semester's expenses, and the family's economic situation, the amount of the subsidy requested, whether they are married, and whether they have children must be stated.

### A Clownish Talk

— Xisen

The three great masters of the clown role, Xiao Changhua, Ci Ruiquan, and Guo Chunshan, stand as a tripod. Changhua is melancholy, Chunshan wields the mallet, and Ci Ruiquan, who is active on the stage, has a particularly youthful spirit despite his age. This time, Old Ci is coming south with the Tan Opera Troupe. Can he bring a fresh perspective to the moribund clown opera scene?

Famous clowns are like famous painters. Their works must be unrestrained, detached from the mundane, cool, and natural. Changhua, in today's clown scene, is the lingering light of the ancestral temple. Insiders compare him to almond tofu among foods, because his sweetness is clear and cool, simple and elegant, so a little is better than a lot. Chunshan has been too old in recent years. One must carefully study his performances to find the subtleties. He is always willing to answer questions from younger generations and tells them everything he knows, so he is respected. His position is almost comparable to that of Qian Jinfu in the past Jing role and Wang Yaoqing, the living "Master of the Universe." As for Old Ci's strength, he often has new sounds. He assists the Tan family for three generations and has excellent feelings. Therefore, the clown roles in Tan operas played by Old Ci can always create a mood appropriate to the scene and make people smile. This new performance should not be difficult to hear such pearl-like witty remarks.

Among the rising stars of the clown role, the talent is few and far between! Ma Fulu wins with his cheerful spirit, but unfortunately, he fails to avoid vulgarity. Jia Duocai wins with his strangeness, but he also suffers from too much clowning. As for Ru Fuwei, Zhu Binxian, Sun Shengwu, Ci Shaoquan, Ai Shiju, Zhan Shifu, and others, their skills are not deep enough, and their skills are still difficult to reach a pure green state.

Among the clowns in the wild, Chi Zijun is undoubtedly the best. He likes to drink. Usually, he is as polite as a Confucian scholar, but after drinking, he does not abandon the true nature of the clown role. He is full of humor and talks about the allusions, anecdotes, and funny stories of the pear garden. Listeners laugh, and he has a lot of secret clown opera scripts. Wrapped in dark blue cloth, he often shows them to people and says, "This is not a priceless treasure, but whoever needs it, can take it." He once gave the play "Running Donkey" to Ye Shengzhang, but in fact, he is a shallow artist who is not easy to pass on and copy. In recent years, he occasionally shows his face, and it always shakes the nine cities. He is also a strange talent!

The clown role is like the corner of a horn, and it is not easy to cultivate it. Therefore, the Capital Opera School has the so-called "Eight Demons of the Clown Role": Zhang Jinliang, Zhao Depu, Yu Jinhua, Wang Yuhu, Yin Jinzhen, Guo Jinguang, Gao Dezhong, and He Jinkuan, all of whom are children who can actually be called upon to call the capital. Among them, Jinliang is the most outstanding, and Jinzhen and Jinguang are both proficient in martial arts. I don't know if they will be able to occupy a place in the clown role in the future?

### A New Contribution from the Film Industry

— Xinfang

The Youth Chamber of Commerce in Pasadena, California, USA, recently completed a vocational education film with private funds, titled "They Can Help." The original intention of the authorities in shooting the film was to help the graduates of various technical or vocational schools and universities in the area enter society this season. Therefore, the entire content of the film is devoted to writing about the preparation and training for various professions. The collected materials include aircraft construction, photography, stenography, automobile engineering, etc., which can be described as all-encompassing. It is heard that the director of the film is a woman named Dorothy Flagg.

The film is now being shown in rotation at local commercial organizations, chambers of commerce, and service associations, and students are admitted free of charge.

Such films should also be extremely needed in China. Therefore, the author specifically borrows a corner of this publication, hoping that domestic film merchants can also pay attention to it.

New York Theater

New York's largest movie theater, called Music Hall, can accommodate 16,000 spectators. Its facilities are the most complete in New York. Before this theater existed, the Roxy and Paramont theaters were the largest. Every day, there was a constant stream of people, with ladies in beautiful attire and jewelry, and the scene was extremely prosperous for a time. Since the completion of the Music Hall, however, business has plummeted, and the prosperity of the past is no more.

Shou Yunhu's Opera Talks

### Joint Discussion of Tan Fuying and Ma Lianliang (Part 2)

— Su Shaoqing

Opera is mainly based on singing. As the saying goes, "Silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat," meaning that the human voice is the most valuable. Therefore, among the three types of Lao Sheng (male lead), An Gong (singing-focused role) is the most important. In the past, those with poor voices specialized in the decline school. Now, I will use records and wireless motors as evidence. The sound received by records and wireless motors must be singing-focused. No matter how wonderful the acting is, it cannot be recorded. If you rely on the opening and closing of the weapons, then the sound of gongs and drums will be so loud that we will all dislike it. Although this is a joke, it can certainly prove the saying that singing is the life of opera. In the past, the Kui school specialized in singing An Gong operas, and never learned decline school or weapon-focused operas, which is why. Taking An Gong as the first is a tradition passed down in the pear garden, not my fabrication. I pay attention to saying this because I want all insiders and amateurs to focus on practicing their singing as long as they have a good voice. After practicing the singing skills and words, it is not too late to learn the acting. Because singing and recitation (recitation is included in singing) are very important to the pitch and rhyme, and they are the most effective in conveying inner emotions. They are the crystallization of the art of hearing. Now, I will describe the changes in the two people's voices to end my article. During the Hongxian era, Lianliang choked rice many times, but he had already become a leading actor and was very popular. At that time, Fuying was also in the Fu Liancheng Society. He was still a boy's voice and sang middle-axis plays, such as "The Battle of Puguan," and his high pitch could be heard. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Lianliang was also very popular on the stage in Shanghai, and Fuying was in the period of nurturing his voice. Around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Lianliang's voice was greatly improved, and he sang in a regular style. Fuying's voice gradually improved. In recent years, Fuying's voice has greatly improved, and he sings in a regular style, while Lianliang's voice is slightly weaker. The two are evenly matched, like the struggle between Chu and Han, and the victory depends on whose voice is better. With a good voice, you will be energetic, and you can fight ten. Without it, you will be too busy to defend yourself and have no fighting spirit. The two are my old friends, and I hope they will both take good care of their voices. Gao Qingkui used to be a champion, but what is he like now?

### The Flavor of Kissing on the Silver Screen: Head Tilting and Neck Pain Are Inevitable

— Wan Yu

Let's shatter the illusions of millions of moviegoers who envy the kisses on the silver screen. This performance of passion is actually a very mechanical task! It's just like building a house according to an engineer's plan—the script is equivalent to the blueprint. Those lingering kisses are filmed over and over again, causing the leading lady's neck to ache from craning her head to kiss, and the leading man to struggle immensely.

According to Bette Davis, who is known for her candor, kissing on the screen simply lacks excitement and pleasure. Pain and difficulty are more common: both heads must stay within the focal point of the camera to avoid slipping out of the screen; two noses are also difficult to manage; lipstick gets smudged, makeup is rubbed off, and a lot of powder ends up on the male actor's clothes, causing him disgust; sometimes the director even asks the male actor to grab your head and neck, which will definitely mess up your hair.

Ann Sothern has a more pleasant interpretation of this issue; perhaps it's because she's full of youthful enthusiasm. She said, "I don't mind slight hardships, as long as the person I like kisses me, even if he kicks me lightly, I wouldn't care. John Garfield and I had a great romantic performance in 'They Made Me a Criminal.' We treat acting as a fun thing, and we casually don't pay too much attention to the camera angle. However, there's no real stimulation in kissing, and this kind of performance will definitely ruin your makeup. But, because kissing is a real-life performance, there's no way to replace it."

Hedy Lamarr, who has only made three films in America, has already been recognized by the general public as an outstanding mysterious woman. MGM almost believes that everyone in the world wants to kiss her! Someone asked Hedy about kissing, and she said shyly, "I don't think there's any reaction to kissing. If the script stipulates that I have to kiss, then I have an obligation to do so." Then, she gave a playful wink and said, "I haven't kissed Clark Gable yet."
