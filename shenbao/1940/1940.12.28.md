### Five Million Elite Chinese Troops Determined to Launch a Major Counteroffensive Next Year; Guerrilla Force of Over One Million Sees Great Improvement in Equipment; Communication Lines of Various Battlefields Constantly Cut Off by Chinese Forces

Chongqing – According to a spokesman for the Chinese military, the main task of the Chinese army next year will be to intensify all necessary preparations for the final counteroffensive against the Japanese army. This statement has attracted great attention from people here. Although the spokesman did not provide details, he stated, "1941 will be China's year of counteroffensive and victory." It is said that the Chinese army has increased to over three million regular troops, over one million mobile troops, and a large number of new troops are currently in training. Due to the development of inland automotive and arms industries, the current equipment of the Chinese army is incomparable to before. Although the Japanese forces near Guangzhou have increased slightly, it is doubtful whether they will launch any large-scale military operations in northern Guangdong. (Reuters, 27th)

Chongqing – At a press conference today, a Chinese military spokesman, in response to inquiries, stated that China's military strength has been greatly enhanced and that a major counteroffensive will be launched next year. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to call 1941 the "Year of Counteroffensive." Last year, China had two million troops; this year, it has reached five million, of which over one million are guerrillas. The clothing and equipment of the troops have seen great improvement, coupled with the experience of years of combat, and their quality has also made significant progress. As for the situation on the front lines, there have only been minor skirmishes in the past week, with no major developments. The Chinese army continues to disrupt Japanese transportation. Rumors that the Japanese army intends to launch a major offensive in Guangdong Province are extremely unreliable. According to intelligence received by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops concentrated in Zhongshan County are being transferred elsewhere, indicating that the Japanese have no intention of launching an offensive in that area.

American Attitude Increasingly Tough

Tokyo – This morning, the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun reported that the American attitude towards Japan is now increasingly tough and will limit Americans in the Far East to return home by the end of January next year. Sources with inside knowledge claim that this rumor is becoming increasingly reliable. Several American ships will arrive in Yokohama in January, including the President Taft on January 3rd, the President Coolidge on January 4th, the President Pierce on January 9th, and the President Cleveland on January 18th. In the past, only one or two American ships arrived in Yokohama per month. The United States will also take economic action against Japan, ordering American ships not to pass through Japanese ports in the future. When a government spokesman was asked about the US government's repeated orders for Americans in the Far East to return home, the official declined to comment because he had not received official information. (Reuters, 27th)

Japan Has Not Conquered China

Tokyo – Colonel Mabuchi of the Japanese Army Press Corps, in an article published in the Nichinichi Shimbun, warned the Japanese public not to be complacent and overly optimistic about the Sino-Japanese conflict. He stated that many Japanese seem to believe that the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact has shifted international trends in Japan's favor. However, he believes that the international situation is currently shifting in the opposite direction and is advantageous to the Chongqing government because the Tripartite Pact has led Britain and the United States to resolve to aid the Chongqing government. Therefore, unless there is a drastic change in the world situation in the future, there is no hope of the Chongqing government completely collapsing. The current China situation is extremely complex, and it cannot be thoroughly understood with just common sense. Japan is currently fighting the Chinese army led by General Chiang Kai-shek on Chinese territory. However, even if the Chinese army is defeated, it will not resolve the existing Sino-Japanese war. The majority of Chinese people gathered under General Chiang’s banner represent the essence of the Chinese people who love their country, and behind them stand countries such as Britain and the United States that are aiding the Chongqing government in resisting Japan and maintaining the old order in East Asia. The powerful efforts made by Japan against the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp should be fully recognized. Some Japanese people have the mentality that the Japanese army can defeat the enemy, and thus have the feeling that Japan has already conquered China, but this is not the case. Today, the Chinese people are divided into two major camps, one seeking peaceful means and the other seeking to fight to the end, both aiming for China's revival and independence. On this point, the Japanese should not wear glasses clouded by prejudice and arrogance when viewing China and its people. Japan advocates building a new order in East Asia and a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is a good intention, but unless Japan actually implements these plans, everything is just empty talk. If Japan does not have the strength, any treaties and agreements it concludes with other countries are just a piece of waste paper. This has been proven by Germany. Now is not the time for the Japanese to seek private gain, but to strive to promote a solution to the Sino-Japanese conflict, accelerate the reorganization of armaments, and expand production capacity to establish a nation with particularly strong defenses.

### Failure to Resolve Thai-French Border Disputes Will Lead to Serious Consequences; Thailand Demands Return of Lao Territories; Conspiracy with Japan Likely Involved

Hong Kong – According to sources from Bangkok, the border conflict between Thailand and Vietnam may have serious consequences and is not just a small country seeking to expand its territory or a guerrilla-style war. People here believe that Thailand's demand for the return of Lao territories is probably related to Japanese conspiracies. However, Thai nationalism under the leadership of Prime Minister Songgram is playing a key role in this war. Prime Minister Songgram is a military man who was educated at a German army school and is therefore heavily influenced by totalitarianism. He also thinks of emulating it in his hometown. Songgram was also a hero of the Second Revolution in 1933 and was the target of several assassins, but his iron-fisted policies dealt a severe blow to the conspirators. Songgram has curbed the economic expansion of overseas Chinese in Thailand and often delivers speeches promoting nationalism on the radio and in public places. Seeing Hitler's success in Europe, Songgram turned his attention to the Lao territories that France seized in 1893. At the same time, he also put forward a demand for Cambodia, but this demand is not an immediate matter. It is known that the present is a great time to launch it because France has become a weak country and is under Japanese pressure. Japan now regrets inciting the Thai people to rise up and fight Vietnam, as Japan wants to acquire Vietnam and is unwilling to hand over the Lao territories, which are rich in minerals. British pressure may be able to stop the border friction, which seems to be the only way at present, as Thailand usually exports 85% of its goods to various parts of the UK. Bangkok sources say Britain believes that if Thailand recovers the Lao territories, Thailand will have a buffer zone with Japan, so it has secretly allowed Thailand to make territorial claims to Vietnam. As for the United States, its views differ from those of Britain. The United States believes that although Thailand is only trying to recover lost territories, which is different from the actions of Japan and Germany, its opportunistic aggression violates the country's foreign policy. According to observers, Thailand is definitely not a part of the "New Order in East Asia". If Thailand can break away from Japanese conspiracies, it may become an important buffer state in future disputes and an ally of Britain and the United States. Thailand has a population of 14 million and has been implementing a conscription system for several years. Its air force is small but modern, and it possesses a squadron of destroyers and light warships. Thailand is important because of its strategic position. If Thailand is in Japanese hands, it will become the best base for attacking Singapore and Burma. (International News Agency, 27th)

Christmas Eve Border Warfare

Bangkok, yesterday's official gazette here stated that on the eve of Christmas, small-scale battles on the Thai-Vietnamese border lasted all day, with conflicts occurring in several places. French forces fired artillery and machine guns at the Thai side, and Thai forces returned fire, with shells hitting French artillery, silencing it. One Thai woman was killed and two men were injured. The French side also suffered casualties. (Reuters, 27th)

Hanoi – Disputes between Vietnam and Thailand along the border continued on the eve of Christmas, all initiated by the Thai side, with the Vietnamese army retaliating. Thai artillery fired twenty shells at the Thai Khe District of Laos, and the French army immediately returned fire. Thai military police also fired shots at the islands of Đồng Xá Nọ and Đồng Khiêm (both transliterated) on the Mekong River, and the French army retaliated by bombarding the Thai military police barracks in the town of Khemmarat and using machine guns to strafe various military facilities there. A Thai aircraft then intruded into Lao territory over the town of Khemmarat, but did not drop bombs. In addition, French forces engaged in skirmishes with a Thai patrol on the Cambodian border in the Ya Bei Dong area. Three Thai soldiers were killed and only one French soldier was injured. (Havas, 26th)

Hanoi – Officials have recently issued a communiqué stating that a unit of Thai troops intruded into the Vietnamese border near the Cambodian province of Pa Lin. Our ambush troops immediately rose up to meet them, killing fifteen Thai soldiers and wounding many others. The remaining troops of that country then collapsed and retreated. (Havas, 26th)

Japanese Army Expands Haiphong Airport

Hanoi, reliable sources reported yesterday that a senior Japanese official, whose position is more important than that of General Kokuta, the head of the Japanese military mission in Vietnam, will depart for Saigon tomorrow to discuss with Kokuta Japan's desires in southern Vietnam. The official told French leaders, "Now that the Japanese incident in Tokyo Province has gradually been resolved, we are shifting our interests to the south." Recently, the Japanese acquired land in the Haiphong airfield and are currently expanding it. They are using 5,000 tons of cement to modernize the Haiphong airfield, and it is believed they have reordered 30,000 tons. Large numbers of Japanese troops have been stationed in Hanoi, and civil and military officials now own private residences. It is believed that the Japanese will soon develop the Lao Cai phosphorus mine. A Japanese official who inspected the mine said that the Japanese could obtain 500 tons of phosphorus annually from the mine. It is heard that the development of the mine will begin soon.

Guangzhou – According to reports from the Japanese South China Fleet, Vice Admiral Shimada, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, announced on the 23rd of this month that the Japanese fleet would begin blockading the ports of the South China coast, starting from Christmas Day. Japanese warships and naval forces have begun operations against the supply lines and ports of the Chongqing government. Japanese naval aircraft scouted and bombed various ports on the South China coast, such as Shuidong, Dianbai, Yangshan, and Guanghai, causing heavy damage to warehouses full of war materials. (Reuters, 27th)

### Establishment of Customs Anti-Smuggling Office Postponed

Chongqing – According to officials in charge of the Anti-Smuggling Office, once the office is formally established, all armed anti-smuggling teams in the country, such as the opium suppression anti-smuggling team, tax police customs, customs police team, salt police team, and the freight inspection offices in various war zones, totaling more than 30,000 people, will be under the jurisdiction of the office. They will be assigned to various important transportation arteries and key points and commanded separately by the anti-smuggling sub-offices. It is heard that because the organization is large and the regulations are complex, preparations will take some time, so the original target of establishing the office in the new year must be postponed slightly.

Editorial

### Urging Speculators to Reflect

Yesterday's newspaper reported that on Christmas Eve, no less than one million yuan was spent on dance halls and drinking, while no less than one hundred and sixty corpses were collected by the Pushan Villa from the streets. Comparing the two, who would say that the deep contradictions of Shanghai society are inappropriate. However, this million spent only sought one night of pleasure, and they do not know that the cost of continuous drinking, eating, and giving gifts is more than several million yuan! The number of street corpses is only those collected, and they do not know how many tens of thousands of people died from hunger, cold, and malnutrition. Strolling the streets and begging along the way, there is no road or place that does not see the traces of such people. And those huddled in straw sheds and broken houses, wailing next to broken mats and cold stoves, they do not know how many people there are. Shanghai is a paradise, a hell: it is one of the most joyful and laughter-filled corners of the world, or a desolate and tragic dead end, cool observers know it, do those who live in a drunken dream think about it at all? Alas? This is indeed the strange shape of urban society, and also the evil result of social disease and the inability to transform human morality.

This year's prices are almost unprecedented in Chinese history, and this year's life is also a rare encounter for the Chinese people. On the one hand, we only see speculators active in all directions, all with full wallets and excessive spending, while on the other hand, everyone is exhausting all their resources and still fearing it is not enough. Speaking of the vagrants on the streets, they are very bitter, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, only waiting for the benefaction of passers-by. The lives of the poor in tile houses should be better than theirs, but they do not know that begging is obstructed by face, and who will be a patron if they ask for loans. In the cold winter, they are still thinly clad and have little firewood or grain. Because a yuan for a liter of rice, a yuan for a catty of oil, a family of five, with a daily income of two or three yuan, can only barely survive on porridge, and there is no time to take care of clothing. When disease comes, they rely on their original resistance to deal with the disease demon, and there is no source for medical expenses. Don't they usually make plans for supporting their parents and raising their children? But their savings have been oppressed, squeezed, and sucked dry by today's speculative merchants, powerful thugs, and giants. Isn't their income slightly increased compared to before the war? However, the increase is limited, and the rise in prices is unlimited. With limited wages meeting unlimited prices, it is rare not to be overturned. This high price is what has promoted the general poverty of society.

People in Shanghai, don't they think of the helplessness of the poor? Only those who are richer often do not know the hardship of poverty. This is also because their circumstances make them so. Living in tall buildings, how can they know that there are still attics in straw sheds for people to live in? In the midst of sumptuous feasts, how can they know that there are those who cannot get enough to eat all day, and cannot even ask for leftovers? In the warmth of the red stove, how can they know that there are those who shiver in the cold and snowy world, only with the heat of their blood and body temperature to fight against the cold waves? Although, it is said that the people of Shanghai are not all numb, they have never been unkind. Who is not as good as I want, with this in mind, those who do good deeds, although this year's poverty is more severe than in previous years, this year's relief also surpasses last year. Just in terms of porridge tickets, there are more than ten groups currently issuing them, and benevolent groups have ordered no less than 60,000 tickets. There are two or three other places selling cheap meals. As for those who give away cotton clothing, some benevolent groups distribute them centrally, others distribute them separately, or specialize in helping the hidden poor. The Cilian Society also follows last year's example, distributing steamed buns and ginger soup; and some people give away steamed bun coupons or even rice tickets, which proves the enthusiasm for burying the winter and providing relief. However, this is still only passive relief, which cannot eliminate the hidden dangers of social unrest or save mankind from distress, so in the active aspect, it still lies in the leveling of prices and the continued holding of Yao Zhen.

The greatest difficulty in leveling prices lies in the gradual obstruction of freight transport. Whenever one steps into an occupied area, chickens cannot be slaughtered, eggs cannot be cooked, cloth cannot be cut, and cannot be carried, even clothes that have been made, belongings, and items like cigarettes and matches are subject to detention and confiscation. Goods from Shanghai cannot enter the occupied areas, and goods from the occupied areas are not easy to enter Shanghai. Even between the occupied areas, the various difficulties are the same. Thus, freight transport loses its convenience of circulation, supply and demand lose their effect of adjustment, the prices in various places are all expensive, and the people's livelihood in various places is all difficult. The suffering they endure is greater than that of the residents of Shanghai. However, Shanghai's people's food has already been deeply affected. Wheat is controlled and cannot come, rice is plundered and cannot come. Fortunately, the transportation of foreign rice is free. The import of foreign noodles and foreign wheat is not worried about being interrupted. Cotton is monopolized, yarn is manipulated, cloth is controlled. Clothing is important, but there is no harm in wearing old clothes that have been sewn and patched. So its severity is not as great as that of the people's food. The rice merchants in Shanghai often use the price of grain in the mainland as an excuse, but they do not think that the high price of rice in the mainland is due to the sudden increase in population, and the mainland does not produce rice, and it has added many people who eat rice, how can it not seek more than supply. Third, the import of grain to the mainland, along the coast, has been blockaded by Japanese warships, and the mainland is close to the occupied rice-producing areas, and it needs to compete with the Japanese army, and Shanghai's source of foreign rice can almost be said to be available every day. Therefore, the high price of rice in the mainland is still excusable, but those who hoard grain are still sentenced to death. The high price of grain in Shanghai is entirely due to hoarders relying on their strong financial resources to gamble and make advances, to be an enemy of the people's food. If the price of rice remains high for a long time, to the point where the general public cannot buy food as usual, then diseases will break out, and the roads will be thorny, and Shanghai will no longer be a happy land. Therefore, what is most urgently needed today is to level the prices of general necessities of life, and the only key lies in how to work together to eliminate the obstacles in front of the rich. Speculative merchants should take a step back and think, if the whole society is poor, and you are rich alone, you will also feel that wealth is not a blessing. Why not take this opportunity to plan a self-preservation strategy, and do not make excessive demands, to preserve the livelihoods of the general public? Then, although the eastern corner is lost, it is not too late for the mulberry elm to receive.

### British Far East Commander Arrives in Hong Kong to Inspect Defense; Use of Singapore Naval Base Issue Soon to Have Agreed Plans Between Britain and America

Hong Kong – Sir Brooke Popham, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Far East, arrived here this morning from Singapore to consult with naval, land and air force leaders and inspect defenses. (Reuters, 27th)

Manila – The Manila Bulletin recently published a dispatch from New York Times correspondent Abende, stating that it is expected that a formal plan for the joint use of the Singapore naval base by Britain and America will soon be decided and will not be abandoned due to Japanese opposition. (Central News Agency, 27th)

Manila – Abende, manager of the New York Times Chinese office, told journalists here today about the situation in Singapore. He stated that he did not see warships around Singapore. In November, the British garrison troops increased their strength, with the largest number of Indian troops arriving, and Australian troops also arriving. The air force strength has been greatly enhanced. Britain has strict censorship of speech in Singapore, and all facts and figures related to military defense are kept secret. However, Japanese spies are still very active in secret. In the short term, Britain and America will establish a formal agreement, and Singapore will become a joint naval base for Britain and America. It is believed that Manila will also become a joint naval base for Britain and America to show the spirit of cooperation. The defense of Manila is not as tightly arranged as that of Singapore, and there are still several areas of defense on the east coast that are empty. However, preparations for destroying roads and railway traffic in case of emergency are well in hand. The US government is buying large quantities of tin and rubber, and the prices are low.

The matters that the group should pay attention to are (1) China's actual combat strength, (2) the Chinese people's adherence to the Three Principles of the People advocated by the Founding Father, (3) China's construction efforts, (4) the atrocities of the Japanese army in China, which can clarify the true purpose of the Japanese-advocated New Order in East Asia.

### American Public Opinion Unanimously Advocates for Armed Sanctions Against Japan. Yarnall Expresses the Need to Protect Legitimate Rights. Former Ambassador to Japan Still Holds Isolationist Views.

New York - News yesterday: The New York Post recently conducted a public opinion poll in the United States. The results showed that 80% of the American people advocate using force to stop Japan if it launches a southern advance. The newspaper held a poll asking the question, "Should we use force to stop Japan?" The results showed that 80% of the people favored using force to stop Japan, while only 20% opposed it. After the vote, the poll also published the contrasting opinions of Admiral Yarnall, who served as commander of the US Asiatic Fleet from 1936 to 1939, and Castle, who served as ambassador to Japan during the 1930 Naval Conference, for public review. Yarnall's opinion favored using force to stop Japan. Yarnall believed that all of the United States' interests in the East were threatened by Japan's use of force to invade East Asia and advance into the South Pacific, and that our country's people and commerce were also being excluded from this vast region. Castle stated that the only American interest in the Far East was commercial interest, and that the United States seemed to have completely forgotten that its most important commerce was trade with Japan. If the United States went to war with Japan, it would not only lose this trade with Japan but also reduce future trade opportunities in any part of the Orient. Japan is the most industrialized and advanced country in the Far East and, as such, is best qualified to hold a leading position in the Far East. Yarnall also declared that the appeasement policy had failed in both Europe and Asia. Both Germany and Japan have recognized the appeasement policy as a symbol of weakness, and implementing the appeasement policy has only strengthened aggressive actions. One must be prepared to protect one's legitimate rights by force if necessary. This method of protecting rights by force will be far more effective in stopping Japan's aggression than the appeasement policy. It should be understood that the appeasement policy is a sign of weakness and has long been ineffective. If we do not protect our legitimate interests in time, we will have no rights to protect. The war in China and the war in Europe are one and the same because they are both wars in which the three dictatorial countries, based on a kind of military pact, are resisting the world's democratic countries. If we want to preserve culture, we must overthrow this absolutism and force the governments of these dictatorial countries to be led by people who understand honor and justice, and be led again by people who recognize that war and conquest only bring harm to the people. There is no shortage of such wise men among these three dictatorial countries, but today they have either been exiled or silenced. If absolutism is not overthrown, there is no hope of restoring normal international relations and reducing the military burden of various countries. Castle stated that defending the Philippines was the only reason to resist Japan's southern advance. Castle said that the Philippines is now nearing independence, and we have promised it independence in a few years. If we do not go to war with Japan, the Philippines can remain completely secure. If we go to war with Japan, it will be difficult for us to defend the Philippines. Our attempts to interfere in foreign politics have put us in danger of war. Being in a miserable situation is a new experience in American history. If we get involved in the war, we will be attacked from all sides. Our ally England has forgotten that it has placed reporters in a dangerous situation. It should be understood that if the United States fights in the Far East, it will be difficult for the United States to help England again. As a result, some Englishmen have recognized this point and are deeply worried about a war between Japan and the United States. We should keep the fleet stationed in the Pacific and not act rashly until the navy has doubled in strength. If at this time the fleet goes to the Atlantic to assist the British Navy, the result will only be that the United States is in a crisis of disappointment. Those who advocate a strong stance against Japan all say that Japan does not want to attack the United States, so there is no danger of war. These words are an extremely insecure sluice gate. How can it prevent the invasion of floods? We must know what the purpose of a war between Japan and the United States is. Can anyone explain it? Is a war between Japan and the United States beneficial to the United States and any major power in the world? This question cannot be answered with certainty. (27th day United Press dispatch)

### Soviet Composer's "Song of Chinese Friends"

Chongqing - The China Chorus is recently working hard to popularize music. The Chongqing Municipal Government has stipulated that six theaters in the city will allocate one performance per month for the group to hold public performances free of charge. The first public performance is scheduled for January 2nd. In addition, the group received dozens of magazines from the American Writers Association and a song by composer Orshan Yin called "(Song of Chinese Friends)". The lyrics are translated as follows: (1) We bathe in the warm sun of spring and salute our friends, in distant China, in heroic China, the home of our friends. Bullets of the enemy are above their heads, and under their feet are the ruins after the bombing. They are far away on the other side of the mountains, but our hearts and songs are connected to them. (2) In distant China, in heroic China, there are strong national resistance fighters, facing the spring sunshine with full of hope. They hold guns against the enemy. Our songs fly over the forests and fields, harmonizing with the songs of Chinese friends. They are far away on the other side of the mountains, but their hearts and songs are connected to us.

### National Government Issues Order to Commend Qian Changgan

Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 27th stating that Qian Changgan, a technical expert in the Ministry of Communications, had a deep understanding of bridge engineering.

Budapest - German and Soviet troops are still moving this morning. Allied mechanized reinforcement units are deploying along the left bank of the Prut River. At the same time, tens of thousands of German troops are entering Romania from Hungary and reportedly deploying in all directions. This German troop movement indicates that Germany will take action in the Balkans via Greece, which may even affect the Soviet Union's strategic position, as well as the future of Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The standard German forces in Romania have been expanding rapidly. According to various estimates, they will expand to between 200,000 and 500,000. News from the Balkans indicates at least 300,000. Red Army troops with tanks, heavy artillery, and other war equipment are stationed along the Prut River on the Soviet-Romanian border. Heavily equipped German detachments are reportedly heading to various areas along the Romanian border adjacent to Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgaria and Romania have been greatly threatened. (20th day International News Service dispatch)

Budapest - Yesterday, it was reported that because Germany was deploying large numbers of troops into Romania, the Soviet Union was also strengthening the Red Army garrison in Bessarabia and the eastern border areas of Poland, and expanding the artillery and aircraft squadrons in those border areas to confront the German forces. This news was transmitted here by travelers. Since Germany deployed 300,000 to 500,000 troops into Romania, it is widely believed that these rapidly expanding German forces in the Balkans will take action in the New Year, thereby affecting the Soviet Union, as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The news of the Soviet Union increasing troops has strengthened this belief. As standard German troops traveling by train through Hungary into Romania gradually increased to 500,000, Romania has been completely under German military control. The tension in the entire Balkan situation is intensifying, with a high risk of breakdown. There are various external rumors about the true motives and purposes of the German troop expansion in Romania. Diplomatic circles speculate that Führer Hitler will ultimately be unable to attack Thessaloniki in Greece via Bulgaria and Romania to assist Mussolini. If so, then Herr Hitler will risk a reaction from Turkey, as Turkey has warned in advance not to allow the Thrace region to be invaded. Some people also believe that the previous reports that the Soviet Union had demanded complete control of the mouths of the Danube River caused tensions in German-Soviet relations, and that the German troop movements may be related to this matter. (27th day International News Service dispatch)

Budapest - According to eyewitness reports yesterday, German army transportation through Hungary has been greatly intensified in the past three days. Trains carrying large quantities of military supplies are passing by every hour, indicating the needs of a large-scale German military operation. (27th day United Press dispatch)

New York - An American news agency's dispatch from Budapest stated that about twenty German divisions, fully equipped with mechanized units, are continuously passing through Hungary by train en route to Romania. Another report said that 1,000 German military trucks have arrived in Trieste for distribution to Italian troops. (27th day Reuters dispatch)

London - Regarding the story from New York about German troop movements through Hungary, official circles here stated yesterday that they had no knowledge of it. (27th day Reuters dispatch) Authoritative Nazi officials in Berlin yesterday vehemently denied foreign reports of Soviet-German difficulties in Romania, saying that such reports were "a routine attempt by foreign propagandists to damage relations between the two countries." (27th day United Press dispatch)

Sofia - Observers pointed out that Hitler's territorial ambitions for the Soviet Union's Ukraine may not have been abandoned. Germany, using Romania as a base, may launch a blitzkrieg against Ukraine as early as January, when the ground is frozen solid and suitable for mechanized operations. Hitler's tactics often involve surprising moves and cannot be limited by common sense. (27th day United Press dispatch)

### German Troop Increase in Romania Shocks All of Europe

Istanbul - A certain source who recently returned to Turkey from Romania stated that the arrival of a large number of new German troops in Romania is of great international significance. The Romanian authorities did not anticipate that Germany would add any number to its 42,000 troops stationed there. Germany currently has at least seventy divisions stationed on the Soviet-Russian border in Poland, but if troops are transferred from Germany to southern Poland, it is possible to go through Hungary, as the railways in southern Poland are very old. (27th day United Press dispatch)

New York - Rumors of a large-scale German troop movement to Romania shook all of Europe yesterday. Apart from diplomatic sources saying that trains in Hungary were delayed for four to seven hours each, there was no official news in other major European cities to prove this. Berlin officially vehemently denied that German troops had entered Romania via Hungary. Belgrade officially denied that any German troops had entered Bulgaria. The chief of intelligence in Bucharest told the United Press that the German troops who recently arrived in Timisoara in east-central Hungary were only expanding the garrison there. Intelligence also said that "Germany does not seem likely to launch military operations in the Balkans, especially in Greece and Turkey." The United Press reporter was forbidden to publish the number of German troops who recently arrived in Timisoara. (27th day United Press dispatch)

### Germany's Intentions Are Unpredictable. A Major Offensive Must Await Next Spring.

Budapest - Diplomatic circles believe that the German deployment of 300,000 troops through Hungary to Romania will take a month to complete. Germany seems to be preparing for a major offensive next spring, rather than attempting anything at present. The number of troops currently entering Romania ranges from 300,000 to 350,000, all of whom are fully equipped with the latest equipment and mechanized war equipment. Germany is also requisitioning 1,000 to 1,200 trains in Hungary for transportation. Diplomatic circles also believe that Germany's true intentions cannot be predicted at this time because the Soviet Union's attitude is extremely docile. Currently, very few German troops are invading Bulgaria because King Boris of Bulgaria has warned that if Bulgaria is used as a base for military operations, he will abdicate. German forces are currently quite capable of cutting off the connection between Greece and Turkey to the south, as Yugoslavia recently signed a non-aggression treaty with Hungary, making it almost impossible to go through Yugoslavia. In this case, Bulgaria's position is even more dangerous. The Soviet Union has at least twenty divisions in Bessarabia, all of which are mechanized and equipped. This number has doubled since the summer and autumn seasons. The Soviet Union's attitude may be to support Turkey, regardless of the war in other countries. If German troops invade Greece, the winter climate and geography will be major obstacles. If there is a large-scale offensive, it will have to wait until next spring. If they can capture Thessaloniki in Greece by then, it will be enough to save their dying partner, and the port is only a few hours away from the British oil fields in Iraq and Mosul by bomber. In addition, some people speculate that German troops will try to invade Syria from there, but this must be done with a sufficient base in the Aegean Sea. (27th day Havas dispatch)

### British Artillery Arranged in a Semicircle. Intensive Bombardment of Bardia. British Troops Continuously Reinforcing the Front Lines.

Cairo - British troops consider the Italian stronghold of Bardia in northeastern Libya to be extremely important. Yesterday, they continued to strengthen their fresh troops and artillery in preparation for a final offensive. Front-line news said that although there had been some minor engagements between British and Italian troops, the situation had not changed much. British troops had gathered more than 250 cannons in a semicircle around the port. Although the Italian army put up a stubborn resistance, it had gradually retreated to Bardia. The area is now blowing cold winds, and neither side's troops know that Christmas has arrived. British troops are trying to break through the Italian defenses and drive them into the sea. They believe this will be a matter of days. (27th day United Press dispatch)

London - According to news received here today, the British are continuing to bombard Bardia with increasing intensity. British and Dominion troops are surrounding the port and preparing to attack. An account of the Indian troops' participation in the Western Australian victory has now been published.

### Northern Battlefield Launches Offensive. Greek Troops Rush into Lin City. Important Stronghold Connecting Elbasan. Italian Troops Retreat to Valona Along the Coast.

Athens - Greek troops have rushed into Lin City, an important stronghold on the road to Elbasan (the Greek army's future destination). (27th day Reuters dispatch)

Athens - Battle reports said that Greek troops in the northeastern region of Albania launched another fierce offensive last night. The Italian army, which had retreated to Valona in the coastal area, and those who were under great pressure in the Tepeleni, Himara, and Këlcyrë triangle areas, were greatly threatened. According to reliable front-line news, the Greek northward attack broke through the Italian front line north of Pogradec and advanced to an important junction at the starting point of the road to Elbasan. According to general opinion, Elbasan is the center of the Italian defense line in the north. The loss of that city will force the Italian army to retreat to Tirana. Large Greek reinforcements are now rushing to the northern area to join the battle. Along the coast, Greek troops are fiercely pursuing, while Italian troops are trying to resist and contain the Greek advance. Today's official communiqué stated that yesterday Greek troops captured several more Italian troops and a large number of military supplies. (27th day League of Nations dispatch)

London - Last night, the Athens communiqué declared that the Greek troops on the Albanian front, still in a heroic posture, are fighting hard in thick fog, snow, and cold weather, and have occupied several enemy outposts as a result. The number of prisoners and military supplies captured by the Greek troops is very large. The Italian army has been forced to retreat to the north and northwest of Himara, and has abandoned several important military strongholds in that area in the evening. A Greek military spokesman said today that the Italian army had abandoned several high grounds north and northwest of Himara. Greek troops are now clearing the occupied area of the Drinos River and entering further inland. Five Italian officers and sixty-five soldiers captured there belonged to five different units, which shows the chaos of the Italian army. Further north, Greek troops have conquered several villages.

Enclosed are two images of Lincoln, hoping that they will be hung in the Navy Department and the officers' quarters of the destroyer Lincoln. Alexander thanked Knox for the gift and presented a rare colored antique naval model in return, writing in his reply, "There is no better gift than the gift you gave me, because it shows your sympathy with the struggle to preserve human freedom."

### Japanese Newspaper Promotes Major Propaganda, Claiming the U.S. Will Intensify Restrictions on Japan, as Evidenced by the Withdrawal of Nationals and Economic Oppression

Tokyo – The "Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" published an article today, stating that the United States is currently spreading "unease rumors," claiming that the U.S. government will soon strengthen its anti-Japanese attitude. However, the article did not specify the date or location of the dispatch. The newspaper listed the following events to observe the U.S. position: (1) The U.S. government will intensify its recommendation to evacuate American nationals from the Far East by January 31 next year. (2) The U.S. government will intensify economic pressure on Japan, prohibiting American ships from entering Japanese ports starting in February. The "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" stated that the transmission of this rumor is highly regarded in U.S. policy towards Japan, as it coincides with the impending reopening of trade negotiations between France and Japan in Vietnam and amidst rumors that the U.S. is about to join the European war.

The article also stated that the Japanese government authorities are preparing everything to cope with any situation arising from the withdrawal of American nationals from Japan.

### U.S. Newspaper Criticizes Arms Exports to Japan, Urges Government to Pay Attention to Aid to China

Washington – The "Washington Post" wrote an editorial yesterday, stating that part of the U.S. aid plan to China has been undermined by the continuous export of U.S. military raw materials to Japan. The editorial stated that the total value of U.S. exports to Japan in October was $26,195,000, which is $8,000,000 more than in September. The reason for this surge is mostly due to the large-scale export of raw and refined copper, metalworking machinery, gasoline, and other aircraft fuels to Japan. In the first ten months of this year, the total amount of U.S. exports to Japan was $191,413,000, while in the same period last year it was only $179,377,000. Our country's exports to China increased significantly in October, totaling $67,908,000 in the ten months of this year, while in the same period last year it was only $40,170,000. The editorial also stated, "The increase in trade with China is gratifying because this move can show that China, as an independent warring nation, has at least obtained the above assistance from our side."

### Vichy Still Trying to Struggle to Avoid Being Drawn into the War; Pétain Will Personally Negotiate with Hitler to Resolve Tensions Between Germany and France

Vichy – According to reliable sources here, after Marshal Pétain, head of the French government, received assurances from the military leaders of North Africa and the Near East that they are prepared to defend France against any aggression, Pétain took a firm stance last night to resist the pressure of German forces. It is claimed that Marshal Pétain has consistently opposed any cooperation plan to involve France again in the war and fight alongside the Axis powers to attack Britain. Observers say that this development is the goal of powerful figures and is supported by some senior officials in the Vichy government. The divisions within the Vichy government are increasing daily.

Rumor That Marshal Pétain Will Meet with the German Leader

Therefore, it is rumored that Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler may meet soon to resolve the difficulties between France and Germany. Military leaders in North Africa and Syria assured Pétain that their troops would be prepared to defend France against any aggression. Since Marshal Pétain received this assurance, Pétain's position has obviously been strengthened. (International News Agency, 27th)

Vichy – After French Navy Minister Darlan arrived in Vichy, he was received by Pétain, followed by a cabinet meeting chaired by Head of State Pétain and also attended by Interior Minister Peyrouton, Defense Minister Huntziger, and Finance Minister Bouthillier.

French National Assembly as an Advisory Body

Lyon's "Le Temps" recently commented on the direction of French politics, stating, "The future of France's national system should be based on our country's excellent inherent spirit, rather than the crystallization of a political action. Our national revolution is aimed at radically reforming our habits and systems to restore our spirit of generosity and freedom, not retaliatory behavior. It does not suppress the people's aspirations, but rather wants to guide them at any time while respecting public opinion. In the future, our country should replace the original Senate and Chamber of Deputies with a National Assembly, whose powers should be completely independent, so as to become Marshal Pétain's permanent advisory body. In the event of major incidents, the head of state can consult with it at any time or consult with individual members to make decisive decisions. (Havas, 27th)

### Securities: Grades 甲 and 乙 of Domestic Debt Both See New High Prices

The public debt black market suddenly had an abnormal and unexpected development yesterday. Grades 甲 and 乙 both saw new high prices, but unfortunately, they quickly fell by half a yuan. The reason was that the same company bought in large quantities, intending to tighten its position, but it thought that its strength was not great, and it immediately settled out when it was profitable. It is difficult to predict whether this kind of so-called rising trend will continue. Jiu Liu, because the Northern Gang had quite a lot of absorption, had a light capital and heavy interest, and its future should still have progress. Yesterday morning, the same company bought in first place, De Fu followed, Lian He was the palace, and retail investors fueled the flames. The market price gradually rose, without looking back, and suddenly improved by one yuan and two or three jiao. Ding Kang Yitai and Sheng Da then sold at a good price. Lian He De Fu continued to buy in the afternoon, Sheng Da made up for it, and Xie Kang Zhen Chang bought in. Grades 甲 and 乙 then saw new high prices again, but Ding Kang Yitai continued to sell, the same company turned to sell, and Hong Da Shun Chang Hou Da all settled out. The high price of Grade 丙 suddenly dropped from four yuan and six jiao to four yuan at the closing. The price of Grade 甲 was raised by four jiao, and then it was returned. The foot of this rising trend is not solid, and it is afraid that it will not be easy to maintain without falling. As a result, the market price unanimously rose by three jiao to one yuan and four jiao, and the turnover was about three million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 300 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded, and the price was twenty yuan, seven jiao and five fen, which rose very sharply. It is rumored that the company's profits this year can be 2 million yuan.

Also, the stock market of the public institute of commerce and industry opened steadily. Later, due to the covering of short positions, the prices tended to rise. Near the closing, the stocks of all stocks became more and more fierce. It is generally expected that the market will open high in the new year. The most traded stocks include Yangzi, International British Union, Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory, Jardine Matheson Brewery, and Wheelock Marden, which all closed at high prices.

### Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Rises and Retreats Wildly; There is a Difference of More Than Forty Yuan

The yarn market has huge fluctuations, and the situation of rapid advances and retreats is more and more intense. This is entirely due to the different wills of the long and short sides. At first, sellers were frightened and rushed to cover their positions. Then it was heard that those who profited were selling, and then the foreign exchange turned longer and gold fell. As a result, the chips were slightly relaxed, and the shorts became active again. The floating market was painful and the new market gradually weakened. According to rumors in the market, the attitude of "foreign guests" is still silent. The new high of 20-count Double Horse was seen at 1,433 yuan, and the low price broke the 400 yuan mark, at 1,391 yuan. Today, 480 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, because the popularity of the previous day was strong, and the shorts were eager to make up for it. The first plate price was 1,415 yuan. As soon as this plate was opened, buyers came one after another, and the sellers were difficult to cope with. It rose directly to 1,433 yuan. Then, those who made a profit settled, and the price slightly loosened, falling back to 1,416 yuan. However, the foreign exchange opened slightly shrinking by one gear, and the market turned up again, rising to 1,428 yuan again. In the middle, it was heard that the speculative longs were settling a lot, and the situation turned down for a while. The market revolved and went down. It was almost 12 o'clock, and the trend in the field changed greatly. It was said that rumors were flying around. Many said that foreign exchange was going to be longer, and the floating households sold and the market price went straight down to 1,394 yuan. Statistics show that 6,105 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 15 yuan.

Twenty count Double Horse first made 1,400 yuan, then 1,392 yuan. Someone wanted to enter, and then made 1,400 yuan again. Finally, the price was 1,395 yuan.

### Cotton Market is Quiet as Usual

The current cotton situation is similar to the previous day, but the factory's demand is not strong, and the holders still have no intention of compromising on sales, so the market is quiet as usual.

Another news is the foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market is firm. First, because of the poor weather report in the cotton area, and then because of the purchase of the same industry, the closing price rose by five or six pounds compared with the previous day. India stopped trading.

In Shanghai, foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the tightening of the exchange rate. The factories have a strong intention to purchase, but the same industry is unwilling to sell at a low price. However, according to the trend of the cotton market, the cotton price is still expected to rise.

### Food: Rice Market is Silent; Prices See a Slight Correction

Foreign rice slightly leveled off yesterday, because after the cessation of brokers' entry into the market, speculative trading suddenly became silent, and floating retail investors also sought to get out of the market with the market. Moreover, a certain firm sold more than 1,000 packages of broken rice, selling at the limited price of 76 yuan. In addition, the public warehouse's rice reserves are already in progress, and orders are also being evacuated, and people's hearts are turning flat. The spot market price has been reduced by about one yuan. However, the sales in the market are still middle and second-class goods according to the limited price. If the high-priced goods such as Saigon are limited, they still cannot get out of the sample. Therefore, the trading of spot rice for the whole day was only more than 2,000 packages, and only 200 tons of futures were opened in small transactions, with December at 95.5 yuan, January at 87.1 yuan, and January next at 88 yuan. The price was also about one yuan lower than the previous market.

Thick and thin are more observant, domestic rice and glutinous rice have a little more trading, but because people's hearts have been emptied and the sales market is weak, the selling price has been devalued by about one yuan. It is estimated that Kunshan 斛 of white japonica can be seen from 100 yuan to 97 yuan, and Qingjiao 斛 of thin rice can be seen from 92 yuan to 90 yuan, and the original package is 96 yuan. The glutinous rice is tired in this environment. The prices of Xuanli domestic yuan have been sold at 94-95 yuan, and the prices of Hong Kong white yuan have been sold at 84-85 yuan, also down by about one yuan compared with the previous market.

### Huge Amount of Canada Flour Traded; Appetite of Hoarders Gradually Slackens

Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was first concentrated and then flat. The opening in the morning was quite firm, because the supply of Chinese flour was decreasing day by day, and foreign flour has become a necessary product for local customers. Generally, merchants insist as usual. It is heard that local customers have purchased more than 2,000 packages of Huashen brand Australian flour, at a price of 22 yuan and 95 fen, and more than 5,000 packages of Hua Wu Zhonglou brand flour, at a price of 22 yuan and 75 fen. It is rumored that grain merchants have newly ordered two ships of Canadian foreign flour, at a price of 4.5 US dollars per barrel, with loading in January and February. People's hearts in the market, after hearing about the conclusion of this huge amount of fixed flour, the appetite of hoarders is more slack, and the evening market situation is gradually loosening. As for the sale of flat flour, it will be maintained until the end of the year as usual. The new method for January next year will be decided after considering the source of foreign wheat, it is said.

Wheat: Yesterday, the trend of wheat was still firm. Chinese factories have not made any significant progress for a long time, and Japanese factories are paying attention to absorbing futures. It is heard that the price of Chinese train wheat is 30 yuan to 29.5 yuan. About 10,000 packages were thrown by merchants to Sanxin Factory. The shouting price in the market is very high, still 32-33 yuan, and there is no proper transaction.

### Oil Cakes: Oil Market Supported by Hoarders

Yesterday, due to the easing environment and the softening of people's hearts, the oil market, under the downstream trend of soybeans, was strongly supported by a part of hoarders, but the overall situation was not good, and the result was still a fall. It is estimated that 150 pieces of Chengfu Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 94 yuan to 93 yuan. 100 pieces of new goods were priced at 94 yuan and 5 jiao. 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 115 yuan and 75 fen. 200 barrels were delivered in the upper part of January, and the price was 116 yuan and 25 fen. 100 barrels were delivered in the lower part of January, and the price was 117 yuan and 25 fen. 300 barrels were delivered in the upper part of February, and the price was 118 yuan and 5 jiao. 150 dan of Da You Factory soybean oil were priced at 93 yuan and 5 jiao to 93 yuan.

Today, 2,380 packages of beans, 15,820 pieces of soybean cakes, 100 packages of sesame, 650 cans of sesame oil, 800 packages of raw kernels, and 3,400 cans of raw oil are all being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Rose Too Rapidly, Sales Have Stagnated

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market saw prices rise in the morning and fall back in the afternoon. Initially, market sentiment was enthusiastic, and all goods were quoted with unanimous increases, ranging from 50 cents to 75 cents per piece. However, actual sales to customers remained sluggish. Wholesale dealers on this street have already stopped extending credit due to year-end accounting procedures, and are temporarily suspending restocking except for goods awaiting sale. There were also rumors of a delay in the issuance of new miscellaneous banknotes, causing market sentiment to weaken. Small retailers rushed to sell, and selling pressure led to a price decline, ultimately resulting in prices little different from those before Christmas. Around 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Cantonese and Hong Kong dealers handled over 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou dealers handled nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, etc. Northbound Yantai dealers handled 70-80 packages of heavy-weight Double Elephant brand suiting fabrics.

Eastern Cloth: At the opening, due to the soaring yarn market, the upward trend was particularly strong. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was sold for $43.20. Later, with the decline in bid prices and yarn prices, the market for mid-range fine cloth, which actually sells, showed signs of stagnation again. Outside speculators sold off their holdings, causing prices to soften gradually, closing at $42.56 at midday. The market continued to fall to close at $41.90. Four Gentlemen's broadcloth was $1.2005.

Exports: 1,150 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (28th).

### Spring and Summer Woolens: Significant Transactions

Light-colored spring thin flannels, thin plain broadcloths, various spring goods for Chinese and Western clothing, summer goods like panama, feather yarn woolens, worsteds, harvey woolens, flannels, etc., have all seen significant transactions recently. Dealers are keen to stockpile, mainly because there are more Heqi (a type of cloth) this year than last year, ample funds, small inventory levels, rising factory prices, shrinking foreign exchange limiting imports, and expectations that the Yangtze River will open, boosting the market and creating shortages, driving prices even higher.

### Zigong Woolens Decline

Original color Zigong livery woolens, previously in short supply due to market shortages, experienced two or three price increases. Western goods were particularly popular. Recently, market sentiment has weakened and turned sluggish due to the arrival of Eastern goods and production from domestic Yin Feng and Dalu factories, leading to a balance between supply and demand. Those holding inventory no longer see room for speculation. Yesterday, Fook Tai original color Zigong woolens sold for $45 per yard, Yin Feng Cai Shen Hu for $28, and Dalu Yi Ben Wan Li for $25.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stabilize

Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned flat, with little fluctuation. The guild's quote for current goods, two-four group white, outside the warehouse was $79.40, a slight increase of 10 cents. Dutch red current goods were $64.20 to $64.00, in the warehouse $64.90, end of the month delivery $64.50 to $64.40. Taikoo Car White B Mark west of the warehouse remained at $78.50, end of the month delivery $78.10. DY Mark west of the warehouse new goods were $77.20, HX Mark $76.80 to $77.00, showing a slight rebound. Although domestic sugar quotes increased, there were few buyers due to transportation difficulties in various regions.

### Reasons for Sugar Market Increase Vary

Recently, the sugar market has risen rapidly, reaching new highs. On the 24th, two-four coarse white reached $81, and Dutch red reached $65.50. The guild saw more inflows than outflows, indicating a potential sugar shortage. The reasons are as follows:

(1) Higher settlement prices: Dutch sugar is settled in US dollars, and the recent shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate has led to higher sugar prices. If the exchange rate recovers, sugar prices will likely ease. (2) Total market inventory is around 70,000 bags. Although new arrivals are continuous, outbound sales are also strong, preventing the accumulation of inventory. (3) The approaching Lunar New Year, with daily sales of around 2,000 bags, boosts market sentiment. (4) Sugar merchants adulterate sugar with cornstarch to profit. However, cornstarch prices are now over $80, exceeding sugar prices, leading many to anticipate higher sugar prices. (5) In the past, cheap Japanese sugar dumping suppressed market prices. This year, Japanese sugar imports are scarce. Recently, Japanese merchants have been buying coarse white sugar in the market, totaling over 10,000 bags, with unclear intentions. (6) Due to the sudden purchases by Japanese merchants, there are rumors of increased customs duties or the opening of the Yangtze River, but these are unreliable. However, the Japanese purchases have fueled various rumors and suspicions. (Hua Qiang Que Chou)

### Dried Goods: Golden Vegetables Reach New High Prices

Recently, the arrival of golden vegetables has been limited, and dealers have tightened supply, causing the market to rise repeatedly with strong upward momentum. Top-grade vegetables reached a new peak yesterday, opening at $120. Other mid- and lower-grade vegetables also followed suit. Based on current demand, further tightness is expected. Medicinal Materials: Kushenzi (Sophora Root Seeds) Up $20 Due to the lack of supply and dwindling market inventory, kushenzi has seen increased demand from various groups recently, driving up prices. Compared to the beginning of the month, prices have risen by as much as $20 per load.

### Silk and Tea: Factory Silk Records Recent High, Sold for $5,000

The overseas silk market after Christmas remains flat. The New York market is down slightly by 1.5 points compared to the last market before the closure. Yokohama and the rest of the New York silk market remain at the original levels. Local silk prices have been affected by the recent establishment of a "New Central Bank", leading to a contraction of foreign exchange and soaring silk prices. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Da Chang sold 50 bales of white factory silk, 78%, 20-22 denier, at an opening price of $5,000, $400 higher than at the beginning of the month. This price is the highest record in recent months.

### Metals: Blue Lead and Iron Sell Actively

The blue lead and iron market has been quite active recently, with thermos bottle factories and blank manufacturers absorbing significant quantities (due to seasonal factors), making the market lively. Market sentiment is boosted by the contraction of foreign exchange, and quotes are quite firm. Yesterday, goods from Hui Company opened at $140 per 200 pounds, while Lianban opened at $150 per crate, each rising by $5-6. Besides local manufacturers, out-of-town businesses are also active. Tianjin and Yangtze River merchants are also stocking up, leading to optimistic expectations for the future.

### Coal: Hongji Coal Dust Price Increase, Up $13 Per Ton

Hongji No. 2 white coal dust, under the pretext of a sharp increase in freight costs last month, had once raised prices, and coal briquettes had followed suit, with factory prices increasing. Unexpectedly, yesterday, cargo handlers took advantage of the recent foreign exchange contraction, and raised the price of No. 2 dust by another $13, from $155 to $168 per ton. Other lower-grade dusts, such as Xinhong dust and Guba dust, also increased accordingly.

### Economic Miscellany

— Feng Liutang

Cigarettes

Cigarettes are machine-made products, even more indicative of foreign influence. They are also called "fragrant silver" because their aroma is superior to any other tobacco. Generally speaking, opium smoking is the most cumbersome, requiring one to lie on their side, curved. It is also the most time-consuming, taking several minutes to prepare and smoke even a small amount.

Water pipes are less cumbersome than opium, but still require a water pipe, loading tobacco, blowing smoke, burning the tobacco, and disposing of the ashes, which is not very convenient. Dry tobacco can be said to be the most convenient, but because the pipe is small, it doesn't hold much tobacco, and the taste is not as good as cigarettes. Carrying it is also not as convenient as cigarettes, as it requires at least a foot-long tobacco pouch and other items. Therefore, cigarettes are uniquely convenient. They don't require a pipe, and one can continue to work normally with a cigarette in their mouth. They are suitable for walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, reaching even remote areas and all corners of the world. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Convene Special Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers, The Council Proposes to Increase the General Municipal Rate by 40 Percent Starting Next January

The Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting yesterday (27th) and decided to convene a special meeting of foreign ratepayers on January 23 next year to consider adding an additional 40% surcharge on the current general municipal rate (i.e., 18% plus an additional 50% surcharge) and land tax collection rate, and separately setting the fee rates for various licenses, which will be charged at 27% of the current general municipal rate and 1.35% of the land tax. According to the new method, an additional 40% surcharge will be levied simultaneously starting from January 1 next year.

### Saigon Cancels Rice Export Ban, Rice Prices Fall There, Rangoon Even Cheaper, Rice Market Closely Supervised, Rice Merchants Fearful

Most of the rice needed in this city comes from Saigon, and the price of rice there is based on the price of rice in this city. Now that the market prices of various foreign rice in this city have been assessed and limited, and are being strictly enforced, this news has been transmitted to Saigon and other places. Therefore, the rice merchants in Saigon believe that since the price of rice in Shanghai has been assessed, if they continue to tighten the original price or increase it further, the Shanghai rice merchants will not be able to make a profit, so they are hesitant to move forward and turn to other places to purchase. This has some impact on the business of Saigon rice merchants. General sentiment has changed from firm to soft, and market prices have begun to decline. The mainland newspaper reports that, according to business sources yesterday, Saigon has lifted the ban on the export of No. 1 Saigon rice. 80,000 bags of Saigon rice are already on their way to Shanghai. This move will have a good impact on the rice market in this city.

Rangoon Price 50 Yuan Per Tan

Yesterday, rice industry sources revealed that the current price of Rangoon rice is only about 50 yuan per tan in national currency. Although the quality of this rice is not as good as the rice produced in Siam and Saigon, the value is ultimately cheaper than the above two types of rice. If it can be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities, it will also be the only fundamental way to stabilize the people's food supply. Although there is a shortage of rice transport ships, it is reported that relevant parties are actively trying to increase the number of sailings so that large quantities can be transported to Shanghai. This is a counter-evidence to the rice lice using high costs as an excuse for rising rice prices.

Reform of Rice Market Requires Perseverance

After the market opened yesterday morning, it was rumored that more than 100,000 bags of tribute rice would arrive in port in early January, causing great anxiety among hoarders, who feared that market prices would plummet and suffer unexpected losses. Therefore, high-end rice grains have been seen in samples. Regardless of whether it is domestic or foreign rice, each tan has fallen by about 1 yuan compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions in the city reached more than 2,000 bags. According to a person familiar with the rice market, the handling of the rice market reform has been more stringent this time. Because there are no speculative elements in the market spreading rumors and purchasing rice on behalf of outsiders, the market transactions are based on actual sales as a principle. If we can further dredge the source, the market price is expected to not have much large fluctuations. However, this measure must be adhered to in order to lay the rice market on a stable path. If the rice market suddenly tends to stabilize, we should consider the interests of a few people who are excluded from the market and revoke the measures restricting entry into the market, then speculative elements will be able to re-penetrate the market, which is not a benefit for the people's food supply in this city. It is hoped that relevant parties will pay attention to this.

Eight Periods of Fair-Priced Grain Sales for a Total of Fifteen Days

Since the rice price increased, tens of thousands of poor people in this port have hoped that the eighth period of fair-priced grain sales will be realized as soon as possible. According to the Dazhong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the fair-priced grain sales committee, the 30,000 bags of broken rice ordered from the foreign production area will soon arrive in this port. The eighth period of fair-priced grain sales will be held around January 5 at the latest. It is also learned that the fair-priced grain sales date is about 15 days, because each rice firm must handle the end of the year when waste accumulates, so the fair-priced grain sales date will be shortened.

### Cross-Border Road Construction Donation and Tax Disputes, Negotiations Are Pending

It was recently reported that a so-called "Shanghai West Municipal Government Tax Collection Office" sent letters to Chinese and foreign factories within 100 meters of both sides of the road built across the border in West Shanghai, requesting "tax collection." According to the Yangjingbang land regulations, the donations and taxes in the area within 100 meters of the road built across the border are collected by the Municipal Council. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from the donation office of the Municipal Council yesterday. According to a senior official of the office, the donation and tax dispute in the area of the road built across the border in West Shanghai cannot be resolved for a while. Negotiations cannot begin until the police agreement of the "Joint Police Power" is signed. In recent months, a "tax collector" has been repeatedly sent by a certain party to the area to collect donations and taxes. Although he has not received a detailed report, according to what he knows, some taxpayers in the area have already paid taxes to the Municipal Council and also paid taxes to a certain party. This is their voluntary loss, and the Municipal Council cannot interfere.

### Salvation Army Allocates Funds to Help Foreigners, Gives Cash According to Life, Beneficiaries Total 120 People

The Shanghai division of the Salvation Army, in order to help poor foreigners in this port, specially distributed a large amount of cash on Christmas Day, distributed by Major Marie Mountain, the district chief, to 120 poor foreigners, and divided them into three types according to their living conditions: couples and one child were each given 25 yuan in national currency, two children were given 30 yuan, and more than one or two people were given 40 yuan. The army has followed the usual practice of distributing a large number of Christmas packages on Christmas, but this year it has been changed to cash, and the recipients are very practical.

### Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Donate to Motherland, Exceeding 10 Million Yuan, Allocated to Charitable Donations in Various Parts of the Country, Another 5 Million Yuan Donated in Quinine

There are more than 1.3 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Although they are far away overseas, their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of others. Among them, the city of Batavia accounts for more than 1.2 million people. Since the war, overseas Chinese have been enthusiastically donating money and have never slackened. In addition to regular monthly donations, there are also occasional dedications of gold and charitable recreational activities. As of November this year, only

Batavia Overseas Chinese

Donations to the Motherland's charity donations alone are more than 13 million yuan. There are also many other individuals who remit money directly. In addition, the donation of quinine medicines back to the country is even greater, totaling 650,000 Dutch guilders, equivalent to more than 5 million yuan in national currency. This quinine is greatly needed on the front line, and will be

Continuously Donated

This time, when Wu Tiecheng went to the Dutch East Indies, the overseas Chinese were very excited. At the welcome and farewell meetings, they donated more than 6 million yuan on the spot. Local overseas Chinese are mostly from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and hundreds of groups can unite sincerely. Especially for work that benefits the motherland, the communication is closer and the cooperation is more effective. Especially recently, Japan

Advancing Southward

All the overseas Chinese in the area, in addition to being vigilant about themselves, are even more concerned about the motherland. They have now sent overseas Chinese leader Qiu Yuanrong back to the country to investigate the actual situation and prepare for overseas Chinese to return to the country to invest and run real industries in the future. The authorities warmly welcome Qiu's visit and provide him with various conveniences. The news is that a satisfactory result was obtained, and after returning to Batavia, he will widely promote the motherland.

### Wenzhou Rice Famine Turmoil, Many Killed, Disaster in Ningbo and Shaoxing Counties is also Severe, Yin County Implements Two Porridges and One Meal System

According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiries, Wenzhou, which is located in eastern Zhejiang, has always been known for its rice production. Recently, there has also been a rice famine, and people have no way to purchase rice, so they petitioned the county government and were shot at by armed teams, killing and injuring many people. The public caused disturbances, destroying the residences of gentry such as Chen Zhuosheng on Fu Slope Temple Lane, Tang Boyin in Bailifang, and Zhang Ruzhou, the town chief in Chengnan.

Councilors Send Condolences to All Famine Victims

After receiving the news, the Zhejiang Provisional Council sent a telegram of condolences, saying, "Yongjia Chamber of Commerce transfers to Yongjia Jin County Public Appraisal, recently heard that the Yongjia people petitioned the county government because they could not purchase rice, and were shot at by armed teams, killing and injuring many people. After hearing the news, this meeting expressed deep condolences and has decided to send a telegram to the provincial government to quickly raise and transport rice for relief by emergency methods, and to strictly investigate and handle the matter. It is hoped that all the people will abide by order together to maintain the security of the rear, and a special telegram of condolence is sent for your public appraisal, Provincial Provisional Council."

Ningbo and Shaoxing are also Extremely Serious

In addition, in Ningbo and other counties, such as Yin County, the system of two porridges and one meal has been strictly implemented, and the expansion of winter planting and miscellaneous grains has been promoted. On the one hand, rice has been purchased from various rice-producing areas in Zhejiang and Jiangxi to provide relief. However, according to estimates, the county's food supply can only last until February next year. In the spring and summer, there will be a serious period of hardship for the people's food supply. A famine has already occurred in Zhenhai County, and gentry from Shanghai and Zhenhai are providing rice relief to Yin County.

Provincial Relief is Too Slow to Help

The remaining counties, such as Cixi, Fenghua, and Shaoxing, all feel the lack of food, especially Shaoxing, which has suffered from the aftermath of the war, and the food panic is extremely serious. People are starving to death on the roads, and the situation is tragic. Although the province is coordinating and adjusting the situation and sending economic delegations to various places to inspect and inquire, the relief is too slow to help.

### Honda went to Ningbo, and Japan increased its alert, All three bridges were locked

At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, special precautions were suddenly taken in the Hongkou area and along the Suzhou Creek. All bridges along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge, were blocked by the Japanese army, cutting off traffic. All military vehicles and pedestrians south of the bridge could not pass. The situation was very serious. It was not opened until 8:30 a.m. It was blocked for half an hour before and after. According to foreign sources, the reason was that the new Japanese ambassador to Ningbo, Honda, went to Jiangning and passed through the area, resulting in temporary precautions.

### The Owner of Fang Dan Land Appeals to Restore the Electricity. The Municipal Council has No Right to Levy Land Donations and Taxes. There has been a Judgment, so there is No Need to Appeal Again.

In the Fang Dan land tax case collected by the Public Concession Municipal Council, the Chinese Ratepayers Association has severely protested to the envoys of the countries concerned after receiving the report from the landowner, and attached a copy of the judgment of the First Special District Local Court that the Fang Dan land tax does not need to be paid. Yesterday, the landowners Fang Jiahe, Hu Jingfang, Fang Wende, etc., jointly notified the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the purpose of filing a lawsuit with the Consular Court and explained the errors recorded in the foreign newspapers. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the honorable ones, after reading the news in the newspapers translated from the English American Evening Post about the Shanghai Municipal Council's unauthorized collection of donations for the Fang Dan land, the taxpayers thought that there may be misunderstandings. The evening post thought that the taxpayers and the consular joint court filed a lawsuit on whether the bureau has the right to collect donations for the Fang Dan land. However, the taxpayers are now asking the court to restore the original state of stopping the supply of electricity and compensation for various damages after the power outage. The independent judicial authority has determined that the bureau has no right to collect donations for the Fang Dan land, which is obvious and there is no doubt. Therefore, the taxpayers request your association to forward it to various newspapers."

### 3,000 American Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Decide to Delay Their Travel. They Will Observe the Development of the Situation Before Deciding Whether to Go. Only a Few American Missionaries are Travelling.

According to an investigation by a Western reporter to the American overseas Chinese in this port, the evacuation of American overseas Chinese from the Far East, which was in full swing eleven weeks ago, has gradually been forgotten. There were originally 4,000 American overseas Chinese in this port, but now there are about 3,000 remaining. More than half of these 3,000 people are family members, and hundreds of them originally intended to accept the advice of the State Department and prepare to evacuate, but it is heard that they have now decided to postpone their trip. According to an observer, these American overseas Chinese seem to be observing whether the situation will worsen. According to an official of the steamship company, he firmly believes that unless there is a new development in the situation in East Asia, American overseas Chinese in this port are unlikely to continue to evacuate, but judging from the records of the American President Steamship Company, American missionaries in China are still continuing their plan to return to the country. Each President's ship has several American missionaries taking it back to the country. It is reported that in the future, it will still be difficult to find second and third class seats on the President's ship, but there will be a lot of spare first class seats.

### New Year's Day of the 30th Year of the Republic of China, All Circles Prepare for Commemoration, At this Very Moment There will be No Extravagant Celebrations, Citizens will Promote Thrift as Victory Approaches

The New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China will arrive in an instant. That day is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All circles in this port, at this very moment, when the country is in danger, have decided to follow the central government's order and not engage in extravagant celebrations. Various organs and groups such as the customs, post office, courts, Municipal Council, Public Concession, banks and money changers, various markets, embassies of various countries in Shanghai, and various schools, etc., will follow the usual practice of raising flags and taking three days of vacation to mark the occasion. At the same time, the citizens of all circles, as the year is renewed and national victory is approaching, in addition to the belief in resisting and building, which is more determined, will also enthusiastically promote the movements of saving to build the country, donating conscience money, and providing disaster relief, so as to strive for victory and complete the great cause of resisting and building.

### Coal Briquettes Price Increase

The coal briquette factory has assessed the price, that is, it must not exceed 140 yuan per ton. However, some of the larger coal briquette factories have acted against the law and ignored it. Therefore, they have increased the market price of coal dust needed for the coal briquettes they hold, using the excuse that the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes has increased, so they have increased the market price of coal briquettes to 160 yuan per ton. Because of the impact of foreign exchange contraction, the market is restless. Coal merchants use the opportunity to firmly hide their existing goods and refuse to sell them easily. After the coal market opened yesterday, people became more and more panicked, and as a result, the market price of coal briquettes was raised by 8 yuan per ton. The current factory price has risen to 168 yuan, and the retail price has reached 180 yuan per ton, that is, 9 yuan per load (100 market catties). However, according to the New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiries, the coal dust currently shipped to Shanghai was all transacted at low prices, and the current foreign exchange contraction has nothing to do with the market price of coal dust. However, coal merchants are taking the opportunity to increase prices, and their intentions are truly unpredictable. Moreover, the coal dust currently manufactured by various factories is not entirely Hongji coal dust. Only a small number is available, and most of it is Heling coal dust from Taiwan. The price of this coal dust is quite cheap and the quality is inferior. It is hoped that the coal briquette association and the relevant authorities will pay attention to it and stop looking on, so as to relieve the people from their misery.

### The Silver Money Industry's Total Close is Approaching, Monetary Resources are Abundant, Sunday, January 26, Both Industries will Still Work as Usual

The New Voice News Agency reporter inquired from the banking industry yesterday that after the financial industry in Shanghai was maintained by the two national banks, it has remained stable as always. All banks have been able to obtain considerable profits. However, the demand deposit of each bank has increased compared to before the war, and there is a lack of proper investment channels. In addition to universally reducing interest rates, each bank is also trying to transfer domestic Shanghai surplus capital. All industries have been fully prepared for the end of the year and the Lunar New Year. The head office shortage of each industry at the end of the year has now been arranged so that they can pass it peacefully. The recent decline in the Shanghai market foreign exchange lending rate has proven that the monetary resources in Shanghai are abundant.

Date of Spring Opening

January 26 is the date of the total close of each industry in the 29th year of the Republic of China. In order to facilitate the collection and distribution of each industry, the Silver and Money Industry Association has decided by joint meeting that although this day is a Sunday holiday, the decision is still to operate as usual and has notified the members to follow the instructions. The money shops of the Money Industry Association members will take four days off from the 27th to the 30th, called the general settlement period, and will open on January 31. The banks of the Banking Association members will take one to two days off from the 27th to the 29th, called the Spring Festival, and will open on January 30. Regarding the handling of business matters before and after the total close, such as market lending rates and receipt collection times, the silver and money industries will hold further consultations.

Annual Settlement of the Lineage

December 31 is the end of the Gregorian year. Each bank has separately settled the interest for the commercial and savings departments, and it is scheduled to extend office hours internally on that day to rush to settle the accounts. Although January 1 to 3 are New Year's holidays, each bank will still operate as usual internally. The money industry's settlement is based on the end of the Lunar New Year, and only ordinary settlements are handled at the end of the Gregorian year. As for each factory, company, firm, etc., those who use the new accounting method will use the end of the Gregorian year for settlement, but in fact, nine out of ten are based on the end of the Lunar New Year for settlement.

### Auction of Goods Held Up in Vietnam; Various Industries Protest; Registration of Goods Underway; Government to Be Contacted for Compensation

Since the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in June of this year, a considerable amount of goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong merchants have been held up in Vietnam, unable to be transported to the mainland. The total value is estimated to be over ten million yuan. Later, due to Vietnamese authorities yielding to demands and preventing the transfer of the held-up goods to the mainland, and with recent reports that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, intends to order a public auction of the stored goods, leaders from various commercial sectors in the city have been jointly deliberating on countermeasures to seek relief. They have also telegraphed the government to lodge a serious protest with the Vietnamese authorities. According to a report yesterday from a reporter of the Ping Ming News Agency after visiting the local pharmaceutical industry, the amount of medicines held up in Vietnam is also not insignificant. The industry held a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and advisors the day before yesterday (the 26th) to discuss the issue of negotiations regarding the goods held up in Vietnam. It was decided to first send letters to the relevant pharmaceutical companies, requesting them to provide detailed reports to the association on the names, quantities, and values of the goods held up in Vietnam. They will then separately request relevant government departments to argue for their rights based on reason. Other manufacturers and traders are also currently processing registration procedures. If the held-up goods are indeed auctioned off, they have decided to telegraph the government to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities, demanding compensation for the losses at the original price.

### Fire Department Report from the Shanghai Municipal Council

Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 709 fire alarms, including five malicious false alarms and two special alarms. The estimated property losses due to fires within the International Settlement and the Special Rate Area amounted to 361,120 yuan. Three citizens died and five were injured in fires. Two people were injured due to special incidents. Five firefighters were injured while fighting fires. In addition, the Fire Brigade's ambulance was dispatched 524 times last month, transporting 529 patients to various hospitals.

### American and Italian Soldiers Brawl; Ended Amicably; Both Sides Claim It Was Just a Drunken Quarrel; Dance Hall Suffered Losses of About 7,000 Yuan

Yesterday (the 27th), authorities from both the American and Italian sides in Shanghai stated that the brawl at the Da Lu Dance Hall on Christmas Day has now concluded. They claimed that the incident was purely a drunken quarrel and should not be given too much importance. Yesterday morning, officers of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment denied that anyone died during the brawl. It was also claimed that the reports of an official apology from the Italian authorities were inaccurate.

Dance Hall Considers It a Minor Incident

However, rumors circulated yesterday morning that one Italian corporal died or was seriously injured during the brawl. Verification or denial of this claim could not be obtained from the Italian authorities. Furthermore, a letter from Mr. Hiller, the assistant manager of the Da Lu Dance Hall, stated that the incident on Christmas Eve was merely a minor disturbance. He also stated that reports of a dancer being thrown onto a brass drum and an Italian sailor being mistreated by having his head hit against a piano were untrue.

Italian Troops May Compensate for Losses

The Da Lu Dance Hall is currently seeking compensation for the damage to furniture during the brawl, totaling two thousand yuan, and for unpaid bills of five thousand yuan from customers who scattered. According to an officer of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment, the U.S. authorities will not be responsible for the compensation. It is believed that the Italian authorities have expressed regret over the incident and will bear the compensation.

The Situation at the Time Was Very Tense

It was reported that when the American and Italian soldiers began to brawl, there were about 1,500 customers in the dance hall. Upon seeing the situation, they scattered in panic, causing great chaos. It was difficult to exit the hall. While the melee was in full swing, moviegoers who had just left the Grand Cathay Theatre heard loud noises coming from the Da Lu Dance Hall, indicating the intensity of the fighting. It is reported that at least twenty-five soldiers were injured. The American authorities stated that all injured American soldiers had been released from the infirmary, but the extent of the Italian soldiers' injuries was unknown.

### Steamed Buns and Ginger Soup; Scheduled Distribution

Address Being Searched For

The Shanghai Charity Federation, recently noting the unprecedented high prices of rice and flour this year and the difficulty for ordinary people to make a living, has decided to distribute steamed buns and ginger soup as usual. They plan to start the distribution on December 19th, which is the first day of the twelfth lunar month. They are currently actively working on the preparations. As for the distribution locations, the venues at Longmen Road and Dahua Road were selected last winter. However, due to the increase in the number of people receiving relief this year, they plan to find a wider area to accommodate everyone.

Shelter for the Cold

Since the Cilian Relief Society opened the shelter for the cold ahead of schedule the day before yesterday, it accommodated over two hundred people on the first day. Yesterday, they continued to send trucks to various roadsides to collect people and transport them to the shelter. As of 11:00 AM yesterday, over one hundred more people had been taken in. According to the society's estimate, the capacity of 1,600 people will be reached within a few days. If the capacity is exceeded, they may open a second shelter to accommodate more people and benefit the poor.

Distributing Cotton Clothing

The poor people taken in the day before yesterday were mostly emaciated and in a miserable state. After giving them baths and haircuts, the shelter provided each of them with a set of cotton clothing. Those suffering from sores and skin diseases were transferred to the refugee hospital for treatment. There were also those addicted to opium and heroin, who were treated by a contracted addiction specialist at the shelter. However, as these people's bad habits are deeply ingrained, as in previous years, some may try to escape. Therefore, this year's management is particularly strict to help them see the light and avoid sinking into darkness.

Children's Provisions More Than Doubled

The Ciyou Nursing Home, Infant Shelter, and Children's Shelter established by the China Ciyou Association are currently housing over 650 refugee children. The association is soliciting candy and used toys from all sectors for the Spring Festival. Furthermore, due to rising prices, the association had previously budgeted six yuan and fifty cents per child per month for provisions, but this has now more than doubled. Therefore, it urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute to this good cause.

Various Industries Generously Agreed to Continue Donations

Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association began providing refugee relief, various sectors have generously contributed, either by donating a percentage of salaries or a percentage of business income, providing regular assistance. Tens of thousands of victims have been spared from hunger and cold. The association recently learned that although it has repeatedly tried to disperse the refugees through various means, there are still more than 16,000 people in the shelters, mostly the elderly, weak, disabled, and homeless. At a time of high prices, it feels deeply that it is difficult to maintain them. It is specifically appealing to various industries to continue their donations for another year to complete the effort. It is reported that after the association issued the appeal, various industries such as restaurants, pawnshops, rice shops, cotton cloth shops, yarn factories, fresh fish shops, hardware shops, steel and scrap iron shops, and medicinal material shops have all agreed to continue their donations for another year according to the original plan, in order to fulfill the initial intention of providing disaster relief. Furthermore, the association's citizen fundraising committee has also taken the initiative to extend the donation period, working together to maintain the good cause. The personnel of the two disaster relief agencies are also determined to handle the matter with integrity, ensuring that every drop of contribution goes to public use and that no funds are wasted, so as to reassure all sectors.

### Stringent Searches After Killing of Japanese Police Officer; No Rice Allowed In or Out of Tushanwan

Since the re-implementation of the "Pass System" for entering and exiting Nanshi last month, the "double pass check" has gradually loosened. However, after the Japanese police officer Minoru Sakazaki was attacked with a hatchet at the intersection of Wenmiao Road and Zhonghua Road on the 22nd of this month, the situation has become tense again. Japanese military police and patrolmen at each entry and exit point are conducting extremely strict "pass" checks, causing many residents to be unable to enter or exit and gathering at the iron gate. Among the dozens of cases of Japanese police officers being killed in Shanghai, this is the first one to occur in Nanshi. Although the Japanese side searched the households in the area around the incident, there were no martial law measures. Furthermore, after the reopening of Xujiahui Tushanwan in western Shanghai the day before yesterday, the situation has gradually eased, and pedestrians and vehicles are now allowed to pass. However, rice is subject to strict inspections, causing farmers from Caohejing, Qibao, and other places who transport rice into the concession to be in a quandary.

### History

— Pinpin

I often wonder why humans write history? When Emperor Frederick the Great asked someone to read history to him, he said, "Call the liars." History is a lie, why write it? The great historian Gibbon also said: "History is nothing more than a record of human crimes, stupidity, and misfortune." History is a criminal file, why publish it?

Is history really a pile of worthless dregs? I say no.

Do you know how history is created? History is formed by the collision of two opposing forces. One force represents truth, justice, and morality; while the other represents evil and deceit. These two forces are in constant conflict and struggle, and mankind progresses forward. Human progress is difficult because history is a product of blood.

Thus, history is not for us to watch, but for us to do. Only cowards are happy to watch history, of course, the result is that he feels uncomfortable, because he sees the mistakes of the past. Brave people are to do, to create history. William Mott said well: "History represents the most pleasant place for poetry and novels, the solemnity of epic, the moving plot of drama, the horror and lessons of legend." Creating history is valuable because it is progress. Watching history makes people depressed and old; but creating history makes people excited and young. Friends, when you open history, do not read it as a dead book, but as a trumpet, calling you. Rise up your arms, fight the evil forces, you must go and create!"

The Greek warriors created the fruits of victory, which was inspired by the historical sites of Marathon.

### I Wasted Ten Years

— Li Min

Friend, I want to tell you, in this situation, I wasted + years.

Ten years is a long time!

But what can I do? Every day I watch the sky dawn to darkness, darkness to light, just circling the circle of life, and gradually, I also become old.

You know, I was fourteen when I started in this business, but now I am twenty-three years old, twenty-three should be the age to get a wife, but where do I start?

Hearing the whistle of the steamship in the morning, I need to go to work, and dragging my corpse-like body home at night, I just fall into bed. In fact, it is not that simple, I don't know how many things need my strength, I don't know how many things need my brain, and in addition to using both brain and strength, I also have to endure the factory director's "scolding".

The factory director is a timid and suspicious person, but after he has eaten his wine every meal, he will say very pungent and unreasonable words. We are unwilling to meet him, but we are often forced by life to plead with him.

Once, I went to the factory director to borrow money for my younger brother's carbuncle surgery; the factory director was drunk from eating rice wine. I explained the reason for borrowing money, but he got angry. He said:

"Who cares about your family!"

But I can't let my brother suffer from carbuncle and even die. After the father died, should these older brothers not bear the responsibility? However, I finally endured the anger and begged several times, and finally the factory director blamed me for spending too much usually, and fiercely signed a word to lend me twenty + yuan.

In fact, is twenty yuan enough for the hospital? That is hard to say.

The staff in the factory seem to live in a "peaceful world", when they are free they do not talk about women, but talk about "mahjong" scriptures, sometimes they sigh and say that the cost of living is too high, but they do not worry about the factory, but blame their own bad fate.

Is fate really bad, I don't understand.

But I think that fate is ultimately empty, wasting like this for ten years, is there no way to change it?

So, sometimes I hate my father, why didn't he let me read more books, otherwise it would be better than wasting in a dark factory.

However, this is also superfluous, before the society is reformed, the man-eating system will always remain.

But in today's cost of living, I really can't get by, ten years, although I wasted it, but at the beginning of the eleventh year, I can't waste it like this anymore.

You probably don't know how many dollars I make a month. Friend, I only have ten dollars a month, plus the so-called cost of living allowance now, it's only twenty dollars. Where do you say I should use these twenty dollars a month? The factory director scolds me for being too wasteful, this is really unfair, rice costs one hundred yuan per picul, briquettes cost eight yuan per picul, I have a mother and younger brother at home, we have to eat. We also have to live in a house, but what do I use twenty dollars for? Buying two pecks of rice, twenty dollars is gone, what about the rest?

I am confused, I doubt; the factory has raised the price of goods, why is our salary not increased?

I painfully wasted ten years, now I can't waste it anymore!

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

Qian Muzhai slowly stood up and said, "What you say is not without reason, I will go and sacrifice myself for the country with you." Liu Rushi then walked down the stairs with Qian Muzhai. Muzhai's adopted son and daughter and all the family members were serving on the side, all with tears in their eyes. Qian Muzhai and Liu Rushi each felt extremely sad. First, they personally lit incense at the incense table, worshiped the late emperor, and then worshiped their ancestors. Muzhai's adopted son and daughter came to kowtow to Muzhai and Rushi. Muzhai's relatives did not yet know, so there were only a few people in the family. Rushi's daughter could not help crying sadly, and everyone cried. Muzhai was sad and speechless. Liu Rushi shook her hands tightly, stopped everyone's crying, and said, "This is a sad but not really sad thing. Everyone must die in life, we sacrifice ourselves for the country, live as loyal ministers, and die as superior ghosts, you should be happy, why be sad? As long as you be good people in the future, do not disgrace your parents or stain yourselves, even if we are in the underworld, we will be able to rest in peace. If the fate of the Great Ming has not yet ended, and the southeastern provinces raise an army of loyalists, and in the future they can drive out the barbarians and restore our rivers and mountains, then "When the royal army pacifies the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice." Lu Fangweng's poem can be recited for us, which is even your good fortune, and we in the underground will also jump three hundred times, and dance three hundred times. Why do you cry, disturbing people's hearts, this is a childish attitude that must never be had." After Liu Rushi finished speaking, everyone really did not dare to cry, so Liu Rushi took Muzhai's hand and walked to the back garden. Everyone followed far behind, not daring to make a sound. Muzhai wore his court clothes and crown, pacing slowly, only sighing. It was late spring at this time, the weather was already warm, the garden was full of green willows and red flowers, the scenery was bright and beautiful, the roses on the flower stand had already bloomed, the swallows shuttled back and forth in the tender green willow branches, and the orioles were also chirping娇ly on the branches. Muzhai could not help but sigh: "Such a good spring scenery, the heartbroken people are shocked to see it, how can they have the leisure to appreciate it? Du Fu said that the country is broken and the rivers are still there, and the grass and trees are deep in the spring city. "Yushan is a piece of soil, how can it be kept clean for a long time?" Liu Rushi said beside him, "The reason why we are unwilling to live in a filthy world is that death is cleaner instead." Muzhai sighed again, and walked around the lychee path, in front of a small pavilion there were several plum trees, piled with a delicate rockery, under the rockery there was a clear spring, the pool water was very clear, and there were also several swimming fish 唼喋 on the surface, surrounded by a white stone railing, before Muzhai and Rushi often flew glasses and drunk in the moon, and fought grass and chanted poems by the pool, unexpectedly today they will die here, can they not feel emotional? Muzhai walked to the pool, stopped, and looked around. (23)

### The Successful Failure

— Xinliang

There is such a story: four college students just graduated, they decided to seek development separately; but before they were to separate, they each took out one hundred yuan and handed it to the uncle of one of them for safekeeping and investment; after + five years, whoever has the greatest achievement, whoever can get this bonus.

As a result, one became a successful engineer, one became a successful economic advisor to the government, one made a fortune in Australia, with both money and prestige; in short, these three generally succeeded.

There was another one, who was originally prepared to be a novelist, but finally in order to bear the burden of the family, he had to work as a low-level clerk in a small export company; so, on that day fifteen years later, he wrote the following letter to his former classmates:

"Dear friends, I only have - a wife - in my eyes, she is the most lovely wife in the world.

Four children, the best. A happy home - no happier than this.

A spirit of struggle - feel very happy.

I have failed in some respects, but in my family life - I am successful.

Believe me, I still like to have fun, and I will never envy your wealth and glory."

Who got that bonus in the end? It was not the engineer, nor the economic advisor, nor the rich man, but the low-level clerk, the "successful failure". When those three classmates who had both money and prestige read that happy letter, they all felt in their hearts that they had failed!

True "success" should be a gentle, sweet life. It does not necessarily require a lot of money, nor does it necessarily require a big, impressive title; but a happy state of mind, a spirit of struggle, is indispensable for everyone who wants to succeed!

### Winter

### Good Waiter

— Hu Bei

In Rome, there was a foreign journalist who lived in a hotel and discovered that the waiter was a spy. He had always thought that spies were not of much importance. But this spy, Daoci, followed him all day long, and he hated listening to his important conversations very much: so he had to report this matter to the hotel manager.

The manager said: "What can I do? I can fire him, but the spy who is hired again may not be such a good waiter."

### Active Photographers on the Front Lines

— Xing

Yellow River Line · Yunnan-Guizhou · Nanning · and Southeast

The contributions of the photographers in the cultural work camp cannot be erased. In the rear, they risked working under bombardment; on the front lines, they endured hardships and hardships like soldiers. They are worthy of being the cultural new army. The following is the latest situation of their access to the front lines.

Expanding the current situation on the Northwest battlefield, the mighty Yellow River basin, supported by the Taihang and Zhongtiao mountain ranges, has formed the most solid fortress. The photographers Tong Zhen and Ye Jiong, who are stationed in the Northwest, plan to use the Yellow River Line as the warp and the bears on both sides of the Yellow River as the weft. To make a systematic documentary film, the first thing to show is that the Zhengzhou stronghold of the Pinghan Road is connected to Tongguan. Our army's defenses have always maintained an advantage. The second is the salt production life of the people in the Huangpan area. Due to the difficulty of importing sea salt, they spontaneously improved the ancient salt lakes in the eastern Henan area. There, the salt content mixed in the soil layer, after being washed by the Huangfan torrent, and then exposed on the ground under sunlight evaporation, is the best natural salt pond.

The second group is Cheng Zelin, who went to the border between Yunnan, Guizhou and Vietnam alone. He set off two months ago. The Iron Army General Zhang Fakui is the commander defending the area. Cheng Zelin works with General Zhang. On the frontier, photographers need to endure hardships like soldiers. The inconvenience of transportation and walking for several days is commonplace, but this also makes the harvest in the camera more abundant, including the defenses of our army crossing the border, the life records of the local Vietnamese people, and the harmonious emotions of the Han and Vietnamese people.

Lian Ju, a photographer stationed in Guilin, took advantage of his proximity to the water and went to Nanning after its recovery. By the middle of this month, we can see what Nanning is like after the robbery? What is Nanning, which is being rebuilt?

There is also a group of Zong Weigeng who is active on the eastern battlefield. When he recovered Zhenhai and conquered 　 and, he was already working in that area. When he passed Shangrao lightly on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, he met with the commander and requested to collect economic construction materials from the southeastern theater. General Gu said: "The southeast is actively developing military warfare and economic warfare, and economic warfare has made more significant achievements."

In short, today's photographers have become the most active and sharp cultural new army.

### Development of Domestic Films in Hong Kong

— Haixing

The Hong Kong Lee Theatre is the largest theater in the city. In the past, it has staged Cantonese opera and Peking opera. Mei Lanfang, Jin Suqin, Wang Xichun, Xue Juexian, and Ma Shizeng have all performed in the theater. The theater has recently been completely renovated with more than 200,000 Hong Kong dollars. It was initially planned to stage Peking opera again. Hong Kong newspapers have repeatedly reported that the first phase is Li Wanchun, the second phase is Zhang Eyun, and the third phase is Qilin Tong. The owner of the theater, Yuan Yaohong, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Someone introduced him to Zhang Shankun, the owner of Guolian. After talking, Yuan believed that domestic films had great potential, and he immediately decided to abandon the original plan and sign a film contract with Guolian. It is reported that the theater is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The first film is Chen Yunshang's "Xiaoxiang Autumn Rain", plus a short film of nine major stars singing. The blockbuster "Xi Shi" will be presented on New Year's Day next year.

### Remotely Listening to Jin Shaoshan's "Lianhuan Tao"

— Yu Chu

I accidentally turned on the radio and happened to receive the rebroadcast of "Lianhuan Tao" from Beijing Radio. I have heard the play from the radio twice. One was broadcast by the local Xin Xin Stage, sung by Li Wanchun and Sui Shengrong. Now it is a collaboration between Jin Shaoshan and Zhou Ruian.

It was once rumored that Shaoshan's voice was hoarse, but after listening to it today, his voice has recovered, high-pitched and loud, just like in the past. Congratulations to him. Among today's Jing roles, only Shaoshan and Wang Quankui are good at singing. (Ma Shixiao, who is now affiliated with Huang Jin and came to Shanghai with the Fu Liancheng class, has a full and flavorful voice. If he works hard and strives for further study, his achievements may not be inferior to Jin Wang.)

The biggest drawback of listening to Peking opera is that you can't see the charm of the stage at that time. If the two Lianhuan Tao plays, Erdun's appearance, tearing his beard, using his eyes, and the running of the horse when stealing the horse, and the expression when worshiping the mountain, the workmanship, etc., can only be understood in the brain. Shaoshan's Xipi Yuanban section sung in "Sitting in the Village" is clear and measured, and not everyone can reach it. After that, the "Stealing the Horse" "Chang" returning to the mountain, there were not many cheers from the audience. Hou Xirui is the best in this "Chang" in terms of his figure and style. Shi Haisheng and Rong Yijun are also not weak. The Yaoban of "Returning to the Village", "The royal horse is coming happily, the golden saddle, jade bridle, yellow silk rein... "Shaoshan sang the four sentences, which were as decisive and satisfying as chopping nails. After singing this section and entering the "Chang", the gong and drum sounds on the "Chang" have changed, knowing that Ruian's Huang Tianba is on the stage. Ruian was very popular in Ping in the early years of the Republic of China, and he would pick a big sign to perform (at that time, Cheng Yanqiu was still singing the opening opera in his class). Later, he also invited Jin Shaoshan to accompany him in the play. I didn't expect that he has now been reduced to Shaoshan's vassal. On that day, Ruian's Tianba made his appearance, with sparse applause, and the audience did not like it very much. Zhu Guangzu was played by Wang Fushan, the son of Chang Lin, and his speech was still clear. The "Public Hall Discussion" set a plan to "light the dart" and other "Changs". There are many transitions in it, and there is nothing wonderful to say. It was not until Shaoshan's "Chang" was changed again, and Dou Erdun came out again, when the leader reported that the dart master was asking to see him, Shaoshan shouted "Line up to welcome him", using his nasal voice greatly in the two "welcome" characters, and won a full house of applause. Immediately after worshiping the mountain and going on stage, Ruian's big paragraph of speech has a small building style. "Biao passed Malanguan..." A paragraph, sung with a full palace and full tone. It is not easy for Ruian, who is over fifty years old, to have this tone. However, Dao said that the high places are too sharp, such as the "this" character of "originally for this", which feels sharp and harsh. This may be because he is trying his best to imitate Xiaolou but his inner breath is not enough. Shaoshan's last sentence of the Liushui "Dantan" is raised, which is quite good. The two "Changs" cover each other, which is very tight. Since Tianba asked "How is Peng Peng an official?" Starting from one sentence chasing another, the two answered fluently, which is seamless. Listening and sighing are over. Finally, Baobao Village Chief said "Team sends Tianba", all the performers of this role use Beijing dialect to say it, which is purely a gimmick and has no meaning. Now Shaoshan also speaks Beijing dialect in this sentence. I don't know who started it. Wei Changtian sang "Duo Meng Village Master Kuan Hongliang" in a section of Liushui. Bao Erdun sang "Father is a hero and son is a good man" four sentences, and the whole play ended without taking the second "stealing hook".

### Garbo is in Love Again

— Baolin

I saw in the previous issue that Miss Shawi wrote that Garbo's fifth love interest was Dr. Gailo Hesser, but who knew that their love river had twists and turns again?

Recently, a rumor has been spreading in Hollywood that Garbo is in love with the great musician Stokowski again. Mr. Shi was Garbo's fourth object, and he had been separated from Garbo for a long time; but recently after he returned from traveling in South America, he made the first call to Garbo to invite her to meet and talk. People will be confused, because aren't Garbo and Dr. Gailo Hesser very close?
