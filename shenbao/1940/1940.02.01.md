### Japanese Army in Tianjin Blocks Food from Entering Concessions; Prices Soar Higher Than During Last Year's Flood; Only White Russians Can Carry Food into the Concessions

Tianjin: According to the Japanese military spokesman today, the Japanese side has not imposed any restrictions on the transport of food into the concessions. However, this claim by the Japanese side is completely inconsistent with the facts. A reporter for the English-language "North China Star" newspaper, an American named Bao Wen, attempted to pass through the Japanese sentry line today with six dozen parrot eggs, but was stopped by a Japanese sentry. Although Bao Wen presented her American passport and the pass issued by the Japanese side, it was of no avail. Bao Wen indicated that she was willing to leave the parrot eggs behind, hoping to keep the chicken eggs, but the Japanese sentry still refused her request. Therefore, Bao Wen had no choice but to abandon all six dozen eggs. In addition, another foreign journalist was also stopped by a Japanese sentry for carrying five apples and was not allowed to enter the British and French concessions. However, these two foreign journalists did not intend to carry food to the concessions, but merely wanted to test whether the Japanese military spokesman's claim that the Japanese side did not restrict the transport of food into the concessions was true. This can be said to have already been confirmed. Furthermore, the Japanese side's restrictions on food entering the concessions can be clearly seen from the food prices in the concessions. Food that sold for only 35 cents a pound two weeks ago has now risen to $1.10 a pound. At the same time, it only sold for 60 cents a week ago. Before the two journalists conducted this test, the Japanese military spokesman insisted at a reception for journalists that the Japanese side had no intention of starving the concessions. The reporter then stated that the spokesman's words were not true, and that Japanese sentries did indeed prohibit food from being carried into the concessions. The spokesman then said that these sentries were all members of the Hirota squad, directly under the command of Commander Honma, and that there was no room for misunderstanding. However, each sentry had the right to handle matters at their own discretion. He also said that the Japanese side's attitude towards American residents was completely the same as its attitude towards British residents and residents of other countries (it is noted that when the Tianjin concessions were first blockaded last year, Americans enjoyed special treatment; the Japanese side's statement today shows that it has changed its attitude towards the United States). He also said that the reason why Japan hopes that third countries will cooperate in establishing a "New Order in East Asia" is that it hopes that third countries will adopt a friendly attitude towards Japan and not take a hostile attitude. Furthermore, at the meeting, the spokesman also said that if one wants convenience, there is nothing better than abolishing the concessions, because at that time, there will be no need for obstacles. Furthermore, the Japanese side has tightened its blockade of the concessions considerably. Countless trucks are waiting outside the barriers to enter the concessions, but only a very small number are allowed to enter the concessions. Many of these trucks have been waiting outside the barriers for as long as five days without being able to pass. As a result, the prices in the concessions are even higher than during last year's flood. At present, only White Russians in anti-communist organizations can carry food into the Japanese-controlled areas. As for British and American people, they are afraid of being insulted by Japanese sentries and are unwilling to make this attempt. (30th dispatch from Gilb, special correspondent of the United Press)

Tianjin: According to news from here today, the English-language "North China Star" reporter, the American woman Bao Wen, reported her experience at the Japanese sentry station yesterday, and the incident of her being prohibited from carrying six dozen parrot eggs to the British concession, to the American Consul General in Tianjin, Gottway. In addition, the American woman Evans, who arrived here from Shanghai on Monday, also encountered various difficulties at the Japanese sentry station. Therefore, Evans also reported her experiences to the American consul. It is reported that the American consul has listed the experiences of the two in his routine official report to Washington. At the same time, the American Chamber of Commerce here will also hold a meeting tonight to discuss the Japanese side's tightening of the blockade of the concessions and the shortage of food in the concessions, and believes that the situation is serious. It is noted that Evans is a well-known lawyer with a good reputation in China. According to her statement to the American United Press reporter, she arrived here from Shanghai on the afternoon of Monday and hired a car to proceed to the Wan'guo Bridge. In this car, there were also two Chinese women and a Chinese girl. When the car reached the Japanese sentry station, Evans presented her American passport and other certifying documents. After a glance at the lady's suitcase, the Japanese sentry said to her, "It is best to go to Asahi Street." At the same time, the Chinese women and others were not allowed to pass because they were carrying food. Therefore, Evans followed orders and went to Asahi Street. However, when she reached Asahi Street, the sentry there did not allow her to pass either, and said in English, "You should go to Wan'guo Bridge." Evans then said that she came from Wan'guo Bridge, and that the Japanese sentry at Wan'guo Bridge had said that she should go here. The Japanese sentry then said, "That's a mistake. I will notify the Japanese sentry on that side by telephone." At this time, the Chinese women and others had already gotten out of the car, so only she went to Wan'guo Bridge again. Who knew that when she reached that place, she was told to stop again, until the Japanese sentry opened her suitcase and saw that there was no food before he let her go. Furthermore, in Evans' report to the American Consulate, she mentioned the experiences of a Western maid from a certain Western hotel who was stopped by Japanese sentries every day, because the Japanese side did not care about wasting other people's time.

### United States Navy Should Maintain Two-Front War Capability; So That Treaty-Scorners Know What to Fear; Navy Secretary Edison Defends Military Expansion Plan

Washington: Navy Secretary Edison stated in the Senate Naval Committee today that the United States should strengthen its national defense to the point where countries that scorn treaties will think twice before making the United States their target of attack. Edison said, "If our strength is not sufficient, then our interests, our precious freedom, and our wealth will inevitably become the targets of attack by countries that scorn treaties or scorn what we consider to be national integrity. The Navy Department, in view of the world situation in 1940, has decided that the United States should quickly build new warships and complete them as quickly as possible. The United States must be prepared to deal with the worst-case scenario. If the strength of the US fleet is weaker than the combined naval power of our potential enemies, then our current fleet must be considered unsuitable for use. However, if the United States can make solid preparations, even tyrannical countries will have to think twice before risking a conflict with the United States. The procedures proposed by the Navy Department, if passed, will serve as a powerful announcement to prevent countries with aggressive intentions from acting rashly, and that the United States intends to effectively protect its country and all its interests in dealing with such countries," he said. (30th dispatch from International News Service)

Washington: US Secretary of the Navy Edison stated in the House Naval Affairs Committee today that in order to achieve its national defense security, the United States must maintain its original US$1.3 billion naval expansion plan, because in the current war, the United States must be able to simultaneously defeat enemies from the Atlantic and from the Pacific. In today's war, the strength of various friendly countries will soon turn into a force against the United States. Therefore, in theory, we can include the navies of Britain and France in the ranks of friendly forces, but in reality, our navy must have the strength to operate independently. Therefore, the United States must maintain its strength in the Pacific, and at the same time, it must build another Atlantic navy." However, many in the House Naval Affairs Committee advocated a three-year plan that was half of the original plan, and some even advocated shortening it to a two-year plan, reducing the plan to add 77 new ships by 21 ships. According to Republican Representative Chi, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, if the shipbuilding plan proposed by the Navy Department is adopted, the shipbuilding cost each year for the next three years will be as high as US$800 million.

Economic Pressure Alone is Not Enough to Make Japan Comply

New York: Famous journalist Lippmann recently wrote an article in the Republican New York Tribune analyzing the situation in the Far East. He said, "Some believe that if the United States exerts economic pressure, Japan will give in. This is a superficial view. According to Japan's intentions, it wants to destroy the power of the United States' 'potential allies' in the Far East. In order to achieve this goal, Japan will establish an alliance with European countries that are currently at war with our country's 'potential allies' in the Far East. It will not directly attack our country, but will attack our allies, so that our country will not go to war, but will still be completely isolated. If so, if our country does not accept Japan's disturbance in the future, it will have to fight it alone in extremely difficult circumstances. Indeed, if our allies are defeated or exhausted in Europe, and are expelled from the Far East, then no matter how strong the United States is, it will not be able to simultaneously plan for both the Pacific and the Atlantic and make people respect American interests. This is what Japan knows. Republican Senator Vandenberg once predicted in July of last year that the Far Eastern problem could not be resolved without the participation of European countries. This is a very insightful statement. Its penetration may not be what he originally intended," he said. (30th dispatch from Havas)

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Reviews US-Japan Relations; Pittman Strongly Advocates That Embargoes are Necessary

Washington: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to review US-Japan relations tomorrow, and study the steps to be taken in the future. If necessary, Secretary of State Hull will be invited to attend a report, or to conduct an investigation into the general relations between the United States and Japan. The chairman of the committee, Pittman, recently issued a statement to the press, saying, "In view of the current situation, I firmly believe that it is still necessary to impose various restrictions on Japan in terms of commerce, so as to prompt Japan to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards the interests of various countries in China." As for the views of the State Department on this matter, they have not been revealed so far. However, political figures believe that if Congress can pass a bill authorizing the State Department to impose economic sanctions on Japan when necessary, it will be welcomed by the department. As far as the attitudes of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are concerned, in addition to Pittman and other members who have always advocated sanctions against Japan, isolationists Vandenberg, Nye, and Wagner still oppose dealing with Japan with strong measures. (30th dispatch from Havas)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull declared that the issue of implementing an export ban against Japan is currently being carefully considered, and a decision will be made only after a detailed study of all possible reactions. He also said that he does not intend to attend the report when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meets tomorrow to discuss the embargo issue, because he has already informally notified the committee of his views. (30th dispatch from Haitong)

Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, if the United States implements the export embargo against Japan advocated by Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Japanese people will inevitably regard it as an insult to Japan. Suma told American reporters that Japan believes that the current untreatied state between Japan and the United States is extremely inappropriate. If the United States implements an embargo against Japan at this time, it will inevitably give Japan a bad impression, because Japan's attitude towards the United States has not changed since the expiration of the US-Japan Treaty, and it has strived to adjust relations between the two countries. As for the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, both the Tokyo side and the local authorities are doing their best to realize it as soon as possible. (31st dispatch from United Press)

### Disputes Between Britain and Japan Willing to Seek Friendly Resolution; Legal Principles Can Be Disregarded; Expression of Prime Minister Chamberlain

London: In a speech by Prime Minister Chamberlain, there was a passage involving Japan that said, "Our country has had a dispute with the neutral and friendly Japanese government (referring to the Asama Maru case). From the perspective of pure international law, the two governments may have different interpretations, but the life of the nation and the psychology of mankind are by no means the most powerful factors in legal issues. If the Japanese people or the Japanese government think that our country deliberately and arbitrarily exercises the rights of a belligerent, disregarding international courtesy and the Japanese nation, then nothing could make us more melancholy. It must be known that our strong enemies have no scruples, and in order to dispel their plans, we have to implement all kinds of things, but we are willing to get along peacefully with friendly countries and will never take any measures to offend the self-esteem of this friendly country," he said. (31st dispatch from Havas)

### Asama Maru Case Continued Talks Between Britain and Japan; Britain Willing to Concede to Japan; Promises a Political Solution

Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita discussed the "Asama Maru" incident for an hour today, and will meet again tomorrow. He also said that Arita insisted during yesterday's meeting that the British side must return the 21 German sailors who were detained. Japan will issue a note again regarding the British government's reply, which can be issued within two days. After this note is issued, all notes exchanged between Britain and Japan will be published in Tokyo and London. (30th dispatch from United Press)

Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" said that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, in a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, temporarily shelved the law and adopted a political solution to the "Asama Maru" case. The British ambassador stated to Arita that this unfortunate incident could be resolved through friendly negotiations. If it is found that the arrested Germans are not qualified to be detained, the British government will be willing to reconsider the matter. Although the British government has now adopted a more moderate attitude, the points of contention between the two governments are still clearly different. It is expected that the talks in the next few days will reveal the most important effort to resolve this case. Dagu "Mainichi Shimbun" said that Britain's interpretation of international law regarding the "Asama Maru" case simply ignores Japan's superior position in the Far Eastern seas. According to the correct interpretation of international law, disrespect for the Japanese Navy in the Far Eastern seas should be regarded as illegal. (31st dispatch from Reuters)

London: Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu visited the British Foreign Office at 3:00 p.m. on the 30th and held discussions with British Foreign Minister Halifax regarding the Asama Maru incident. The content of the meeting was kept unanimously silent by both Britain and Japan, but it is generally believed that this resolution meeting was held because at a time when news of Japanese warships searching British ships in Hong Kong and Fuzhou or the Japanese side strengthening the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the relations between Britain and Japan have reversed again, there are concerns that the Asama Maru incident will become more difficult to resolve. Therefore, although Ambassador Shigemitsu did not receive instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he pointed out the urgency of resolving the incident to Foreign Minister Halifax from the side, arousing the attention of the British side, and the governments of Britain and Japan both agreed not to publish the content, which is enough to show that both sides are earnestly seeking a solution to the incident. The British government also has a full willingness to cooperate, so the resolution is by no means too difficult, and will continue to negotiate in the future. (30th dispatch from Domei News Agency)

### Soviet-Japanese-Mongolian "Manchukuo" Boundary Survey Conference Ends Without Results; Progress in Soviet-Japanese Commercial Negotiations

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters this morning that the Joint Boundary Survey Committee of Japan, "Manchukuo", Mongolia and the Soviet Union has been dissolved. Regarding this matter, the official side has received a telegram from Harbin that the reason for the dissolution of the committee is that it was unable to reach a compromise. Before the dissolution, all representatives jointly signed a statement declaring the fact that the above reasons could only stop the progress. It is noted that the Harbin Conference was convened on January 7, following the Chita preparatory meeting, with the aim of clearly demarcating the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border in the Nomonhan area. (31st dispatch from Reuters)

It is reported that the 20% reduction measure is applicable nationwide. (United Press dispatch from the 31st)

Editorial

### Is There a Possibility of the European War Shifting to the Near East?

Since the European war entered a stalemate on the Western Front, general observers have speculated that Germany will launch a frontal assault on the Maginot Line with the arrival of spring, or that Germany will invade the neutrality of Holland and Belgium and attack France from the flank, or that Germany will adopt a grand strategic detour and attack the Balkans. Each of these observations has its own basis, but in fact, only one observation can prove to be correct. We do not ask which observation coincides with the facts, but the general view is that the strategy of Britain and France is to implement a long-term blockade, preparing to force Germany to submit economically. Such a view is certainly largely correct, but whether the future war situation will develop in this way remains to be proven by facts. Comparing the economic and geographical environments of both sides, Germany is indeed only advantageous in offense and not in defense; and in the offensive strategy, there is only one route of attack towards the Balkans that has a better chance of winning by surprise, which seems to be a cost-effective plan. This is because the Maginot Line is where the main force of Britain and France is concentrated. Although the military strength of Holland and Belgium is not as strong as Germany, due to historical lessons, they have at least undergone several months of defensive deployment. Furthermore, they are not far from Britain and France, making it very easy to obtain assistance. Therefore, when Germany attacks, it will inevitably sacrifice greatly and have difficulty succeeding. As for developing towards the Balkans, the situation is different. The military strength of countries such as Romania and Bulgaria is certainly insufficient to resist Germany; and the assistance of Britain and France is beyond their reach. This strategy is relatively easy; moreover, the countries in the Balkans are small and divided in strength, and their wishes are great and mixed. In the event of a crisis, each will prioritize its own interests, so there is the greatest possibility of being defeated individually.

From a flat military perspective, changes in the Balkan situation, the rise and fall of power, are not the determining factors in the victory or defeat of the European war; but a flat observation is not enough. Since Germany has the greatest possibility of attacking the Balkans, the Near Eastern countries neighboring the Balkans have recently been filled with an atmosphere of gunpowder. According to dispatches from various places, it is rumored that Germany is about to expand its military operations to the Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian region; it is rumored that Britain and France have also amassed large armies in various parts of the Near East, preparing to cope with future incidents; there are even rumors that Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey intend to conclude a military alliance immediately, and that Iranian troops have already begun mobilization. In short, the recent situation can be said to have reached a considerable degree of tension. The Near East is closely related to the future of the war for Britain and France. In economic terms, most of the kerosene needed by Britain is obtained from Iran and Iraq; and the wheat and cotton of Iraq are the main food and raw materials supplied to Britain. In military terms, the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, is completely controlled by Palestine in the Near East; and Syria and Iraq are the two most important military strongholds in the Near East. If the British and French forces in the Near East suffer setbacks, there will be major difficulties in the contact between Britain and France and Asia; military activities will also be reduced; and the colonies in Africa will also be in danger of being threatened and attacked.

Because the Near East is so important, all the European warring countries attach great importance to this military and economic stronghold. However, the situation in the Near East is very complex. It is difficult to foresee what changes will occur in the Near East in the near future, or what kind of reaction the Near East will have due to coercion and inducement. If Germany wants to attack this stronghold, it depends on how strong the combination of Germany and the Soviet Union is. The Soviet Union believes that Germany's attack on the Balkans directly affects the westward expansion of Soviet power; if it goes further into the Near East, it will lead to a more acute confrontation with the Soviet Union's power. In the overall strategy of the Soviet Union, it would not be convenient to allow Germany to realize this plan. A more likely possibility is that Germany will use the Soviet Union's power to develop towards the Near East to indirectly complete its strategy.

Since the revolution, the Soviet Union has always adopted the diplomatic banner of supporting small and weak nations and liberating oppressed nations towards the Near Eastern countries; in fact, it did help Turkey to restore its country, and successively made friends with Afghanistan, Iran, and other countries, inducing them to lean towards the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of the European war, the Soviet Union has been more active in the Near East. Although the past Soviet-Turkish negotiations were not successful, the good friendship between the two countries still exists. Recently, the Soviet Union announced the construction of railways on the Iranian border, completing the connection between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, which is obviously a plan for the Near East. Originally, the Soviet Union had strong military power and geographical advantages. The reason why it was not in a hurry to take action was that the opportunity was not ripe and the pretext was not very clever. If Britain and France were to create an opportunity for it and give it a pretext, such as actively assisting Finland, the Soviet Union would be afraid that it would have to take action in the Near East.

Although Britain and France have close military and economic reliance on the Near East, the interior of the Near East has never been sincerely convinced by Britain and France; the riots in Palestine last year are an example. Originally, after the end of the First World War, the Near East was divided by Britain, France, and other countries in the form of mandates; although a small part of it has since declared independence, it is still actually subject to the control and manipulation of Britain and France; especially all economic resources are mostly occupied by Britain and France. In recent years, many ethnic groups in the Near East have hoped to obtain true freedom and independence. If there is an opportunity to take advantage of, they will have serious expressions that are unfavorable to Britain and France; moreover, in the vicinity of the Near East, in addition to the Soviet Union, which is eyeing it covetously, Italy is unwilling to sit idly by and watch the rise and fall of power, and Japan also hopes to get involved. Whether Britain and France can maintain the Near East and utilize it in the future will depend on whether Britain and France can first solve these political problems. Otherwise, if Germany and the Soviet Union jointly attack this weak point, who can guarantee that the center of gravity of the European situation will not shift in this direction? If the flames of war are ignited in the Near East, then what Germany and the Soviet Union seek will not be obtained, and Japan will inevitably see it as an opportunity to take advantage of the fire, looting Britain and France's colonies in Asia on the one hand, and intensifying the oppression of Britain and France's rights and interests in China on the other. This will only aggravate the situation!

### Commemoration of the Nazi Party's Rule, Hitler Reaffirms the German Nation's Right to Exist, Ridicules Britain and France's So-Called War Goals, Expresses Belief in Germany's Final Victory

Berlin. Yesterday was the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. A commemorative meeting was held at the Berlin Sports Palace at 8 p.m. The meeting was only announced provisionally yesterday afternoon. Before 8 p.m., the entire venue was crowded, with 15,000 audience members from all walks of life. All cabinet members, generals, and party and government leaders were also present. When the Führer Hitler arrived, the entire venue erupted in thunderous cheers that lasted for several minutes. Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Führer Hitler delivered speeches successively. After the speeches, the entire venue sang anti-British military songs and the meeting adjourned. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 30th)

Berlin. The main points of Führer Hitler's speech at the Berlin Sports Palace last night, on the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, are as follows: (1) Briefly described the failures of the democratic Germany to improve the situation from the Treaty of Versailles to the time when the Nazi Party came to power in 1933. (2) Listed the achievements of the Nazi Party's eight years in power: Germany began large-scale military expansion in 1934, implemented universal conscription in 1935, occupied the Rhineland region in 1936, implemented the four-year plan in 1937, annexed Austria and the Sudetenland region in 1938, and rose up to defend itself in 1939 when the enemy's mask was uncovered. (3) Discussed the war aims of Britain and France, saying that in a nutshell, "they want to restore a fragmented Germany like in 1648." (4) Briefly mentioned German-Italian relations, declaring that the friendship between the two countries remains as before and their interests are the same. (5) Responded to Britain and France, hoping that the opinions within Germany were complex, and especially warned the French Premier, "Mr. Daladier, if you think you are fighting against German tribes, you are either foolish or delusional. I clearly inform you that the tribes in your mind are actually a united Nazi German nation." (6) Finally, Mr. Xi (Hitler) vigorously affirmed the right to exist of the 80 million German nation, stressing that "if there is no clear understanding of rights, then understanding is out of the question. We do not want to fight for another three to five years. The German people have placed their trust in me, and I will strive to repay them and live up to their expectations." (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

Danjing. Today is the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's coming to power in Germany. The commemorative ceremony began at 7 p.m. this afternoon at the Berlin Sports Palace. First, Goebbels delivered a brief opening speech, stating that the Western plutocratic political countries are still spreading rumors, and their goal is to divide the German nation, but this kind of trick "is indeed" worthless. Under the leadership of the Führer, the German nation has already united and will never be confused by the words of London and Paris, but will only follow the teachings of the leader. On this seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, I would like to thank the leader on behalf of the people of the whole country. In the future, the people of the whole country should repay the leader's great achievements with struggle and work. Hitler then took the stage to deliver a speech at 7:03 p.m., which lasted for 63 minutes until 8:06 p.m. Briefly stated that the British war goal is to build a so-called new Europe. The authorities of that country promise to establish justice, implement disarmament, guarantee free trade, cultural prosperity and religious life after the war. It's "pathetic" that they can't come up with new slogans. Because in 1918, they also used the establishment of a new Europe as their war goal, but in practice, apart from disarming and destroying some countries, they themselves re-expanded their military. That's all. All the ills after the last European war were caused by the Treaty of Versailles. Although the League of Nations guaranteed this treaty, the League of Nations was not a free international group, but a tool to guarantee the implementation of this written order (referring to the Treaty of Versailles). At that time, Germany was still in a democratic political system, and no one cared about the pain it suffered. As a result, Nazism emerged. Moreover, the policies promoted by our party are based on our own strength, that is, work knowledge and the productivity of our country's land. We never threaten others. It can be seen that the movement carried out by our party is purely a domestic issue in Germany... As a result of our party's efforts, our country withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934 and reorganized its military, restored compulsory military service in 1935, sent troops to occupy the Rhineland region in 1936, and annexed Austria and the Sudetenland region in 1938. Until last year, we finally uncovered the enemy's mask. This is the achievement of our party's seven years in power. If all countries could have understood the German nation at the beginning, then everything would have been completely different. However, in these years, others have always criticized us for refusing to negotiate. In fact, every time we mentioned the colonial issue, others did not even bother to answer. The purpose of the British Prime Minister Chamberlain was to dismember Germany and eliminate the Germanic nation. I don't know that the 80 million Germans in Central Europe also enjoy the right to exist. These 80 million people are strong when united and weak when divided. This has been deeply understood by compatriots across the country. Britain does not want to see a unified Italy, let alone a unified Germany. The current problem is that several young countries have become great powers after uniting with each other and have officially put forward their demands, but the rich countries still want to be beyond their own power and impose a blockade...?? Remembering when the Nazi Party began to fight for the country, others attempted to dissolve our party, but our party not only stood still, but also established a new order in Germany. Today, others want to dissolve Germany. This is the war goal of Britain and France. However, our answer has always been the same, and we can only smash their delusions with facts. In the past, I was always ready to reach a compromise with other countries, but after the Munich Agreement was signed, Chamberlain decided not to conclude a new agreement with Germany. Until September of last year, the Western European countries actually removed their masks and ignored all our efforts to seek compromise, and brazenly declared war on our country. It can be seen that the enemy deliberately started the war. Today, I can tell Britain and France that since you want to challenge, you can now get your wish. Moreover, Germany and Italy have been implementing a common policy for more than a year, and they still do so today, and they will never be alienated by others. Chamberlain once held the Bible and attempted to form an alliance with Father Stalin. Later, because I had joined hands with the Soviet Union first, the two of them broke up. The fact that the vast space in Europe was able to avoid war was all thanks to this. In the past, Germany and the Soviet Union lived in peace for a long time, and today, the two nations have the same goals and will never fail to live in peace. After Germany reached an understanding with the Soviet Union, it has lifted all the shackles in Eastern Europe. The conquest of Poland last year is proof of this. This country was originally guaranteed by Britain, but in just 18 days, it was completely eliminated from the map of Europe. This is the first stage of Germany's liberation, and the second stage has now begun. British Naval Minister Churchill is almost impatient. As for the method of warfare, Britain's implementation of the blockade policy does not care about fighting against women and children, and the method of establishing concentration camps was originally invented by Britain. In short, we have been prepared for any eventuality. Our actions in the past five months have actually surpassed the achievements of the seven years since we came to power. This can be a consolation for the people of the country. Although the British radio station has falsely accused our party of collapsing, this kind of outdated propaganda can only make my belief stronger. The German army is still the strongest army in the world, and the German nation is still united. The enemy's propaganda will never be able to destroy this unity. As for the French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast yesterday, he criticized Germany for controlling Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland in the manner of enslaving the residents of various places. I think this gentleman will one day be able to recognize my Austrians. In other words, this gentleman may one day recognize the elite troops composed of Austrians, and then all his fantasies will be shattered. Mr. Daladier should know that he is no longer fighting against several different nations, but against the entire Germanic nation. The army and the party have become one and there is no possibility of division. Twenty-five years ago, the German military was not very strong. At that time, France's strength was above us, and Imperial Russia was its ally, but in terms of the war situation from 1915 to 1918, Germany, with the help of God, was still able to gradually improve its situation. It is a pity that the people of the country gave up halfway and finally signed a peace treaty. However, this kind of thing will never happen again today. The Nazi Party has been fighting hard for fifteen years. Under good organization, 80 million Germans across the country will definitely fight bravely. Any agreement that does not recognize our rights will not be accepted by us. I have the trust of the people of the whole country and will never fail the expectations of my compatriots. We are fighting for the Germanic nation and will rather die than surrender if necessary. I would like to encourage the people of the country together. Long live Germany!" (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

Explaining the Entry of the War into its Second Stage

Berlin. In addition to publishing the full text of Führer Hitler's speech, the Berlin newspapers also published editorials, emphasizing that Mr. Xi's speech and the emotions of tens of thousands of audience members all demonstrated Germany's belief in victory. The "People's Observer" pointed out that since the beginning of the war, there has been significant progress in military preparations, which is enough to show that this belief has a basis. The "German General Gazette" stated that the Führer's speech has explained Germany's position to the world without ambiguity and explained that the second stage of the war has begun. (Haitong dispatch from the 21st)

Effectiveness of the British and French Blockade Policy

Paris. The newspapers here have rarely commented on Führer Hitler's speech yesterday. The "Little Parisian" reported that "Since the implementation of the blockade policy by Britain and France, the effect has been extremely great. The German side is very irritable and deeply knows that the risks ahead are increasing day by day. All of this has been clearly demonstrated by Hitler's speech." The "Business News" reported that Hitler is launching a large-scale blackmail campaign, from the North Sea in the north to the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea in the southeast, all within his scope of activity, and yesterday's speech was a part of this campaign. In any case, Germany has no intention of launching an offensive in the next few months. This is already known to the governments of Britain and France. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

American Political Circles Do Not Attach Importance to It

Washington. Führer Hitler delivered a speech today, vehemently criticizing Britain and France, but the American newspapers and general opinions did not attach importance to it. The published speech was very brief and had a small headline, like a secondary news item. The political circles said that this speech was still the well-known "rustic words" and had no novelty. Its intention was to make the German nation continue to live in illusion. It has no meaning to the United States, because the German nation has always been anesthetized by official propaganda. American public opinion can always obtain correct information on the development of the international situation and can not be concealed by anyone. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

Germany Attempts to Induce Italy to Participate in the War

Paris. French political figures are all indifferent to Führer Hitler's speech today. Observers say that there is little value in commenting, saying that the Nazi Party's "achievements," the promotion of German military power, and the criticism of Britain and France's "provocation" are all the clichés commonly used by the Nazi Party and have long been familiar. However, one point to note is that Hitler tried his best to explain to Italy that its position with Britain and France was the same as that of Germany, and at the same time wanted to make it believe that Britain and France wanted to dismember Italy. This is actually the first step in attempting to induce Italy to get involved in the war. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

Fascist Party Sends Congratulations to Germany

Swiss Capital. The German semi-official agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, recently issued a message stating that today is the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The Secretary-General of the Italian National Fascist Party, Muti, recently sent a telegram to Führer Hitler and Party Representative Hess, stating that all Italian Blackshirt members and I unanimously pay tribute to our comrade in arms and respectfully extend our congratulations to Hitler. Hess immediately sent a telegram of thanks in return. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

Italy Believes It Is of Great Significance

Rome. Political figures here recently commented on Führer Hitler's speech on the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, and believed that the section involving Germany's preparation for war and military strength was of great significance. They said that the German authorities have been planning the war plan for several months, and that they will probably launch a large-scale offensive in the future. Therefore, Germany's imposition of a full-scale war on Britain and France is imminent. However, some observers attach importance to the section of the speech that criticizes Britain and France, and say that Hitler did not say a word about the future status of Poland, which shows that "Germany only wants to directly annex its occupied territories." As for Hitler's mentioning of Stalin and the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Italian people did not approve of it because they adopted an anti-Soviet stance that remained unchanged. On the other hand, Hitler's criticism of the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles was welcomed here. In addition, it is natural that the Fascist Party is satisfied with Führer Hitler's statement that Germany and Italy are friendly and have the same interests. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

### English Coastal Area: German Planes Attack Vessels of Various Nationalities; Several More British Ships Sunk; Danish, Norwegian, and Other Ships Also Reported Lost

London: Political circles here recently stated that about twenty German aircraft attacked vessels of various nationalities yesterday in British waters, from the sea off Aberdeen in Scotland in the north to the sea off Kent in the south, a total distance of about 800 kilometers. Enemy aircraft were sighted along the entire line. In addition to dropping bombs on merchant ships, the aircraft strafed them with machine guns. As a result, only one ship was hit and caught fire. British destroyers in various locations immediately took to the air to pursue them, and one German bomber was shot down. The German air force, believing that the British climate was too cold for British destroyers to take to the air to intercept them, attempted to act recklessly. However, the air defense authorities had already taken appropriate measures and prepared for them. Not only were the aircraft belonging to the coastal defense constantly patrolling the coastal area, but also the warships escorting merchant ships, equipped with anti-aircraft guns, assisted domestic aircraft in attacking enemy aircraft, thus achieving some success. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

London: The British ship "Penkerris," with a displacement of 4,450 tons, encountered danger yesterday in the sea north of Scotland and immediately sent out a distress signal. A ship rushed to the rescue, and all the crew members were reported safe. In addition, the Scottish ship "Jillarda," with a displacement of 2,178 tons, also sank in the sea off the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland. The sixteen crew members escaped in a lifeboat, but unfortunately, it capsized a quarter of a mile from the coast, and they tragically perished. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

London: The London company ship "Ashton" (1,487 tons), with a crew of eighteen, is feared lost in the North Sea. The ship was sailing to a port on the northern coast and was expected to arrive three days ago, but there has been no trace of it to date. Two lifeboats with the words "London Ashton" have been washed ashore. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

London: After the London company ship "Jesse Queen" (　　〇 tons) sent out a distress signal yesterday, the British Air Force was very active off the east coast of England. Listeners on the radio heard the "Jesse Queen's" distress signal, stating, "This ship is currently under attack by enemy aircraft; another ship has also been attacked." Several British fighters immediately took off and flew over towns on the east coast. It is reported that several Grimbsy company fishing boats were strafed and bombed by German aircraft yesterday, but the fishing boats were not lost. However, the captain of one fishing boat and a crew member were killed by machine gun fire. A German aircraft descended rapidly outside a town on the east coast and attacked a patrol boat. The boat dodged, so although the German aircraft dropped two bombs, splashing water, the boat was not damaged and continued to advance. After British aircraft chased a large, gray German aircraft out to sea, the German aircraft that had attacked the patrol boat reappeared further south, so they gave chase. The German aircraft then disappeared into the clouds to avoid the British aircraft. Two German bombers flew over a town on the east coast of Scotland yesterday, flying so low that one of them almost collided with the spire of a church. Yesterday, another German aircraft was intercepted by a British fighter. The gunner was hit and unable to return fire, so the aircraft flew into the clouds off the coast of Scotland and escaped. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

The Hague: The "News Report" reported that German aircraft attacked the coast of England yesterday, and the British armed ship "Jillarda" of 2,178 tons was destroyed by bombs and sent out a distress signal. "Umtchenni" sustained minor damage. "Barnclerst" was hit by a bomb near Wick, caught fire on the spot, and many crew members perished. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

Swiss Capital: The German General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that our navy has strengthened its defenses in the waters around Heligoland, increased the number of destroyers on the island of Terschelling, and used various other methods to defend against enemy submarine attacks. Our aircraft were actively operating over the North Sea and the British coast, from the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland to the mouth of the Thames River. In addition to reconnaissance, they sank seven armed merchant ships and damaged several others. Two British picket boats were also sunk. Although British anti-aircraft gunners and fighters were very active at the time, only one of our aircraft was missing. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Danish Capital: The Danish Ministry of Commerce announced that, in view of the frequent accidents in North Sea shipping, Danish sailors must have life jackets before boarding ships to prevent accidents. In addition, the government is currently planning other safety measures. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

The Hague: German aircraft were seen flying over the northeastern and central parts of the Netherlands last night. Dutch air force patrols immediately took to the air to chase them away, and anti-aircraft guns also opened fire. It is reported that the Dutch government is planning to negotiate with Berlin about this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

### German Troops Launch Attack on French Positions West of the Saar River, but Fail

Paris: Regarding the situation on the front lines, semi-official sources recently announced that the snow on the front lines had recently melted, but it froze again yesterday. However, German troops were still dispatched, on a larger scale than normal patrol activities, and used artillery fire to cover their advance on our positions between the Saar River and the Warndt Forest. The scattered villages and numerous houses there are not conducive to patrol activities. Since last October, German troops have repeatedly launched sudden attacks in this area, attempting to seize French outposts, but have not succeeded. The reason for this is that when German troops attacked yesterday, French troops immediately opened fire and repelled them. The two sides' artillery then exchanged fire until nightfall. In addition, the air forces of both sides did not engage due to bad weather. However, one German aircraft flew over northern France and returned to Germany via Belgian airspace. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Paris: General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 296, stating that the vanguard units of our and enemy armies were quite active on the west bank of the Saar River today. The artillery of both sides also exchanged fire throughout the day. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### Continued Progress in British Merchant Shipping

London: An official article published today indicated that the state of British merchant shipping continues to improve, and there has been an upswing in recent weeks. During a period of twenty weeks, the average number of British ships lost each week due to German naval action was 5.2, totaling 23,600 tons, while the number of ships added was 5.4, totaling 24,000 tons. In the week ending January 25, four British ships and fourteen neutral ships were lost, proving the accuracy of Naval Minister Churchill's statement that Germany was venting its anger specifically on neutral ships. The situation of German merchant shipping is very different from that of Britain. When the war broke out, there were 350 German ships sheltering in neutral ports, but 44 of them have already been lost. The Allies have captured 21 of them, totaling 89,000 tons, and the Germans themselves have scuttled 23, totaling 139,236 tons. It is estimated that the German ships that have been captured and scuttled account for 5% of the total, and those still sheltering in neutral ports account for 30% of the total. German propaganda about the losses of the British Navy is inaccurate. The British Admiralty also issued an article today exposing its falsehood, stating that German broadcasts claimed that the British ships "Jersey," "Viscount," and "Mihawk" had all sunk, but in fact, these three ships have not been lost and are still performing their duties. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

### British Army, Navy, and Air Force Growing Stronger Daily; Export Trade Also Gradually Improving; Constant Concern for the Interests of Neutral Countries: Chamberlain Delivers Speech

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain attended a banquet of the "Public Interest Protection Committee" at noon today and delivered a speech, stating that German submarines had not been active for a long time. One submarine attacked a British convoy again yesterday but was eventually destroyed, and most of the crew members were rescued by our side. Our navy has always stood on the front line of defense of the British Isles. In other words, the oceans of the world account for two-thirds of the global area, and British ships are protected by the navy wherever they sail. From the northern coast of Scotland to the coast of Greenland, the sea area spans 1,000 miles. Our navy fleet is constantly patrolling this sea area, and the results are becoming increasingly apparent. The claim by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels that Germany has gained control of the ocean is laughable. German aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked defenseless ships. Although they flee as soon as our anti-aircraft guns or destroyers open fire on them, ships and lives have suffered as a result. However, the strength of the British Navy is sufficient to protect convoys, and more and more neutral ships are taking advantage of our navy's escort arrangements. Our achievements in the naval field are as described above, and we are making great efforts in other areas and have achieved great results, as evidenced by various facts. In terms of the army, our country has more than 1.25 million troops in the mainland, on the French front, in India, in overseas territories, and guarding important transportation routes. Thousands of trucks have been transported to France, and no less than 500,000 tons of various munitions and military supplies have been transported to the front lines. In terms of the air force, the number of workers employed in aircraft factories has increased sevenfold compared to 1935-36, and 67 aviation schools will be established in Canada in the near future, with a total of 40,000 instructors and pilots. More than 80 new or expanded airfields have been built. In addition, in order to ensure the various raw materials needed for our military equipment, a plan has been drawn up to purchase all the wool produced by the various territories of the Empire during the war and for one year after the end of the war. We have also purchased textile raw materials and leather, totaling millions of pounds. The number of cannons of various calibers manufactured has increased at least twofold compared to the past, and some have increased eightfold. The extent of our war effort can be seen from each of the above figures. Regarding commerce, the value of our country's exports did decline significantly at the beginning of the war, which was inevitable, but it has been increasing continuously since last December, and is now higher than the average amount for the three months before the war. Regarding agriculture, the government authorities are currently planning to increase the area of arable land in the country by 2 million acres." Chamberlain then addressed the issue of neutral countries, saying, "We have not questioned the right of neutral countries to participate in the war or avoid getting caught up in the whirlpool. However, regardless of how these countries use their own chosen neutrality, and regardless of their size, strength, or weakness, there is one thing we ask them to consider: in order to exercise our rights as belligerents, we may take certain actions that may cause inconvenience or even loss to these countries. However, we have never sunk neutral ships or sacrificed the lives of neutral people. The enemy, on the other hand, has issued threats to certain neutral countries, which are too weak or too close to Germany to dare to offend them. As a result, Germany blatantly disregards the interests of these countries and does not even consider the most basic rules of humanity. The difference between them and us is vast. It would be wrong to say that we are indifferent to the losses that neutral countries may suffer." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### Turkish Foreign Minister Hopes for Solidarity Among Balkan Entente Countries; Departs for Yugoslavia Yesterday; Hungary Unwilling to Raise Territorial Demands

Istanbul: Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu departed for the capital of Yugoslavia today to attend the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente countries. Government officials, as well as the ambassadors of England, France, Poland, and other Balkan Entente countries, were at the station to see him off. German Ambassador Papen did not attend. Before departing, the Foreign Minister told reporters that he hoped that the representatives of the Balkan Entente countries would be able to reach consensus and reaffirm their ties of solidarity at this important meeting, so as to contribute to the peace of the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas, 31st)

Hungarian Capital: Foreign Minister Csáky gave a speech in the Senate yesterday explaining Hungary's foreign policy. Officials are maintaining absolute silence regarding the content of the speech. Political circles recently explained that, with the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan countries about to open, Hungary has not abandoned its territorial demands, but it is unwilling to raise them in the current situation. Therefore, it prefers to keep the content of the Foreign Minister's speech secret for the time being. Hungary's goal is peace, as can be seen from this action. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### German-Southern Economic Committee to Meet Early

Paris: According to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the German-Southern Economic Committee, originally scheduled to convene in April or May, is now scheduled to meet in February. According to official explanations, the reason for holding the meeting early is that, after Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia implemented customs unification, there is a need to adjust the commercial relations between Germany and the southern countries. It is generally believed that the convening of this meeting is at the insistence of Germany, and it will be related to the German offensive that has begun in southeastern Europe. A new German financial delegation has arrived in the capital of Yugoslavia to negotiate matters related to the pre-war Serbian loan. The German goal seems to be to increase the percentage of repayment that the Southern country agreed to in December of last year. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Southern Country Capital: The government of Yugoslavia recently ordered a batch of goods from Italy, especially cotton yarn. It has now dispatched a delegation to Rome tomorrow to discuss the delivery of this order. In addition, Pielkmann, an advisor to the German Ministry of Economy, has been sent here and met with Southern Country Commerce Minister Andres today. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### Hungary and Greece Establish Aviation Agreement

Hungarian Capital: Regarding the opening of air routes between Hungary and Greece, it was recently announced by officials that the two countries have reached an agreement, stipulating that the airmail planes of both parties may fly over each other's territory.

He said that the scope of discussion at the meeting was very broad, but he declined to specify the details. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Washington: British Ambassador Lothian met with U.S. Secretary of State Hull today to discuss the British restrictions on American shipping. Lothian then told reporters that he and Hull discussed the possibility of British ships being exempt from being escorted into British-controlled ports within the combat zone designated by U.S. legislation. However, this matter is still under discussion, and the establishment of controlled ports in Canada is also being considered. A large controlled port will be established in the city of Shediac in New Brunswick. He and Hull discussed all points in a very friendly atmosphere for 35 minutes. He did not submit a reply to the U.S. note to Britain. The British response to this note has not yet been made. It is reported that Lothian and Hull discussed almost all aspects of recent British-American relations. Hull then stated when receiving reporters that he did exchange general opinions and information with the British ambassador, which was an attempt to clarify the situation and seek solutions. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Soviet Planes Continue to Bombard Indiscriminately; 3,000 Bombs Dropped in the Past Week

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no important developments on the front lines before the 30th. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy reserves and military targets, with great success. (TASS dispatch, 31st)

Finnish Capital: Last night, this city continued to receive news from southern Finland about the Soviet bombing raids on Sundays. The coastal areas from Vyborg in the east to Turku in the west were all devastated by the bombings. Since Finland was attacked by air, Sundays have been the most tragic. Soviet aircraft bombing seems to spare nothing. In addition to towns and villages, even isolated farms and farmhouses have been cruelly attacked. From January 21 to 27, about 3,000 bombs fell on Finland. Two hospitals were also targeted for bombing. It is reported that 1,250 Soviet soldiers were killed last Sunday. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Finnish Capital: According to the Reuters correspondent accompanying the headquarters of the Finnish army in the central and northeastern fronts, the Finnish army is now fiercely resisting 20,000 Soviet troops in the fighting north of Kemijärvi. People here believe that this is the most important battle in the region since the Finnish victory at Suomussalmi. Kemijärvi is south of Suomussalmi, 30 miles from the Soviet border. At the same time, Soviet troops are continuing to launch fierce attacks on the front lines north of Lake Ladoga. According to military authorities, the soldiers currently used by the Soviet Union in this area are the most elite troops, fully equipped and armed. The Reuters visitor also said that there is also fierce fighting in the Lasti area of central Finland. According to a statement issued by General Schultz, leader of the Finnish Civilian Air Defense Office, the Soviet Air Force has dropped more than 20,000 bombs in Finland to date, with 643 air raids, resulting in 357 deaths, 330 serious injuries, and 585 minor injuries. The Finnish side shot down 300 Soviet aircraft, and at least 800 air force personnel were killed or captured. There have been about 24 incidents of hospitals and churches being bombed.

### Yong Sheng Wheel Detained Case: Britain Lodges Representation to Japan; Dispatch Purely of an Inquiring Nature; Diplomatic Protest May Proceed to Tokyo

The British ship Yong Sheng of Jardine Matheson & Co. was suddenly boarded and searched by the Japanese Navy in Fujian waters last Tuesday, detained for fifteen hours, and then released. The ship arrived in Shanghai on the 26th. Captain Baden has reported the details to the company, the British Consulate, and the naval authorities.

Dispatch of an Inquiring Nature

It is understood that the British naval authorities in Shanghai have submitted a dispatch to the Japanese side yesterday regarding the search. The content has not been officially released, but it is heard that its nature is to inquire with the Japanese side about the reason for the ship's detention for fifteen hours. According to news from the British Embassy, the official intention is that the British Navy may not lodge a major diplomatic protest regarding the detention of the Yong Sheng, or may transfer the case to Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador in Tokyo, for handling.

Detention Possibly a Retaliatory Measure

As for the reason why the Yong Sheng was detained, it is generally believed that the Japanese side is implementing retaliatory measures due to the Asama Maru incident. When the Japanese military boarded the Yong Sheng, they asked Captain Baden about the Asama Maru. According to other sources, the dispatch sent by the British Navy to the Japanese side yesterday was purely of a specialized nature. As for how the Japanese side will handle this, nothing was heard as of last night.

All German passengers on board were

Taken into a Room

Inside, the British officer went to meet with the captain of the Asama Maru, and after a while, he returned to address the Germans who were to be taken to the British ship, and allowed them to return to the cabin to carry their luggage. Armed British soldiers also helped the captured Germans carry out their personal items, so no luggage was left on board. Among the German sailors who were taken out, there was a captain who had previously told people, "During the World War, he

Had Been Detained

### Fire on Julu Road

At about 9:00 PM on the 26th of last month, a silversmith's shop on the back building of No. 13, Lane 189, Julu Road, in the French Concession caught fire, endangering the left and right neighbors. At that time, Ms. Yu Ling, the second landlord of the house, and the silversmith Han Zhuqing were unable to escape and died in the fire. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, the two bodies were dug out and taken to the autopsy station. The police reported to the Public Procurator of the Second Special Court to verify that Yu Ling's husband, Yu Gaosheng, had received the body for burial. Since Han's body had no family members to the case, the charity organization took care of the burial on his behalf and waited for the family to recognize it. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that the body of Yu Ling, which was dug out after the incident at that time, was actually an apprentice of the dead Han Zhuqing, whose name is unknown. Because the body was burned, it was impossible to identify it. The body of Yu Ling was not dug out until yesterday morning, and the whole body was still intact. The family reported to the police station and sent the body to the autopsy station for verification. After reporting to the Second Special Court to send personnel to inspect it today, the family will coffin it.

### Ningbo is Extremely Peaceful: Telegrams to Shanghai from Ning Shao Yesterday; Market Rumors Are Not Credible

Since the Japanese army crossed the Qiantang River by stealth and invaded Xiaoshao, the Chinese army has dispatched a large army to block it. Now the Japanese army that landed is unsustainable and will soon be wiped out. However, yesterday the market rumored again that the Japanese army had landed in Longshan, eastern Zhejiang, and Ningbo was bombed. A New Voice reporter confirmed with relevant parties that it was not true. Yesterday, foreign ships anchored outside the Zhenhai Estuary telegraphed to Shanghai to report the itinerary of each ship. The landing of the Japanese army in Longshan and the bombing of Ningbo were not mentioned, which proves that the rumors are not true. At the same time, the telegram of a certain Italian ship contained the four words "Ningbo is Peaceful." Telegrams from Shaoxing, Yuyao, Ningbo, Zhenhai, and other places yesterday reported that the situation was peaceful. Very few people in the urban area have moved to the countryside, and because the Lunar New Year is approaching, the commercial market is still very prosperous, but the market is held at night. As for the outside world, there is even a saying that the Japanese army has arrived in Ningbo. According to a report from the Datong News Agency to the relevant parties, it is purely unfounded rumors. The Ningbo Tongxiang Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday, which briefly stated, "The Xiaoshan war is getting better and better, and the situation in Ningbo is more peaceful than usual." From this, it is enough to infer that the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is also very smooth. The Moufu Wheel is scheduled to enter the port this morning and sail to Zhenhai on the second day. The Baoli is scheduled to leave Zhen and sail to Shanghai on the same day. However, in addition to passengers, the cargo has decreased sharply. Deping and Dabu have both safely arrived in Zhenhai.

The steel bar industry and rice industry associations in this city first advocated and implemented it and donated money one after another, the number of which is huge. It is heard that the colleagues of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, in view of the suffering of the child refugees, specially saved 300 yuan for New Year's Eve dinner and sent it to the academy in a letter yesterday.

The Shanghai Steel Bar Old Iron Industry Association issued a notice to members yesterday to initiate the saving of New Year's expenses and transfer them to help the "Refugee Children's Educational Academy" to educate and nurture the expenses of child refugees. Thanks to the support of merchants from the Han口铁商德昌祥申莊 and other industries, they first donated 500 yuan to this association to be forwarded to the educational academy. Then, the merchants donated 551 yuan to repay the food expenses of the child refugees.

### Taking Advantage of the Lunar New Year: Rice Merchants Engage in Under-the-Table Transactions; Market Management Committee Strictly Cracks Down; Rice Prices Should Be Controlled Based on Inventory

The price of rice in the Shanghai bean and rice market has been subject to price limits stipulated by the concession authorities. Speculation and manipulation are prohibited. At the same time, various industries have formed a People's Food Regulation Association to collectively order foreign rice. A Flat Price Committee has been established to solicit donations and manage flat price sales. As a result, the price of rice in the market has stabilized. However, the current market price of rice, especially medium and lower grades, has reached the limit price, and under-the-table transactions have occurred. The highest price for white rice in the unofficial market has risen to around 44 yuan per day, and sales are restricted to those who are well-acquainted. This is actually a deliberate manipulation for profit by general speculators, taking advantage of the period of limited arrivals during the Lunar New Year. It is reported that the Market Management Committee has strictly cracked down. The Shanghai market has a very abundant stock of rice, and foreign rice is arriving continuously, so there is no reason for panic. Based on the inventory, there is no reason for such a sharp rise in prices. Yesterday, the "Ewo Fook Sang" vessel arrived with 4,049 bags of tribute rice, and the "Taikoo Suiyang" vessel arrived with 10,447 bags of tribute rice, both diverted from Hong Kong. The "Yuezhou" vessel also delivered 6,478 bags the day before yesterday.

### Chiang Ching-kuo: Currently Residing in Ji'an

The English "Great American Evening Post" states: Today (29th), the telecommunication reports that where General Chiang Kai-shek's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, is located is a question mark, but this is inaccurate. Since September 1937, Chiang Ching-kuo has been assigned to work in the security team of the Fourth District (southwestern) of Jiangxi, and until recently, he was appointed as the administrative inspector and security commander of the district. He usually stays in the command headquarters near Ji'an. However, his mother recently died during a Japanese air raid, and a funeral was held five weeks ago. Chiang Ching-kuo left the command headquarters to go to Guling Fenghua to attend the funeral. His Soviet-born wife and young son also went with him. Chiang Ching-kuo once studied in the Soviet Union. When he worked in Jiangxi, he helped train new soldiers and shared meals and accommodation with them, which won him the hearts of the people.

### A Bold Thief Waited in the Victim's Home and Forced Him to Sign a Check for Cash; He Escaped with Stolen Cash and Took the Victim's Photo for Extortion; A Dismissed Apprentice Was Suspected and Arrested

The Meifeng Paint Store at No. 17, Lane 19, Qinghai Road, is owned by Lin Zhiyuan, and his residence is also in the store. At around 9:00 AM on January 29th, six robbers suddenly entered through the back door. Three of the robbers held pistols and monitored everyone in the room. They searched Lin and found a bunch of keys, then opened the drawers of the writing office and took out two checkbooks, forcing Lin Zhiyuan to sign two checks, one for 2,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank and one for 3,000 yuan from Shanghai Bank, and stamp them. One robber went out to cash them. The remaining robbers continued to rob in the room. Before long, the robber who went out suddenly reported by phone that the two checks could not be cashed because the seal did not match. The robbers then forced Lin to issue another check for 2,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank, along with 3,000 yuan in legal tender and 350 US dollars that had been stolen. They carried the stolen goods and

left through the door. Before escaping, they also took a photo of Lin for extortion, saying that if he reported it to the police, he would be killed. The robbery lasted for two hours. Lin did not dare to speak out after the robbers left. It was not until the day before yesterday that he reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detective Sun Wenxi went to investigate. Hu Zhiming (18 years old), a Ningbo native who had recently been dismissed as an apprentice from the store, was suspected of having informed the robbers. Hu was arrested at Room 55, Donghua Hotel, No. 30, Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested detention. Judge Xiao ordered Hu Zhiming to be detained until February 16th for further questioning.

### Chen Zhanxiong's Case: Sentence Reduced on Appeal

Chen Zhanxiong, a native of Fenghua, the owner of Anle Palace Dance Hall Restaurant and the manager of Yiwentai Dance Hall on Yuyuan Road, was previously arrested by the French police for smoking opium. He was sentenced to six months in prison by the Second Special District Court, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan a day. While being held in the detention center to detoxify his opium addiction, Chen spent 150 yuan to bribe guards Jiang Nai, Tu Gang, Luo Zhiyi, and fellow prisoners Tao Yongchang, Qin Jiaqi, and Chen Jusheng, asking them to buy smuggled opium, tea, and food. This was discovered by the prison authorities, and evidence was seized. Chen and the above-mentioned individuals were sent to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. The two guards, Jiang and Tu, felt guilty and afraid of punishment and abandoned their posts and escaped. An arrest warrant was issued. After the prosecutor concluded the investigation of Chen Zhanxiong and others, he filed a public prosecution on charges of bribery and dereliction of duty. Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the trial and sentenced Chen Zhanxiong to eight months in prison for bribery and a fine of 500 yuan. Luo Zhiyi was sentenced to three years in prison. Tao Yongchang and Chen Jusheng were each sentenced to four months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan a day. Qin Jiaqi was sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan a day. Chen, Luo, Chen, and Qin were dissatisfied with the judgment and hired lawyers Jiang Ping and Ge Zhiqin to appeal to the High Court. The collegial panel concluded the trial and scheduled a date for the verdict. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Acting Judge Chen Daqi, accompanied by Judges Huang and Gu, opened the court to pronounce the verdict. Luo Zhiyi's sentence was changed to one year and three months in prison, with one year of deprivation of civil rights. Chen Zhanxiong's sentence was changed to three months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan a day. Chen Jusheng was acquitted. Qin Jiaqi's appeal was rejected.

### Adultery: Each Sentenced to Four Months in Prison

Xu Fulong, a native of Huaian, 38 years old this year, lives at No. 47, Boxiang Village, Avenue du Père Hérode, French Concession. He runs a restaurant for a living. He married Jiang (37 years old, nicknamed Thirteen Points, also known as Three Madmen), a native of Yancheng, for ten and four years. However, Xu likes female beauty and has another lover outside. Ms. Jiang sleeps alone and inevitably enters and exits entertainment venues, leading to her acquaintance with Xu Haishan (42 years old this year, resident of No. 462, Xujiahui Road, owner of a truck company), a fellow villager. She cohabits in the truck company. However, Xu Haishan is also a married man. In order to win Ms. Jiang's favor, he specially sent his original wife, Yang, to the Nan City Nine Mou Di Timber Industry Association refugee shelter, subsidizing her with three yuan a month for food. However, good times do not last long. Recently, Xu Haishan laid off a driver in the truck company. The driver held a grudge and secretly reported the adultery between the two to Ms. Jiang's husband, Xu Fulong, who in turn reported it to the French police. On the 29th of last month, detectives were sent to No. 462, Xujiahui Road, to arrest them both and take them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial. Judge Wu presided over the trial. The police prosecuted them for adultery. The court ruled that Xu Haishan, having a spouse, committed adultery with another person, and Xu Jiang, having a spouse, committed adultery with another person, and sentenced them to four months in prison each. The attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### International Relief Lottery: Not Yet Approved for Issuance; Police Confiscate and Destroy All Copies

After the national government stopped issuing aviation lotteries, a French charity lottery took its place. Recently, someone organized an International Relief Lottery Company on the second floor of Jianghai Bank, No. 109 Ningbo Road, intending to issue an International Relief Lottery in the name of commercial interests. However, this organization has not registered with the Italian Consulate and has not obtained permission from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, so it is difficult to approve its issuance according to law. After investigation, police detectives went to the International Relief Lottery Company on the second floor of Jianghai Bank, No. 109 Ningbo Road, the Huada Printing Office (located at No. 50, Lane 90, Maigen Road), which printed the lottery, and the Dagong Foreign Firm, No. 731 Nanjing Road, and the Tianfulai Lottery Store on Nanjing Road, etc. to search. They confiscated 71,097 printed International Relief Lottery tickets, 150,000 misprinted lottery tickets, 200 wooden seals, 485 advertising papers, and many other printed materials and advertisements, which were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Ru Baoyi applied to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for an appropriate disposition of the confiscated items and explained the facts. Criminal Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered that all confiscated items be destroyed by the police.

### Since the Beginning of Winter, the Climate Has Been Extremely Cold; The Number of Beggars Who Have Frozen to Death Exceeds 2,000; The Sight of Corpses Lying on the Streets is Unbearable; We Urgently Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Funds for Relief

Since the beginning of winter in this city, the weather has been extremely cold. The number of beggars and refugees who have frozen to death on the roads of the British and French concessions is

large. Recently, after two more snowfalls, the temperature has dropped sharply, and the number of frozen bodies on the streets has increased even more. The sight of corpses lying on the roadside is unbearable. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguan News inquired with Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall. It was reported that 30 people froze to death in the British Concession yesterday, 17 more than the day before. There were 27 adults in the French Concession, 8 more than the day before, and 40 children, 10 more than the day before. In December, the British Concession collected 406 exposed corpses, and in January, 461. The French Concession collected about 500 large and small exposed corpses in December and about 600 in January. In total, 906 people froze to death in December and 1,100 in January. Therefore, since the beginning of winter, the number of corpses lying on the streets in this city has reached about 2,000. Although some of them died of illness, the majority died of freezing due to the extremely cold weather. The tragic situation is rare in recent years. At a time when the cold wave has not yet receded and the north wind is strong, we sincerely hope that all enthusiastic people will donate generously or save on New Year's expenses to help the beggars on the streets. This would be a great act of merit.

### Letter

To the editor,

Regarding the dispute between myself and You Huai concerning a promissory note, when I was detained at the Lukouchiwan Police Station on December 22nd of last year, I am grateful that Attorney Xu Wufang, entrusted by a friend, personally came to the police station to investigate and assist in negotiations. This was all due to Attorney Xu's warm-heartedness and traditional values. However, upon reading today's news column in the Shen Bao, the statement "Xu commissioned Attorney Xu Wufang to be present and forced Xu to sign a settlement" suggests that the coercion to sign the promissory note came from Attorney Xu rather than You Huai. This is unclear and confuses the facts. Therefore, I specifically request that your editor publish a correction in the "Letters" column.

Sincerely,

The Editor, News Column, Shen Bao Newspaper

January 31st

Educational News

### 1939 Public Works Department Education Department Report: Three School Buildings Sold Due to Circumstances

The 1939 Education Department report of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department is as follows:

At the beginning of the war, all school buildings established by the Bureau were for emergency purposes. Therefore, each school had to find temporary housing to continue classes. In the previous year, except for four school buildings that had been returned to the Bureau, there were still as many as twelve schools attending classes in temporary school buildings. Last year, no school buildings were returned to the Bureau. The three school buildings that were previously converted into Public Works Department hospitals were not recovered as hoped. The difficulty of reopening the school buildings north of the Suzhou Creek has not been overcome. Most of the temporary school buildings for each school are not very suitable. If this continues for a long time, it will be inappropriate. Three school buildings (the Public School for Western Children, the Hanbury School, and the Public School for Chinese Children) have been sold due to circumstances. Therefore, it is concerning that these schools must continue to teach in temporary school buildings indefinitely.

Since the school affairs of each school are carried out under the above-mentioned circumstances, it is impossible to maintain the past standards in any aspect. Although the staff of each school can be diligent and persevering, the obstacles caused by the disorder of the education system cannot be completely eliminated. Except for those who have returned to their original school buildings, the rest are restricted in terms of curriculum scope and content due to narrow rooms and incomplete equipment.

In the autumn semester of last year, a total of 7,607 students were registered in 16 day schools, of which 1,284 were foreign students and 6,323 were Chinese students. Among the Chinese students, 2,568 received secondary education and 3,755 received primary education. There is not much difference in the number of people compared with the previous year, with only a difference of fourteen people.

The dormitories of the Public School for Western Boys and Girls and the Hanbury School are still renting two houses near Jessfield Road, accommodating 20 boarding boys and 24 girls.

One new development last year is worth mentioning: a fourth night school was added, specializing in young workers. These people have not received basic education, so the courses taught are quite simple. Each night school is affiliated to the Public Works Department Elementary School. As of the end of the year, the total number of students was 1,323.

A comparison table of the number of students in each school of the Public Works Department is listed below, from 1936 to 1939 (autumn semester).

(Tuition and Scholarships) In September of last year, the Bureau, in view of the large increase in expenses required by the above-mentioned schools, considered the issue of increasing tuition fees. It was found that the total education expenses required for the whole year exceeded the amount listed in the budget by 340,000 yuan. If the situation remains unchanged, the expenditure of each Western school in 1940 is estimated to increase by about 43.7% compared with 1938, and the expenditure of each Chinese school will increase by 38.5%. Western schools spend more, so the increased tuition should also be more. It was resolved that each Western school would increase tuition by 25% from November 1st of last year, and each Chinese school would increase tuition by 15% from the spring of this year. The above surcharges are estimated to generate 100,000 yuan per year.

Last year, seven outstanding students in Chinese middle schools obtained scholarships. Together with the 14 freshmen who obtained scholarships for excellent results in the entrance examination held in June, a total of 21 people were invited to waive all tuition and book fees. In addition, there were 31 old students who had won scholarships in the previous year, each of which was extended for one year. As for students in Western schools, depending on their academic performance and family financial situation, four students were exempted from paying all or part of their tuition.

(Schools Receiving Subsidies) Last year, a total of 178 private Chinese schools applied for subsidies, including 35 new schools and 143 old schools. Their applications were reviewed separately by a special sub-committee of the Education Committee. As a result, 147 schools were approved, but with one condition: the facilities of each school must comply with the regulations of each department of the Bureau. A total of 220,000 yuan was approved for distribution in subsidies. The subsidies of 16 schools were cancelled for various reasons.

A total of 190,000 yuan was issued as subsidies to foreign schools, of which 139,000 yuan was allocated to the nine Japanese schools run by the Japanese Residents Association.

A comparison of the amount of subsidies received by each private school is as follows (1931 to 1939):

### The Revival of Education in Western Zhejiang (3)

The current situation of secondary education in Western Zhejiang is roughly as described above. As for primary school education, each county has also shown a thriving phenomenon. In Anji County, from March to July of the 28th year, in these short four months, 42 primary schools have been restored, with a total of 2,745 students. Xiaofeng currently has five county-run central primary schools, 59 township and private primary schools, 16 short-term primary schools, and three mobile primary schools, with a total of more than 4,000 students. Lin'an currently has four complete primary schools, 103 junior primary schools, nine county-run short-term primary schools, and two mobile schools, with a total of 5,945 students. The above three counties have completely restored the number of schools before the war.

Although the entire territory of Hang County has fallen, it has also followed the advancement of politics and established 19 primary schools in the occupied areas. At the same time, private primary schools in towns such as Tanglou Sandun have come to request registration. Although most of the territory of Yuhang County has already fallen, and what remains are only some poor and remote mountain villages, 38 primary schools have been established this semester, and half of them are located under the sphere of influence of the Japanese. The schools established in the occupied areas of the two counties, because the Japanese often come to harass them, use the shape of private schools to cover up the promotion of wartime education, which is indeed a painstaking effort. After the town of Si'an in Changxing was seized by the Japanese twice, all the houses were burned down. However, with the prosperity of the market and the increase in population after the recovery, two complete primary schools and two junior primary schools have been established under the leadership of District Chief Yan. The number of students has not decreased compared with before the war. It has been widely rumored in recent months that the Japanese intend to invade Si'an, and the Si'an Central Primary School is still safely building new school buildings for the new year, re-establishing the wartime education center in the rubble of broken walls and ruins.

As for other counties in Western Zhejiang, because reporters encountered searches when entering and leaving the war zone, there are no detailed statistics, and the same report cannot be made to readers. However, with the progress of the military and the advancement of politics in Western Zhejiang during the second phase of the War of Resistance, it will definitely be able to quickly restore the education cause in the same way and embark on the road to revival.

The Impact of Male and Female Sexual Life on Health

Men who read this article are guaranteed a long, healthy and peaceful life. Endocrine fluid in the gonads is indeed the source of life for men.

The matter of male and female sexual behavior was once deeply taboo in feudal society. Especially so-called "moralistic gentlemen" considered discussions of male and female issues simply heretical. As a result, when young men and women had to solve sexual problems, they were like blind men riding blind horses - how dangerous!

Sex is a human instinct, as important as diet. Therefore, in civilized society, the examination of knowledge of sexuality has long been increasingly refined and renewed daily. In fact, it is of great and huge benefit to mankind. The world does not know how many men and women are immersed in the sea of suffering, and have therefore been saved!

Humans cannot be supermen, so abstinence is extremely difficult! And the harms of abstinence are generated by righteousness. However, indulgence is by no means appropriate. Researchers of animal scientists want to know more. In the animal world, many animals actually die due to not being able to have intercourse, but there are also those who die due to excessive intercourse! If people cannot control their sexual impulses and lead an appropriate and happy sexual life, its harms are also beyond description. We only need to see men who committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage, indulgence, and debauchery in their early years... those who have lost endocrine fluid in their gonads will suffer from impotence, incomplete development, back pain, neurasthenia, and brain weakness. Thus, even if there are charming wives and concubines, they cannot lead a happy sexual life. How can this not make wives hate them? From this, the couple turns against each other, performing jealousy, elopement, divorce, suicide and other domestic scandals and tragedies - how can it be counted! Or, in fact, health is lost as a result, life becomes negative, affecting the future of schooling and careers, or in fact, it leads to premature aging and short life!

The above-mentioned pathological conditions caused by gonad loss, due to the progress of new medicine, have the most correct and effective treatment, which is the active taking of "Gonadotrophic Hormone", a healthy reproductive gland of animals. This therapy has been recognized by world-renowned doctors, and no less than several million men have been cured. It is true that this agent is expensive in materials, finely supervised, mild in nature, and has great replenishment power. It is any similar. What any similar preparations cannot match. After taking it, it will produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood in one day and night. Continuous taking will further promote development and nourish the nerves, and it will definitely cure various diseases in a short period of time. Middle-aged and elderly people often take it to prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Schmidt's Semen Consolidating Tablets" (sold at major pharmacies such as Sino-Foreign Five Continents, Sino-English Huamei, etc., and the Western Music Department of Wing On Company, with an actual price of two yuan per bottle) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, which will be effective faster!

### The Misfortune of Atrophied Breasts and How to Save Them

— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

A healthy and beautiful woman with rich feelings and a graceful figure not only makes men's hearts flutter and love her endlessly. Even her women look at her because their own development cannot be perfect. They see that other people's bodies are so flexible, their breasts are so towering, and their hips are so plump, and they will feel ashamed of themselves and sigh in admiration. It is not only that, but also healthy and beautiful women with towering breasts and plump hips. Due to the health of the gonads and ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, their temperament is also very gentle, their thoughts are sharp, their muscles are white and tender, and their cheeks are even like being slightly drunk with wine, revealing a charming red. If Ruis is on this pretty face with a pair of curved eyebrows like autumn water, bright eyes, and light dimples, how charming and lovely it is. These women are not only fragrant, sweet, respected, and pursued, but even in the private life between husband and wife, both parties are as close as glue, with particularly strong feelings, forming a happy family and giving birth to smart children. Their happiness will be immeasurable!

But then again. If you have committed chest binding, self-pleasure, vaginal discharge, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, multiple births, abortions, and evil spirits over the years, serious illnesses and other damages in the past, so that the gonads and ovarian functions have been ravaged, affecting metabolism. Then the breasts will not have good development, showing the ugly appearance of atrophy and flatness. Beauty is lost and there are no curves. This kind of woman not only cannot occupy a place in the social arena and be welcomed, but even in the family, she is often disliked by men. Her fate will be very tragic! However, even with such misfortunes today, there is no need to be discouraged, because science is omnipotent. There is now a gonadotropic ovarian endocrine preparation for women called "Gonadotrophic Hormone" that can save them. The ingredients of this agent are ovary hormones extracted from strong animals, and mixed with minerals and plant phosphorus, calcium, iron, vitamins, etc. under scientific management and precision preparation. Therefore, the medicine is very peaceful and the efficacy is very great. If you take it during this winter tonic, it can exert a unique effect. Long-term use can not only regulate menstruation and seed, blacken hair and beautify the face, but also make the atrophied breasts rise up, increasing health and beauty.

### Spermatorrhea is a Waste of Life

— Sex Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui

A bowl of porridge, a grain of rice, one should think of where it comes from with difficulty; half a thread of silk, one should always remember the difficulty of obtaining materials; material things, even, should not be wasted, let alone our most sacred and precious life! Our body is like a machine. The machine must be lubricated with oil, and then the functions of each part can be agile. What the functions of our body depend on for lubrication is the endocrine fluid (semen) in the gonads. This type of endocrine gland is a ductless gland, including the pituitary gland, pineal gland, adrenal gland, testicular gland, and many others, which can directly seep into the blood, irrigate the whole body through blood circulation, and nourish the brain, spinal cord, and nerves of the sexual organs, so as to generate various different and complementary functional skills. Therefore, the brain can think, the hands can work, the feet can walk... thus becoming people who are skillful and the spirit of all things. As for the skin, bones, flesh, and blood... these are just like various parts in a machine! Therefore, science can create robots, but cannot create living people. This is where the subtle effect of the endocrine fluid of the gonads and the nerves lies; from this, it can also be known that the endocrine fluid of the gonads is indeed as precious as the source of life. To make it healthy and abundant, then that person must be smart and lively, and have a promising future. If one does not know how to cherish oneself, commits masturbation, indulges in lust, is licentious, or is worried and overworked, thereby damaging the endocrine function of the gonads and loosening the sperm gate, then a terrible case of spermatorrhea will surely erupt. The harm of spermatorrhea is equivalent to wasting life! If treatment is delayed and neglected, then symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, and incomplete development will be endless. In this way, the smart will become stupid; the lively will become rigid; the brave will become cowardly. How countless are those in this world whose youth is thus delayed, lose the happiness of life, or even die young?!

Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. If one can actively take the special medicine "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Pills", one will surely receive the effect of curing the disease as soon as the medicine is taken. This has long been recognized by world-renowned doctors. This medicine truly has the special effects of consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves, and after taking it, one can fall asleep and stop spermatorrhea on the same night. However, for those whose spermatorrhea already has the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the strong animal gonad preparation "Reproduction Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Continuous use will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time. One will become even healthier. Patients who can personally come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment can be even more guaranteed a cure.

Commercial News

### Food Grains and National Rice are All Sold at Limited Prices and Exceed Them, Causing Increasing Panic Among the People

Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were few due to the approaching end of the major settlement period. There was very little shipped out of Hongkou, and the activities of local stores were also not numerous. However, the sellers' minds were still firm, and the asking prices in the morning were still high, with prices continuing to rise. Currently, there is no proper market for rice prices. Thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice are all sold at 40 yuan, which can still be called a limited price. As a result, various under-the-table deals have emerged, and in reality, they have all exceeded the limited price by several yuan. The rice sold by rice shops at 40 yuan per day is mostly extremely poor quality. The prices of Baiyuan rice, etc., have not fluctuated much. Liyang goods are as high as 40 yuan, and the next best, Tokyo Baiyuan, is 37 yuan and 7 jiao. There is no market for Lu Yangjian.

Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw customers hoarding two warehouses, and prices rose step by step. The selling prices of various godowns were raised again by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. Hoarders both inside and outside the industry were particularly active. In addition to spot goods, repurchase transactions were particularly lively. However, new transactions continued to be made, and new large batches were also agreed upon. Yesterday's statistics showed that Chinese and foreign merchants such as Jianyuan, Dafo, and Heyi sold a total of 3,000 tons of Siamese No. 2 to grain merchants at a price of 49 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen; 1,500 tons of Mili rice at a price of 44 yuan and 9 jiao; 1,500 tons of Saigon No. 2 at a price of 49 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen; 600 tons of small squeezed rice for repurchase at a price of 48 yuan; 200 tons of broken Saigon rice at a price of 38 yuan; Saigon No. 1 specially opened at 41 yuan and 5 jiao, with a general market price of 41 yuan and 2 jiao; Saigon No. 2 at 40 yuan and 3 jiao, with a general market price of 40 yuan; fire-squeezed rice at 40 yuan and 39 yuan and 8 jiao; large-squeezed rice at 37 yuan and 5 jiao, with a general market price of 37 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen; Tokyo Jianjian rice was high at 38 yuan, and the next best was 36 yuan and 7 jiao; rice husks were at 32 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen. The closing prices were all similar to the previous day's market.

Foreign rice continued to arrive, with more than 14,000 bags arriving. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng Wheel brought 4,049 bags from Hong Kong and imported them yesterday morning, unloading them at the Roosevelt Warehouse. Swire Group's Suiyang Wheel also loaded 10,447 bags from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai at around 2 PM yesterday, docking at the Bund in the French Concession and scheduled to open its hatches and unload today.

### Repurchased Flour Continues to be Incredibly Expensive, with Green Cannon Car Prices Reaching 12 Yuan and 5 Fen

Flour is becoming more and more expensive, without end. Although the No. 2 flour factory's market is holding at the original price of 10 yuan, the supply is limited, and the restrictions are becoming more and more severe. Those in need cannot buy any goods and have no choice but to quench their thirst with poison, resorting to repurchased goods. The minds of general holders of goods are becoming increasingly upward, rising another 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day. The unit price of Green Cannon Car warehouse receipts reached a peak of 12 yuan and 5 fen. The prices of Red and Blue Car warehouse receipts also rose from 11 yuan and 4 jiao to 11 yuan and 5 jiao. The speed of the price increases is truly astonishing. Currently, the repurchased goods on the market are limited, selling less and less, and many are unwilling to lightly dispose of them as the market changes. Therefore, the market is becoming increasingly firm. The total amount of flour sold on this street was less than 5,000 bags, and the trading volume of repurchased goods was only 2,000 to 3,000 bags. A total of 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

Yesterday's wheat trading was quite quiet. Currently, the sources are blocked, and the inventory is thin. The minds of those hoarding for the year are firm, and they all plan to sell again at the red opening of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, there were very few sales on the market, and a closing scene has already emerged. Except for a small number directly allocated to factories, Fuxin Factory handled 300 bags of Suzhou wheat at a price of 20 yuan. There were no other transactions heard of.

Among the miscellaneous grains exports, today there are 2,590 bags of beans, 1,800 bags of raw peanuts, and 1,000 pieces of bean cake, all shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities, Domestic Debt Market, No Significant Fluctuations, Afternoon Ex-Dividend Calculation, Foreign Stocks See New High Prices Again

Yesterday's securities gray market was conducted with interest included in the morning and ex-dividend in the afternoon, so the actual prices in both markets did not fluctuate significantly compared to the previous day. Buyers were more enthusiastic in the morning, while sellers were slightly more numerous in the afternoon, so the strength of the bulls was slightly weaker, but the underlying trend was still bullish. Although it is approaching the Lunar New Year, there is still more cash than goods on the market. There are not many days left in the year, and there are quite a few people who are holding inventory over the New Year. Although there is also a need for funds, it doesn't matter much because the money market is loose. Therefore, there will be no significant impact even if there is a small downturn in the future. The market price was high first and then low in the morning with interest included. The market price was calculated ex-dividend in the afternoon, which is also quite equivalent if the current value of the interest coupon is added. There were still more sellers in Lianhe, followed by Yuanfeng and Yueheng. There were more buyers in Runli, Lianyi, and Xinfu, followed by Wanchun, Yongkang, and No. 16. As a result, the market price was not listed as up or down due to the ex-dividend new trading, only the high and low price table is listed below. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan.

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 21 yuan.

The stock market of various industrial companies is still strong, and several stocks have seen new high prices again. Some of the most sought-after stocks are being taken profit from. There are buyers for Yesong shares at 280 yuan, returning to the market price on Monday of last week when it issued a dividend of 20 yuan, which can be said to be a unique dynamic. The shares of various trust companies are trending very steadily. Rubber shares are also firm because foreign spot prices have risen. Inglewood shares advanced to 46 yuan and 75 fen. The trend of Huizhong Bank shares is difficult to grasp. The price surged very quickly at the opening, soaring to 3 yuan and 6 jiao, and then a countertrend suddenly rose, falling back 6 jiao and closing at 3 yuan and 1 jiao.

London, 30th dispatch, the listed market prices of various British Far East company stocks today, the market is calm, and the market prices have generally not changed.

London, 30th, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt today, still reported steady, there was no change in the bonds across the board.

### Yarn Sales are Not Weak, the Yarn Market Continues to Rise

The yarn market continues to sell and continues to rise. This is because actual sales are still stable and not weak. The north still has a healthy appetite for coarse yarn. Although the demand for 20s, 30s, and 42s yarn in the south is not very strong, scattered purchases continue unabated. Therefore, people's minds are firm. At the same time, those with spare funds are also taking in inventory again. The market is supported by this and is slowly advancing, but the overseas cotton market is still not escaping its tired situation.

The opening atmosphere for spot yarn in the morning was still enthusiastic. The opening price for 20s Double Horse was 747 yuan. As soon as this price was opened, scalpers rushed to buy, and the floor suddenly tightened. It slowly rose to 752 yuan. Then, news came that the foreign exchange market was flat, and the Guanggang (Guangdong Gang) only traded specified yarn brands and cotton yarn, and did not buy other yarns. The market atmosphere calmed down slightly and retreated one step. Statistics on transactions in half a day totaled 2,395 bales. The market price of 20s Double Horse rose by 3 yuan, and Tiannu (Goddess) rose by 3 yuan. The factory opened 200 bales of 20s Jinbaoxing (Golden Treasure Star) from the Zhongfang Factory at a price of 725 yuan; 200 bales of 10s Jinbaoxing at a price of 565 yuan; Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 10s Special Jincheng (Golden City) at a price of 600 yuan; 10 bales of 20s Special Jincheng at a price of 745 yuan. Today, 110 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong, 10 pieces to Haikou, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 171 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by various gangs is listed below.

Hong Kong 555, same industry 1,830

Mainland 10 Total 2,395

### US Cotton Export Subsidy, Yesterday Announced Cancellation Again

Cotton trading has completely stalled. This is because the end of the year is approaching, and people are preparing to close accounts and are not buying or selling. However, there is still demand from Qingdao, so although foreign cotton is flat and weak, people's minds can still be maintained. Today, only one transaction of straw-wrapped cotton was made, with 200 bales purchased by the same industry at a price of 655 yuan. The source of supply from northern Jiangsu was 327 bales of Tonghua cotton. Today, 130 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, opened firmly in the morning. A telegram from Liverpool indicated a sharp rise, which aroused purchases by the same industry. Spot trading also turned active. Subsequently, the government announced the cancellation of the remaining 20 pounds of export subsidies for encouraging the export of US cotton. As a result, people's minds turned quite well. As a result, the price rose by 10 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by 11 rupees including forecasts, Egyptian cotton fell by more than 40 pounds, and Liverpool cotton rose by more than 20 pence.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, yesterday the same industry was quite interested in inquiring about Indian cotton. However, the asking prices were too low, so the number of transactions was not large, but there were still more than a thousand bales. US cotton trading was very quiet.

### The Future of Children

— Huang Jiayin

Recently, strange and bizarre gossip news seems to be increasing.

For example, the incident of a certain Wang, who used to "make a living by teaching," using his twelve-year-old twin sons to file a lawsuit and beg for alms, resulting in the arrest department prosecuting him for fraud, is a good example.

As someone who has taught, Mr. Wang not only did not properly educate his two growing sons, but instead asked them to kneel on the ground and beg for alms. We dare not say whether this action constitutes the fraud crime charged by the arresting authorities; however, we dare to assert that Mr. Wang deserves the punishment. Because Mr. Wang is destroying the future of his two sons, if the arresting authorities had not discovered it early, the future of two useful children in society would be unimaginable!

Comparing Mr. Wang's actions that endanger society with merely deceiving a few passersby into generously donating money, the depth of his sins is truly immeasurable. Of course, in the current law, there may not yet be crimes such as "destroying the future of children" or "creating social hazards," but we should not neglect this more important aspect under any circumstances.

We hope that in the future society, "children's education" will become a required course for every parent, and there will be explicit legal provisions for the crime of "misleading children." In this way, the innocent children of the future may be able to enjoy a more reasonable education and treatment.

### Impressions of Holland

— Renren

These past few days, international news has frequently reported on the tense situation on the Dutch border and domestic mobilization, which cannot help but make me recall the tranquility and peace I witnessed in Holland six months ago. I am also concerned about the nearly one thousand overseas Chinese and countless international friends who are enthusiastically working to aid China who remain there.

The natural beauty of the Dutch landscape is quite famous internationally, so many people have praised it as the "park of Northern Europe." The scenery is even more beautiful in the countryside, with crisscrossing clear rivers and marshes, abundant fields, and the distinctive and exquisite Dutch-style houses, low-roofed cottages, and occasional windmills, all of which truly make one feel as if they have entered the realm of a Western fairy tale's "enchanted forest." The Dutch are indeed known for their cleanliness, and their homes, no matter how simple, always have pristine white curtains adorning their windows. Every house is like this, like a uniform for the buildings. Presumably, because most of their houses are built of wood, which is easy to clean, they have to do a major cleaning of their houses every two or three years. During my short stay in Holland, I saw countless Dutch people wearing wooden shoes and climbing on tall ladders, desperately washing and scrubbing roofs and walls. This is indeed a unique Dutch scene.

The Netherlands is a relatively wealthy country, so there are very few extremely poor people, but that does not mean that everyone is well-fed and clothed. In the alleys and streets of Amsterdam, you often see disguised beggars wearing old clothes, playing the violin or accordion, waiting for passersby to give alms. On the benches along the main roads, there are also many unemployed people sitting with their heads down, waiting for government relief. Although education is quite widespread, university education, due to high tuition fees, is limited to the children of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, when I left Holland in mid-August last year, I heard that some university students were brewing a movement to demand lower tuition fees.

Everyone has heard of the Queen of the Netherlands, right? The Netherlands is still a constitutional monarchy. Although conservative forces dominate in parliament, other radical parties can still legally exist, and people have freedom of belief, association, publication, and speech. But it should be noted here that these civil rights only apply to Dutch citizens. As for the political activities of the people from the Dutch East Indies colonies or naturalized Chinese living in the Netherlands, they are strictly monitored and restricted.

Last summer, there were nearly a thousand overseas Chinese scattered throughout the Netherlands, mostly from Guangdong and Qingtian, Zhejiang. Their occupations were either running small businesses or working as laborers on ocean liners. Their lives were certainly quite difficult, but despite this, their donations to the motherland were very enthusiastic. Once, at a charity event for China, I personally saw a Chinese worker take off his gold ring and generously throw it into the donation box, moving everyone in the audience to cheer. Recently, newspapers have also reported news of large numbers of Chinese workers returning to China. Hopefully, the growing new China will not disappoint these sons and daughters returning from afar.

### The Life of the American President

— Zi'an

President Roosevelt, beloved by all Americans, celebrated his fifty-eighth birthday the day before yesterday. Dance parties were held enthusiastically throughout the country, and the money raised was donated to the "Polio Fund," because Roosevelt had previously suffered from this disease. The following tells us about Roosevelt's daily life. – Editor

Although the President of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, receives an annual salary of £15,000, his life is actually simple and frugal, no less than that of ordinary people.

He is now in his fifties, but because his daily life, diet, office work, and entertainment are orderly and regular, he is still in very good spirits.

He gets up before eight o'clock every morning, washes up, and then goes to the grooming room to groom himself. After grooming, he has a light breakfast; scrambled eggs and plum jam bread are his favorite morning meal. After breakfast, he starts reading newspapers. He flips through a dozen daily newspapers page by page, which takes about an hour to read. He takes advantage of the twenty or thirty minutes of free time to stroll in front of the corridor. From 10:30 to 12:00, he meets with cabinet members, etc., except on Sundays; he meets with about twenty or thirty people every day. For lunch, he eats only soup, roasted meats (chicken, duck, pigeon, etc.), salad, and coffee, a few simple dishes. In the afternoon, he reads official documents in his office and sometimes summons subordinates to discuss government affairs. After five o'clock, he leaves the office and swims in the White House swimming pool. Regardless of the weather, he spends thirty minutes in the swimming pool every day. Swimming is President Roosevelt's only hobby. Dinner is more substantial, and after dinner, he retires to his study to write or draft speeches. The President's enjoyment of food and clothing is extremely simple and egalitarian.

The White House, the presidential residence of the United States, is magnificent and beautiful. The White House's regular expenses are included in the government budget, which requires about two thousand eight hundred and sixty pounds per year. All expenses for decoration, heating and cooling equipment, water and electricity consumption, and flower garden expenses, housing repairs, etc., are included. The White House has twenty-one bedrooms, one gym, and one swimming pool. Various vases are displayed on the desks and shelves in each room. Every morning, gardeners must cut thousands of beautiful flowers and arrange them in the vases for viewing. The construction cost of the glass flower garden in the White House is worth millions of pounds. The head gardener who manages this glass flower garden is old and has worked in the White House flower garden for many years and has been praised by President Roosevelt.

There are twelve chauffeurs in the White House. The annual expenses for gasoline, lubricants, chauffeur wages, and chauffeur uniforms are also considerable. Chauffeur clothing costs about sixty pounds per person per year. The government specifically allocates an annual fund of five thousand pounds for the President's travel expenses, as well as a special train and a yacht for the President to ride. The President of the United States has the most enjoyable living and travel arrangements.

### How to Enrich Thought

— Yibei

Thought is a remarkable thing. In today's world, it is humanity's weapon. If thought is not sound, there is a possibility of being conquered by others. If we want to have pure and era-appropriate thought, we should pay attention to the following:

(1) Recognize the spirit of the times and observe society.

(2) Pay attention to human rights and the welfare of the masses.

(3) Pay attention to self-cultivation.

(4) Pay attention to one's actions and constantly reflect.

(5) Have self-confidence and a strong will.

(6) Carefully choose those whom you believe in and admire.

(7) Judge with an objective attitude and understand matters with associative methods.

(8) Do not emphasize views formed during fantasy, worry, or joy.

(9) Impartially judge the words of others.

(10) Do not casually accept the advice of others, nor absolutely reject the loyalty of others.

(11) Do not ignore small things, nor overemphasize small things.

(12) Read more beneficial books and newspapers.

If we can faithfully fulfill these, at the very least, our thoughts will not become appendages of the thoughts of others.

### Canned Blood Transfusions

— Sansan

The Saint-Antoine Hospital in France has invented a "canned blood transfusion" method, which involves putting the blood needed by patients in metal cans, which can last for two weeks without spoiling. After the invention of this method, it has been of great help to wounded soldiers at the front lines.

### Talking Points

— Zhuangsen

A horse's strength is more than six times, but less than seven times, that of an ordinary man.

A kangaroo's long jump will not exceed twenty meters.

An elephant has a very keen sense of smell and can detect a person walking towards it from a distance of one thousand meters.

A spider has a larger appetite than any other animal. If calculated proportionally, a spider's daily food would be equivalent to a person eating thirteen sheep, eleven pigs, two cows, and four tons of flour.

Beetles are the strongest and most powerful creatures, capable of carrying things that weigh 850 times their own weight. Comparing this to a person, they should be able to carry something weighing sixty tons.

A grapeworm can only travel 0.0000000000002 meters per second.

A golden oriole can travel 300 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 2,000 meters, and its range can last for half a day.

### Children's Education

— Menggu

After the famous American educator Parker finished his speech in Chicago, a lady asked, "How early should I start educating my child?"

Parker asked back, "When is your child due to be born?"

The lady felt strange and said, "Born? My child is already five years old!"

"My God, madam," Parker exclaimed, "hurry back, don't stand here talking to me; you have already lost the most precious five years."

### Movie King Loves China

— Huazhi

The recently elected Movie King, Mi Gai Luona, is affiliated with MGM and is nineteen years old. Last year, he was among the top alongside Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, and this year he is the sole leader, which can be considered fortunate. He comes from a difficult background; his father is a playwright, and he has had a talent for singing and humor since childhood. Mi Gai Luona's style generally imitates Clara Cable and Lionel Barrymore. His successful work is "Jin Yu Man Tang" [likely a translated movie title]. He is currently a basic actor at MGM, with a weekly salary of one thousand US dollars and ten thousand US dollars per film split.

His life is multifaceted; he likes music, art, dance, and sports. There is a swimming pool in his home. He can also play the piano and violin, which complements his singing voice. His lover is Maddie Gallen, the female lead in "Jin Yu Man Tang" and "The Wizard of Oz," and their relationship is very warm. Mi Gai Luona also has a considerable knowledge of Eastern culture. In "Jin Yu Man Tang," he sings, "Good friends, happy today, I will fight fiercely with the bugs of Garoli, and I will also watch the China-Japan chess game war." He tries as much as possible to learn Eastern styles and even studies Chinese. This summer, after filming "Judge Hattai," he may take advantage of his vacation to buy a boat and visit China.

### Talking About "Daughter Country"

— Shuimo

I can't tell if I like it or hate it, but I have to spend two "New Years" every year. The new New Year has passed, and the old New Year is coming soon. People are planning how to spend it again. The Shanghai Drama and Art Society is also planning what new things to contribute to the new year. According to general speculation, it will always be a historical drama, but in fact, the arrangement of this drama is completely beyond people's expectations. This is a new play by Yu Ling. It is another work centered on women after he wrote "Women's Apartment" and "Flowers Shed Tears." It can be called one of the three "Women" trilogies. However, the style has completely changed. It is about the fantasies of several women who want to become immortals and think about developing. The author uses fantasy expression methods to visualize it on the stage, so all kinds of strange and grotesque forms are expressed on the stage. Techniques that have never been used on the stage are all being tried here. Ships sail in violent winds and raging waves, women sing and dance wildly on the ship, and suddenly immortals appear. Here, women emerge from under the stage and come to the stage. The costumes here, the old ones are Ming Dynasty clothes, and the new ones are almost new clothes from 1950. Strange and magnificent, it's almost like "The Wizard of Oz." But this is a fantasy, and when the fantasy is shattered, what is given to these women is still disappointment. In terms of actors, All Starcast has also been adopted, including Lü Ji, Yang Fan, Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Xiao Feng, Murong Wan'er, Xu Li, etc. When it is performed in the future with musical rhythms and exaggerated comedy forms, it will definitely give people a new impression.

### "Pain" Premieres

— Traveling Reporter

At the end of the lunar year, the old opera world has the custom of closing the box. The Xindu Theater will also stop performing for three days from the fourth, and on the seventh, Lunar New Year's Eve, it will premiere the play "Pain" as a realistic work exposing all aspects of the old society. The Shanghai opera world has revised social themes with new ideas and premiered them on important holidays, which cannot be said to be a progressive and good phenomenon. The content of "Pain" is to write about the internal and external lives of all levels of society in the metropolis on the lunar New Year's Eve, using objective and critical eyes to make a powerful rendering. Although it is not known what the effect of the performance will be in the future, this is always the path of Shanghai opera artists gradually moving towards awakening and progress.

### Strange Stories of Misplayed Plays (Part 2)

— Su Shaoqing

At that time, the play was performed for three days and three nights, six acts, and he missed all six acts, without deserving his reputation. (Shaoshan arrived backstage, and within a few minutes, his face was made up, and his costume was also quick. If he sang "Searching the Underworld Mountain" or "Locking the Five Dragons," he would sing the inverted board while fastening buttons and tying belts. After singing, he went on stage, rushing in a laughable manner.) The play was voluntary, and I had no choice; however, missed plays are missed plays, and popular is popular. I heard that Shao Shan is now in Beiping, forming his own troupe, taking the lead alone. I wonder if he can change his habits and not miss plays? Shao Shan's missed plays are not enough to be strange. Now I hear of even stranger stories that are worthy of laughter. A certain young man used to rely on famous female actors, but recently he has not performed often. He looks dispirited. When he joined a certain troupe, he missed several plays. The manager did not punish him but still gave him roles. He became accustomed to it and always arrived about half an hour late for his own play, carrying a baggage man carrying his costume slowly. Since the play was missed, there was no need to put down the costume package, and the servant would carry it back the way he came. Someone told the manager that the package he was carrying was not the costume for the day's play and could be checked. One day, he was again late and missed the play. The manager ordered his master and servant to sit down and rest temporarily. In the meantime, he opened his costume package and saw that it contained tattered clothes, not the costume for the day's play. He asked him why. At first, he did not tell the truth, but then he said bitterly that all his costumes had been pawned and that he was late every day because of this. From then on, the young man had nowhere to join a troupe, and the Liyuan [opera world] spread the story as a joke.

The play historian said that in the past, actors did not dare to miss plays because the law was strict. Recently, discipline has been relaxed, and the strangeness of missing plays is like the above. The young man's missing plays were due to poverty and not striving to improve, which is also pitiful. Jin Shaoshan's missing plays were due to laziness. People tolerated him when he was at his peak, but once his voice fails and his energy declines, people will get tired of him. If he can change his usual habits, wouldn't that be good? Those who eat and neglect their work are in danger, and all actors who love themselves should be respectful and diligent.
