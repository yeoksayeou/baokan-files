### Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Invade Xiangning and Jixian, Constantly Intercepted by Chinese Forces. The Japanese Army at Wangzhai Suffers Heavy Losses in an Ambush. Japanese Troops Retreating South from Yangcheng Were Completely Annihilated.

Xingji: Since the 10th, the Japanese have transferred approximately 5,000 to 6,000 troops from Hejin, Jishan, and Fencheng to invade Xiangning and Jixian in western Shanxi. The Chinese army is resisting every step of the way, intercepting them everywhere. Fierce battles have continued for five days and nights, killing many Japanese soldiers. The battle situation on various routes is as follows: (1) More than 3,000 Japanese troops from Hejin, with more than 1,000 mules and horses, invaded northwards from Xigaikou, Bashipan, and Weijialing in three routes.

Editorial

### The Improved British Cabinet, the United States, and the Far East

The so-called Far Eastern problem at this stage has vast and complex content, with the Sino-Japanese War being the most important core. All events that have already occurred and may occur in the West Pacific are not isolated and are all affected by the current situation between China and Japan. If the world's observers of the Far Eastern situation cannot grasp this key point, they will inevitably become fragmented and unable to achieve a true understanding.

The nearly two years of war between China and Japan have suppressed Japan's status as a first-class power and also hit its attempt to dominate the Far East. On the other hand, China has also emerged from a state of weakness and formed an important force for stabilizing the Far East. This situation has become particularly significant in the past six months. If, twenty years ago, issues concerning China's own rights and interests were still to be decided by the great powers, then in 1940, any event related to the Far Eastern machinery must put China's trends and intentions first. This is the result of subtle changes in the international situation, and it is also the reward that China has earned for its own efforts. The reason why the Far Eastern policies of Simon and Chamberlain were difficult to implement, even leading them into a predicament, was precisely because of a lack of recognition of this change and still dealing with the overall situation in the East today with the eyes of the Anglo-Japanese alliance era.

In recent days, the Netherlands and Belgium have suffered terrible attacks, and the European war has intensified. There have been calls from the Japanese side to reconsider their "non-intervention" stance, and the fate of the Dutch East Indies has attracted the world's attention. Although Japan, like the United Kingdom and the United States, has recently expressed its respect for maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, it cannot completely hide its desire for them. The Japanese warlords are currently taking a reserved attitude because the European war is seeing some clarification and the American fleet has already sailed east. However, if the United Kingdom and France encounter another setback on the Western Front like that in central Norway - this, while not related to the final outcome of the European war, is an important turning point - the Japanese may take swift action to create a so-called fait accompli and then use it as a basis for bargaining with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. This preemptive strategy is the specialty of aggressor nations. Although the United States has a powerful fleet stationed in Hawaii, it is still 3,000 nautical miles away from the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, making it difficult to respond quickly to events. Moreover, the isolationists within the United States have not yet disappeared, and there are suggestions in Congress to cultivate rubber in Brazil as a substitute for imports from the Dutch East Indies. These are all weaknesses of the United States itself. At that time, the United States will inevitably fall into a dilemma. Hull's repeated statements and the eastward deployment of the American fleet are all wise measures, but they are still not enough to thwart the ambitions of aggressors.

Hull's recent statement that "respecting the status quo of the East Indies is essential to maintaining peace in the Pacific" is correct, but it only states one aspect of the problem. Another important factor that he has omitted is China, which is fighting the war of resistance. If Japan had not been exhausted in the three-year war of aggression against China, the situation in the West Pacific would not be what it is now since the beginning of the European war last autumn. Perhaps the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Annam, and India would have already suffered from the invasion of the Japanese warlords, fulfilling their long-cherished dream of southward advance. Today, the military and capitalists in Japan who are obsessed with the southward route are deeply regretting the rash act of invading China and are eager to extract themselves from the quagmire in order to seek other developments. This point should be closely watched by the great powers, especially the United States. It must be understood that the only way to maintain peace and tranquility in the Pacific is to completely defeat Japan's aggressive intentions. Since the great powers are not yet willing to confront Japan with force, they can only expect the victory of China's war of resistance to maintain peace in the Pacific. Since the outbreak and subsequent expansion of the European war, China's strength in resisting aggression has been severely tested and has proven to be able to shoulder this important mission. Over the past decade, many battles against aggression have unfortunately ended in defeat, but only China has stood firm as a bulwark that cannot be overthrown. The world should re-evaluate the value of this achievement and provide more and more active encouragement and assistance.

In the past, many people lacked understanding of the seriousness of the situation in the East, and the Far Eastern policies of the United Kingdom and the United States often appeared to be aligned in appearance but separated in reality, even going their own ways, thus missing many opportunities and almost causing irreparable mistakes. Now that the storm in the West Pacific is imminent, we must never repeat the mistakes of the past and sit idly by. Although the new British cabinet faces many difficulties and cannot be expected to take on more responsibility in the East, it can be determined that it will never again hinder the United States' active use of its power in the Far East. Rectifying the chaos and restoring order is now the right time. It is hoped that the United States will consider the Far Eastern problem as a whole and recognize that maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies cannot be achieved solely by existing measures. It must promptly impose political and economic pressure on Japan and do everything possible to increase China's strength in resisting aggression and accelerate the success of the war of resistance. That is the best way to curb aggression and the most direct and effective way to stabilize the critical situation in the Far East.

### German Troops Cross the Meuse River, Advance Westward. British and French Land and Air Forces Cooperate in a Counter-Offensive. Heavy Bombardment of German Mechanized Units. Reports of the Maginot Line Being Breached are Incorrect.

Paris: Today marks the fifth day of the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. The situation in the Netherlands is quite critical. It is rumored that General Winkelman, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch Army and Navy, has already delivered a broadcast, stating that the country's military strength is far inferior to that of the enemy, and that it has no choice but to cease resistance in order to avoid further loss of life. A summary of the latest developments and the war situation from various sources is as follows:

(1) There are widespread rumors that German troops are concentrated on the Swiss border. The Swiss Federal Government has declared a state of alert and ordered the army to prepare for any eventuality, so as to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.

(2) German troops have already captured the port of Rotterdam. At the same time, General Winkelman, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch Army and Navy, issued a so-called "Address to the Nation," declaring a cessation of resistance. However, in view of the "Address to the Nation" issued by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in London today, the veracity of General Winkelman's speech remains questionable. A Havas reporter, who departed from The Hague, Netherlands, on the 13th of this month, stated that Germany is using the "Fifth Column" (former internal spies) to sabotage the Netherlands. Their plainclothes guerrilla teams had already been deployed in various strategic military locations, and upon a single command, they launched their attacks simultaneously. The unfavorable outcome of the Dutch war is due to this.

(3) The largest war in the history of modern warfare is currently taking place within Belgium. The number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks used by both sides is unprecedented. German armored units attempted to advance towards Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, and Charleroi, but all failed. The combined forces of Britain, France, and Belgium are still firmly defending key strongholds. Belgian forces have only retreated to pre-arranged lines of defense in some secondary positions.

(4) Fresh French and British troops have also landed at Narvik in northern Norway to attack the German forces from the rear. (Havas, 14th)

Paris: German troops have crossed the Meuse River in several locations, especially north of Dinant in Belgium and south of Sedan in France. However, with the assistance of a large air force, the Allied forces immediately launched a counter-offensive, killing many enemy troops. The two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. (Havas, 15th) The Paris High Command has just issued a war report stating that enemy tank units launched a fierce offensive last night in the Gembloux area in central Belgium. After receiving reinforcements, the enemy attempted to cross the Meuse River at Namur, but although our army launched a major counter-offensive at the Dyle River, they were eventually repelled. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Our air force and the British air force are operating jointly on the front line and are proving to be very effective. As for the Western Front, there is nothing noteworthy to report. (Havas, 15th)

London: According to the latest reports received here, the British and French troops are not discouraged by the surrender of the Netherlands. Assisted by a powerful force of British bombers, they have stemmed the German advance westward across the Meuse River. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, British bombers, protected by fighter planes and operating jointly with the French Air Force, have repeatedly carried out low-level bombing raids on enemy troop concentrations and tank formations, with great success, and have provided valuable assistance to the French army, destroying two bridges and two pontoon bridges. At least fifteen enemy aircraft have been shot down by our air force and anti-aircraft batteries. In this fierce fighting, it is impossible to expect detailed reports from the pilots. Our aircraft inevitably suffered significant losses when attacking important targets under heavy anti-aircraft fire and fighter protection. Therefore, although we lost thirty-five aircraft, the results achieved far outweigh the losses. Some of the crew members have already returned to their bases. According to an official communiqué, the enemy is currently attacking fiercely with tanks and aircraft, but it is not yet possible to determine whether their main objective is to divert the Maginot Line at Sedan or Longwy, or to prevent the French army from fighting alongside the British and Belgian forces with maximum effort. According to well-informed observers here, the reports that the Maginot Line has been diverted or breached are inaccurate, as the main body of the line actually extends from the Luxembourg border. From there to the coast, it is a deep and heavily fortified line, and Sedan is not part of the Maginot Line. (Reuters, 15th)

Expansion of the Western Front Battlefield

Paris: Military sources here have recently stated that the war on the front lines is becoming increasingly fierce, and the battlefield is expanding accordingly. As of today, the entire area from the Rhine River in the north to the Swiss border in the south has become a vast battlefield. A summary of the situation on the front lines is as follows: (1) German troops in eastern Belgium, originally advancing westward from Maastricht, were intercepted by French troops. Their motorized units, along a line east of Brussels to Namur, are preventing the German advance westward. A German advance post made contact with Allied forces at Gembloux, 15 kilometers northeast of Namur. They launched several fierce attacks, attempting to advance directly to Brussels, but were repelled by the Allied forces, suffering heavy losses, especially in their motorized units. (2) In the Meuse River area, that is, along a line from Namur in Belgium to Sedan in France, French and German forces have been fighting for two days. Both sides have continued to reinforce their troops, and the fighting has intensified. German troops finally crossed the Meuse River by force in small boats north of Dinant in Belgium, and gained some footholds in certain locations. The French army launched a major counter-offensive, consolidating its positions. (3) On the Maginot Line side, large-scale fighting is currently taking place in the Sedan area. The German troops are the most elite units, and after crossing the Meuse River via Luxembourg and the Ardennes Mountains, they continued to advance, reaching 6 kilometers south of Sedan. However, the French army launched a major counter-offensive from the afternoon of yesterday, and by night, they had recovered all the lost territory in the east and driven the German troops back across the river. In other areas, thanks to air support, the positions are even more consolidated. (4) In terms of air combat, the number of German aircraft lost is about 60 percent higher than that of the Allied forces, proving that British and French aircraft are superior in quality to German aircraft. In the last three days, Germany has reduced the number of times it has bombed the interior of Britain and France or attacked the rear of the Allied forces. The information released by the German High Command regarding air combat is untrue and not credible. (Havas, 15th)

German Military Report

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German military report stated that the famous Dutch fortresses of Europe, unable to withstand the bombardment of the German air force and army, have surrendered. German troops in Belgium have intercepted enemy forces and reached the Dyle River. German troops fighting between Namur and Givète have crossed the Meuse River. French armored units west of the Meuse River launched a counter-offensive but were repelled. The German air force participated in the fighting, destroying many armored vehicles. When German troops crossed the Meuse River in the Sedan area, the northern end of the Maginot Line had already been invaded by German troops. The French army made every effort to counter-attack, but were still repelled, suffering heavy losses. Yesterday, the German air force focused its main activities on attacking enemy transportation hubs, railway stations, and highways behind enemy lines. The enemy sent several strong air force units in an attempt to resist German air activity, but not only did they fail to succeed, in one location alone, more than seventy British and French fighter and interceptor planes were shot down. In total, enemy aircraft losses for yesterday alone were no less than two hundred. (Haitong, 15th)

French Troops Retreat from Sedan Purely for Strategic Reasons

New York: According to a consolidated report of United Press dispatches from Europe yesterday, the German army has broken through the first line of French defense and moved the Western Front war into French territory. Hitler's motorized units have crossed the Dutch border to the coast, broken through the main Belgian defense line, and advanced to Sedan in northern France. The German side claims that German troops and the air force have used blitzkrieg tactics to seize the Netherlands and Belgium as a base for attacking Britain and the French Maginot Line, and that progress is faster than planned. Allied dispatches largely confirm the victories claimed by the German high command, and state that the great forces of the Allies are engaged in a historically unprecedented battle with Germany's modern motorized units and air force. According to public announcements from both the French and German sides, the main French defense line runs along the French-Belgian-Luxembourg border northwest to Charleville on the Meuse River. In this 50-mile area, the Germans claim to have broken through the French lines in several places and advanced to the Sedan area, which will soon become the scene of a major battle. However, it is doubtful whether the Allied forces in Belgium can effectively form a line to confront the German army in a pincer movement. Protecting the French border is another matter. The French Maginot Line extends westward from the Belgian border to the coast. To date, German troops entering French territory have not yet reached the main Maginot Line, as the line is several miles inside the border. Therefore, military experts regard the French military retreat from Sedan as purely for strategic reasons. (United Press, 15th)

(Haitong, 15th)

Brussels: The Belgian High Command has just issued a war report stating: "Our troops retreated to new positions last night and redeployed for continued combat according to plan. The retreat was assisted by Allied forces and was orderly and without losses. In the Namur area, enemy mechanized units, under air cover, launched repeated and fierce attacks. Our army is now resolutely resisting them." (Havas, 14th)

### German Troops Occupy Netherlands, British Heart Feels Threatened. France Denies Paris Air Raid.

### Dutch Commander-in-Chief Announces Cessation of Resistance. This Message Was Issued to the Army. German Mechanized Units Entered The Hague Yesterday.

London: The Dutch Commander-in-Chief has confirmed in a radio broadcast that he ordered the troops to cease resistance, saying that this was a last resort. He said, "Although we have decided to do our best to defend the country, I have received reports from all parties that today we have reached the end of our strength. Although the soldiers fought very bravely, the strength of the two sides is too disparate. As a result, the number of those killed in action has reached hundreds of thousands. Our air force has been almost completely destroyed and is no longer able to assist the army. Other air defense methods have also had little effect, leaving our soldiers without any protection under air raids. As for the civilians, women, and children who have been bombed to death, they are countless. At present, Rotterdam has suffered serious war damage, and other cities will also encounter the same fate, so there is only one way to stop the war. I know that most of the people of the country will be greatly shocked by this news, but for the benefit of the Dutch people, this is a step that must be taken." The commander-in-chief also asked the people to trust the future and maintain order, and concluded with "Long live the Queen, long live the motherland." According to officials at the Dutch embassy, the Commander-in-Chief's declaration is limited to the fighting forces, and does not include the Dutch Navy. (Reuters, 15th)

Amsterdam: The Dutch Hilversum radio station announced this morning that German troops entered The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government, at 5:30 this morning. (Haitong, 15th)

Paris: The Dutch embassy here issued a communiqué stating that some of the country's troops have retreated from the south into Belgium and are concentrating to regroup and form strong forces. (Havas, 15th)

The Hague: The Dutch Supreme Command issued an order yesterday that all hostilities throughout the country, except for the province of Zeeland in southern Netherlands, were ordered to cease. All wartime measures, including blackouts, were suspended throughout the country except for Zeeland, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and bloodshed. The northern and central parts of the Netherlands, which were largely un-occupied and un-trampled by German forces, were thus surrendered to the enemy. Large fires broke out in most parts of Amsterdam and Rotterdam yesterday, caused by German incendiary bombs and the Dutch authorities' own defense measures. German troops have now occupied the northern front and the northern and central parts of the Netherlands. Dutch government officials have fled to Britain on British cruisers. The center of gravity of the war has shifted to the south, and the Allied forces are now trying to stem the German advance across Belgian territory. The Dutch people were shocked by the government's announcement. Newspapers explained that Queen Wilhelmina was forced to flee to Britain because of German plans to bomb the Dutch palace and capture the Queen and other government officials. Public opinion encouraged the people to "persevere, and after the war, the Netherlands will be able to restore its territory." (United Press, 15th)

### Most of the Dutch Navy Will Deploy to the East Indies. Dutch Envoy Ordered to Respond to Japanese Note. Britain and America Have No Intention of Interfering in the East Indies.

London: According to sources here, although the Dutch army has surrendered, Zeeland in the southernmost part of the Netherlands has not yet fallen. Most of the Dutch navy has sailed out and is said to be stationed in the Dutch East Indies, where it is in a state of full preparation. It is not yet known whether Germany will attempt to take over the Dutch East Indies, now that it has seized power in the Netherlands. In fact, the German navy lost most of its ships in the Scandinavian campaign and would not be able to undertake such a long expedition anyway. It is reported that Britain in Singapore and France in Vietnam are prepared to assist the Netherlands in the event that any fourth country attempts to spread the war to the South Pacific. The US fleet has been stationed in Hawaii indefinitely, and there is reason to believe that the US naval outpost in the Pacific has been fully prepared for a long time. The US State Department and the Japanese Foreign Ministry have exchanged expressions of concern for any attempt to disrupt the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. The British ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has also informed the Japanese Foreign Minister of British sympathy for Japan's concern for maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. With such a strong force paying attention to the South Pacific, any aggressor attempting to disrupt peace in the region would be foolish. (Reuters, 15th)

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that the Dutch ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita this morning at 10 a.m. on the orders of his government to explain Japan's note to the Dutch government of May 11. It is said that the Dutch government is confident that Britain, the United States, and France have no intention of interfering in the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 15th)

Tokyo: The Dutch ambassador to Japan, Mr. Paster, has informed the Japanese Foreign Ministry that the Dutch government has given the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies full power to handle diplomatic affairs in the Dutch East Indies. In the future, Japan's diplomacy with the Dutch East Indies should be negotiated with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies or the Dutch ambassador to Japan. It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry has sent a document to the Dutch government in London to confirm this. (United Press, 15th)

Washington: The State Department announced that the United States will take care of the interests of Belgium and the Netherlands in Germany. If the capitals of Belgium and the Netherlands are occupied by Germany in the future, the US envoys stationed in those countries will remain in their posts to take care of the interests of Britain and France. (Havas, 15th)

### Dutch East Indies Prevent Anti-Japanese Movement. Japan Plans to Develop Trade. Talks Divided Between Britain and the Netherlands.

Tokyo: According to official reports received last night by the Japanese Foreign Ministry from Ishisha Jutaro, the Japanese ambassador to the Netherlands, and Saito, the Japanese consul-general in Batavia, the Dutch authorities have assured Japan that they are willing to control anti-Japanese agitation in the Dutch East Indies. On May 12, the Japanese government ordered its ambassador to the Netherlands to protest against a group of Dutch youths in the Pati region on May 10 who shouted "Expel the Japanese" in front of a Japanese store. The Dutch government assured Ishisha that it would take appropriate measures to crack down on similar behavior in the future and expressed regret if the incident was true, as the Dutch government had not received any formal report on the matter. Japan also protested about a resolution passed by the "Motherland Club" in Semarang, stating that Japanese and German residents in the Dutch East Indies were hiding weapons and that their homes should be searched. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies replied, assuring Saito that the local government would take preventive steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said today that the Dutch authorities have assured the Japanese consul-general in Batavia that they will take effective measures to crack down on anti-Japanese agitation on the island. These assurances have been confirmed by the Dutch government in The Hague. When asked whether the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would be maintained if the Netherlands fell into German hands, the spokesman replied that although the Dutch government had moved to London, he hoped that the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would not change in view of the assurances issued by the Dutch authorities. When asked whether Japan was also concerned about maintaining the economic status quo of the Dutch East Indies, the spokesman replied that Japan certainly hoped that Japan's existing trade with the Dutch East Indies would not only be maintained but also increased. The Japanese and Dutch authorities have been holding talks on this point in Batavia and The Hague. Japan is deeply concerned about promoting trade with the Dutch East Indies and other parts of the world. As for Japan's attitude toward the Dutch West Indies, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks on April 15 stated Japan's deep concern for maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies but did not mention the Dutch West Indies. When asked whether Britain and Japan had started trade talks, the spokesman replied that Japan was not only negotiating trade issues with Britain. The Japanese ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Mamoru, was discussing various issues with the British authorities, and trade issues may have been occasionally touched upon during the talks. (Reuters, 15th)

### Dutch East Indies Pledge Allegiance to the Queen. British Newspapers Comment on the Dutch, Expressing Sympathy and Understanding.

Batavia: The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies declared in a radio broadcast that the Netherlands had issued a "ceasefire" order and urged the people not to be discouraged by this. The first reaction to this broadcast was that some people joined the Allied forces. Representatives of local chiefs and other ethnic groups, including Chinese Arabs, have all declared their loyalty to the Queen. The people of British India sent a telegram to the Governor-General stating that today is the most difficult period in human history, as the peace of the world and all civilization that has been maintained with dignity have been destroyed by the madness of one person. It is reported that military authorities are now preparing to deal with all eventualities. The head offices of many Dutch trading companies are now moving to the Dutch East Indies. The European operations of the Dutch airline will be jointly operated with British Imperial Airways. Dutch aircraft will only fly to Alexandria, and then British aircraft will carry passengers and cargo for onward travel. Shipping to Europe has now been suspended. (Reuters, 15th)

London: British newspapers commented on the "ceasefire order issued by the Netherlands, with the main theme being to express sympathy and understanding for the difficulties encountered by the Netherlands. The Evening Standard said that apart from the sins that European civil nations must share, no other blame should be placed on the Netherlands, as they still hoped that they could protect themselves by individual relief until the coming of the thirteenth hour. The Star said that the Dutch army resisted until the British and French troops were able to settle their positions, for which we should be grateful. All newspapers said that we must not imagine new dangers because Germany occupies Dutch ports and airfields. One evening newspaper said that Britain's response will be a firmer determination and more vigorous efforts. This can be used to infer the rest. (Reuters, 15th)

### Belgian Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation, Encouraging People to Fight Resolutely. The Time for Compensation Will Eventually Come. The Government Continues to Enlist Young Men into the Army.

Brussels: Prime Minister Pierlot delivered a broadcast speech in the evening, reporting on the war situation, roughly saying: "Yesterday, German troops launched repeated attacks in various places on the front line. Our army resisted bravely, and until last night, we were still able to defend the original positions. Afterwards, our military headquarters changed the defense system, and the process was very good. This morning, German troops launched an offensive in a certain area, but our positions remained unshaken. In the forts of Liège, our artillery continued to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. It is rumored that German paratroopers landed in this city on the two days of yesterday and today, which is not true. In recent days, enemy aircraft have wantonly bombed Antwerp, Namur, Leuven, Aalst, Tirlemont, and other places, and openly opened machine guns in certain places to strafe civilians riding trains and teams of refugees, causing heavy casualties. In short, the cruelty of this war is greater than the war of 1914. All this should be known to the countries of the civilized world and judged by human conscience. We firmly believe that there will be a time in the future when the past will be compensated. At this time, we should still maintain our courage and not listen to rumors. The government's regular office remains in the capital and will inform the people of the progress of the situation." (Havas, 14th)

Brussels: The Ministry of National Defense has announced that young people between the ages of 16 and 35 will be enlisted into the army to serve, including those who are temporarily exempt. The disabled are not included. In addition, the semi-official Belgian News Agency issued a message stating that the front-line situation is gradually stabilizing, and the British and French embassies have not moved elsewhere. According to well-informed sources, the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France often holds joint meetings. At that time, General Michiel, Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Army, may go to participate on behalf of Belgium, which is also unknown. (Havas, 14th)

### English Translation:

### British and French Organization - New Volunteer Army - Defending Against German Paratroopers - Enthusiastic Enlistment

London - According to official announcements, Britain will organize a new army called the Local Defense Volunteers. Service is purely voluntary, without pay. Those between the ages of seventeen and sixty-five will be provided with weapons by the authorities and will be responsible for defense in small villages and sparsely populated areas. Minister of War Eden made a broadcast asking the people to join this new army. Due to the German army’s deployment of paratroopers behind the Dutch and Belgian defense lines, the government’s defense plan is very effective, but for the sake of intensifying defense, it is requesting that citizens who are not yet in military service actively participate. (Reuters, 15th)

### National Mobilization Completed - Swiss Defense Consolidated - Relying on Natural Barriers and New Weapons - Ineffectiveness in Use - Invasion Inevitably Leads to Misfortune - Historical Records Can Be Examined

Swiss Capital - The Federal Council and the General Headquarters of the Army recently issued a statement stating that the national mobilization order has been declared complete within a very short period of time. All units have now been deployed to their designated defensive positions, and the equipment of the border defense forces is particularly sophisticated. In short, the neutrality and independence of our country will be maintained by the national armed forces. (Havas, 15th)

Zurich, Switzerland - Germany has concentrated a large number of troops on the Swiss border, and the Swiss government has immediately declared a state of alert. Army units have also been ordered to be on standby. Military experts here are optimistic about the country's defense, saying that if the German army invades, it will not be easy to succeed. Although Switzerland has a population of only 4.2 million, the army has 500,000 men. In addition, three-quarters of the country is mountainous, making it easy to defend. It is impossible for the invading army to advance quickly or deploy its lines, and it is vulnerable to attacks by guerrillas. In addition to natural barriers, the authorities have also built strong fortifications. The St. Gotthard Fortress in the Alps is the nerve center of Switzerland's entire defense system. Gun emplacements and machine gun positions are carved into the rock, and all artillery is controlled by electric current. The rock is 200 meters thick and cannot be destroyed by aircraft bombs or artillery fire. The fortress is also equipped with generators and water plants, and can be self-sufficient in water and electricity. Food and ammunition have also been stockpiled in large quantities, so there is no need to worry about shortages. Historically, mountainous areas have been the strongest passive defensive works in war, as evidenced by numerous historical records. When the Carthaginian general Hannibal attacked Rome in ancient times, he lost almost half of his army after crossing the Alps. In 1799, Russian General Suvorov led an Austro-Russian allied army to attack Napoleon's army, crossing the St. Gotthard Pass (2,076 meters above sea level) and the Kinzig Pass, losing one-fifth of his army without making contact. By the time they reached the vicinity of Zurich, the soldiers were exhausted, and they were defeated as soon as they engaged in battle. During the last European war, from 1916 to 1917, the Italian army fought with the Austrian army, losing as many as 200,000 officers and soldiers in the Dolomite mountains. In recent years, although various countries have made many innovations in armaments, they have still been unable to overcome this extremely dangerous terrain. Even mechanized units have no possibility of developing their power. Even if all vehicles are used, they can only travel on flat roads and are only enough to form targets for shooting, giving the defending side an advantage. Moreover, roads everywhere can be blocked by various obstacles to impede traffic. It is impossible for the electric team to bypass and attack in the high mountains. In addition, the air in the mountainous area is fresh, and the range of various artillery pieces can be increased by one-third. All kinds of calculations for the artillery team must be completely changed. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve accuracy in the shells fired, at least in a certain period. Moreover, large cannons are bulky and difficult to use in the mountains, and small-caliber cannons do not have enough firepower to destroy rocks. As for aircraft, which were originally the most powerful weapons of the German army, they are extremely easy to lose their effectiveness in mountainous areas. Even in peacetime, flying in the mountains is dangerous. In the Alps, there are at least 250 days a year of bad weather, with clouds and fog, which is a major difficulty for aircraft. If German pilots were to bomb Swiss troops and supply trains at night, it would be tantamount to suicide. Moreover, the Swiss army has sophisticated anti-aircraft guns, which are enough to prevent German aircraft from running rampant. (Havas, 14th)

### Completing the Deployment of Two Million Troops - Accelerating Shipbuilding and Strengthening Coastal Defense - US President Sends Special Message to Congress - Increasing Army and Navy Expenditures by More Than 120 Million Yuan

Washington - Responsible sources expect that President Roosevelt's special message to Congress today or tomorrow will propose an increase in army expenditures of approximately $907,500,000 and navy expenditures of $212,500,000. The purpose of this procedure is to complete the deployment of one million troops and accelerate shipbuilding and strengthen coastal defenses. According to Congress, the salient features of this procedure are: (1) manufacturing the urgently needed military equipment for 750,000 army troops and 250,000 reserve troops, such as semi-automatic rifles, tanks, artillery, and anti-aircraft weapons; (2) increasing the army's strength by 15,000 men, so that another first-class "streamlined" infantry division can be established, and training 7,000 aviation corps pilots; (3) accelerating shipbuilding and expanding the convenience of training naval aviators; (4) strengthening coastal defenses, with the army estimating that it will cost more than 100 million yuan to strengthen the defenses of the United States and Panama, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico; (5) adding 200 four-engine bombers, costing 100 million yuan. (Reuters, 15th)

Washington - White House spokesman Early reported yesterday that President Roosevelt is currently taking action to prevent the United States from being dragged into the European war. He said that President Roosevelt believes that the expansion of the European war is "like an emergency fire in the street, and a big gust of wind is blowing towards your house. Therefore, what you should do is try to prevent the fire from spreading to your house." President Roosevelt will leave it to Congress to decide whether the funds for the new national defense measures should be raised by increasing taxes or by raising the limit on public debt, which has recently been increased to US$45,000,000. President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to allocate a supplementary budget for national defense, totaling approximately US$63,000,000. Due to the recent new war situation in Europe, this huge sum is necessary to supplement the US$2,000,000,000 budget for the army and navy. President Roosevelt's request includes US$12,500,000 for the purchase of major raw materials for national defense and US$2,900,000 for strengthening the coastal defenses of Puerto Rico. He urged Congress to recognize the urgent need for these funds. (Associated Press, 15th)

Washington - The US Navy Department has proposed to Congress to immediately allocate an additional 300 million yuan to accelerate the completion of the 68 battleships and auxiliary ships currently under construction.

(Reuters, 14th) Washington - General Pershing, former commander of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, delivered a radio address to the American people last night, calling on the United States to immediately expand its army on a large scale. Pershing believes that the current US military strength is too inadequate. (Haitong, 15th)

### US Tilt Towards the Allied Powers - Emotions Growing Stronger - Hull Sends Note to Germany - Declaring Preference for Democratic Countries

Washington - Emotions favoring the Allied powers are growing everywhere in the United States.

Hull said that the United States is now willing to contact the American republics to protest to Germany against its invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. The local newspapers welcomed this statement. According to the Washington Star, Hull has sent a note to Germany declaring that the Americas will henceforth, at least morally, favor the democratic countries fighting for survival, but what the Americas can do is still only this.

### Time for Decisive Fate in Sight - Mussolini Eager to Act - Convenes Important Meetings and Increases National Defense Expenditures - Relations Between Britain, France, and Italy Have Reached a Critical State

London - Neutral diplomats are deeply concerned about the possibility of Italy joining Germany in the war. Various rumors here yesterday indicated that Germany's conquest of the Netherlands and rapid occupation of most of Belgium may prompt Prime Minister Mussolini to take action. The recall of the Italian ambassador to Madrid to Rome and the recent diplomatic talks between Italy and Egypt are seen here as related to Italy's preparations to join the European war. According to some neutral diplomatic sources, Italy is trying hard to induce Spain to join the German-Italian axis. If Spain joins the German-Italian side in the war, it can assist Germany and Italy in attacking British Gibraltar on land. The cannons that Germany shipped in during the Spanish Civil War are said to have been installed in the Sierra Ronda, and their range can reach the British fortresses defending the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. It is believed here that the Spanish dictator Franco is willing to avoid joining the war between the Allied powers and Germany, but this cannot erase the fact that Franco once requested German and Italian assistance to overthrow the Spanish National Government. Well-informed sources say that Italy has also pressured Egypt to conclude a non-aggression treaty, which, if Italy goes to war with Britain, could undermine the interests of the British-Egyptian alliance of 1936. It is understood that Egypt has strongly rejected this, but Italy's diplomatic efforts have not stopped. (Associated Press, 15th)

Rome - The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia recently stated that the time for deciding the fate, happiness, and historical events of Italy for the next century is now in sight. Those who usually advocate peace, who are full of themselves and claim to be friends of democratic countries, are actually trying to start a movement to shake Fascist confidence. Today, no one should pretend not to understand the correct goals of Fascist Italy in the European war. Those who still knowingly violate them will be treated as enemies. (Reuters, 15th)

Britain and France Pay Attention to Italian Interests

Paris - Relations between Britain, France, and Italy reached a critical state yesterday. While German mechanized units and air force launched fierce attacks on the Meuse, Albert, Longwy, and Moselle areas, attempting to capture the left flank of the Maginot Line, anti-British and anti-French news from Italy also reached Paris. Italian student movements and newspaper propaganda seemed to echo the German army's offensive. The French Ministry of Information issued a statement yesterday in response to Italy's protest against the British and French blockade, declaring that the implementation of the blockade by Britain and France has greatly affected Italian interests. The implementation of the blockade by Britain and France often takes a flexible approach, paying special attention to Italian interests. Britain and France have always considered Italy's legitimate economic interests and have repeatedly contacted Italian officials and private individuals in order to maintain the normal state of British, French, and Italian commercial transactions. Britain and France have also carefully considered the issue of Italy's food needs, and Italy's imports have even increased compared to normal times. This is sufficient evidence that the cooperation between British, French, and Italian people has achieved results. All difficulties arising from naval policies have been submitted to a joint committee of experts for resolution. The joint committee often tries to resolve various difficulties in order to satisfy Italy. (Associated Press, 15th)

Rome - Italian Minister of Economy Riccardi delivered a speech in the Senate yesterday, fiercely criticizing the British and French blockade measures, forcefully stating that the result of the British economic blockade has caused significant losses to some neutral countries, especially countries with overpopulation and lack of raw materials, which are particularly harmed, and almost have no choice but to use force to defend their fair demands.

US to Evacuate Nationals from Italy

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull stated while hosting reporters that US authorities are currently warning American citizens in Italy to leave the country.

### New Italian Ambassador to Germany Assumes Post, Announces Aspirations Before Departure, To Strengthen Bilateral Relations

Rome - Italy's former Minister of Propaganda and newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, Alfani, departed from here last night for Berlin to assume his post. Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen were both present at the station to see him off. (Haitong, 15th)

Rome - Italy has recently dispatched a new ambassador to Berlin, who is also carrying a letter from Mussolini to Hitler. (United Press, 15th)

Berlin - The Berlin People's Observer interviewed Alvin, a reporter stationed in Rome, yesterday evening. Before the newly appointed Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfani, departed for Berlin to assume his post, he requested an audience to express his views. Mr. Alfani first mentioned the glorious commencement of the German army's offensive in the West. He then stated that, according to diplomatic custom, in my capacity as the newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, I declare my aspiration to strengthen the relations between the two countries. However, the Rome-Berlin Axis has already stood the test of time, and the interests of the two countries have long been intertwined. Therefore, this declaration of aspiration is not sufficient to express my true feelings. I only wish to solemnly state that the unity of Germany and Italy is due to the common good foundation of the two revolutions, and even more so because both countries have leaders of the great era. These two great leaders both rose from the people and deeply understand the traditions, desires, and needs of the people. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

### Japanese Planes Attack Lishui Several Times on Moonlit Night: Thirty-Three Planes Invade in Four Waves, Dropping Over Two Hundred Bombs

Jinhua Correspondence: Lishui in southern Zhejiang, originally the leading county of the Quzhou Prefecture, has suffered repeated bombings by Japanese planes last year. The city and houses have suffered losses. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 PM on the 15th of April, twelve Japanese planes suddenly sneaked in from the Jiangxi border, taking advantage of the moonlit night to attack. They flew in batches over the city area, first dropping five or six flares, instantly illuminating the area as if it were daytime. Then, they lined up and dropped bombs, bombing for an hour and a half. Over a hundred bombs fell inside and outside the city. In Cangqian Main Street, West River Bank in front of the Prefectural Office, Dashuidou Main Street, Huxiao Gate, Suichang Road, inside and outside the city walls, and the prison guardhouse, etc., over twenty bombs fell, destroying sixty or seventy houses, killing over twenty people, and injuring over thirty. The prison guardhouse was hit by four bombs. The deceased included guards Xie Zhishu, and prisoners Yuan Feiwu, Chuan Chuntai, Jiang Changxing, Zhou Tuhe, Liu Taofangou, Chen Pinhua, Zhu Lianfang, and one other person whose flesh and blood were unrecognizable, totaling eight people. Twelve prisoners were injured. Director Li Xiaozhong was also seriously injured.

Not long after the air raid alert was lifted, unexpectedly, a second batch of five Japanese planes invaded Lishui again at 4:15 AM on the 16th, circling and spying before leaving. A third batch of five Japanese planes attacked Lishui again at 5:00 AM, dropping thirty or forty bombs in the suburbs. Shortly after, seven more planes came and dropped sixty or seventy more bombs in the suburbs. One bomb fell on Huangni Mountain outside Liyang Gate, slightly injuring two people.

When the Japanese planes attacked, a resident surnamed Mou on Cangqian Heng Street hurriedly evacuated without extinguishing the remaining fire, causing a fire. At that time, officers and soldiers of a certain division's quartermaster office, disregarding their own safety, desperately tried to put out the fire under the circling Japanese planes, eventually extinguishing the flames. This fire destroyed over twenty civilian houses and caused a major disaster. The spirit of righteousness and courage demonstrated by the officers and soldiers of a certain division's quartermaster office is especially commendable.

### Chinese Troops in Dinghai Suddenly Attack Japanese Troops in the County Seat, Simultaneously Attacking Shenjiamen

Ningbo Correspondence: The Chinese Anti-Japanese Guard Brigade ×××× various teams, which had penetrated deep into the Dinghai urban area, launched a fierce attack on the east and west gates at 9:00 PM on April 29th. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and responded in a panicked manner, resulting in a chaotic situation. As a result, the Japanese headquarters at the old site of the county party headquarters in the city, and the Zhoushan Power Plant in Dongdou Nei, were both bombed and burned down. The residence of the puppet civil affairs section chief He Chuicang was also destroyed by fire. That same night, guerrillas in Shenjiamen also launched a surprise attack, inflicting considerable losses on the Japanese troops. Currently, the Japanese troops are mobilizing warships to patrol various islands, ostensibly to show off their strength, but the guerrilla units are determined to inflict serious blows on the Japanese troops.

### Japanese Goods Smuggled into the Mainland via Fujian, Sent by Postal Parcels, Reaching 500,000-600,000 Yuan Per Month, Fujian Authorities Have Strictly Prohibited It

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the implementation of the blockade of various ports in Fujian Province in the summer of the year before last, anti-Japanese goods agencies have been set up everywhere. At the same time, the military and civilians along the coast have also closely cooperated, and the work of preventing and arresting spies has been very effective. The Japanese side's method of relying on gangsters to smuggle in large quantities has been difficult to implement, so they have changed their strategy. They set up pharmacies in Gulangyu, first using expensive Korean ginseng and deer velvet, sending them by postal parcels to spies lurking in nearby coastal areas, ordering them to sell them cheaply. Initially, they entered through Tong'an and Haicheng, two places opposite Xiamen and Gulangyu, and were sold by spies to pharmacies and local despots in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Ordinary merchants and civilians who are greedy for profit and forget righteousness also constantly remit money to the Zhen Da and Guang Ming pharmacies in Gulangyu to order ginseng and velvet by mail, and gradually extended from ginseng and velvet to other medicines and cloth. Those who bought them also gradually expanded from the coastal areas of southern Fujian to the inland areas of northwestern Fujian. The amount of money remitted each month reached as much as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Recently, these mailed Japanese goods have even reached Zhangshu and Leping counties in Jiangxi Province. Because of transportation relations, Pucheng and Jian'ou on the Fujian-Zhejiang border, and Shaowu and Guangze on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, are particularly concentrated places for mailing Japanese goods. Every day, postal parcels are sent from Gulangyu, which has aroused the close attention of the authorities, ordering the postal inspection agencies to conduct careful inspections, and many cases have indeed been cracked. It is now heard that the traitors have changed their methods again, sending the smuggled drugs and cloth parcels to remote towns with only postal agency offices to avoid inspection, and then entrusting people to transport them to the cities. At the same time, because the transportation of opium from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou is difficult and the price is rising every day, and it is not easy to buy, the Japanese side also distributes opium planted in the occupied areas and manufactured morphine to pirates to offset their military expenses. The pirates exchange it with traitors and civilians along the coast for food and various local products, which has a serious impact on the people.

### Recent News from Taizhou: Guerrilla Teams Will All Be Incorporated into the Regular Army

The Continental Daily reported from Taizhou, northern Jiangsu, that, according to responsible persons, the guerrilla units currently fighting in this area will all be incorporated into the regular national army starting from June 30th. Outside Taizhou city, affected by the war, bandits are gradually becoming rampant. Recently, two American female missionaries and one German missionary from Taizhou and Xinghua were stopped by six bandits posing as guerrillas two miles outside the south gate of Taizhou while heading to Shanghai. Under the pretext of inspection, they robbed them of watches and jewelry. The authorities tried their best to investigate, but have not yet captured them. The 600 elementary school teachers in Taizhou and its suburbs have recently suffered from high living standards. The county government has asked the public-spirited people to meet and discuss improvements. As a result, 100,000 yuan was raised, and the provincial authorities obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to announce that land tax in this area will be increased by 1.6 cents per mu starting this year to permanently guarantee the lives of teachers. Five days ago, the Japanese army (16 miles south of Taizhou at the port) attacked the guerrilla team at Diaojiapu, 12 miles north of the port and only 24 miles from Taizhou, in three routes. They were defeated by the guerrillas, so Taizhou remained peaceful as usual. Last week, the Japanese army clashed with the guerrillas outside the city of Gaoyou. The Japanese army was unable to advance eastward. The automobile road built by the central government three years ago from Nantong along the Yangtze River to Yangzhou was destroyed by the guerrillas after the war broke out. It is now heard that the Japanese army in various places on the north bank of the Yangtze River is currently repairing the road.

### Wuxi's Urban and Rural Areas: Extortion and Kidnapping Occur Frequently, Puppet Troops Do Anything for Little Pay

Wuxi Correspondence: Recently, the puppet troops in Wuxi have been extorting, kidnapping, and stealing due to the shortage of military pay. Not long after the bombing incident at the Wan Da South Goods Store on North Main Street, at 10:00 AM on the 9th, Shao Yingbao, who was serving as a guard in the puppet army, suddenly delivered a threatening letter to the Hong Maoshan Goods Store in Beihang, demanding 1,000 yuan, agreeing to meet at the Daxin Hotel on the 10th to negotiate. The store then sent the apprentice Hua Ronggen to talk about the publication, and secretly reported to the Japanese military police and puppet police, who arrested Shao and made him confess that his accomplices were in the Liaoxi Hotel, and arrested Wu Jiexian, Li Yaoting, and four others, and handed them over to the Japanese military police for handling. Although the Japanese side ordered the puppet army commanders to strictly supervise the puppet army, the puppet army's internal components were complex and their monthly pay was meager, so it was still impossible to rectify them.

### Jiangyin's Yellow Croaker Season Declines: Puppet Water Patrol Chief Shot Dead

Jingjiang Correspondence: In Chengyi, every early summer, there is usually a yellow croaker season, with the area from Huangtiangang outside the north to Puhui Bridge as the concentration point for fishing boats. Fish shops line up, selling to Xiwu and various villages in this county. Villagers also use salted yellow croaker as a side dish during the busy farming season. The annual sales must be two to three million catties. In the past two years, after being occupied by the Japanese army, Huangshan flowed eastward, and there was a blockade line. All the fishing boats have gathered in Hupu, and Jiangyin's yellow croaker season has stopped from then on. The yellow croaker sold in the city and villages is mostly transported from Shanghai and Xiwu. In the past, at this time of year, there would be a surge in arrivals and the price would be very cheap. The situation is different this year. The fishing grounds along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are unstable, and the livelihoods of fishermen are even more difficult, resulting in a sharp decline in this year's fish production and a sudden decrease in arrivals. At the same time, because consumption has not decreased, there is a shortage of goods. Recently, the price of large yellow croaker has suddenly risen to 70 yuan per dan, which is seven times higher than in the past. Yellow croaker is a common food, so expensive, other foods can be imagined. Huangtiangang outside the north of Jiangyin is an important gateway to the north and south of the Yangtze River. The county government had set up a puppet water patrol team, led by Jiang Zhuzhou as the puppet patrol chief, specifically to collect boats coming and going, asking for money and hating bones. A few days ago, Jiang was suddenly shot and killed by a Jingjiang mobile team near Junshan Lane. Afterwards, the Japanese troops stationed at the port searched the households, but nothing was recovered.

### Islands in Eastern Fujian Recaptured One After Another; Only Xiaomai Island Remains Occupied by Pirates

Fuzhou Correspondence: Many coastal islands in Fujian Province have been occupied by pirates colluding with the Japanese forces, using them as bases to attempt to invade the coastal borders. In recent months, due to the weak Japanese forces and the inability to hold on firmly, those that have been successively recaptured by the Chinese army include Pingtan, Meizhou, and Gantang Islands. Nanri Island, the second largest island in eastern Fujian, is located between Pingtan and Meizhou Islands and has been designated as a special zone by the provincial government. Last winter, it was also occupied by pirates colluding with the Japanese. After Pingtan and Meizhou were successively recaptured, the island's situation became isolated. On April 1st, the Chinese army stationed in Putian was ordered to cooperate with local teams to set off by sailboat from a certain place to attack the island. At 5:00 AM on the 2nd, they sailed to Nanri. The army jumped ashore and pounced on the island in different directions. The pirates occupying the island were extremely panicked when they suddenly saw a large army approaching, and fled in confusion to the southeast. The army followed and pursued them, and the bandits eventually retreated in small groups, seized boats, and fled into the sea. Nanri Island was thus completely recaptured, and the islanders saw the light of day again, and everyone was happy. Men, women, old and young, vied to cook rice and slaughter chickens to reward the soldiers. The soldiers took the opportunity to persuade the people to organize armed forces to defend their homes to prevent the pirates from making a comeback. The islanders have been deeply affected by the poison and know that without armed self-defense, there is no determination. (According to Nanri Island, the people's guns are mostly purple) They are extremely willing to listen to the government's command and jointly defend the isolated island. On the 3rd, the Chinese army again went to Dongshan Island and Xiaonanri Island to clear out the remaining bandits. Currently, there is no place for the pirates to hide near Nanri Island, and local order has been restored. The people's self-defense team has also been established, and there is no need for a large army to be stationed on the island for a long time. Except for leaving a part to assist the people's self-defense team, the rest have returned to their original posts.

Currently, among the coastal islands in eastern Fujian, only Xiaomaiyu, Mazu Ao, Chuanshi Mountain, and a few other places are still occupied by pirates. After the pirate leader of eastern Fujian (i.e., the pseudo-Fujian Civilian Army Second Route Commander) Yu Ahuang died of serious injuries, the remaining vacancy was filled by Wang Fumin, the pseudo-deputy commander dispatched by the Japanese navy commander in Xiamen. Wang and Yu Ahuang's uncle Ahou and pseudo-chief of staff Lin Shaoping have long been at odds, and are currently brewing a conflict.

### Record of the Second National Advanced Normal Education Conference (I)

— Yi De

President Chen, Minister of Education, delivered a speech with profound significance; Discussing the problems of normal colleges is the foundation of national construction

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) At 3:00 PM on April 25th, the 29th year, the second National Advanced Normal Education Conference opened after frequent air raid alarms. The venue was located in the new house auditorium of the Ministry of Education in Lianglukou, Chongqing. It was decorated with Sichuan-produced porcelain and arranged with historical teaching aids from Southwest Associated University, including historical photos, maps, models, and biographies of ancient people, all of which were to show the greatness of the Chinese nation and arouse national self-confidence.

Attendees

There were 34 attendees in total, some of whom were normal school principals and chief instructors such as Li Zheng, Huang Yusheng, Wang Jin, Yuan Dunli, Cha Liangzhao, and Xu Kesi. The other part was personnel from the Ministry of Education, such as Wu Junsheng, Zhang Yi, Chen Lijiang, Gu 森, Gu Yiqiao, Cheng Qibao, Zhou Shang, and Bu Shuang. The chairman was Minister of Education Chen Lifu.

Minister Chen's Speech

The chairman's opening speech was indeed of profound significance. He spoke in a relaxed, slow, and unhurried tone, saying that it had been three years since the restoration of the normal college system. Originally, this kind of conference should be held once a year, but it was suspended for a year because of the convenience of the Ministry of Transportation. After the interruption of this system, there must be many problems in the middle that are worth discussing from time to time. Whether the normal college is related to the perfection of national construction and whether future education can be improved depends on whether the normal college's plan can be implemented. Normal colleges affect all kinds of education at all levels more than other education institutions.

Now the level of middle schools is declining. Is it because middle school teachers only prepared to teach others when they were studying? They have not received training in teaching methods in ordinary schools, so problems will naturally arise when they go out to teach others, just like untrained soldiers going to war. In the past few years, universities blamed middle schools, and middle schools blamed teacher training, blaming each other. The unified enrollment statistics in the past two years have really made me worry about the future of the country. The basic subjects of the students are unexpectedly bad. Among 20,000 people, only 10 people passed each subject with a score of 60. Some people said that the questions were difficult, maybe they were, but as I see it, when I took the university entrance exam, there were more questions and the level was deeper. It seems that there should have been progress in more than 20 years since the sixth year of the Republic of China, but it is disappointing.

Even if the questions are difficult, a discount will not work. Some students cannot do a single question. Last year's Chinese composition topic was to describe the four seasons. Those who have read a little English can also write a few sentences, but many people cannot write. Among 3,000 people in Chongqing, those who got zero points accounted for one-third. Is this the depth and difficulty of the questions? The badness of mathematics, physics, and chemistry will scare people when you look at it. Some people say that the unified enrollment happened during a turbulent period, so the level plummeted. But there are schools that do not change, such as Southwest and Northwest, etc., but in fact, they are also a mess. With the decline of basic sciences and the lack of improvement in middle schools, the foundation of the country cannot be stable. I hope this conference will pay special attention to this seriousness and see if the cause of this bad situation is teaching poorly or managing strictly. From this perspective, normal colleges must be reorganized now and be responsible for the future.

As a result of inspections in various aspects: (1) Elementary schools cannot be said to have not made progress. For example, common sense, discipline, and vitality are all better than in the past, especially the teaching materials and teaching methods are more substantial and complete. (2) The mess of middle schools is indescribable. We must now rush to remedy it. Normal colleges should help the education department use the best and fastest methods to improve it. In the future, how normal colleges will train students to serve as good instructors, manage strictly, and teach brilliantly.

Whether the management, education, health, and security of a country are good or not can show whether the country is good or not. (1) In our country's health affairs, in this war, we have observed that the military has made rapid progress, and we have learned good teaching methods from this war. (2) In terms of health, our economy is lacking, and we must create it to achieve sufficient food and soldiers to meet the requirements of the times. (3) If the Baojia system is well organized, it can also progress. Management is nothing more than law and discipline. With these two conditions, management is easy to solve. (4) The aspect of education is a big concern. Whether it meets the requirements of the country is still questionable. In the National Education Conference, teacher training was discussed, and there were problems with both quantity and quality. The normal college problem discussed today is the foundation of national construction. If education is not good, management, health, and security will all be ungrounded. For such a conference, the responsibility is really heavy.

If a storm occurs in a normal college, it is a shame. If a teacher does not respect himself to such an extent, how can he teach others? This must be corrected. The Ministry of Education is determined to be the backing. Normal college students should obey discipline and orders one step ahead of others, and at the same time, the spirit of research should also be particularly interesting. Other schools should not be casual about the instructor system, but normal colleges should study why it is not good and find a way to improve it. Normal colleges must sincerely accept and experiment with the things that the superiors require them to do.

We must recognize that the Ministry of Education is the normal college, and the normal college is the Ministry of Education. The normal college system is being promoted, and it is a common thing for the Ministry of Education and the school to get together quickly. Today, we should speak out thoroughly about the bad points of the normal college in the past without being polite. Everyone should be responsible for the country and improve the teacher training in various provinces, starting with people and laws. For example, whoever teaches physics best should use his methods and teaching materials for everyone to use. Normal colleges have been running for three years, and there are still three years of training time. In these three years, the shortcomings of the current middle school teachers should also be studied as soon as possible to find such a curative method, and it is hoped that this conference will discuss more and more to obtain satisfactory results.

### The National Government Increases Vocational Education Funding by 400,000

A total of 1.2 million this year (Chongqing, 15th) In recent years, the government has paid great attention to production education. The expenses for various vocational schools that the Ministry of Education plans to add are quite large. The budget for production education in the national budget for this year is 800,000 yuan. The Ministry of Education is now expanding various vocational education programs and plans to ask the government to add 400,000 yuan to the budget, which has been approved by the National Government.

### Overseas Chinese Education Correspondence School: Enrollment is Enthusiastic, Enrollment Period Extended to the End of June

(Chongqing Airmail) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has established an overseas Chinese education correspondence school in order to facilitate the further study of teachers and staff in overseas Chinese schools and improve overseas Chinese education. It has issued an order for current teachers and staff in overseas Chinese schools to enroll in school for training, and has set March 25th of this year as the deadline for enrollment and March 29th as the official opening date. Later, due to difficulties in postal transportation, the enrollment application forms of various students were mostly unable to arrive on time, so the deadline for enrollment was extended to the end of June, and the school will open on July 1st. Currently, the number of applicants has reached over a thousand, which can be described as enthusiastic.

### Chinese Zoologist Lu Dingheng Dies of Illness in Yunnan

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Supplementary Education Federation, Qian Guokai, Goes to Chongqing, Publishes the Process of Establishment in Hong Kong

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Qian Guokai, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Supplementary School Teachers and Staff Union, was ordered to come to Hong Kong from Shanghai to wait for a flight to Chongqing. A reporter from Dahua News Agency visited him, and he informed us about the situation in the Shanghai supplementary education sector. According to him, although supplementary schools are not orthodox schools, their scope is broad and their nature is important, which is unmatched by any school. The level of students in supplementary schools includes universities, colleges, middle schools, and even elementary schools, and the students' identities include people from all walks of life, including scholars, farmers, workers, and businessmen, so supplementary schools can be said to be the "think tanks" of all walks of life. My intention to give up everything in Shanghai to run supplementary schools is also here. The Shanghai Municipal Supplementary School Teachers and Staff Union that I initiated and organized aims to promote and develop supplementary school education. In the past three months, nearly nine-tenths of the city's supplementary schools have participated, which shows the sincerity of the supplementary school colleagues in supporting the national anti-Japanese and nation-building policy, etc.

### The Li Family's Will in Hefei Donated to the French Board of Directors, Stored by the Aurora University Library

The Li family in Hefei has a collection of 18,000 volumes of books from the Wangyun Caotang, and recently, for the convenience of social people to consult, all of them were donated to the Shanghai French Concession Public Board of Directors, so that the bureau can circulate the books. Because there is no public library in the concession at present, and the Aurora University Library is open to the public and well-managed, the collection of books was transferred to the library for sorting and cataloging. In order to commemorate Li's righteous act this time, the funds were raised and Aurora University was instructed to set up a special room to store the books. It is now heard that the arrangement has been completed, and on the 20th of this month, the French Consul General will preside over the opening ceremony and invite Chinese and foreign people to visit.

### Reorganization of Datia Alumni Association

(Dahua News Agency) The Datia University Alumni Association in this city has been suspended indefinitely since the outbreak of the war, so that the graduated alumni scattered in this city have rarely had the opportunity to contact. It is now learned that many graduated alumni of the school have obtained instructions from the Changju of Guiyang Datia University and are responsible for reorganizing the graduated alumni association, improving the organizational structure, and that the reorganization has been completed. Qian Guokai and other five people were elected as executive directors, and Qian was mutually elected as the chairman of the executive directors. In addition to reporting to the competent authorities and the authorities of the two schools in Qianhu for filing, they are now actively registering graduated alumni.

### Gold Plunges, Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens, Legal Tender Value Strengthens, Unified Public Bonds Rise Across the Board, Victory in Hubei and Henan Greatly Impacts Market

Since May 2, when speculators colluded to cause a tightening of foreign exchange and an abnormally high inflation in the financial market of this city, the opposite situation has suddenly occurred since the 14th. The exchange rate against the US dollar has reached $5.375, and the gold price has shrunk to within the $6,000 range. Foreign stocks have also plummeted. In addition, the markets for important goods have all fallen accordingly. Rumors have sprung up, such as the sudden news that Abe has flown to Hong Kong, and those with limited knowledge believe that peace between China and Japan is expected, and they have released foreign exchange. Yesterday, the market also spread incredible news such as the retreat of Japanese troops from Jiujiang and a turning point in the European situation towards peace. As a result, the market fell into chaos again. The details of the situation learned from various sources are as follows:

Gold and Black Market Exchange Rate Both Plummet

The cash exchange rate once plummeted to $300 the day before yesterday, but when the market opened yesterday, the decline was even more severe. It initially started at $6,530, then gradually decreased, falling below the $6,000 mark to $5,850. By noon, there was a slight rebound, reaching $6,030. The difference between the two days was about $1,000. Compared with the peak of $7,200 on the 2nd of this month, the price plummeted by $1,170. As for the black market exchange rate, the morning opening for the British pound was 3 pence 71875, and by noon it rose to nearly 4 pence, at 3 pence 9375. The morning opening for the US dollar was $4.9375, and it also gradually rose above the $5 mark. The noon closing was $5.1875, and the highest was $5.375. There was no market in the afternoon as usual on Wednesdays.

Foreign Stocks Also Plunge

During the financial turmoil on the 2nd of this month, foreign stocks had soared, but this was actually due to the blind following of general investors in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, they also fell sharply. For example, Jardine Matheson's stock had already fallen by more than ten yuan the day before yesterday, and yesterday it fell to the buying price, worth only $75. Compared with the previous closing price of $95, it fell by a huge $20. Other stocks such as Union Insurance, Jardine Matheson, Rubber, Telephone, Tram, etc., also did

Foreign Currency Prices Small, Japanese Yen Plummets

not fall. As for the closing exchange rates for foreign currencies at noon, the British pound note has retreated to $140, the British gold note has retreated to $55, the US gold pound has retreated to $144.5, the US dollar note has retreated to $18.65, the Hong Kong dollar note has retreated to $3.9, and the Japanese yen has retreated to $1.21. Although there was no market in the afternoon, US dollar notes traded over-the-counter were as low as $17.7 around 3:30 yesterday afternoon, and $18.1 at 4:00 PM. The Japanese yen note plummeted even more, falling to $1.15 in the afternoon. The market price last Saturday was $1.28, and the Japanese yen fell by a total of $0.13.

Foreigners Rush to Buy Legal Tender

The reason for the market fluctuation is that the victory in the Hubei and Henan battle has strengthened everyone's belief in the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the legal tender. The public bond market has been rising continuously. Those who previously bought foreign exchange with legal tender have also realized that it is wrong. In addition, overseas Chinese, in view of the unrest in various places, have transferred their funds back. This is also one of the reasons for the loosening of foreign exchange positions. In the speculative market in Shanghai, foreigners account for an important position. With the expansion of the European war and the news that the Netherlands did not resist, foreigners in Shanghai were afraid that the financial policies of various countries would change, so they deposited their funds in Chinese banks. Foreign banks' positions were tight, so they had to release foreign exchange and foreign stocks.

Speculators Wake Up, This is the Time

According to a financial expert, although this turmoil was caused by rumors, it shows that if China wins the Anti-Japanese War, the restoration of foreign exchange to its original state and the return of prices to normal will be easily achieved. It is hoped that those who misunderstand the current financial situation and engage in speculation will wake up as soon as possible. According to an economic expert, when the black market exchange rate tightened on the 2nd of this month, general merchants in this city immediately raised the prices of all kinds of goods, whether they were local or foreign. In fact, they imported foreign goods before the black market exchange rate tightened. Even if the cost increased, it would be at least three months later. They took advantage of the situation to seek profits, which has a great impact on the livelihood of civilians. Since local goods have nothing to do with the rise and fall of foreign exchange, it is even more unreasonable. Now that gold has fallen sharply and the black market exchange rate has loosened significantly, all general prices will inevitably fall significantly, which is an inevitable principle and trend of economics.

### National Bonds Soar, Buying Interest Strong

In the Shanghai Securities Exchange's gray market, unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E all soared in price and buying interest was strong due to the victory of the Nationalist army in Henan and Hubei and the encouragement of the people. At the same time, the government is determined to maintain credit. After the market opened yesterday, the price fell by one to six cents due to the successive closing of floating accounts. In the afternoon, it soared again. The closing prices are recorded as follows: Type A closed at $59.70 in the morning and $60.40 in the afternoon. Type B closed at $51.45 in the morning and $52.25 in the afternoon. Type C closed at $49.35 in the morning and $50.10 in the afternoon. Type D closed at $48.50 in the morning and $48.85 in the afternoon. Type E closed at $50.05 in the morning and $50.90 in the afternoon.

Allocating Special Funds to Repay Principal and Interest

The Ministry of Finance allocates funds to central banks for storage to repay the principal and interest of national bonds that are due, in accordance with the regulations of each public bond. National bonds guaranteed by customs duties, such as unified public bonds, revival public bonds, and long-term financial public bonds, are discounted and paid by the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture. The payment dates for national bonds are as follows: (1) The tenth principal and interest payment of the Yuping Railway Public Bonds will be made on May 31. (2) The ninth principal and interest payment of unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E will be made on July 31. (3) The ninth principal and interest payment of revival public bonds will be made on August 31. (4) The principal and interest payment of long-term financial bonds will be made on September 30. (5) The interest payment of national salvation public bonds will be made on August 31.

### Cleaners and Night Soil Workers Continue Strike and Stage Demonstration

At around 7:00 AM yesterday, 400-500 cleaners and night soil workers gathered at Meibai Ge Road and Xinzha Road and staged a demonstration, overturning several garbage and night soil carts in the middle of the road, blocking traffic and causing a foul odor, forcing pedestrians to cover their noses. Trams on Route 3 and buses on Route 10 were blocked. A large number of detectives arrived and dispersed the crowd. The debris on the road was cleared by ambulances. Some workers moved large stones from somewhere and placed them on the tracks on Zhejiang Road. A tram on Route 5 could not brake in time and collided with the stones, shattering all the windows. The Jing'an Temple Police Station in western Shanghai believed that the piles of garbage in the road damaged the appearance of the city, and forced the cleaners to sweep the streets at around 7:00 AM. The cleaners refused, and the police arrested the head of the workers (Zhao Shangshan). The demands of the cleaners and night soil workers are listed as follows. They demand that temporary workers be converted to permanent workers and that all treatments be equal to those in the French Concession.

Night Soil Workers

Night soil workers also sent representatives Shen Zhaohuai and Wang Zeshun to the Public Works Bureau and the Political Department for direct negotiations, and proposed to calculate the remuneration according to the number of carts. The original remuneration for each night soil cart was six cents, and they demanded an increase of two cents to eight cents. The price for each chamber pot was changed from twenty-one cents per month to thirty cents. At the same time, they demanded that the night soil owner give them an additional ten yuan of rice subsidy per month, but so far they have not been successful.

Cleaners

Cleaners and road workers once again negotiated with the Public Works Bureau and the Political Department yesterday. The Bureau especially changed the wages to one yuan per day (except for night soil workers). Other conditions were ignored. The labor representatives believed that they were not satisfied, so the strike continued today. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union, in response to the joint request of road workers Wang Guanguo and others for justice, forwarded a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting that the wages be appropriately increased and rice subsidies be provided, and the Bureau has been asked to review it.

### Market Rumors Abound, Speculators Helpless, Forcing Prices to Fall, Misguided Hoarders Rush to Sell, Rice, Coal, and Daily Necessities are Sold at Reduced Prices

The high prices in Shanghai have reached a severe state, all caused by speculators hoarding and profiteering. In the past, purchasing foreign exchange was a shortcut to wealth, but now it has become hoarding goods. As a result, imported goods such as pigments, paper, steel needles, foreign coal, hardware, etc., have soared. Now, due to the rumors in the market, the rise in the exchange rate, and the fall in gold prices, people are unsettled, and hoarders are rushing to sell, so the prices of various goods have fallen. Yesterday, rice prices plummeted, and the yarn price decline is becoming more severe, causing hoarders to suffer.

Prices are Stable in the French Concession

The Shanghai Taisha Times reported that a person from the Price Stabilization Committee in the French Concession told reporters that food prices in the French Concession are now stable and fairly reasonable. The prices of local products are the same as before the recent depreciation of the legal tender and have not increased. However, the prices of imported goods have naturally risen greatly due to the depreciation of the legal tender. The Price Stabilization Committee has not set

Maximum Prices

Therefore, no one has been prosecuted for excessive pricing, but many shop owners have been prosecuted for reducing the weight of goods and adding impurities to food to deceive customers. As for the price of bread reaching 50 cents per pound, the Price Stabilization Committee hopes that it will fall soon. An official from the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession replied to reporters that the Bureau has not yet received reports of merchants hoarding and profiteering, so there has been no action to prosecute them according to the law. The Bureau

Will Investigate Reports

If reports are received. The "Foreigners' Vegetable Market" will be set up on the second floor of the Ba Xianqiao vegetable market at the end of this month to sell food for foreigners. It is also reported that the French Concession authorities are discussing with the Japanese to prevent the source of rice from being blocked. If it is not effective, they will further formulate laws to restrict speculation and hoarding, and set price limits. It is also hoped that the Public Concession authorities will take close cooperation to ensure that this plan has a significant effect.

Market Rumors Abound, Price Decline Severe

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Jinrong Market yesterday that the rumors in the market yesterday were completely speculations by the general public, such as the entry of the United States and Italy into the war and the devaluation of the US dollar. As for the peace talks between China and Japan, it has been confirmed that they are not true. Moreover, the Chinese authorities have strongly refuted the peace talks between China and Japan, which are absurd. China is still determined to resist Japan until the Japanese army completely withdraws from China. As for the saying that the Japanese army is withdrawing from China, it is said that due to the great victory of the Nationalist army in Henan and Hubei, the Japanese army was defeated miserably, and the Japanese army in the Yangtze River has withdrawn and is seeking peace with us. Due to the above reasons, the hoarders had to sell, and the price decline was severe. The market price of briquettes fell from 9.4 yuan per load last week to 8.5 yuan. Yesterday, after the briquette market opened at 1:00 PM, speculators were uneasy and sold their goods at reduced prices. As a result, except for the various grades of white coal that formed a hovering situation, the market price of briquettes fell by 6 yuan per ton. It is learned that the manufacturing cost of each briquette factory has been reduced, and its selling price will continue to fall. The price of Xian rice also fell significantly yesterday.

### Ticket Prices Increased on the Yuehan and Xianggui Railways

All national railways have increased the fare of all passenger tickets by 25% since May 11 of last year, originally scheduled to end at the end of the year. Now, according to the Ministry's order, the price increase method will be extended to the end of June of this year. It was recently learned that the passenger ticket price of the Yuehan Railway has increased by 80% according to the original price, and the freight has increased by 50%. Regarding grain, rice, coal, and other items, the special price will still be charged. The Yuehan Railway takes Hengyang as the center, south to Qujiang and north to Lukou (the station before Zhuzhou). The ticket price from Hengyang to Qujiang is 17.25 yuan for first class, 11.1 yuan for second class, and 5.55 yuan for third class. The ticket price to Lukou is 6.9 yuan for first class, 4.4 yuan for second class, and 2.2 yuan for third class. Now, all the above ticket prices have increased by 80%. The passenger ticket price of the Xianggui Railway has also increased. The ordinary express train ticket price from Hengyang West Station to Guilin South Station is 6.65 yuan for third class, double the price for second class, and double again for first class. Now, all the above ticket prices have increased by one-half. It was also learned that the Guiliu section of the road has also added a special night express train since May 1, departing from Guilin at 5:00 PM every day and arriving in Liuzhou at 4:30 AM the next morning, with first, second, and third class sleeper cars attached. The price of the third-class special express train ticket for the section has now increased to 5.48 yuan, double the price for second class, and double again for first class. Sleeper car tickets must be purchased separately.

### Opening of the South Huangpu Blockade Line, Foreigners Do Not Pay Attention, Japanese Warships Stationed in South Huangpu for Strict Inspection, Entry and Exit to Pudong is Blocked Again

According to Japanese sources, the blockade line on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, which has been blockaded for two and a half years, was opened yesterday. Reporters went to the Shiliupu area yesterday morning to inspect and saw that the original blocked entry and exit points to Pudong had been blocked again to continue salvage the sunken ships. The new entry and exit point to the south of the Ning Shao Wharf in Shiliupu, which was opened yesterday morning, is wider in area than the one in Pudong.

Strict Inspection of Ships Entering and Exiting

In order to prove that ships of more than 1,000 tons can enter and exit, the Japanese side sent a warship of similar tonnage for a trial voyage yesterday morning. Although it was able to pass safely, the speed was extremely slow. A Japanese navy "guard ship" is berthed at Ning Shao Wharf to guard the entry and exit points of the blockade line. Several Japanese navy personnel are stationed on the ship to strictly inspect small and wooden ships entering and exiting the blockade line. Looking at the east and west banks of the South Huangpu from afar, the broken walls and ruins are still in a desolate state, and no Chinese or foreign ships have been seen entering or exiting there.

Foreigners' Observations, Meaningless

Reporters asked a foreign authority about this matter yesterday. According to him, (1) Most of the foreign trade in the Yangtze River basin comes from the ports upstream of Nanjing, and this section of the waterway is still blockaded. Therefore, the so-called opening of the Yangtze River to give huge convenience to international trade is nothing more than a way to deceive the world, and it is still meaningless. By analogy, the opening of the Huangpu River is nothing more than this. (2) In the Chinese-controlled areas, the Japanese army is responsible for everything. The so-called "military necessity" is a mystery in the eyes of civilians. The so-called "economic development plan" is nothing more than an attempt to monopolize it. However, before the end of the war, this kind of Japanese deception is the same as the law. Experience has fully proven that, in short, the Japanese will not easily give up this kind of right they believe they have gained through "military success." The opening of the Huangpu River is just a "policy." The truth is self-evident.

### Norway's National Day, Grand Broadcast, 9:30 PM on the 17th, Consuls of France, Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands to Broadcast

The English Great American Evening Post reported that the consuls general of France, Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands stationed in Shanghai will broadcast at 9:30 PM on the 17th of this month, the 126th anniversary of the promulgation of the Norwegian Constitution, to show the unity of the four countries. First, the French Consul General Eugene will broadcast to welcome the Consuls of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway, and then the Dutch Consul General Baussévain, the Belgian Consul General Keersmaekers, and the Norwegian Consul General Giertz will reply and speak to overseas Chinese in various parts of China. The consuls will all broadcast in their native languages, and then rebroadcast in English and French. The radio station will also broadcast the national anthems and music of Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

### Jiangsu's Cargo Surface Explodes Suddenly, the Type of Object is Under Investigation, Six People Burned, the Shipment is Postponed

The British merchant ship Jiangsu, weighing 482 tons, was formerly managed by Tongyi Shipping Company and sailed on the lower Yangtze River Beisha Line. Because British ships were hindered by the Japanese Navy and transportation was light, it was suspended. Later, it was managed by Taichangxiang and sailed on the Hu'ou Line, but it was also blocked from time to time. Now, Baochang Company on the upper floor of the Guohua Bank in Shiliupu has leased it from Taichangxiang to sail to Songmen.

Docking to Load Cargo

The ship sailed to Jin Liyuan South Head, the former fishing boat pier in the French Concession, to load cargo the day before yesterday, and was scheduled to sail this morning. At around 6:00 PM yesterday, workers were moving cargo to load the ship. Unexpectedly, a cargo exploded suddenly

Sudden Explosion

While being placed on the second layer of the ship’s deck in the front cabin by two workers, the cargo suddenly exploded, immediately with flames and sporadic cracking sounds. After hearing the news, the shipowner immediately blew the whistle. The French Concession Fire Brigade was notified and drove to the fish boat pier in Shiliupu, dragging a hose to the ship to spray and extinguish the fire. At the same time, the Customs Fire Boat Pujiu also rushed to the scene and approached the Jiangsu ship to spray into the cabin to extinguish the fire. After about 20 minutes, the fire was extinguished.

Passengers Injured

At the time of the accident, there were already passengers in the cabin. It was reported that two men, three women, and one female child were burned. One of the men was severely burned and his life was in danger. A total of six people were injured and taken to the Guangci Hospital for treatment by ambulances from the French Concession Fire Brigade.

Source of Cargo

As for the cargo that exploded, the crew has confirmed that it is Customs Document No. 31, (Jude) Marton, a total of two pieces reported, handled by Xing (Hsinyeh, transliteration). What the cargo is is under investigation. Fortunately, the cargo that was burned was on the deck, so other cargoes were not affected, but many cargoes were wetted due to the water sprayed during the fire extinguishing, and the passengers' luggage was also wet and messy. They are now piled up together for identification.

Awaiting Inspection

The ship was originally scheduled to sail last night, but due to insufficient cargo loading, it was changed to export this morning. Now, due to the above-mentioned accidents, it must be inspected by the Customs and the insurance company before it can sail, so it is temporarily suspended from leaving Shanghai this morning. The export date will be determined after inspection.

### Xiangtai Labor Dispute Resolved

The thousand-plus workers of the British-owned Xiangtai Bank went on strike last week to demand that the factory improve their treatment, but they were not successful. It is now learned that the labor and management sides negotiated again yesterday and reached a resolution. The conditions accepted by the factory are as follows: (1) A monthly subsidy of 15 yuan per worker. (2) Wages will be paid as normal during the strike. The above conditions have been deemed satisfactory by all the workers and they will resume work today. The eight-day labor dispute has thus come to an end.

### Jishan Amusement Fair - Today's Exciting Program

Yesterday was the second day of the Jishan Amusement Fair, and the number of visitors doubled, because the female performers were the most famous five groups in Shanghai. Therefore, apart from being able to see a grand performance in the charity association, there is usually no such opportunity. The ticket income at the Renewal Stage alone was more than 4,000 yuan. Today, famous Shenqu opera artists Shi Chunxuan, Xiao Wenbin, Wang Xiaoxin, Liu Ziyun, and Shi Genfu will jointly perform the cautionary play "Poison of Inheritance." The national Xiangqi (Chinese chess) masters' charity competition and the Spanish bullfight, and other novel programs, will also begin today. The chess competition time is from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. The players will be Xue Weihan and Lian Xuezheng. The Henan "Hui (Muslim) Chaquan" and the Qunying Guoshu Troupe will hold Guoshu (Chinese martial arts) performances at the same time. The Hui Chaquan is making its debut in Shanghai. Guoshu enthusiasts should be able to learn from and observe it. The Shanghai amateur drama association's historical drama "Wen Tianxiang" will also be staged on time, inspiring national spirit. It is of considerable importance at this time. The enthusiastic welcome of "Wen Tianxiang" by the audience shows that the national righteousness is still awe-inspiring in the hearts of the people.

### Japanese Navy Threatens to Fire on Foreign Ships - Warns Shipping Companies Against Disobeying Orders of Japanese Gunboats

According to a reliable source from the Continental News, the Japanese Navy in this city has issued a formal warning to the shipping companies of various countries operating between Shanghai and Wenzhou regarding the need for foreign ships to obey the orders of Japanese gunboats. This warning was issued by a senior officer of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai to the foreign consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States in this city a few weeks ago, and relayed to the shipping companies. It stated that ships of third countries disregard the orders of Japanese gunboats in the Wenzhou area. If these ships disobey orders in the future, Japanese gunboats will take necessary measures. The orders are issued during the day with flag signals and verbal notifications, and at night with flashing light signals. There are rumors in this city that foreign ships have been identified by the Japanese Navy as disobeying orders and are now detained near Wenzhou, but this claim cannot be confirmed. According to informed sources, the Japanese warning clearly implies that Japanese gunboats will bombard or prevent the activities of foreign ships that disobey orders. It is noted that most of the ships traveling between Shanghai and Wenzhou are British and German merchant ships.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Finance Committee - Powell Appointed Chairman - Public Works Department Reduced and Renamed Architecture Division - Staff Reduction Does Not Affect Work Efficiency

It is reported that at the first meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council Finance Committee held the day before yesterday, Mr. Powell, the chairman of the committee, submitted his resignation, which was approved by the general meeting. However, Mr. Okamoto Kazuo, a Japanese member, proposed, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese member, seconded, that he be re-elected as chairman of the committee. The Finance Committee was originally composed of three members, but the annual meeting of Western taxpayers resolved to expand it to twelve members. Mr. Powell was the former chairman. Because the committee has been expanded, he automatically submitted his resignation, but he was finally re-elected.

Public Works Department - Staff Reduction Implemented

The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Committee held a meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss the reorganization of the Public Works Department into an Architecture Division. It was found that the reorganization of the Public Works Department has been underway for four years, and now it has reached the point where staff should be reduced. After the staff reduction, all positions will be concurrently held by other employees. The department handled very complicated construction projects from 1929 to 1935, but there are currently no large-scale construction projects, so the staff of the Architecture Division should be reduced to save money. Moreover, after the staff reduction, the efficiency of handling affairs will not be affected. The current Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, Mr. Strebford, is an architect. After the division is reorganized, Mr. Strebford will be in charge of it. The term of office of the current Chief Engineer and Deputy Chief Engineer of the division will end at the end of this month, and they will be given considerable retirement benefits to show consideration. After the Public Works Committee resolved the case, it was submitted to the regular meeting of the council on the 15th of this month for approval.

### Playing with Dangerous Objects - Two People Injured in Explosion

In a shed on Machi Road, Haifang Road, Shanghai West, Chuan Changfu (age 26), a Shaoxing native who specializes in collecting old copper and iron for a living, at about 11:45 AM yesterday, due to a bullet mixed in with the rotten copper and iron he collected, he struck it hard with an iron hammer, causing it to explode suddenly. Chuan's hands, face, and other parts were severely injured in the explosion and he fainted on the spot. He was later sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment by ambulance.

At about 3:15 PM yesterday, a child scavenger, Wang Genbao, about ten years old, in Kunming Road, Zhoushan Road, Shanghai East, found a bomb in a garbage can and played with it at will. The bomb suddenly exploded, and the child's leg was injured on the spot. Blood splattered everywhere, and he moaned incessantly. He was sent to Hudong Hospital for treatment by street patrolmen.

### Latvian Nationals in This City Celebrate Anniversary of Government Establishment - Held at Difeng Road Last Night - The Country Is United in Overcoming Difficulties

Latvian nationals in this city held a commemorative meeting at No. 86 Difeng Road at 7:00 PM yesterday to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the Latvian government. The meeting was presided over by Dr. Charles Ulmanis, president of the Latvian Overseas Association, and General Balodis. The Latvian government was established on May 15, 1934. After its establishment, officials and civilians worked hard to

Construction work has been quite successful. The Latvian President is particularly enthusiastic about supporting poor students, and has deposited a large sum of money in the Latvian Bank so that students can borrow money to go to school. Last year, Latvia signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, according to which the Soviet Union can station troops in Ventspils, Liepāja, and several airfields along the coast. However, this treaty does not affect Latvia's

internal affairs, nor does it interfere in its domestic politics. Latvia suffered greatly from the European War, and its shipping and commerce have been suspended. However, the authorities have set up various methods to overcome the difficulties. The people of the whole country cooperate with each other under the guidance of the authorities. For example, urban residents are sent to the countryside to help farmers cultivate the land, and factory workers are committed to collecting firewood for the winter and the coming summer. Various textile factories have also resumed work

The products are of excellent quality, and the whole country has resumed thrift, collecting waste iron and other useful materials, even collecting wood chips and wood ash as much as possible for the manufacture of soap and fertilizer. Coal smoke is also collected, as it is a necessary raw material for the manufacture of pigments. Therefore, Latvia is currently fighting against a bad environment, and its determination is commendable.

### Matricide and Patricide Case - Written Judgment of Appeal - Mentally Sound Without Any Debilitating Illness - Difficult to Conceal the Guilt with Retraction and Sophistry

The sensational case of patricide and matricide, after the initial trial by the Special Court No. 1, sentenced the main characters Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death, and their mother Zhou Jing to two years and six months in prison for helping to destroy the corpse. Because they were dissatisfied, they hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Jiang Baoli to file an appeal with the High Court No. 2. The appeal court has completed the trial and ruled that the appeal be rejected. The defendants still expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling and planned to file another appeal with the Supreme Court. The written judgment of the High Court No. 2 has been delivered to the relevant defense lawyers yesterday. The facts of the main text have been seen in the newspapers and are omitted. Now, the reasons for the judgment are extracted and recorded below.

It was found that Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang had confessed in detail to the fact that they jointly premeditated to kill their biological father, Zhou Yongjie, and dismember the corpse to conceal the crime, during the interrogation by the police, the autopsy by the prosecutor, and the trial in the original trial. They each testified against themselves and corroborated each other. They were all caught in the act of dismembering and destroying the corpse when they were arrested on the spot. In addition, the testimony of Western Deputy Detective Glockov, based on his direct observations obtained while performing his duties, clearly pointed out that the left and right corners of the forehead and the temples of the deceased Zhou Yongjie

all had electrical current stimulation marks, more than ten marks of wounds; the head was forcefully cut off; the right thigh had a yellow stain from nitric acid burns; the left knee was cut off with a knife; the right kneecap was sawn off with a saw; the face was corroded with sulfuric acid, resulting in blackening; the left and right fingers and the backs of both hands all had skin breaks from electrical current stimulation wounds. It was confirmed that he was electrocuted to death. In addition, the prosecutor of the original court, together with the forensic doctor, verified and filled out an autopsy report, which was kept in

the corpse dismemberment file. The murder weapon and the electric wires, scissors, screwdrivers, saw, rope, etc. used were also seized by detectives at the corpse destruction site and on the table in the house. They were also verified by the original merchants from whom they were purchased, Dakang, Yongtaixing, Ruikang, Fushengyong, and Zhonghua Medical Bureau, and invoices were obtained as evidence. Moreover, one end of the seized electric wire still had strands of the deceased's hair. The bed on which the deceased was electrocuted and the cloakroom where the corpse was temporarily stored both had blood stains. This is sufficient to show that Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang's confessions are all consistent with

the implementation of the truth, and cannot be denied by empty words after the fact. Although the purpose of the appeal is to completely shift the responsibility for killing a direct blood relative and destroying the corpse to Zhou Qinxiang alone, it is not only unfounded and difficult to believe, but also, if that were the case, why would Zhou Qinxiang and Zhou Qinji, immediately after plotting to kill their biological father, tell their mother and sister "Zhou Qinzhu" that it was their brothers who jointly committed the crime? Moreover, according to Zhou Qinzhu, "My feelings with my two younger brothers, Qinji and Qinxiang

are the same. I don't have a small grudge against my younger brother Qinxiang," which shows that Zhou Qinji's statement that "I heard Qinxiang say that he had killed our father, and I was afraid that my sister Qinzhu's relationship with Qinxiang was not good, and she would definitely report it to the authorities."

It is better to say to mother and sister that we two jointly killed him, so she might not report it to the authorities," is difficult to believe. Moreover, according to the detailed circumstances of the mother and son of the appellants described in the police station and in the original trial, when Zhou Qinxiang first touched the temple of Zhou Yongjie with the electric current, Zhou Yongjie shouted,

and Zhou Jing was awakened. She saw the lights in her husband and son's rooms were bright, and first shouted five or six times, then shouted one or two times, and then saw Ah Nan (referring to Qinxiang) come over. And from the actions of Zhou Qinxiang and others, after Zhou Yongjie shouted, he cut off the table lamp, and touched his father's whole body with two bundles of electric wires dozens of times, until he was breathless and the corpse was cold, and then wrapped the corpse with bedding and tied it with electric wires. All these actions must have taken

a long time. If the time experienced by Zhou Jing's above-mentioned actions is compared with each other, then the two brothers Zhou Qinxiang and others would not have had the opportunity to calmly plan and jointly confess in order to seek forgiveness from their sister. Moreover, if, as Zhou Qinji and others said, the murder of their biological father was committed by Zhou Qinxiang alone, then after Zhou Qinxiang suddenly heard of the tragic death of his biological father, even if the brotherly love was deep and he tried to cover up for him, judging from his current measures, not only was there no emotion of grieving for his father and resenting his brother, but even

he was willing to risk the great crime of treason for his brother, and he took the same measures as his brother in moving the corpse and planning to hide the corpse and destroy the traces, as if he only knew there was a brother and did not know there was a father. Such a violation of human feelings and reason is not something that could have happened in reality. Moreover, after the court's separate interrogation, the statements of Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang were different regarding the plan to jointly admit to killing their father and the order of moving the corpse to the cloakroom. Their situation of colluding and forging lies is even more obvious. As for killing the biological father and

destroying the traces, Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang went out of the house at the same time and went to the French Park to discuss how to dispose of the corpse for several hours. They both admitted this in this trial. They separately went to various shops to buy knives, saws, and other items used to destroy the corpse, and carried them back home together. They went up to the floor where the corpse was hidden, and were still living together in the same place when the detectives came to arrest them, carrying out the work of destroying the corpse. This was also confirmed by Zhou Jing, her maid Yang Pu, and Western Deputy Detectives, respectively.

Zhou Qinji and others cunningly claimed that Qinxiang returned home at three o'clock, and Qinji said that he did not arrive until about six o'clock. This is their conspiracy to evade responsibility and exclusively admit to the crime, and there is no doubt about it. Furthermore, Zhou Qinji repeatedly stated in the police station and in the original trial that he was 24 years old, and Zhou Qinxiang was 21 years old. Even if they were both born in December, they were both over 18 years old,

There are written records to prove this. However, after the appeal in this trial, Zhou Qinji suddenly claimed that he was 21 years old, and Zhou Qinxiang changed his claim to 18 years old. This was obviously a cunning attempt to obtain a lighter sentence. It is difficult to recognize as true. Moreover, after reviewing the ages recorded on various diplomas, Zhou Qinji was 18 years old in 1935, so calculating to the current year, he is 23 years old. Zhou Qinxiang was 20 years old in 1939, so calculating to this year, he is 21 years old. Both have reached 18 years old. Their

reduction of age defense has no benefit to the appellants. Furthermore, whether the appellants have mental debility was also carefully assessed by forensic doctor Wei Ligong, who submitted an assessment report, stating briefly that "The examination results show that the defendants' mental state is unchanged, their comprehension is complete during questioning, their memory and understanding are very good, and there are no abnormal physical phenomena.

### Major Fire on Maho Road Yesterday Afternoon - Ten Houses Destroyed - An Old Woman Burned and in Critical Condition - Thousand Yuan in Cash Suddenly Disappears

A fire broke out at about 2:30 PM yesterday on the second floor of Kuangmingji Beef and Mutton Office, No. 60 (Madrid) Lane 355, Maho Road, Dagu Road, Public Concession. The fire was raging and unapproachable. It affected the Da Jiangnan Shoe Factory at No. 68 and the house of a certain family at No. 64 next door. At that time, an old woman, Li Zhao, 71 years old, in No. 66, was burned all over her body because she was unable to escape. Her head was charred and her face was unbearable to look at. Afterwards, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital by ambulance. It is said that her injuries were very serious and her life was in danger. When the fire was raging, the Central Fire Brigade received a report and quickly drove to the scene to fight the fire. It was extinguished at about 3:00 PM. As for the cause of the fire, it was said that the house at No. 66 was cramped and crowded. It is said that a tipped-over candle on the mezzanine of the second floor of that house spread to the bedding, and it immediately became uncontrollable, breaking through the roof, causing the fire. It is also said that four people surnamed Jin (employees of Yitai Shipping Company) in the first house where the fire broke out had more than 1,000 yuan in national currency in a leather suitcase. When the fire broke out, they were too anxious to escape and did not have time to take it out. After the event, it was found that it had disappeared. Whether it was burned in the fire or stolen by someone in the chaos is currently under investigation. As for the second landlord surnamed Kuang of that house, he was arrested by the patrolmen after the event and taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for verification. A total of three houses were destroyed. There were about dozens of households affected. Because most of the residents there were operating small businesses, when the fire broke out, their wives and children cried, and the situation was very painful.

### Continued Hearing of Gu Zhuxuan Case - Witness Testimony

The case of Gu Zhuxuan being sued for inciting the murder of lawyer Wu Qilun was continued yesterday afternoon in the Criminal Division No. 1 of the Special Court No. 1, presided over by Judge Feng Shide. Lawyer Ru Baoyi from the police station stated that the subpoenas for witnesses Qiu Changsheng, Qiu Changyin, and Tianchan Teahouse manager Liu Zhenqiu and accountant Yan Hanqing had all been served separately, and requested that they be summoned. Qiu Changsheng was absent due to illness, so the court immediately summoned Qiu Changyin to court to inquire about the process of Wu's lawsuit against Qiu Changsheng and others.

According to Qiu Tang, the handling of how this matter involved litigation, how it was settled, the lawyer on the other side was Wu Qilun, and how I paid others for compensation, etc., were all handled by the Management Committee, and I knew nothing about it. Therefore, he replied to all the questions asked by the court that he did not know or understand. The court then summoned Liu Zhenqiu to the case. According to his testimony, Tianchan Teahouse is located at No. 222 Yu Qiaqing Road, and Gu Zhuxuan invested in it. Gu's nephew Yuebo registered to open it. Since Gu Yuebo returned to Jiangbei,

all the accounts, etc. were handed over to Gu Zhuxuan. Gu Zhuxuan did not come often, only occasionally when the Tianchan Stage was opened as a refugee shelter. However, the number was not large, but from the second half of last year until now, he has never been there once. In our accounting room, there is a writing desk, which is where I and the accountant sit. There are also five tea tables dedicated to regular customers for tea or hand talk gatherings. I, Changchun,

do not know him. I may be able to recognize Qiao Dahe Shang (Qiao Yaoshan) if I see him, but I have never seen him this month, nor have I seen Gu Zhuxuan come to talk to Qiao. As for whether Zeng Changchun is Gu's student, I don't know, etc. Then Yan Hanqing was summoned, and his testimony was the same as Liu's (omitted). The court then brought Zeng Changchun to the case and asked if he knew the two witnesses Liu and Yan. Zeng replied that he did not know them. At this point, the court stated that the case of murdering Wu Qilun

has been clarified, and ordered that the other theft cases committed by the defendants be proceeded with. The lawyers for the defendants Gu Zhuxuan, Wu Linkun and Jiang Pingfan, and the lawyer for Qiao Yaoshan, Wang Yaotang, requested to withdraw first and asked to be notified in advance when the defense was to be made. The court approved it. Judge Feng then proceeded with the theft case brought by the police station, and adjourned the hearing until dusk.

### Accountant of Jardine Matheson Embezzled Huge Sum - Chen Ruihua Confesses to Forging Signatures and Embezzlement - Case Requires Investigation and Return to Custody for Further Adjudication

Chen Ruihua, an accountant from Ningbo and assistant Lu Ruichang of the actual handling room of Jardine Matheson at No. 27 The Bund, recently caused a huge loss of 750,000 yuan in public funds in one month starting from March 27 due to operating in stock speculation. After the case occurred, the compradore Pan Zhiquan reported it to the General Patrol Room, and Hua Detective Kang Zengxiang arrested Chen and Lu.

The embezzled funds were seized

More than 50,000 yuan in cash and stocks with a face value of more than 600,000 yuan were handed over to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. This morning, the case was continued in Criminal Division No. 1 by Qian Hongcai, the presiding judge. The plaintiff Pan Zhiquan hired lawyer E Sen to bring a civil suit. Lawyer Ru Baoyi from the police station filed a complaint, stating that Chen Ruihua was being sued for embezzlement of business funds, and Lu Ruichang was being sued for aiding and abetting embezzlement. It was also stated that although the value of the seized stocks was

640,000 yuan, according to the estimated value of the embezzled funds seized during the previous court hearing, it was only about 99,000 yuan less. This was because the stock market price had fallen recently, and its value had also fallen accordingly. Therefore, the current calculation is still about 100,000 yuan short, etc. Questioned, Chen Ruihua confessed that according to the company's usual practice, when the general ledger room needed to use funds, the Westerner Mao would notify the compradore's room by memo, and the compradore would issue a check and ask me to send it. This time, I forged Mao's signature,

falsely obtained 750,000 yuan in cash checks from the compradore's room to operate in speculation, but it had nothing to do with Lu Ruichang, etc. After verifying the confession, the court ruled that the defendant be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date because the case still needed to be investigated.

The detective was staggering, and blood was flowing from his leg. After a closer look, it was discovered that it was caused by the accidental firing of his official handgun, which hit his leg.

Consecutive Four-Day Decline: Gold Price Plummets by Over a Thousand Yuan; Silver Businesses Prove Adept at Self-Preservation: Over Five Thousand Yuan Withheld in Jewelry

Yesterday, the cash price for gold fell precipitously on the black market, plummeting to a low of 6,000 yuan, reaching a low price of 5,800 yuan. The scale of the decline was truly astonishing. However, this newspaper had previously stated that the soaring price of gold was temporary and that those lacking the ability to manage their businesses should proceed with caution. The global situation is volatile, changing in an instant. Once there is a reversal, it would be extremely difficult to avoid. Who would have thought that in less than a month, it would become a reality? The reason for today's sharp fall is the major drop in the New York stock market, the persistent rumors of the United States joining the war, and the pervading atmosphere of peace between China and Japan in the market. The news that the Japanese army was automatically retreating to Jiujiang caused widespread panic, and the exchange rate soared. At that time, the price of gold also plummeted from 6,410 yuan to 5,800 yuan, a massive drop of over 700 yuan from the morning's opening price of 6,530 yuan. Although silver firms searched for opportunities to buy and money changers covered their short positions, the final price still slightly reached 6,570 yuan, breaking through the 6,000 yuan barrier. The securities firms sold 20 taels of gold at 5,800 yuan. Later, as the gold firms profited and covered their short positions, and the foreign exchange rate also softened slightly, the price rose by 200 yuan to the 6,000 yuan level. At this time, a certain silver firm also came to search for buyers, but there were no sellers to be found on the floor. In an instant, the price jumped by 200 yuan, and the silver jewelry firms bought 30 taels for 6,200 yuan. However, at that time, another silver firm came to sell, but buyers were hard to find. In an instant, the price fell sharply by 250 yuan, and the silver firms traded 10 taels against each other for 5,950 yuan. Near the close, the securities firms bought in heavily, raising the price slightly by 80 yuan. The securities firms bought 30 taels from the silver firms for 6,030 yuan, which was the closing price for the afternoon. As a result, the price fell sharply again by 540 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been falling rapidly for four consecutive days, totaling 1,060 yuan. The fluctuation in half a day was 740 yuan. The cash firms quoted prices based on their original capital, giving 10 yuan more for each tael and lowering the purchase price by 30 yuan. The current margin deposit was over 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were few transactions.

A Fifty-Yuan Difference in Jewelry Gold Purchases and Sales

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in the large firms was still 670 yuan. At 9:30 AM, the price was lowered by 10 yuan. At 10:20 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 10:50 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 10:55 AM, it was lowered by another 20 yuan. At 11:07 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 11:10 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At this time, the listed price was only 600 yuan. At 11:25 AM, the price finally rose by 10 yuan. At 11:40 AM, it rose by another 10 yuan. At noon, it fell by another 10 yuan. After 3:00 PM, it fell by another 10 yuan. There were no further changes after this. As a result, the price was lowered by a total of 70 yuan. The large firms revised their listed price to 600 yuan, and the new firms charged the same price. The purchase price was lowered by as much as 50 yuan, which was due to the sluggish cash market outside the exchange in the afternoon.

### English and Indian Silver Prices Rise

London, 14th: In the silver market, the near-term price has risen by a total of one and a half pence in two days, and the forward price has risen by a remarkable one and three-seventy-fifths pence. Both have risen to beyond the 22 pence level. Indian and speculative buyers have been active, but with few transactions, the market situation is unstable. After the close, there were no sellers at the listed price for buyers. New York reports that the spot price of silver in the United States remains flat. Bombay reports that the spot price of Indian silver has risen by 10 annas, and the forward price has risen by 9 annas. The market situation is firm, and a total of 100 orders have been made.

The closing price was 6,010 yuan, a sharp drop of 540 yuan from the previous day. The market sentiment was even more sluggish outside the exchange in the afternoon, and there were few buyers at 5,900 yuan. Transactions were brisk in the first half of the day, totaling approximately 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry firms sharply reduced their prices by 60 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Cash Gold Drops by 540 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially fell by 40 yuan due to the loose foreign exchange rate, making it difficult to boost morale. A certain silver firm and gold firms bought a total of 80 taels for 6,530 yuan. Subsequently, another silver jewelry business and a certain silver firm purchased from each other, with the gold firms buying a total of 60 taels, all for 6,540 yuan. After this, money changers and small investors competed to sell, but buyers were weak, and the price continued to fall. When it retreated to the 6,500 yuan level, a certain gold firm also started to sell, releasing a significant amount. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the securities firms for 6,410 yuan. Then, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the securities firms came to buy in, causing a slight rebound. The securities firms bought 30 taels from the gold firms for 6,460 yuan. However, since the exchange rate remained loose, coupled with the money changers and gold firms competing to sell, the price fell again. Before long, it had fallen by 140 yuan. The gold firm sold 50 taels to a certain silver jewelry business for 6,320 yuan. However, at that time, the silver jewelry business still had a good appetite, and small investors rushed to buy, causing the price to rebound by 90 yuan. The silver firm bought 30 taels from the securities firms for 6,320 yuan. However, due to the even looser exchange rate and the prevalence of bearish news in the market, the securities firms and gold firms mutually pressed down prices and sold off. The bullish silver firms also came to cut their losses. For a time, the market situation became even more chaotic, and the price plummeted.

### European War Rages On: World Financial Stability Is Uncertain: Foreign Exchange Market Shrouded in Selling Pressure: English and American Black Market Plummets

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The English and American black market is no longer what it used to be, with the weakening trend continuing unabated. Furthermore, observing the shift in people's minds, the future is unpredictable. Because the run on a certain major bank has not subsided, and in light of the disastrous drop in New York stocks, there is a possibility that the United States will join the vortex of the European war. However, given the speed of Germany's war efforts, it cannot be compared to past European wars. Whether the United States will participate and how is still uncertain. It is rumored that around the 20th of this month, there may be a huge change in world finance, due to the sharp drop in American stocks and prices. What effect this will have is still difficult to discern. Furthermore, it is heard that the Chinese army has entered the final stage of victory in the Sino-Japanese war, and the Japanese army is retreating to Jiujiang. The atmosphere of peace has been released again by a certain party, becoming very strong. Therefore, in the unanimous selling pressure from Chinese and Western speculators and foreign banks, buyers have disappeared, and the exchange rate has soared to the four pence level for English gold, and 5.375 yuan for American dollars. Upon hearing that cash was being withdrawn outside of 6,000 yuan, the selling pressure slightly subsided and softened for a time, but it soon hardened again. The final price was 3.96875 pence for English exchange, 5.3125 yuan for American dollars, 2.1875 pence rise for English long-term, 3.4375 yuan rise for American long-term, with also a relaxation in futures. Transactions were extremely active. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Exceptional Panic

Initially in the morning, London bars rose nearly one and a half pence, and the long-term rise was four and three-seventy-fifths pence. New York silver prices remained flat. London spot gold remained stable. Exchange rates for English against American, Shanghai, French, etc. were all flat. The American exchange rate against English rose by 0.25, against Shanghai by 1.5 jiao, and against French rose by 0.025. The central bank's listed prices for each exchange remained the same. The banks opened spot prices in the morning with selling prices for English gold at 3.75 pence, and for American exchange at 5 yuan, compared to the late closing price of the previous day, with English flat and American strong by 0.03125, which was because the exchange rate had rebounded. After opening, the American banks first expressed their intention to sell, and the market was already loose. It is calculated that they had traded June American exchange with foreign banks for 4.9375 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced with an increase of 8.25. After this, Chinese and Western speculators unanimously followed suit and sold. The underlying trend was quite strong. In May, American exchange initially traded at 4.96875 yuan and 5 yuan, and in the same month, English gold was already at 3.875 pence, up to 9.375 pence. At that time, people were extremely panicked because it was rumored that the United States would join the war, and it was predicted that around the 20th of this month, there might be a major change in world finance. As a result, the selling pressure expanded, and the spot American exchange was at its strongest at 5.375 yuan. The exchange rate for English also reached 4 pence. However, Chinese merchant speculators were selling to foreign banks, and the spot American exchange traded at 5.3125 yuan. Until around 11:45 AM, it was heard that cash had suddenly rebounded, and Chinese merchant speculators stopped selling. For a time, the American gold exchange was at 3.875 pence, and the American exchange was at 5.125 yuan. However, the closing result was that people were still reluctant to buy, and there were more sellers than buyers, resulting in another sharp decline. English gold was at 3.96875 pence, and American exchange was at 5.3125 yuan. This month's English gold was the same as the spot price, and the American exchange was at 5.28125 yuan. Next month's English gold was at 3.84375 pence, and the American exchange was at 5.0625 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing price, with the spot English exchange rising by 2.1875, and the five-six month term each gaining 25. The term for the American exchange rose across the board by 3.4375. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Market Volatile

Hong Kong, 15th (Wednesday): The exchange market opened stably this morning, but the American exchange rate remained volatile. The spot English exchange rate softened slightly by 0.43125, to 1 shilling 2.90625 pence. The forward rate remained at the original level. The spot American exchange rate rose by 0.1875, to 19.75 yuan. There were sellers but no buyers. The spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by 8 yuan, to 290 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate also softened by 1.5 yuan, to 82 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was flat. The spot American exchange rate continued to soften by 0.125, to 19.875 yuan. There were no other changes. At the afternoon close, the spot Shanghai exchange rate plummeted by 20 yuan, to 370 yuan. The market was flat. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

The spot American exchange rate rose by 0.025, to 4.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, remaining at 110.05 yuan. The "Joint Note" black market rose by half a yuan, to 100.05 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Situation Deteriorates Daily

The foreign currency market situation yesterday: Because of the sharp drop in American stocks in New York, it is generally felt that the United States may join the war. Although this statement may be premature, people's minds have been deeply stimulated. In addition, there are rumors that the world's financial system will undergo a major change after the 20th of this month, and it is rumored that a certain country's army plans to withdraw from Hankou in a short time. As a result, the atmosphere of peace is getting stronger. In fact, this news is released by speculators, but the market is therefore greatly confused. Money exchange shops, except for American dollar notes, still accept them as usual. In addition, all others have been refused to avoid losses after receiving them. The market prices for each item clearly show a situation of "sellers but no buyers." Only the buying and selling of American dollar notes is strong. In the afternoon, it retreated to 17.7 yuan, eventually reaching 18 yuan, which was a huge drop of 1.7 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, such as English and American gold pounds, etc., all fell sharply in unison. The supply of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was also strong. The former initially retreated to 1.1 yuan, and the latter fell to 0.91 yuan.

### Discount Rate Falls Again by Ten Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for private banks fell slightly for every thousand yuan. The initial price in the morning was around 120 yuan, later falling from 125 yuan to 100 yuan. The afternoon was around 105 yuan, which was a drop of ten yuan compared to the previous day. The clearing rate of the Industry Association rose by 0.01 in both the morning and afternoon, with a listed rate of 0.24 yuan.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Weak: Soybean Oil Shipped to Southeast Asia

The oil market was weak yesterday due to excess supply and sluggish sales. The price of Dalian soybean oil opened in the morning at 102.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Affected by the falling gold price, small investors sold off one after another, and the price fell by another 2.5 yuan. As a result, the price dropped sharply by 4 yuan. A total of more than 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, with prices ranging from 102.5 yuan to 100 yuan. 50 dan of oil from Da You Factory were traded at 80 yuan.

Yesterday, 400 cans of raw oil were shipped to Xiamen, as well as 1,400 cans and 50 pieces, along with 1,616 bags of soybeans, were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 1,474 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, as well as 4,878 bags of soybeans, 1,240 pieces of soybean cakes, 370 bags of peanuts, and 340 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Singapore.

### Securities: Foreign Stock Speculators Suffer Losses: All Stocks Fall, Especially Rubber Stocks: Domestic Debt Flourishes, Foreign Debt Hit by European War

The securities black market fell yesterday, first due to the dissipation of the atmosphere of peace, and then rose due to rumors that the Japanese army was withdrawing and the "garrison" was taking over. In this extremely volatile market situation, people's minds are unsettled and easily swayed by rumors. The shorts were uncertain and rose to cover their positions. The multiple parties sold their techniques. The fall in gold became more intense, and the gradual rise in foreign exchange rates further assisted the rise in public debt. The clouds of the European war are spreading, and the involvement is widening, expanding the withdrawals from foreign merchant banks in Shanghai. Initially, those related to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy experienced withdrawals, and yesterday it spread to other foreign merchant banks related to the European war. A large amount of hot money, shaken by this, tends to have nowhere to go. Therefore, some capitalists have already taken buying public debt as a profitable investment. After this turmoil, speculators will at least develop a dislike for foreign stocks. Public debt has become the only clear investment in a murky environment. Although there is still much speculation at present, as the European war expands to a considerable extent, China will become more and more favorable. This is an undeniable fact, but it is not yet permitted by the current environment, so it is expected that the future of the bond market cannot be too optimistic for the time being. Yesterday morning, the initial selling pressure was heavier and the price fell by three to five jiao because the atmosphere of peace was confirmed by newspapers to be inaccurate. In the afternoon, the rising trend suddenly became strong. Type A reached the 60 yuan level, and Type C reached the 50 yuan level. Buyers and sellers still showed signs of indecision, such as Hong Kang initially covering short positions, but suddenly selling in large quantities in the afternoon. Jiu Feng continued to sell off, still following its consistent style. Lian He initially sold and then bought, while the others had more buyers but small appetites, and fewer sellers but a strong desire to sell. As a result of the competition, each bond continued to improve by three to four jiao. Approximately 1.5 million yuan was traded. A simple table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Type A　60.50　59.70　60.10　Up 0.40

Type B　52.35　51.45　52.25　Up 0.40

Type C　50.25　49.35　50.10　Up 0.30

Type D　49.00　48.50　48.90　Up 0.30

Type E　51.10　50.05　50.90　Up 0.20

In stock transactions, 50 shares of Zhongyi Trust were traded at a price of 10 yuan. The European news was discouraging to the public stock market. The New York stock market experienced another major upheaval. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has already fallen 16 pounds lower than the close on Saturday of last week. Affected by this, the prices in the local stock market plummeted. As soon as the industrial stocks opened, they reported a sharp decline. The sellers waited for an opportunity to sell off, in a very urgent state. Even if there was a rebound upward, it was only temporary. Most stocks closed at the lowest price. British United stocks fell from 49 yuan at the opening to 43 yuan. Jardine Matheson fell from 88 yuan to 77 yuan. New shares of New Amoy fell from 60 yuan to 48 yuan. Yangtze stocks fell from 18.5 yuan to 17 yuan. The difference between the high and low of International shares was only one yuan. Steel stocks opened at 40 yuan and closed at the low price of 35.5 yuan. China Land Reclamation stocks once rebounded to 13 yuan, but also closed at the low price of 18.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson stocks had extremely large transactions, opening at 60 yuan and closing at only 50 yuan. The closing prices of each stock the day before yesterday were unfortunately better than the highest price yesterday.

Rubber stocks fell sharply because it was reported that the Dutch army had stopped resisting the Germans. The selling pressure on the shares of the East India companies was particularly strong. Langkat shares previously closed at 36 yuan including interest, but yesterday they fell to 28 yuan excluding interest, losing more than any other rubber stock. The dividend should also be included in the price decline, but it is difficult to estimate the exact amount of legal currency because it paid 0.32 Dutch guilders per share.

London, 14th (Tuesday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained mostly weak, except for the Beining Railway bonds, which rebounded by one pound to a price of 60 pounds. The British-German continued loan (British issue) at the higher end fell by 5 pounds to 50 pounds. Crisp fell by 2.5 pounds to 20 pounds. Chinese-French American dollars (with imprint) fell by 3 pounds to 48 pounds. Reconstruction (British issue) fell by 0.625 pounds to 20 pounds. Vickers loan fell by 1 pound to 9 pounds. Railway bonds at the lower end, Huguang German issue and Beijing-Shanghai each fell by 3 pounds, the former to 13 pounds, the latter to 7 pounds. Daoqing Huguang (non-German issue) and Guangzhou-Kowloon were each at 12 pounds. Longhai and Tianjin-Pukou each fell by 1 pound, both at 11 pounds.

London, 14th (Tuesday): Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks remained stable. Only the shares of HSBC's Mercantile Bank of India, London and China fell by 2 pounds to a price of 89 pounds. There were no other changes.

### American Cotton Plummets: Local Transactions Sluggish

Cotton transactions were very few. This is because the clouds of the European war are thick, American cotton has plummeted, and at the same time, cotton yarn has fallen even more sharply. As a result, the cotton business is sluggish. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed on the left:

Fire Grass 23.00 230 bales purchased by companies in the same industry

Again 230.00 Again 750 bales

Again 226.00 Again 480 bales

Xingxiang 255.01 Again 100 pieces

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton: In the New York cotton market, the initial morning was caused by the selling of speculators. Later, due to the sharp fall in Wall Street stocks and the closing out by some bulls, the cotton market plummeted by more than 50 points. In the Indian cotton market, futures and expectations fell by six rupees. The Egyptian cotton government was ordered to temporarily suspend transactions.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Due to the loosening of the exchange rate, the various companies tentatively planned to wait and see. Transactions in Tianjin were also light. However, the inventory in the market is low, so the selling price is quite firm. However, the overseas cotton market is very cheap. The delivered price is as follows, converted at an American exchange rate of 4.9375 yuan:

20 count American middling 350.90

20 count again Lower grade 340.10

32 count again 375.20

32 count again Lower grade 364.10

42 count again 377.90

42 count again Lower grade 366.50

### Yarn and Cotton: Under a Large Number of Sell Orders: The Yarn Market Becomes One-Sided: Shuangma Plummets by 130-140 Yuan

The yarn market plummeted, and the intensity of the decline was astonishing. This situation was because the foreign exchange rate and gold had indeed fallen, causing speculators to sell off one after another. Once the market loosened, it was like splitting bamboo. It is conceivable how crazy the speculators were. In fact, the prices in the past were pulled up too high, and the rebound was even more intense. However, such a large rise and fall may have exceeded the norm. The opening price for June Shuangma was 1,600 yuan, and the closing price was 1,425 yuan.

Due to the sharp fall in American cotton, the yarn market was in chaos in the morning, with the exchange shouting prices of 14. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,475 yuan. Suddenly, it rose to 1,515 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was loosening, and the gold price was falling. At the same time, rumors were rife, and the shorts became active again. With a large number of sell orders, the market plummeted. The price for 20-count Shuangma fell to 1,405 yuan, a massive drop of 130-140 yuan compared to the previous day. Today, 80 pieces of yarn were shipped to Haiphong, 40 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 475 pieces to Hong Kong, and 103 pieces to Xiamen. Today, 350 pieces were shipped to Haiphong, 900 pieces to Hong Kong, 90 pieces to Yantai, and 148 pieces to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed below:

### Food: Foreign Rice Scattered in Stockpiles, Eager to Sell: Prices Drop by Three to Four Yuan All Day

The rice market experienced extreme rises and falls, as much as six or seven yuan. It rebounded again within a few days. It reached its previous peak price on the morning of the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, news of a sudden plunge in the price was heard, like a flash in the pan. In an instant, it fell again by two yuan. For example, Little Jiao was only sold for 50 yuan. It is difficult to guess such an unstable market. Yesterday, the gold market continued to plummet, and all the prices of yarn and cotton fell in unison. Although in the morning, after the sharp fall the day before yesterday, those with goods still thought of defending their positions, and buyers continued to cover their short positions, there was a brief recovery in each group, and the prices rose by six or seven jiao. Little Wen opened at 50.07-0.08 yuan, but it was only a short time before it leveled off. Afterwards, it was heard that the gold market had fallen again, and rumors spread in the market, causing people to feel panic. Regardless of the original roots of the buyers and sellers, or the scattered households with floating stockpiles, they competed to sell, fearing that they would not be able to sell in time. As a result, like leaves blown by the wind, only the sound of falling could be heard. The prices of each commodity were suddenly lowered by one or two yuan. As the market price was dumped, people's hearts became even more discouraged, and it became more difficult to save the overall situation. As the market neared the closing, the price continued to fall more and more fiercely, and there was no sign of stopping.

After a brief support in the morning, foreign rice was shaken by the sharp drop in the gold price and the spread of rumors. Small stockpiles were sold off first, and large households sold off cheaply later. The prices of each grade fell across the board by two or three yuan. In the afternoon, the falling trend resumed, and small grades, such as No. 2 Siamese, fell to 47 yuan, a drop of 3.8 yuan compared to the morning price of 50.08 yuan. No. 1 fell to 50.05 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 4 yuan. Already No. 2's original afternoon price reached 59.2 yuan, which was also a difference of 3.6 yuan from the price of 62.8 yuan that had been agreed upon in the morning. Original bag No. 2 Siamese fell to 58.5 yuan, and Little Jiao fell to 60.05 yuan. Saigon broken rice was 51 yuan, all with a difference of 4 yuan. The original bag of Huilong was selling briskly in both directions, with 400-500 tons traded. The spot goods were 6,000 bags.

The arrival of thick and thin Jing rice and other domestic rice was still not strong. Only 1,300-1,400 bags from Changxi and Sujia arrived. It was rumored on the black market outside the venue that it was being restrained by foreign rice, and there was limited trading. However, it was not affected by the gold price and the exchange rate. It was heard that although the selling price fell, it was not as severe as that of foreign rice, falling only by 1.5 yuan. Wuxi special clear Jing was 52.5-52 yuan, powdered Jing was 51-52 yuan, and Dang Kun white Jing was 51-52 yuan. Second-rate goods were around 50 yuan. Qing Si thin rice was particularly short of goods. The general market was 51-52 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice was 51-50 yuan.

### Textiles: Speculation Concentrated on Eastern Textiles, Fluctuations Unusually Large, Exceeding Five Yuan

Yesterday, the decline in the cloth market continued, the market was chaotic, and white goods from local factories were rarely sold. Occasional small-scale transactions by brokers required price reductions of one to two yuan per piece. However, major players in the industry remained calm, as speculators flocked to the Eastern Textiles market. Consequently, the rise and fall of Longtou fine cloth were unusually large. The morning session peaked at 47.50 yuan, but then plummeted due to surplus bids, falling in a straight line to 43 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, those profiting from short positions rushed to cover, pushing the price up to 44.80 yuan. Shortly after, rumors emerged that favored short sellers, causing the price to fall to 42.85 yuan. Ultimately, however, due to the large drop, customer interest increased and market sentiment turned upward, rebounding to 43.50 yuan.

### A Ridiculous Western Official

A letter from Fuzhou states: There is a Western military officer who previously rendered meritorious service in China's Guizhou province and received the rank of Deputy General. Now, this Deputy General has arrived in Xiamen and visited officials in Fuzhou. The officials returned his visits one by one, which was quite a grand affair. What is laughable is that when he went to visit the Provincial Commander of Fujian, he wore a Western hat topped with a Chinese red button, and Western clothes paired with Chinese black boots. While wearing both boots and clogs might be acceptable, affixing a majestic red button to a Western hat is extremely inappropriate. At the time, Chinese officials found it to be a topic of amusement.

### Squirrel Captures Thief

A man from Suzhou named Jia kept a squirrel, which was both intelligent and tame. He hid it in his sleeve, and it would only come out when Jia called it, and only eat when Jia fed it. On the eighteenth of last month, Jia returned from gambling in the countryside, having won over ten yuan, which he placed beside his pillow before falling into a deep sleep. A thief pried open the door and crept to the bedside to steal the money. Suddenly, the squirrel leaped out of Jia's sleeve and bit the thief's hand tightly. The thief cried out in pain, and when he tried to strike the squirrel, it bit Jia's nose instead. Jia awoke with a start, jumped up naked, and grabbed the thief's hand. He saw that the thief's middle finger was covered in blood, and realized that the squirrel had injured him. Since Jia had not lost anything, he did not argue with the thief, but scolded him and sent him away.

### The Architecture of Character (1)

Among you, if anyone has taken a sea voyage to New York and seen the countless towering buildings reaching into the sky as the ship approaches the shore, you must have felt two different emotions: (1) amazement and (2) excitement. You are usually accustomed to seeing Chinese-style buildings, and upon seeing New York's hundred-plus story skyscrapers, you will undoubtedly be astounded. These magnificent buildings are all designed by architects, and their structures are complex and splendid. You will admire the architects' intellectual abilities, which surpass those of ordinary people, and you will also experience a kind of spiritual excitement, feeling that human power should not be underestimated. However, if you think further, as great as these projects are, they cannot compare to the structure of the human body. No building in the world can be compared to the construction of a human being, because human life is a very delicate structure. Although we are all architects of our own lives, it is not easy for us to build our lives and characters well. Whether our character can withstand the winds and waves and the battles of life depends on the foundation we lay. Therefore, before building, we must make a plan, draw up a design, and build a good foundation. The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Corinthians, spoke of the importance of this life-building, saying, "You are the temple of God." He presented himself as an experienced architect, laying the foundation for them, and those who come after must build upon this foundation. Everyone should be careful in what they do, building their lives according to the foundation. People have different talents, so the houses they build will naturally be different. Some are worth a fortune, others are like straw. Regardless, "We are all the temple of God." This means that we are all people building a temple, and in building character, we are all our own architects. (To be continued) For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

### Travel Musings

— Jiang

Waking up in the middle of the night, I hear the clock ticking in the darkness.

In the silence, the sound is strangely rapid, and I suddenly think strangely: that seems to be the sound of life's footsteps, hurriedly traveling its lonely journey.

People have quite different views of life, but it is usually likened to a long journey.

Likening life to a journey is indeed a subtle view; because since it is a "journey," all gains and losses are "temporary," and there is no need to be sad or happy about the current situation. And since you cannot live in a "hotel" forever, you must go to a certain destination, so a poet once said with a touch of "Zen": "The purpose of life is to go to the grave!"

"Going to the tomb," this is the inevitable end of life's journey. Whether lying in the cold wind on the street, shivering, or whiling away his "happy night" in a dance hall, they are all parts of a group that are going to the grave by different "roads," but is it simply a matter of "walking" and being covered by soil in the end? That shouldn't be such a simple matter.

For example, planting a few trees by the "road," digging a few wells, leveling those stumbling blocks, killing those beasts that block the way... all the work that makes it easier and safer for people to walk later should be done by people traveling on the road of life.

Furthermore, erecting a stone tablet at those "dead end" intersections, carving a few warning words, so that later people will not have to take these unnecessary detours and waste time, as they and those before them did, should also be done by people traveling on the road of life.

Although these works are all for others, they are the things that "travelers" should do. Understanding this is the only way to truly understand the meaning of life and truly enjoy the warmth of life!

Ordinary people live—but they are just living. Very few people truly understand the meaning of life and truly enjoy the warmth of life. Many people eat well, perhaps have loved randomly, have gotten married, have had children, or even gotten rich, or even inexplicably killed many people in exchange for a pile of shiny medals, thinking that they have tasted all the "flavors of life," but they don't know that they are actually just running empty on the "journey."

Ordinary people generally hope for "longevity," but the meaning of life does not lie in the length of time. Those who do not understand life, even if they live carelessly for hundreds of years, sleep for tens of thousands of years—although much longer than ordinary people, it is still completely irrelevant to truly enjoying the warmth of life!

Those who understand the meaning of life—those who understand how to work for the humanity of tomorrow, how to choose the right opportunity to die—should regard this as a kind of happiness to be proud of; because very few people truly understand this secret!

In terms of history and legend: Hector, the hero of Troy who fought against fate, understood the meaning of life; Socrates, who drank poison for his beliefs and truth, and Aristotle, who cut his veins, understood the meaning of life; those who died in battle for their own and others' purposes, Lun and Petofi, understood the meaning of life...

But there are very few! Most people live, but they are just living—although some of them live for a long time!

But those who truly understand the secret of life and can truly enjoy the warmth of life will not feel the brevity of life—and will never feel that time is running too fast, because even if they live for decades, they feel that it is enough.

Short Essay

### Bird Bottom Story

— Wuxin

Loneliness enveloped the dusk. My stomach shuffled in the desolate backyard, the lonely footsteps of my solitary self stubbornly following me. Golden sunset cast a gentle gaze from the treetops, landing on a few withered and trampled flowers on a small tomb next to a pine tree, where slept the spirit of a small hero.

Not long ago, a friend returning from afar gifted me a beautiful little bird from the South, kept in a delicate cage. He knew I had a deep love and fondness for such small creatures.

She was draped in gentle and pleasing delicate feathers interwoven with cyan and green, and a soft, slender tail; she had a pair of fierce eyes and a sharp beak, singing sounds that were almost music. – Such a beautiful and lovely little animal.

I carefully hung it under the thick shade of a pine tree in the backyard.

However, after some days, it seemed she harbored a deep resentment and despair for life. All the food given to her was trampled under her claws, her body gradually became thin and weak, robbing her of her vitality and beauty. Her eyes became so melancholy and angry, as if to devour everything in the world. She constantly cried mournfully, a tearful tune of longing. She carried a heart fervent with the love of freedom and sentimentality. She envied her companions happily soaring and circling in the high blue sky, the boundless sea. She stared intensely at her free companions, sometimes frantically opening her wings and fiercely rushing towards them with all her strength. However, the solid cage always gave her absolute disappointment. Her stubborn personality prevented her from considering these things. What exactly was she yearning for, pursuing? Only her free companions could tell you.

Finally, what she was waiting for came. She broke her wings, exhausted her last bit of strength, closed her eyes, and quietly lay in the cage. This was on a sunless, about-to-rain dusk.

My heartstrings trembled violently, and I involuntarily released many of her companions confined in the cage. They all smiled and spread their light and cheerful wings, flying straight to the high blue sky, happily thanking her companion's death.

I buried her next to that pine tree in the backyard, placing a few fresh flowers on it, in memory of her.

Every time I saw this small, raised tomb, I hated my friend, hated myself, and blessed this brave little soul.

Children

### The Voice of Children

— Qing

The content of this article reveals many children's opinions and criticisms of their parents, all of which are uttered from the mouths of children in daily life through clever and natural methods, unknowingly. Therefore, it is not subject to any external constraints or restrictions, completely the revelation of their true nature, truthful and frank; it is sufficient to provide a very useful reference for virtuous parents:

First, a six-year-old child said: "Parents are unwilling to listen to important things we say." Another child continued: "If I were a parent, I would sit down, face my child, listen to him word for word, and I wouldn't want to read the newspaper while they are talking." One echoed: "I want to walk with my child in the woods and let him ask me all kinds of questions." A little girl exposed her mother's feigned attitude, saying: "When we play cards, mother forbids us; but when she reads the newspaper, she doesn't know what we are playing."

Many children also say they lack companionship. Parents don't allow him to play outside. When indoors, there is only companionship when mother is free; as for father? One child said: "My father has never played with me, he always says he's too busy."

A slightly older girl said: "If I leave my parents for a minute, there is a minute of questioning." More than a dozen children all unanimously said: "Unhappy that parents treat us as exhibits."

The rest of the children felt dissatisfied with their parents in small matters. For example, one child complained: "Mother often checks my neck to see if it's clean." One said unfairly: "Parents don't allow me to stay out past twelve o'clock." One sighed: "My father doesn't want me to bring the dog indoors." One roared: "Mother wants me to bathe once a week."

Although some of these "Voices of Children" are childish and some are emotional, they are all good references for being good parents; because when children have these feelings, it is either that parents despise children or are wrong themselves, or the methods of implementation are poor and the teaching is inadequate, and these all need to be reflected upon by parents. It is not easy to completely eliminate these dissatisfactions, even in the most perfect family; but ideal parents must reduce these dissatisfactions to the minimum extent possible.

### On the Wealthy Society's Martial Arts Troupe

— Xisen

During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, the court and the public embellished the prosperous times, and drama and performing arts gathered in the capital. The so-called "keban" in theatrical troupes at that time was actually a school for nurturing child actors. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, keban became very popular. Famous troupes such as the Sanqing Troupe and Xiaorongchun cultivated numerous famous actors. Between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, there was still the Wu Liu Troupe, with Xi Liancheng being particularly prominent. Since the Republic of China, keban have gradually declined due to poor business. Only the Fuliancheng Society, the predecessor of Xi Liancheng, stands alongside the newly established Chinese Opera School and the Rongchun Society founded by Shang Xiaoyun, so the Wealthy Society has its own foothold for existence.

The society started with martial arts plays, and the keban regulations were strict, which was conducive to cultivating martial arts talents. Therefore, at a time when other talents are scarce, the Wealthy Society is still able to support itself with martial arts plays. Among the martial arts performers of the society, the one whose martial skills can stand out for a time is Su Fuxian. Su serves as the head of the martial arts troupe in the society. He does not often perform on stage. Su is good at "kantou" ("kangong"), which is the job of supervising students' training. His guidance on skills and correction of postures are also unique advantages, especially "passing weapons," which is his best skill, but his name is not very well known. The second is Li Shengzuo, who serves as a teacher and martial arts clown. When he performs on stage, his specialty is walking as a midget around the stage, and his funny fights are also occasionally wonderful performances. Among the "Shi" generation, Jiang Shisheng is an outstanding talent in short-playing martial arts roles. His somersaults and wielding of weapons are all fiery and intense. It is a pity that he is limited by his aura, and he dares not perform arrow-shirt and armor plays. However, in plays such as "Hua Butterfly," "Boundary Marker Pass," etc., he can be regarded as a top performer among the rising martial arts performers in the old capital. Guo Shiyi's skills are not weak either. His tiger jumps and pliers lifts on stage are high and light. His single lift and small flip into a tiger insertion are smooth and easy, making him the best "flipper" in the society. Among the "Yuan" generation, Huang Yuanqing is the most promising talent. Huang has a handsome and refined appearance, and his aura is generous and full. Whether it is long-armored or short-playing, he can handle it with ease. His Lin Chong in "Lin Chong's Night Flight," Lu Wenlong in "Eight Great Hammers," and the monkey in the Kunqu Opera "Pansi Cave" are all wonderful whenever he performs. As for Song Futing and Han Shengxin's martial arts roles, Ban Shichao and Chen Yuanbi's martial arts female roles, Bai Yuanjie, Ai Shirui, Shen Shiqi, Fei Shiwei, etc., whether they are assistants or supporting roles, their martial arts skills are all worth watching. The prosperity of the Wealthy Society's martial arts troupe today is attributed to Ye Shengzhang, but in fact, the martial arts general teacher Wang Yunping teaches plays seriously and meticulously, and his contribution is also great. Wang is very knowledgeable and serves as the society's managing director. He and Xiao Changhua are the best teachers in the society.

Since the Wealthy Society started with martial arts plays, it pays special attention to martial arts plays. Therefore, its stage performance is more compact than other troupes, and the actors and props are polished together, so that they can achieve a seamless effect when performing on stage. Outstanding talents such as Bao Laitou and Liu Gaoxi can come up with ideas to add to the fun, so that the performers can feel happy and satisfied. It was reported earlier that Ye Shengzhang will come to the south in the autumn, so the northern school of martial arts plays will surely refresh the ears and eyes of the Shanghai people.

### Recording a Charity Concert

— Ling

The Chinese Harmonica Society held its ninth anniversary concert at the Great Shanghai Theatre the other day. The traffic was heavy and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. More than 1,300 Chinese and foreign audiences attended. The opening was at 10 o'clock. First, the president of the society, Mr. Wang Qinglong, led all the members to stand up and play "National Anthem" together, and then began to perform the program. There were ten sections in total. The Knights of the Green Forest March was played by more than 100 members of the society's harmonica team, and the performance was very neat and tidy. Next, the basic team of 40 people played the Waltz of Spring in a pleasant mood, and the tune was ups and downs in harmony, which was very popular. The harmonica solo (1) Harmonica Waltz, (2) Yearning for the Sea, by Wang Qingshan, the director of the society, was also very skilled. Dick's violin solo won a lot of applause. Then the basic team played the overture of the world-famous opera "The Pirate" by the French opera composer Zharoll, which was said to have been specially compiled by Wang Qinglong recently. It was the first time it was played in a Chinese harmonica team. The tune was magnificent and exceptionally brilliant. It was one of the most successful pieces in this program. Later, the second part of the program was Zhu Gongyi's piano solo "Hungarian Rhapsody," followed by the harmonica team playing a masquerade dance and the Esbaña Waltz. Wang Qinglong's harmonica solo has long been famous throughout the country. The suite "Caucasian Scenery," the second and fourth chapters, was played very skillfully under Wang's superb skills and rapid high and low semitones. Finally, the whole group played the "Old Friend" march, ending at 11:45. It is said that the proceeds from the concert, in addition to the necessary expenses, will be used to help refugees.

### After the Rain, Clear Skies

Chapter 24: Lake and Mountain Cleansed, Each with Their Own Merits, Men and Women Cheer Together, Calling "Long Live!"

Mrs. Xue laughed, "Yes! To make triplets, you only need to make one, because the three have the same appearance. Even if there is a slight difference, you just need to make a small mark. This is the trick of the technicians. Although people see three children, whether sitting or standing, they are actually all active. The one standing can also sit, and the one sitting can also stand. What triplets or twins? They only need to sculpt one person." Zhu Ai'ren said, "The Chinese have been sculpting statues since ancient times. According to my grandfather, there used to be a sculptor in Tiger Hill, Suzhou, who grabbed a lump of clay and looked at your face while kneading it in his sleeve. The sculpted statue was actually very similar. It can be said that it was a miraculous skill, but it gradually disappeared. Later, it was said that someone in Tianjin could sculpt statues. A famous one was called 'Clay Figure Zhang,' but he was far inferior to the previous ones in Suzhou. Now, sculptures have photos, and castings have models, which are actually not surprising. It used to be real skill, and it was not scientific at all, and there was no borrowing at all. It is a pity that it has been lost to this day." They talked and bought a lot of toys. Mrs. Xue also gave a large foreign doll to Jin Dan, laughing and saying, "I hope you will give birth to a big fat son next year." They came down from Huiquan Mountain, and without much delay, they thanked Mr. and Mrs. Engineer Xue and returned to the Huanhu Second Hotel. They got into the family touring car again and set off on the Huanhu Road. From Yixing Changxing, they arrived in Huzhou at 7 pm. Lin Jiancheng's sister-in-law and his sister had been waiting there for a long time at the Huanhu Third Hotel in Huzhou. They had agreed to stay at the Huanhu Third Hotel for one night, so they had already booked the rooms. China does not prohibit foreigners from traveling, as long as they abide by Chinese laws, they can live in the inland. Therefore, some high-end hotels in the interior also have Western-style rooms, with everything they need. They thought that Mrs. Surya was an American and used to enjoying herself, so they prepared the best Western-style room for her. The second was a newly married couple, and the third was the ladies traveling together. Dinner was a sumptuous Chinese meal. Lin Jiancheng's sister had attended a wedding banquet in Shanghai the day before yesterday and knew that Mrs. Surya could eat with chopsticks and did not need to prepare knives and forks. They had a great conversation that night. Lin Jiancheng's sister was in the silk business. The development of Chinese raw silk and the increase in exports are self-evident. The two He sisters were preparing to open a weaving factory and had contacts with the silk industry, so this trip was not without merit. The next day, they got up at 7 o'clock and took a walk in a lake park in Huzhou, and then set off. (278)

Film fans and employees are very concerned about the stalemate between Mei Jia and Xinhua. The reporter specially visited Zhang Shankun, the owner of Xinhua, for this matter. Mr. Zhang said: "Mei Jia has stated to him that it was a misunderstanding, and will continue to make films in the future. As for her work in Yi Hua, she will continue to do so. This is a guest appearance, and whether she will continue to sign a contract with Yi Hua to make a series of films will depend on the environment."
