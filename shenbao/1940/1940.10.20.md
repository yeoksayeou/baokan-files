### The Mission of Guoguang

The ancients said, "The best medicine nourishes the spirit, the medium medicine nourishes the body, and the inferior medicine treats illness." Whether it is the best, medium, or inferior medicine, its greatest purpose is none other than enabling people to stay away from suffering and achieve health. Nowadays, science is flourishing, and new medicines are booming. If we were to count them, there would be millions of them. Examining their contents, there are superior, medium, and inferior medicines. It cannot be guaranteed that there are no medicines worse than inferior medicines. The responsibility of distinguishing and selecting these falls to the pharmacy.

The mission of "Guoguang" is to specially take on the responsibility of distinguishing and selecting on behalf of customers. Now, we will divide our will and business system into two parts to announce them.

The first part is dispensing medicine: formally trained pharmacists with rich knowledge and experience, and genuine medicines from formal Chinese and foreign pharmaceutical factories, to match prescriptions from various countries. This is, of course, the duty of a pharmacy, but we add a "seriousness" to every principle. Even if it is as light as water or as small as a bottle, we will absolutely abide by our motto of "rather be meticulous than negligent."

The second part is selling prepared medicines: providing society with effective medicines that "nourish the spirit, nourish the body, and treat diseases." "Medicines worse than inferior medicines" will never be allowed to gain a foothold here. Moreover, we will never easily introduce prepared medicines that would cause our customers to have concerns after buying our goods. Our motto for selling prepared medicines is "rather have fewer than be indiscriminate."

In this way, aren't we deviating greatly from our profit-making purposeâ€”the greatest purpose of business, which cannot be denied, is to make a profit? No! We are merely "not solely pursuing profit" and adhering to the "position of regarding righteousness as profit."

As for taking prescriptions and delivering medicine, phone orders, and customer service, etc., although they are sufficient to demonstrate our sincere, humble, diligent, careful, and agile obligations, we dare not use these small acts of kindness as a slogan here. In short, we are exerting the greatest effort of all our staff to elicit an impression of us from society.

Finally, one sentence must be declared: "Medicine is for treating illness, nourishing the body, and nourishing the spirit," not for low-price competition of "adding three feet to the foot and getting one free." The purpose of the unconditional lottery and giveaways held during our opening this time was to use a larger amount of advertising fees to give practical benefits to the public, in order to indirectly attract public attention.

We dare not be ordinary, for the sake of our responsibility.

### The Defense of the Yunnan-Burma Road Is Thorough; Transportation Efficiency Will Become Stronger; All Kinds of Necessary Equipment along the Road Have Been Carefully Arranged; Trucks Can Reach Kunming Directly from Lashio in Five Days

Chongqing: Peng Xuepei, Director of the Ministry of Communications of China, issued a statement yesterday, declaring that China believes that no matter what actions Japan takes, the Burma Road can always be kept open. Peng said that the Japanese air force's bombing for transportation convenience has taught China some prevention and protection methods, such as the bombing of the Yuehan Railway 1,300 times, and the train only stopped for 36 hours, which is clear evidence. Peng continued to describe the various protection measures along the Yunnan-Burma Road, such as air-raid shelters, labor camps, storage areas, and road repair stations, and said that it is 1,146 kilometers long from Lashio, a Burmese border town, to Kunming, and trucks can reach it in five days. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 19th)

Chongqing: The Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association, the China-Burma Cultural Association, the China-India Association, and the Chongqing Press Association jointly sent a telegram to the Aid China Movement Association in London and the China-Burma Cultural Association in Yangon, expressing China's gratitude for their efforts to reopen the Burma Road. (Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 19th) The local newspapers here have recently published news about the reopening of the Burma Road in prominent positions. Xinmin Daily said that the United States is adopting methods of assisting China and the United Kingdom to protect both sides of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Therefore, the newspaper continued to say that the establishment of an alliance between China, the United Kingdom, and the United States is the most reasonable step. The newspaper said that China, by resisting aggression, actually has the qualifications to be an ally of the United Kingdom and the United States. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### Japanese Planes Attack the Yunnan-Burma Road; Kunming Is Also Severely Bombed

Chongqing: According to Kunming telegrams, not long after the Burma Road was reopened yesterday morning, 36 Japanese planes bombed various sections of the road. Japanese planes departing from new bases in Vietnam bombed Kunming and other cities in Yunnan Province yesterday. It is estimated that a total of 52 Japanese planes participated in the air raid on Yunnan Province. On the morning of Thursday, a large number of Japanese planes attempted to bomb Kunming, but turned back due to bad weather. Unexpectedly, they flew back in the afternoon and dropped bombs in the southern and northern suburbs of Kunming. During yesterday's air raid, bombs fell in the southwest and central areas of Kunming. The British Supervisory Council Church and the French Catholic School were damaged. Two bombs hit the courtyard of the school's hospital, and the staff dormitory was severely damaged. Most of the residents fled to nearby villages to take temporary shelter, and returned from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The length of the air raid was unprecedented in Kunming. The city cannot build air-raid shelters due to underground water. It is also reported that a team of Japanese planes bombed the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway twice, south of Kaiyuan. Many engineers and workers who previously served on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will go to Yangon from Hong Kong to work on the Burma Road. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Lashio: According to passengers arriving here by plane from Kunming today, Japanese planes bombed Kunming and part of the Burma Road in groups on Friday. The Japanese planes did not encounter fierce resistance. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Tokyo: According to official sources today, the commander of the Japanese naval detachment ordered to bomb the Burma Road returned to the base and reported that no motor transport teams were seen in the Chinese section of the Burma Road on Friday. The Burma Road winds through the mountains west of Kunming, 3,500 meters high. Looking down from the air, it becomes a white line. Although low clouds near the Yunnan-Vietnam border hindered visibility, the weather was clear when Japanese planes flew over the road, and they were able to drop bombs and hit a bridge, which was the main purpose of the attack. There was no resistance from the sky or the ground. It is said that the bombed bridge is located on the Lancang River in the upper reaches of the Mekong River. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Tokyo: According to news here today, the Japanese air force began bombing the Yunnan-Burma Road only a few hours after it was opened yesterday. According to an announcement from the Japanese South China Naval Headquarters, Japanese planes attacked the interior of Yunnan Province yesterday, severely damaging major bridges on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is also known that several bridges on the Lancang River near the Burmese border were also destroyed by Japanese planes. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### The Hong Kong Embargo on Munitions Cannot Be Lifted at Present

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, although the Burma Road has been reopened, the Hong Kong government still prohibits munitions and other supplies from being transported into the areas controlled by Chongqing. Hong Kong Colonial Secretary Smith issued an official press release on Friday, retracting his previous remarks that gasoline and other military supplies, except for arms and ammunition, would be allowed to be transported from Hong Kong again. It is believed that the release of this press release was prompted by a note from the Japanese Consul General to the Hong Kong Governor, protesting that this move would violate the Anglo-Japanese Agreement. The press release stated that Smith said that his oral remarks on October 16 were based on his interpretation of the telegrams received from London. He now hears that a relative suggestion has been considered, and it is believed that Hong Kong is not limited by the three-month date of the main agreement for the agreement signed in July. The local restrictions apply not only to munitions, but also to specified items that have not yet been lifted. This ban will not be lifted until the results of diplomatic negotiations are announced. According to Mr. Smith, Hong Kong has returned to the status before the Burma Road Agreement was signed regarding the transportation of arms and other munitions. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Chongqing: Although there are rumors that Japan is threatening to attack Hong Kong and that Chinese people are paying attention to the United States' naval actions, well-informed sources here believe that there will be no immediate crisis in the Pacific. It is believed that Japan will not dare to attack the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. It is said that Japan's naval and economic position is too weak to fight against the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, it is believed that Hong Kong is not in immediate danger of being attacked. General observers say that Japan's threat to China to use Hong Kong for transportation is groundless, because it is well known to the public that China has long ceased to use Hong Kong as the main transportation route for munitions since Japan occupied Guangzhou and blockaded the coast of South China.

### British Opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is Highly Valued by American Newspapers

Washington, D.C.: Washington newspapers said yesterday that the British military's opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is to give China new hope in its war of resistance against Japan. Washington newspapers said that the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the United States' increase in material assistance to China and the imposition of embargoes on Japan are tantamount to opening a new page in Far Eastern history. The newspaper said that the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road has another significance, that is, the United Kingdom has abandoned its policy of appeasing Japan. The newspaper concluded that the United States' aid to China will not lack British cooperation in the future. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

New York: The New York Daily Mirror recently wrote an article emphasizing the importance of reopening the Burma Road, and pointed out that the United States has successively loaned China US$85 million, an amount exceeding the current US investment in China. Therefore, the newspaper said that the United States is participating in encouraging the United Kingdom to increase China's courage, patriotism, and spirit of sacrifice to resist Japan. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

Honolulu: Zhao Jun, an expert from the Chinese Ministry of Finance, declared here yesterday that the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road has greatly excited China. Mr. Zhao is currently planning to take the Philippine Clipper across the Pacific to New York and is currently staying here. He said that the United Kingdom's reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the United States' ban on the export of scrap iron and gasoline used for airplanes to Japan have greatly excited China. According to Mr. Zhao, China has enough military supplies for two years, so the reopening of the Burma Road can alleviate the fear of lack of storage. He also said that it is doubtful that Japan can force the transportation of the Yunnan-Burma Road to a standstill by bombing with airplanes. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### Japanese Newspapers Warn Citizens That the Eastern Situation Is Serious

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today prominently published news of Japanese planes bombing the Chinese territory of the Yunnan-Burma Road, which has already been reopened, and at the same time issued warnings to the Japanese people that they should prepare to fight against the United Kingdom and the United States. The news was transmitted from an undisclosed Japanese air force base, including a special article by a reporter interviewing airplane commander Yamamoto. According to Yamamoto, who led the Japanese airplane squadron that attacked the Yunnan-Burma Road yesterday, "The roads deep into the interior are no longer our enemy. We can fly to any point in the interior and strike it." He also said that the airplanes he led did not encounter resistance from Chinese planes when bombing bridges, nor did they see anti-aircraft fire shooting at them. The National News warned the Japanese people today that the situation in the Far East is gradually becoming serious. The newspaper said, "In order to achieve our great goals in East Asia and to preserve the dignity of the Japanese nation, we should make full preparations so that we can choose one of the paths to fight against the United Kingdom and the United States." The National News said that the news from the United Kingdom about shipping supplies by ship from Hong Kong to supply the Chongqing government "is an open challenge to Japan." Therefore, how the situation will develop in the future will depend entirely on the actions of the United Kingdom. The newspaper further said that Japan is "prepared to deal with any incident with the strongest determination." The newspaper continued to say that the United Kingdom's reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road has adopted a "hostile posture" towards Japan. The reason for this is that the United Kingdom wants to cooperate with the United States to "control" Japan. As for the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States, it is attempting to interfere with Japan's policy of building a new order in Greater East Asia. Therefore, Japan must adopt a firm position towards the United Kingdom and the United States. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### The Thai-French Territorial Issue; Negotiations Have Not Made Progress; The French Ambassador Visited the Thai Foreign Minister for Discussions; Vietnamese Authorities Will Send Representatives to Thailand

Bangkok: Thai newspapers, under the impetus of the government's propaganda office yesterday, intensified their anti-French Vietnamese rhetoric. Thai newspapers claimed that the Vietnamese authorities are arresting Thai nationals on a large scale every day and have stopped allowing Thai people to continue entering the country. It is claimed that a team of Annamese soldiers escaped from the Vietnamese border this week and surrendered to Thailand. The Thai authorities immediately disarmed them for investigation. The propaganda office declared, "If we find that the Annamese soldiers are indeed sincere in their surrender, they can enjoy the same good treatment as other refugees." At the same time, Thai diplomatic agencies declared that negotiations on the Thai-French organization of a mixed commission to resolve the Vietnamese territorial issue have not made progress so far. The French ambassador visited the Thai Foreign Minister two days ago, but the official did not publish any documents related to the content of the two people's talks. It is believed that the Vietnamese authorities will send a delegation to Thailand soon, but the delegation will only be authorized to discuss the small issues related to border incidents in Thailand's demands.

The notice also clearly instructs that they should take neutral ships to avoid danger. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 19th)

Committee Member Chen Mingshu also wished President Dai's trip to achieve complete success in the unity and cooperation between the Chinese, Indian, and Burmese peoples. (Dispatch on the 19th)

### The New US Loan to China; Can Be Announced Within Days; Will Be US$50 Million in a Few Days

Washington, D.C.: A new US loan to China is currently being anticipated, and the amount is larger than before. According to well-informed sources, the Chinese authorities previously requested a loan of US$100 million. When Japan announced its accession to the Axis powers, the US government had already loaned China US$25 million. Some observers believe that the US's quick lending of a large sum of money to China is a well-known gesture to make Japan understand that the US will back China to resist Japanese aggression. It is expected that the new loan can be announced within days, and the amount is almost US$50 million. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Editorial

### The Anglo-German Diplomatic Contest for the Soviet Union

After inspecting Malta and visiting Egypt, British Secretary of War Eden is about to travel to Istanbul, Turkey. It is said that this trip, in addition to convening a conference of ambassadors and ministers to the Soviet Union and the Balkan Peninsula to review the situation in Southeastern Europe and the Near East, will also negotiate a plan with the Turkish authorities regarding inviting Soviet cooperation, which will be sent to Moscow through diplomatic channels, or even personally to the Soviet Union, to be considered by Stalin. Undoubtedly, this is the prelude to another new development in the European war.

As early as the beginning of the month, that is, a few days after the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, this newspaper asserted that for Germany and Italy to defeat Britain, it would be useless to scare the United States away from aiding Britain with this paper alliance alone. It must further open up a way out in the Mediterranean. In other words, "Either try to get Spain to participate in the war, or launch new adventures in Southeastern Europe in order to change the strategic situation in the eastern Mediterranean." Sure enough, while things were heating up in the Far East due to the sudden tension in US-Japan relations, the German military authorities unexpectedly went against the expectations of people in Tokyo, and instead of trying to contain the actions of the United States in the Atlantic, they seemed to be acting alone. They sent troops to Romania, extending their military power all the way to the coast of the Black Sea, which was irrelevant to the war in the Far East. This move, on the one hand, confirmed the previous speculation of this newspaper, making the world aware that the Balkan Peninsula would be in trouble from now on, and on the other hand, it reflected the different dreams of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the same bed, and that their wooing of Japan was only for their own sake, not in sincerely helping Tokyo; this is a fact that the world can see when paying attention to the situation in Southeastern Europe.

German troops entered Romania on the 9th of this month: According to reports in recent days, the Germans are clearly planning a long-term occupation. The first step at present is of course to set up military bases and control Romania's military power; the second step is to plunder all economic resources: its ultimate goal is nothing more than to turn Romania into a vassal of Germany, so that it can be used as a basis for advancing into Southeastern Europe and even into the Near East in the future. As for the future actions of Germany and Italy in the Balkan Peninsula, it is still difficult to know in which direction they will develop first: One said that German troops will pass through Romania and Bulgaria to attack Turkey, and Italian troops will pass through Yugoslavia and Albania to coerce Greece from both land and sea, in order to achieve a containment effect; some people also believe that Germany and Italy will first firmly pull Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia into the Axis sphere of influence, and then concentrate their forces to attack Greece first, in order to occupy its ports, so as to echo the war in Egypt. As for Turkey, unless the country sends troops to aid Greece, they will not bother for the time being, in order to implement a strategy of defeating them one by one.

The British government, of course, has long been aware of this attempt by Germany and Italy, so on the one hand, it is in close contact with Greece, and on the other hand, it is turning its attention to the Soviet Union; because it is well known that the Soviet Union is concerned about the situation in Southeastern Europe. If the British do not want to contain the actions of Germany and Italy, then there is no reason not to focus on the Soviet Union. As early as the Tsarist era, the Dardanelles Strait and the Sea of Marmara were the lifeline in the eyes of the St. Petersburg government; the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 was caused by this. Until the Berlin Conference the following year, the Tsarist government was still striving for the free navigation of the straits and the independence of Bulgaria; since the revolution, the Soviet authorities have always regarded the Black Sea as "Russian." When the Montreux Convention was established in July 1936, Moscow never let go of its use of the straits; if it is said that the Soviet authorities have suddenly changed their policy at this time, and can sit idly by while German military power invades Romania and Bulgaria, sit idly by while German warships travel on the Danube River, sit idly by while German submarines haunt the Black Sea coast, and even sit idly by while the Dardanelles Strait falls into German hands, and can all "turn a blind eye," this is something that no one can believe. Therefore, although German sources have strongly stated that Germany's entry into Romania has long been understood by the Soviet Union, the diplomatic contacts between the United Kingdom, Turkey, and the Soviet Union these days have the following obvious facts: On the very day that German troops advanced eastward, Turkey's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktay, who had been on vacation for a long time, suddenly returned to his post, this is one; Soviet ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov had a long talk with Turkish President Inonu on the 17th, and the Turkish Chief of General Staff was also present, this is two; a Turkish military delegation visited Greece to inspect the various fortresses, and at the same time, it was rumored that Turkey and Greece had established a military agreement, this is three. In addition to the rumors that British Secretary of War Eden is about to go to the Soviet Union to present a cooperation plan in person, it can be seen that targeting the future actions of Germany and Italy, or even the "change of attitude" of the Soviet authorities that many people are yearning for. Of course, the so-called "change of attitude" here may only be a kind of "expression of dissent," and may not necessarily lead to the stage of "Anglo-Soviet cooperation": However, even this "expression of dissent," if it is really to be realized, at least requires the British concessions to the Soviet Union to exceed the "exchange conditions" that Germany and Italy can offer to the Soviet Union, because Moscow's diplomacy is a calm and serious realist diplomacy, and the distinction between interests is the clearest. Therefore, it is said that the key to the future development of the Balkan situation lies in the rise and fall of the Anglo-German diplomatic contest for the Soviet Union, which we firmly believe is largely correct.

### Fierce Battle on the South Bank of the Fuchun River; Zhuji City Completely Recaptured; Extremely Heavy Casualties on Both Sides After a Day and Night of Bloody Battle

### In Response to the Current Anti-Japanese Movement, the United States and the Soviet Union are Holding Talks; the United States Hopes the Soviet Union will Announce Material Aid to China; the Soviet Union Denies Convening a Four-Power Conference

Washington. News last night stated that the current talks between the United States and the Soviet Union are seeking to improve US-Soviet relations in order to resist Japan's current actions. These actions by Japan directly or indirectly hinder the interests and freedom of action of the Soviet Union and the United States. It is reported that most of the talks are being conducted in Washington by Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to Washington Umansky. These two diplomats have met several times a week in the past month. It is understood that the main purpose of the United States in these talks is to obtain a public declaration from the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will continue to provide material assistance to the National Government in Chongqing and station a large number of naval and land forces in the Far East. So far, the talks in Washington have only benefited the Soviet Union to some extent. Observers have not yet seen any advantages for the United States. According to well-informed sources here, the United States has very little hope of the Soviet Union issuing such a declaration. At least the Soviet Union will not issue this declaration when negotiating a non-aggression treaty with Japan. However, at this moment, the Soviet Union has already obtained economic benefits from the US-Soviet talks. It has already obtained much-needed machine tools worth $7 million from the United States and has been granted permission by the US government to borrow 51,000 tons of US tankers to transport gasoline to the Soviet Union. It is understood that the Soviet Union has requested broader economic benefits, but the details have not been released. Many people believe that the Soviet Union has also requested to purchase large quantities of copper, zinc, and lead from the United States. Most people here are skeptical that the Soviet Union can actively prevent Japan's southward advance. At the same time, there is another obstacle to US-Soviet talks, namely that most US business leaders oppose Soviet communism. US defense leaders are also not very interested in promoting US-Soviet rapprochement. This is probably because the Soviet army previously attempted to conquer Finland, so US army leaders are particularly dissatisfied with it. (United Press telegram, 19th)

Moscow. The Japanese newspaper Hochi Shimbun reported on the 16th that "the Soviet government has decided to convene a four-power Soviet-Japanese-German-Italian conference in Moscow." TASS has just issued an official statement that the above report is completely inconsistent with the facts. (TASS telegram, 19th)

Rome. It is rumored here that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will soon go to Berlin to participate in a four-nation conference of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan to establish a united and all-powerful national front to cope with the situation after the opening of the Burma Road.

### Under the Bright Moon and High Tide, Germany's Plan to Invade Britain Has Not Been Realized; Britain Was Prepared and the Navy and Air Force Showed Their Power; Naval Battle Between Britain and Germany in the Southwest Corner of the Earth

London. According to reliable neutral sources, Hitler originally chose September 16 as the date for a major invasion of Britain. Everything was prepared. The night of September 15 was bright with moonlight and the tide was high, making it an excellent opportunity for invasion. Aircraft were lined up in teams, and flat-bottomed boats and other vessels were in groups of hundreds, with troops waiting to depart. The vanguard of the air force first took off, flying densely and with great momentum. Unexpectedly, the British side fought back bravely, shooting down as many as 185 enemy aircraft. The British Air Force continued to show its power, launching a major attack on the enemy's hiding places in the English Channel. By dawn, the German army was in disarray, and the order to attack was withdrawn under the continuous heavy blows of the British Air Force. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

London. Yesterday's communique from the German Command regarding the "naval battle in the Bristol Channel" differs greatly from the information released here. London officials said that no naval battle had occurred near the Bristol Channel, and the "small battles" reported by the Germans elsewhere were inaccurate. According to a joint communique issued last night by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, on the morning of October 17, British coastal aircraft sighted four German destroyers sailing outside Brest, France. The British light fleet rushed to intercept them in poor visibility, hoping to engage the enemy ships. In the afternoon, the visibility improved slightly, and a British cruiser engaged the enemy ships at a very long distance. At that time, the enemy ships were about 100 miles southwest of Land's End in British territory when they were bombed by British ships. They retreated in a hurry. The British ships pursued them, but the visibility was poor again, and the enemy ships escaped to Brest. During the pursuit, the British ships were attacked by enemy aircraft twice, but there were no hits. British bombers also pursued the enemy ships and saw a bomb land near the bow of an enemy destroyer. It was not possible to know the results of the attack in the darkness. The German claim that a British ship was hit by a torpedo is not true, as the British ship was not damaged at all. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

London. A reporter for a certain newspaper who had just returned from a four-month trip to France said that a French doctor had told him that several thousand German soldiers in the occupied areas had been severely burned. These German soldiers had all boarded transport ships, preparing to invade. Unexpectedly, British aircraft took the opportunity to drop oil-filled bombs, setting the ships ablaze. The sea was full of burning oil, and the German soldiers who jumped into the sea to escape were all burned. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

Change of Commander of the British Home Fleet

London. The Admiralty announced yesterday that General Colthart had been appointed Commander of the Home Fleet. The appointment will take effect on December 2. (United Press telegram, 19th)

Madrid. Regarding the change of British naval commander, political circles here claim that this is not surprising. The most noteworthy decision is the removal of Admiral Forbes, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, and his replacement by Vice Admiral Tovey. Tovey is 55 years old and is still considered young in the British mind. He is little known outside naval circles. In the navy, he enjoys the nickname "Devil." He spent most of his time researching torpedo weapons and commanded the destroyer "Onslow" in the Battle of Jutland. Since 1937, he has belonged to the Mediterranean Fleet. In recent months, he has participated in the Mediterranean battles. But the most important figure in the British fleet strategy is Vice Admiral Blake, Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, who has been replaced by Rear Admiral Heywood. Heywood led the British fleet in South America to attack the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" and was promoted to his current position. He is also a fierce general. His main task is to guide naval warfare related to the entire empire. (United Press telegram, 19th)

### German Aircraft Adopt New Tactics; Daylight Air Raids on London; Dive Bombing and Machine Gun Strafing; Area Bombed in Air Raid the Night Before Last Expanded

London. This afternoon, German aircraft tried a new technique for daylight air raids. The method was to suddenly dive down from the clouds, drop several bombs, and open fire with machine guns, then quickly climb back into the clouds in a matter of seconds. Enemy aircraft using the above-mentioned air raid method were discovered in a certain city in the Midlands and two towns on the southeast coast, but there were no casualties among the residents. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

London. Although the weather was bad and the visibility was poor last night, enemy aircraft continued to air raid London. According to a communique issued by the Air Ministry and the Home Security Ministry, German aircraft began to attack after nightfall and did not stop until this morning. Then, small-scale bombings continued. The scope of the German air raids was quite wide, and attention was focused on London and the Midlands. Many high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell in the London area. Houses, shops, and factories were damaged, but casualties were not significant. Fires broke out in some places in a certain city in the Midlands, but they were quickly extinguished. Several places in southeastern England were also bombed, and the damage and casualties were very light. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

British Air Force's One-Week Battle Results

London. In the week ending on the morning of October 18, British aircraft carried out more than 140 air raids on German territory and its occupied areas. The main targets bombed included the Danziger Strasse gas plant, the Tempelhof railway yard, the power station, the Lichterfelde station, and the freight yard. All of the above locations are in Berlin. The artificial rubber factory in Politz near Stettin was also bombed by British aircraft. Kiel was bombed several nights. The Krupp factory in Essen was also bombed twice in a row. British aircraft also attacked the large-scale artificial rubber factory in Launa and the oil depot in Magdeburg. Although all of the above air raids were carried out in bad weather, only ten British aircraft were lost. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

### German Military Report

Berlin. This afternoon, the German military report stated that German submarines had sunk a total of 31 enemy merchant ships in recent days, totaling 173,650 tons. Among them, 26 were sunk in convoys. Although the weather in England was bad, our aircraft continued to bomb military targets throughout England, destroying a large water plant and hitting several munitions factories in southern and central England. Our aircraft bombed docks and factories on the north and south banks of the Thames in London last night, destroying many places. Munitions factories in Birmingham were also bombed by our aircraft. German long-range guns shelled Dover again yesterday. Several British aircraft invaded northern and western Germany last night, destroying several houses. There were no military losses. Two German aircraft did not return to their original defenses. (Haitong telegram, 19th)

### Eden's Visit to Egypt Aims to Strengthen British-Egyptian Cooperation; Egyptian Parliament Set to Convene Next Month; British Army Divisions Open in Egypt to Provide Reinforcements

Cairo. British War Minister Eden's visit to Egypt has had an excellent effect on strengthening British-Egyptian cooperation and has enhanced the existing beliefs of the people. According to reliable sources, the Egyptian Parliament will convene on November 14. At that time, Egyptian politicians will have the opportunity to review Egypt's situation since the Italian army began to invade Egyptian territory. Egyptian government officials such as Ahmed Maher have long advocated convening Parliament, believing that Italy's actions are a direct threat to Egypt and that Parliament should be convened immediately to discuss the path Egypt should take. Soldiers from all parts of the British Empire pass by every day, which is a great comfort to the people. The Egyptian government is also aware of the danger of the current situation and is paying close attention to the false news broadcast by the Axis powers. It has instructed its diplomats and consuls stationed abroad to earnestly resist this kind of rumor. Alexandria is as quiet as ever, with no signs of air raid damage. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

London. According to Rome Radio, one of the four British divisions, a mechanized unit, arrived in Mersa Matruh, Egypt, on Thursday. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

### The Soviet Union Will Not Abandon Traditional Interests in the Balkans; Maintaining Caution to Avoid Friction with the Axis Powers; 300 More German Aircraft Arrive in Romania

London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that in view of the lack of real progress in political and diplomatic aspects, Axis newspapers and propaganda agencies are deliberately fabricating news to mislead the public. The German side recognizes the appointment of Soner as the Spanish foreign minister as one of the most important events, and speaks extravagantly about the very important development of Spain's attitude. However, people only need to recall the expectations of the Axis powers when Soner visited Berlin and Weimar to know how little basis there is for their claims. The German side also regards the visit of German commercial expert Schnurre to Moscow and the return of the German ambassador to Germany, Schulenburg, as the beginning of a new era in German-Soviet relations, believing that the Soviet Union will greatly increase trade with Germany and recognize Germany's living space and leadership in the Balkans. It should be known that anyone who knows a little about the Soviet Union's traditional interests in the Balkans and the Soviet Union's cautious attention to its position in the Black Sea will understand the value of these German remarks. The Soviet Union may not take actions at this time that could cause friction with the Axis powers, but it will not abandon its true and traditional interests either. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

London. Sources in Romania say that a total of 150 German bombers and fighters have now arrived in Romania. In addition, there are reports that another 150 German aircraft, along with 800 pilots and instructors, also arrived in Romania yesterday. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

Conflict Between German and Soviet Troops; Soviet Statement Denies

Moscow. TASS recently issued the following statement: British newspapers "News Chronicle," "Daily Herald," "Daily Mail," and "Daily Express" recently carried Reuters news stating that Soviet troops have already entered Romania, and that Soviet destroyers have also sunk a Romanian ship in the Black Sea. Also, the Turkish newspaper "Istanbul" carried a London telegram on the 16th stating that there had been a conflict between German and Soviet border guards near Galati. TASS has just issued an official statement that the above reports are completely groundless. (TASS telegram, 19th)

Soviet-Turkish Relations Are Closely Related and Understanding Can Be Expected to Be Established

The "Lyon Republicain" recently published an editorial discussing the relationship between Turkey and the Soviet Union, stating that the two countries are now working to establish an understanding. This understanding is beneficial to both countries in peacetime and in wartime. Therefore, it should not be judged from the perspective of the two countries taking joint military action in the future. However, Turkey has declared its determination to defend itself against any direct threat. The Soviet Union also hopes to obtain guarantees for its position in the Near East. Therefore, it is obvious that both sides are eager to conclude an agreement so as to take parallel action when necessary to cope with any eventuality. The geographical location of the Soviet Union and Turkey has prompted the two countries to reach whatever understanding they have reached. This factor is of great significance, but it is not that Turkey is preparing to participate in the current European war with the direct or indirect support of the Soviet Union. (Havas telegram, 18th)

Romanian Industrial System Thoroughly Reorganized

Bucharest. German experts are arriving here every day to take charge of munitions and aircraft manufacturing plants. The Romanian Council of Ministers has passed a number of decrees to make the Romanian economy supplement the German economy. From now on, the industries that Romania should encourage are those that manufacture war equipment or use Romanian raw materials exclusively. The Romanian industrial system will be reorganized, and all industries classified as parasitic industries will be shut down immediately, and plans to increase agricultural production are also being planned.

### Spain's New Foreign Minister, Suner, Makes Inaugural Declaration; Reforming Diplomacy for the Welfare of the Country; Welcoming the Falangist Party to Participate in Cooperation

Madrid. Spain's new Foreign Minister Suner officially took office yesterday afternoon. Those who attended included Leiva Lara, the new Minister of Industry and Commerce, Cazelle, the Minister of Education, Martin, the Youth League leader, Davila, and the National Labor Party leader, Mereno. Suner said in his speech that he would proceed in accordance with the ideals and purposes he had previously set, and would do his best to serve the interests of the country in this emergency. All ineffective methods in the ministry in the past would be abolished, and competent personnel would still be sought for cooperation. Recalling the past achievements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is heartbreaking. Spain is ignorant of important international issues, and is inferior to the foreign ministries of European countries. From now on, it will work hard to improve itself and strive for progress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will respect the Falangist Party from now on, and the spirit of the party will fill the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its work. (Haitong)

Madrid. Spain's newly appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce, Cazelle, declared when he took office yesterday afternoon that he was an old member of the Falangist Party, and that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would implement the various principles and requirements of the Falangist Party in the future. He firmly believed that he would be able to obtain the cooperation of his colleagues when implementing this work. He would never compromise under any circumstances, because this principle was the political program of the Falangist Party. He went on to say that he would work hard, because work was the essence of his entire life, and he firmly believed that he would be able to complete the plan that Spain needed. (Haitong telegram, 19th)

Manila. Spanish expatriates here, led by Solana, sent a telegram to General Franco, urging him not to get involved in the war vortex, saying that they had fought hard for three years for civilization and the Catholic faith to obtain peace, and could not bear to have the people shed blood again. According to Solana, who recently returned here from Spain and the United States, he believes that Spain will not participate in the war. (Reuters telegram, 19th)

### Former President of Catalonia Dies in Prison; Spaniards Seeking Refuge in France Will Encounter New Terror

New York. Former Spanish Foreign Minister Valluit told people today that he expected Spaniards seeking refuge in France to encounter new terror. Former President of the Catalan government, Campanys, was one of the famous figures in Spain when defending Barcelona. Afterwards, he sought refuge in France. After France surrendered to Germany, Campanys was arrested and handed over to Spain, and has recently been executed in prison. Now, German secret police chief Himmler is visiting Madrid, which is probably the starting point for a new terrorist action by the German secret police to search and kill Spaniards seeking refuge in France.

### U.S. Plans Massive National Defense Expenditure: New York Financial Experts Estimate It Will Increase to $5 Billion to $7.5 Billion

New York - Financial experts here estimate that the United States' planned national defense program will require expenditures of $5 billion to $7.5 billion in the second seven-year period after seven years. The U.S. Congress has already allocated $1,500,000,000 to expand and modernize the army and navy. However, compared with future needs, this sum is still insignificant. To bring its

military apparatus up to the same level as powerful nations, the United States cannot rely solely on the aforementioned figure. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall recently told the Senate Budget Committee that doubling Germany's army and equipment would require $100,000,000,000. In addition to the $1,500,000,000 already allocated by Congress, it is estimated that properly equipping an army of two million men would require at least $1 billion. Thus, the cost of existing equipment alone would reach about $3.5 billion.

The annual maintenance cost of a two-ocean navy is estimated to be at least $100 million, and the annual maintenance cost of an army of 2 million men would average around $200 million to $300 million. The annual cost of replacing naval and army equipment would also be around $500 million. Naval and army leaders acknowledge that many unforeseen factors could alter current estimates. For example, the United States currently has 395 warships, but building a two-ocean navy would require at least 700 warships. There are no reliable estimates of the cost of improving coastal facilities and building new operational bases. In addition, protecting

the Panama Canal will require substantial investment in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific coasts. Estimates for air force expenditures are scarce due to a lack of precedent. The Navy currently has 1,765 aircraft and has added 10,000 personnel. Some experts believe these new aircraft will require 30,000 airmen. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently told the Senate that the total amount allocated to the army in early August was $6,808,000,000. According to current plans, the army will increase by at least 700 percent, and mechanization costs will increase by 1,500 percent. The army

currently has 2,700 aircraft and has added 26,000 personnel. Just the ground support personnel for these aircraft may require 400,000 people. The annual cost of maintaining each person in the army is already around $1,000. If the army is transformed to adapt to new circumstances, it may increase to $1,500. Thus, the total annual cost of army maintenance should be between $200 million and $300 million. Barron's magazine speculates on future national defense expenditures, predicting that these expenditures will significantly stimulate industry and commerce and that the federal government's

deficit will increase further. The current annual government deficit is around $300 million to $400 million and may increase to $600 million to $800 million in the future. The magazine also said that since 1933, government spending has been $60 billion, with a deficit of $20 billion. In the second seven-year period, government spending may be $100 billion to $115 billion, and the deficit may be $40 billion to $60 billion. (United Press, 19th)

### Japanese-Dutch Oil Rights Negotiations in Stalemate

Manila - According to telephone messages from Bandung, negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands in Batavia on oil rights have reached a stalemate due to Japan's insistence on obtaining unrefined oil. It is said that Dutch authorities, to protect their oil refining investments in the Dutch East Indies, insist on only allowing the export of refined oil. The authorities did not comment on the report in the New York Times that Japan would obtain 41% of its required oil from the Dutch East Indies in the next six months. However, they denied exerting pressure on the Dutch East Indies, saying that the negotiations were off to a good start. It should be noted that the Japanese representatives are negotiating with private companies, one of which is the Dutch Royal Shell, an Anglo-Dutch investment, and the other of which has American capital. It is believed that the latter company would not act without consulting Washington. (United Press, 19th)

### U.S. Presidential Election: Poll Test

New York - According to a Reuters dispatch from its chief correspondent in the United States, Moloney, the results of the poll conducted by Reuters in the 48 states of the United States show that President Roosevelt will be re-elected on November 5 with more than double the majority of Republican presidential candidate Willkie. According to this poll, supporters of President Roosevelt will account for 34 states with 366 votes, and supporters of Willkie will account for 14 states with 165 votes. In the last presidential election, Reuters conducted the first poll and accurately predicted President Roosevelt's victory over Landon and his re-election. (Reuters, 19th)

### American Nationals in the Far East to Begin Evacuation Soon: "Washington" Set Sail West Yesterday; Peking Union Medical College Hospital Reduces Operations

Washington - The government's accelerated evacuation of American nationals from the Far East is expected to begin today, as the American President Lines' "Washington" is scheduled to sail from New York to ports in Japan and China today. The "Washington" has a special structure and can carry 1,500 American nationals. The vessel will travel to the East via the Panama Canal and San Pedro. The "Washington" is currently fully loaded with military supplies to the Panama Canal to arm the naval reserve forces mobilized there. When it arrives in San Pedro, the vessel will reload with munitions to supply the U.S. Army and Navy in the Far East. Authorities pointed out that evacuating American nationals from the Philippines is difficult because, in principle, the Philippine people have not been advised by the government to leave China, Japan, "Manchukuo," Hong Kong, and French Vietnam as soon as possible. However, it is understood that in order to avoid a future influx of American nationals from the Far East into the Philippines, the authorities feel it is necessary to evacuate women and children from the Philippines as soon as possible. (United Press, 19th)

Peking - Following the U.S. State Department's advice for American nationals in the Far East to evacuate, Peking Union Medical College Hospital will implement a reorganization. The hospital staff held a meeting and decided that American professors, doctors, and other staff should prepare to return home as soon as possible. The hospital's operations have been reduced, and the salaries of Chinese staff have been reduced by 30%. If the current situation does not change in the next six months, Chinese staff can seek employment elsewhere. (Havas, 18th)

### Finance: Gold Market in Turmoil; Speculators Force Short Covering, Squeeze Intensifies; Futures Trading May Be Introduced on Monday

Yesterday, the spot gold market in this city experienced another wild surge. Prices soared to an astonishing level, flying past the 5,800 yuan mark and once reaching the 5,900 yuan threshold. This was unexpected, given the negative news and the weakening exchange rate. The reason is the dwindling supply of spot gold. In June and July of this year, when the spot price was around 700 yuan above the U.S. dollar exchange rate, investors started hoarding, and Hong Kong syndicates repeatedly scoured the market. Recently, with international tensions escalating, wealthy individuals have been increasingly inclined to collect gold. Therefore, although sellers have been repeatedly shorting in excess due to various news stimuli, the supply of gold has been dwindling and is now difficult to obtain. Moreover, credit is remarkably loose, with discount rates for 1,000 yuan being only a dozen yuan or so, further empowering buyers to force shorts to deliver. This has intensified the squeeze. Subsequently, the yarn industry association decided that sellers must deliver the goods. If they have no goods and do not cover their positions, they will be settled at the noon black market exchange rate (around 5,990 yuan). The sellers panicked and rushed to cover their positions. The market opened high at 5,750 yuan, briefly falling to 5,730 yuan. Later, there were reports that foreign banks were also scouring the market. Some small private banks and securities firms followed suit, buying to cover their positions. Although the exchange rate weakened, the price still diverged and rose sharply, reaching a high of 5,890 yuan. Around noon, gold shops and jewelers sold off some physical gold, causing the momentum to falter and the price to drop by a hundred or so yuan. However, short covering soon resumed, and the price ultimately rose to 5,820 yuan, a gain of 115 yuan. The closing price was 5 yuan 84375 above the U.S. dollar closing rate, equivalent to 5,989 yuan and 3 jiao, or 159 yuan and 3 jiao. It was later reported that some positions had not been settled and the shorts had expressed objections. Rumors are circulating that futures trading may be introduced on Monday, pending a decision after discussions in a certain location today. Over 2,000 taels were traded in the first half of the day. Jewelry gold reached a high of 610 yuan and closed at 600 yuan, a gain of 10 yuan. Government gold, etc., remained unchanged.

Closing in on the 5,900 Yuan Mark

The market opened strong this morning. Gold shops initially bid 5,750 yuan per tael, up 35 yuan from the previous day. Bank syndicates aggressively bought, pushing the price up several tens of yuan. After the gold shops indicated their sincerity, the price was suppressed. Bank syndicates sold 10 taels to the gold shops, dropping the price to 5,730 yuan. At that time, speculators took advantage of the dip to cover their positions, causing the price to soar to near the 5,900 yuan mark. The syndicate bought 10 taels from the gold shops, pushing the price up to 5,890 yuan. Soon after, the gold shops, seeing the high price, came forward to sell, gradually lowering the price to 5,800 yuan. The bank syndicates conducted 10 taels of hedging transactions, and the jewelers sold 10 taels to the gold shops, causing the price to plunge to 5,740 yuan. However, speculators and money changers rushed to buy, resulting in a rebound above the 5,800 yuan mark. The syndicate bought 10 taels from the jewelers at 5,830 yuan, closing the session. Since there is no market on Saturday, the price rose 115 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 160 yuan in half a day. The selling price of physical gold from the gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than the black market price. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current spot gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed price, with little open trading.

Jewelry Gold Closes Up 10 Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was 610 yuan. After 11:00 a.m., it fell back by 10 yuan. As a result, the Da Tong company quoted 600 yuan, the same as the Xin Tong company. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

### Few Transactions in U.S. Dollar Notes

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the black market surge due to a short squeeze. British and American gold pounds also rose by 2.5 yuan each. Transactions in British gold notes were still rare, and the market price remained stable. The movement in U.S. dollar notes was minimal, closing down by 1 jiao. Demand for Hong Kong notes was strong, and the price rose by 2 fen. Demand for Japanese gold notes was slightly weak, and the market price softened slightly. The discount rate fell to 1 yuan and 3 jiao 9 fen. Demand for Korean notes was not strong, and the market price rose slightly to 1 yuan and 1 jiao 8 fen in the evening.

### Constant Selling Pressure in Foreign Exchange Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, the selling pressure did not abate, and speculators continued to sell off in small amounts. Moreover, frequent congestion in Hong Kong telegrams resulted in an oversupply, causing the trend to weaken. The market was strongest in the morning, with the U.S. exchange rate already at 5 yuan 875. Brokers and middlemen also sold to Japanese banks at a low price of 5 yuan 875. In terms of market sentiment, there was a continuing weakening trend. The closing results for the day were: British currency was 0.015625 higher, and American currency was 0.03125 higher, for both spot and futures.

Hong Kong Telegraph Takes the Lead, Followed by Chinese Merchants

The market opened this morning with London telegraphs, with both near and deferred deliveries unchanged. New York silver prices were stable, and London spot gold was fixed. The exchange rates for British vs. American and Shanghai were all unchanged. American vs. British fell by 2.5, against Shanghai was unchanged, and there was no market for French. The central bank's listed prices for various exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of British gold at 3/4/7625 and U.S. currency at 5 yuan 8125. Compared to the closing prices of the previous day, British was tighter by 0.015625, and was longer by 0.03125, due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, the Hong Kong telegraph was the first to release the near and deferred U.S. exchange rates, selling to American banks and foreign banks for both the current month and the next month at 5 yuan 84375. Moreover, since Chinese merchant speculators followed suit, the market weakened further. For the current month, American currency was sold by the Chinese to foreign banks at 5 yuan 84275 to 875. HSBC's listed prices for various exchange rates were unchanged. The silver equalization tax was unchanged. Subsequently, the Hong Kong telegraph again offered to foreign banks for the current month's British gold at 2/4/796875. Japanese banks also entered through brokers for the current month's American exchange rate, still firm at 5 yuan 875. By noon, the market stabilized. The result was British gold at 3/4/796875 and U.S. currency at 5 yuan 84375. The current month was the same price as the spot price. November's Central Bank's British gold was 3/4/78125 and U.S. currency was 5 yuan 825, with both spot and futures prices loosening by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to yesterday's closing price. Since there is no market on Saturday afternoon.

### Soybean Oilcake: Speculators Control the Oil Market, Oil Consumers Have No Oil to Consume

Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to be weak. The transport permits have not been issued for four days, while the supply remains continuous. Ordinary speculators with no real financial strength have no choice but to sell at a loss according to market prices. Qingdao raw oil fell below the 100 yuan mark in the morning. Jiaozhou raw oil was seen at 70 yuan. The market in the producing area was also weak and short-lived. Due to unstable market sentiment, although it has been falling for a week, the market situation is still supported by major speculators. Therefore, there are still no alarming situations. The market was turbulent again at yesterday's close. Rumors of positive news suddenly spread, and speculators became active again. The market price rebounded, ultimately matching the previous day's closing price. The same was true for soybean oil. It fell first and then rebounded. The price of soybean oil from the Dayou factory rose by half a yuan compared to the previous day. It was estimated that 500 or so dan were traded. The price initially opened at 84 yuan and 5 jiao, then at 84 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen, and closed up at 85 yuan and 5 jiao. There were also 20 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil traded at 73 yuan and 5 jiao, and 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil traded at 75 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were traded at 75 yuan and 5 jiao to 70 yuan, then rebounding to 70 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen. More than 1,000 pieces were ordered for delivery in three or four weeks at 72 yuan to 71 yuan and 5 jiao, rebounding to 72 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen at the close. 250 barrels of current oil from Qingdao were traded at 98 yuan rising to 100 yuan. 600-700 barrels were opened for November delivery, with the price falling from 100 yuan to 99 yuan and 5 jiao, then rebounding to 102 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen. At the close, 300 barrels were ordered for delivery in late November at 102 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen to 103 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen. Because the Shanghai oil market is controlled by major speculators, oil prices have risen sharply, and oil consumers have no oil to consume.

300 pieces of soybean oilcake will be shipped to Siam today.

### Grain: Supply of Foreign Rice is Booming; New Du glutinous rice also arrives continuously, causing foreign rice to fall back by one or two yuan

The supply of foreign rice is booming, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, another 10,776 bags arrived from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship, which is currently docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. In addition, the Java Company's Zhazha, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, also transported 100 tons of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 1,000 bags. It is said that a large batch is still coming. The ESSI, managed by the Zhongtong Company, has unloaded all the rice and yesterday went to Haiphong to load more rice for Shanghai.

Yesterday, foreign rice arrived in large quantities. New arrivals and those waiting to be unloaded totaled 100,000 bags. Moreover, prices abroad have been lowered due to exchange rate loosening. The market sentiment has weakened, and it continues to decline. As the market price gradually loosens, speculators and football players have no way to participate. The market is following the natural trend and declining daily. Yesterday, the price for raw packed No. 2 Saigon rice opened at 74 yuan, but there was little demand. In the afternoon, buyers only bid 72 yuan and 5 jiao. Although no new transactions were concluded, the asking price was also below 73 yuan and 5 jiao. The selling pressure of foreign rice is increasing, and buyers are all watching from the sidelines. Apart from a few actual sales made at low prices, new speculators both inside and outside the industry have completely withdrawn from the market. Therefore, the opening price in the early market fell, and the closing price in the afternoon was one yuan to almost two yuan lower than the previous evening. No. 2 Saigon was 63 yuan and 5 jiao to 62 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 Siam was 61 yuan to 60 yuan, and the final price was 59 yuan. Huojiao was 67 or 8 yuan, down to 63 or 4 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 60 yuan and 5 jiao to 59 yuan. A total of 4,000 bags of milled rice and 100 tons of raw packed rice were traded throughout the day. Wuhu kejian also fell by one or two yuan, opening at 60 yuan and 5 jiao to 59 yuan and 5 jiao.

Only 2,000 or so shi of new glutinous rice and sharp kiln rice arrived yesterday. However, due to the widespread need caused by damage during milling, the demand from stores is still strong. The market for various new goods is still holding up and there is not much change. Kunshan new glutinous rice opened at 78 yuan for raw packed rice and 74 yuan per hu. Minhang new glutinous rice was 72 or 3 yuan. Sijing wild rice was 79 yuan or 78 yuan and 5 jiao. Qiaojiao kiln willow was relatively firm due to the limited arrival of goods. It was once quoted at 79 yuan in the early market, but was actually sold at 77 yuan. Dujian raw packed was 70 yuan and 65 or 6 yuan per hu. Taicang yangjian raw packed was 70 yuan. Damaged glutinous rice remained unchanged. Changbang zhongguan goods opened at 83 yuan, Su glutinous rice was 76 or 7 yuan, and Nangang early damaged per hu was 80 yuan, down to 78 yuan.

Both domestic and foreign glutinous rice are in short supply. Domestic goods have not arrived for a long time, and although foreign goods have arrived, they are limited. The market is strong because wine merchants are in the brewing season. Although other goods are average, glutinous rice is firm. High-quality market goods are scarce and still sell well. Yili glutinous rice is sold at 77 yuan per 100 yuan, and Changdan goods also sell for 75 or 6 yuan. Hong Kong special group grain glutinous rice opened at 75 yuan and 5 jiao, 75 yuan. Long grain was 74 yuan, down to 71 or 2 yuan. While the market appeared average, the price has actually increased by one yuan in secret. However, glutinous rice beans are less popular and have depreciated slightly by one yuan. It opened at 65 yuan and 5 jiao, 65 yuan.

### Difficult to Do Business in Flour and Wheat

Flour: Yesterday, the market was quiet but tight. There was no expansion in sales to northern and southern customers. The factory price of Chinese flour was 18 yuan and 5 jiao, and the wholesale price on this street remained at the original price of 16 yuan and 5 jiao. There was no change for a while. However, the return of flour from this market was limited by the supply from various factories, which was increasingly rare. The price of old brand warehouse receipts was said to be 19 yuan jiao. The prices of Bingchuan and Tianzhu brands were both 19 yuan. Various flour shops on this street have made some purchases, so the retail prices of various shops have reached 19 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao. The prices of high-grade foreign flour, such as Hongri, Dangtian, and Fushou brands, which are in short supply, are 19 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao. The retail price of each bag is as high as 10 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market was also quiet and firm. The supply from various places has been decreasing daily and is further restricted from being transported to the concession. It is temporarily impossible to buy goods. Apart from a few hundred bags occasionally delivered to Japanese factories, there are generally no formal transactions. The price of goods transported to the concession is said to be 18 yuan.

### Securities: U.S. Economic Aid Excite Bond Market Beyond Normal

Securities market: Yesterday, rumors circulated that the Sino-American loan of 50 million U.S. dollars had been successfully negotiated. Market sentiment became stronger. Short sellers covered their positions, and long investors increased their holdings. The B-share rushed out of 8 yuan and then out of 9 yuan. The A-share exceeded the highest price of 61 yuan and 2 jiao on October 7 and reached a new record of 62 yuan. This trend occurred after the 14th's entire long position had been released. It can be seen that there are many people absorbing the physical shares. The future situation is that the prices of various markets will see new highs. It is not difficult for B, D, and E shares to reach prices above 60 yuan. Yesterday morning, the B-share opened at only 57 yuan and 7 jiao. Datong bought the most aggressively. Xie Da, Ding Kang, Hong Da, Jiu Feng, and the 16th bought one after another, rushing out of 58 yuan to 8 yuan and 4 jiao in an instant. At that time, the 24th still had a surplus to sell. Tong Kang sold off its long position. Lianhe and Yichang also sold off. But the demand was strong, like a drop in the bucket. The closing price at noon rose by 5 or 7 jiao. In the afternoon, the news that the 50 million loan was successful spread, and the buying interest increased sharply. Tong Kang resumed buying. Yi Tai switched from selling to buying. Heng Fu and Gong Mao also bought aggressively. Tong Shun sold off its long position. Hong Da, Lianhe, and Lian Yi sold slightly, but the demand was strong and did little to help. The B-share pierced through the 9-yuan mark, and the A-share saw a new high of 62 yuan. The sudden and rapid progress is still in full swing. The market price closed up by 5 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. The volume of transactions was 1.2 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy were traded at a price of 77 yuan.

London, 18th (Friday) Telegram. Today, the market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks remained flat. Bank stocks continued to decline. The stock price of Mercantile Bank fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 6 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. The stock price of Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank registered shares plunged by 8 pounds to 57 pounds. There were offers but no takers. British registered shares remained unchanged.

### Jardine Brewery Shares - Public Subscription on the 24th

The news that Jardine Brewery Co., Ltd. has commissioned Lian Yang Co. to underwrite new shares was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that a total of 800,000 shares will be subscribed, of which 300,000 shares have already been identified. The remaining 500,000 shares will be publicly subscribed at the HSBC Bank on the Bund starting at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th of this month. The minimum subscription amount per household is 500 shares.

### Yarn and Cloth: Speculation in Cotton Yarn, Reluctant to Let Go Easily

The yarn market is gradually moving towards a peaceful path, but in reality, prices have been fluctuating up and down for days. Ordinary speculators have not seen real benefits, so their minds are somewhat stable. However, most outsiders are still optimistic, but most insiders are holding a wait-and-see attitude because the price has reached a high level, waiting for a clear signal before taking action. Judging from this situation, if there are no unexpected changes, the price of Shuangma yarn at 1,250 yuan may have a chance to fluctuate.

The morning market for spot yarn started with a soft but firm tone, probably because the bulls were unwilling to let go and still intended to drag in and add to their positions when prices fell. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,240 yuan, then it fell slightly to 1,238 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange market did not fall much, and the "gold gang" and scalpers came to drag in, and it gradually rose to 1,253 yuan. However, as soon as the price rose, selling pressure reappeared, and it fell back to 1,244 yuan. However, the Hong Kong gang was still actively trading coarse yarn, and buyers resumed, and it rose again to over 1,250 yuan. The closing was slightly weak. The transaction volume for half a day was 6,220 bales, and the price of 20-count Bianma yarn rose by 5 yuan. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Same trade: 5,480 bales Hong Kong: 740 bales Total: 6,220 bales

Afternoon news: Shenxin No. 2 Factory offered 1,500 bales of 20-count Tiannv yarn at 1,160 yuan, for November delivery, with a deposit of 150 yuan per bale. It was also heard that No. 9 Factory wanted to open the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn at 1,260 yuan. The two sides are still in consultation and have not yet reached an agreement. Tomorrow, 2,070 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, and another 120 pieces will be shipped to Siam.

### Cotton Merchants Order Foreign Cotton

The spot cotton market is calm, and factories have some needs, so the market situation is neither particularly prosperous nor bleak.

Kangjiang Flower 37.00 Shenxin purchased 200 pieces

White Locke Removed 242.00 Shenxin purchased 400 pieces

Dazhong Collection 262.00 Shenxin purchased 200 pieces

Brazilian Cotton 29.000 Same Trade purchased 34 pieces

MT 281.00

284.00 Same Trade purchased 300 pieces

286.00

Pingguoer 161.50 Same Trade purchased 400 pieces

162.00

Another dispatch: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, slightly active. Purchases by the same trade and partial short covering resulted in closing prices up three to four points from the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose one rupee.

Foreign cotton merchants in Shanghai have been unusually busy these days, but due to insufficient inventory in the market, large transactions have not been made. Factories have strong purchasing intentions, and it is difficult to purchase spot goods for a while. As a result, many in the same trade are ordering Indian cotton and Brazilian cotton for shipment.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth has Buyers at Lower Prices

National Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market started flat and then rose, with a very firm trend. This was because the price of raw yarn was expensive and most of the cloth prices were not enough to cover costs. However, the actual needs of customers were not strong, and the rise was slow. The opening price of various goods in the morning was flat. In the afternoon, some fine twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth rose by 1 to 1.5 jiao per piece. Fine yarn and thread fabrics rose by 3 to 5 jiao per piece. Colleagues in Muji Street searched and hoarded light-colored fine yarn and thread fabrics, such as poplin, white ground printed cloth, and grey cloth, with 1,500 to 1,600 pieces traded. White fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth traded over 600 pieces. Customer transactions were not strong. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs bought over 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang and Fujian gangs bought over 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. The Northern Route Yantai office bought over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel. Tomorrow, 795 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday, the market hovered, with a narrow range of ups and downs. The highest price for 10-pound Longtou fine cloth was 38.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 37.8 jiao. The closing price was 37.8 jiao, down 1 jiao per piece from the previous day. This was because colleagues had firm minds and came to buy when prices were low, so although the situation was loose, the ground was still tight. Intermediate fine cloths had mixed performances, while fine twill was always stable due to thin inventory. The closing price of Jiaojunzi Serge was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 5 fen, 2.5 li per yard.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable

Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable. The association set the prices. Spot goods: No. 24 coarse white, 75 yuan at the Mujian warehouse, 74.5 yuan at the outer warehouse, a small difference of 2 jiao. Transshipment goods: 59.3 jiao. Dutch red sugar was slightly soft, at 57 yuan to 56.65 jiao. Road goods were slightly tight, rising by 1 jiao to 57.2 jiao. Taikoo Chebai West Warehouse B Mark remained at 73 yuan, East Warehouse 72.6 jiao to 72.8 jiao, up 3 jiao. DY Mark 69.1 jiao, HX Mark 69 yuan, down a small jiao. H Mark Chechi 56 yuan, unchanged. Also, 3,000 tons of imported sugar arrived on the 19th, shipped from the Netherlands, and another 4,200 bags came from Hong Kong.

### Dried and Fresh Produce: Quanzhou New Dried Longan, Production Price Rises 30 Yuan

Quanzhou dried longan: It is said that the first batch of new goods is being shipped out. Seeing the expansion of sales, the owners unanimously raised the price. According to a letter yesterday, the production price rose by 30 yuan. Also, a small number of goods from Shima and Tongan may arrive in the coming days.

### Medicinal Materials: Bitter Almonds Rebound

Bitter almonds previously fell to 91 yuan in Shanghai due to more sources. Now, due to the high exchange rate, the cost has increased, and the price has increased accordingly. The current market has reached 96 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Moves But Not Smoothly

The bituminous coal market: In recent days, due to the continuous increase in the exchange rate, the cost of imported goods has naturally decreased, but the demand from all parties is moving but not smoothly. The decision to lower the price followed suit and returned to flat. Yesterday, colleagues quoted prices for dismantling: Kaiping screenings 154 yuan, Boshan screenings 144 yuan, Si Jiamachi screenings called 116 yuan. Warehouse deliveries require extra handling fees.

The Public Concession's Labor Bureau, previously due to the high exchange rate and expensive prices, could not offset the original income and expenditure. Therefore, it has implemented an increase in municipal taxes since July of this year. Yesterday, according to sources related to the Concession authorities, the Labor Bureau is still exceeding the budget, and income is not enough to cover expenditure. It is considering increasing taxes again. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:

Deficit in Budget, Seeking to Increase Taxes Again

It is reported that the Labor Bureau is now greatly affected by the rising prices, resulting in increased expenditure. Moreover, the Chinese and foreign staff in the Bureau have had to increase the exchange rate subsidies and rice subsidies due to the soaring rice prices and food costs. The rice subsidy alone has exceeded one million yuan, and the exchange rate is not included. Therefore, the Labor Bureau's budget for this year has again exceeded the limit. As a result, the Labor Bureau authorities are now considering increasing taxes again. However, this has not yet been formally discussed in a meeting, as it still needs to be studied at length by the Finance Department. It is heard that the proposed tax increase will not be too high, and it is still being determined whether it will be a universal tax or limited to certain taxes. However, the authorities have stated that they do not want to increase property taxes or increase property valuations, but this statement has not been confirmed so far.

Fundamental Solution: Suppress Rice Prices

Residents in the Concession believe that if the Labor Bureau truly has a deficit, it should first cut spending and eliminate unnecessary foreign staff. Even if this is not enough, and taxes must be increased, it would be best to increase taxes that are not universally applied. However, to get to the root of the problem, the reason why the Labor Bureau is exceeding its budget is largely due to the high cost of rice. If rice prices can be suppressed, prices will naturally fall, and the one million yuan in rice subsidies can be saved. Now, instead of seeking this solution, the Labor Bureau is simply increasing taxes, which will further increase the burden on residents. This is like draining the pond to catch the fish, which is not the way to govern.

US Deputy Consul General Accomplishes Outstanding Achievements, Returning to the US on the First of Next Month. All Parties Give Farewell Banquets and Praises

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that the US Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Butler, will leave Shanghai on November 1 aboard the SS President McKinley to return to the United States. Mr. Lockhart, who will succeed Mr. Gauss as the US Consul General in Shanghai, is expected to arrive here on the SS President Coolidge on October 23 and take office within the month. According to Mr. Butler's reply to reporters this morning, he does not know if he will return to Shanghai after his vacation in the United States. After the former US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, left here in May, Mr. Butler was responsible for handling the affairs of the US Consulate. He fulfilled his duties diligently. Last night, the American University Club (Mr. Butler is the former president of the club) held a farewell banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Butler at the Winter Garden. After presenting a gift to Mr. Butler, US Commissioner of Internal Revenue for China, Mr. Helmick, praised Mr. Butler's work over the years in his speech.

### American Mr. Pan Ningston Was Humiliated in West Shanghai Yesterday, Forced to Leave a Trolleybus for No Reason, and Has Filed a Protest with the US Consulate

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that after Japanese military police Lance Corporal Saito was stabbed on Yu Yuan Road yesterday (the 18th), the Japanese military police and "municipal police" jointly searched pedestrians and vehicles in the Western District. As of this morning (the 19th), the search is still ongoing near Yu Yuan Road and Jessfield Road. An American citizen, Mr. Pan Ningston, was insulted by the "municipal police" while passing through the Western District this morning and has filed a protest with the US Consulate here. He stated that at 7:45 am today, he was forced to leave a trolleybus in Western Shanghai by Japanese military police and "municipal police," and one of the "municipal police" placed his hand on Mr. Pan's body, apparently intending to push him out of the bus, which was an insulting act. According to Mr. Butler, the US Acting Consul General in Shanghai, he has not yet learned of the matter and cannot make any comments. It is reported that this is Mr. Pan Ningston's third protest to the US authorities. The first was when Mr. Pan's wife had a dispute with the "municipal police," and the second was when Mr. Pan himself was blocked by the "municipal police" with a rifle and forced to bend over. Both incidents were reported to the US Consulate.

### American Reservists in Shanghai Have All Enlisted, Twenty-One Have Left Shanghai on a Flagship, and the Rest Have Been Assigned to the Yangtze River Patrol Ships

The *Shanghai Times* reported that fifty-one US Navy reservists in Shanghai were mobilized last Saturday and Sunday and underwent physical examinations. Twenty-one of them left Shanghai yesterday (the 18th) morning aboard the USS Augusta, the flagship of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, destination unknown. The remaining thirty have been called to active duty, received uniforms, and were seen wearing their uniforms last night, appearing quite pleased. It is heard that these thirty men have been assigned to the US Navy's Yangtze River Patrol ships, replacing the thirty-five regular officers and men of the USS Luzon and USS Guam, which are currently docked in Shanghai. It is also heard that these thirty-five men boarded the USS Augusta yesterday morning and headed south. According to an unofficial statement from the US Navy, the twenty-one US Navy reservists who left Shanghai aboard the USS Augusta are going to serve in the 16th Naval District in Cavite, Philippines. The thirty reservists assigned to the Yangtze River Patrol ships USS Luzon and USS Guam have all been enlisted according to their previous ranks. They have all expressed optimism and joy about re-entering the military.

### Estonian Consulate Archives Seized, Done by Soviet Representatives According to Law, Consular Corps Expresses Inability to Interfere

At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th), detectives from the Public Concession Police, accompanied by personnel from the Soviet Consulate, carried a seizure warrant issued by the First Special District Court to the Estonian Consulate General in Shanghai at 203 Seymour Road to execute it.  The Estonian Consulate Secretary, Miller, resisted and requested assistance from the Secretary-General of the Consular Corps and a lawyer by telephone. The Consular Corps stated that the Soviet Consulate personnel were acting according to legal procedures and expressed their inability to interfere. Consequently, all the archives of the consulate were sealed by the police and Soviet Consulate personnel.  The affairs of the people of the Baltic countries, both domestic and foreign, have now been moved to the Kremlin. The authorities of Latvia and Lithuania in this area have not refused to hand over various files to the Soviet authorities, but Miller alone refused to comply.

Soviet Note to the Chinese Government

According to reliable sources obtained by this newspaper last night, in September of this year, the Soviet government sent a note to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing stating that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia had merged with the Soviet Union, and that henceforth the rights and interests of these three countries in various parts of China would be protected by the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the Soviet note, immediately issued a document to courts at all levels to take note and act accordingly.

Petition to the Court for Seizure

Recently, the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo sent Mr. Beterkevich, who is in charge of consular affairs, to Shanghai to take over the affairs of the consulates of the three countries. He contacted the Estonian Consulate, obtained the necessary information, and, according to Chinese legal procedures and Article 132 of the Criminal Procedure Law, petitioned the First Special District Court to seize the Estonian Consulate.  After receiving the petition, the court ruled that since the Soviet representative had filed the petition according to legal procedures, and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already issued a document to courts at all levels with a record, the seizure was approved.

Bowen Expresses Inability to Interfere

According to Major Bowen, Chief of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to reporters yesterday, the confiscation of the aforementioned files was not carried out by the police but by judicial police employed by the Chinese court. These personnel are not under the command of the Police Department. Mr. Miller is apparently unaware of this situation. However, Mr. Miller stated that the Estonian Consulate remains a member of the Consular Corps in this area and that he will lodge a protest with the relevant authorities, including the Chinese government, the Consular Corps, and the Shanghai Municipal Council. He stated that this case should definitely not be considered closed but is only just beginning.

Estonian Secretary Declares Position

According to the "Continental Daily News", Estonian Consulate Secretary Miller stated that the Estonian Consulate exists globally, and this is the first time it has been searched. Consulate documents have diplomatic immunity from search, and no one may seize them, not even the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. The honorary Estonian Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Lunbao, upon learning that his country had been incorporated into the Soviet Union, became ill with worry and is still in the hospital.  Consular affairs here were once handled by Mr. Romes, the Estonian Consul in Harbin. Mr. Romes made a special trip from Harbin to Shanghai to ensure that the Estonian Consulate in this city did not lose its independent status, and has now returned to Harbin.

### Ship Bookings Increase Unabated, American Women and Children Plan to Return Home, Registration Exceeds 3,800, American School in Shanghai Decides to Close Immediately

According to shipping industry sources, the four giant passenger ships ordered to the Far East to transport American citizens home have a combined capacity of 3,700 people.  At the same time, applications from American women and children in the Far East to the American President Lines in Shanghai for booking cabins are coming in a continuous stream, increasing unabated. As of yesterday, 3,800 applications have been received. According to senior officials of the American President Lines, special berths can be added if necessary, but no decision has been made at this time.

Adding Berths, No Orders Received

According to news from New York, the "Washington" passenger ship has already installed 500 additional berths. It is generally believed that if the current stream of applicants, 200-300 per day, continues unabated, all passenger ships coming to the Far East to evacuate American citizens will have to install additional berths. However, shipping industry authorities insist that such emergency measures are not yet necessary. Although it is expected that more than 1,000 additional applications will continue to come in before the first American passenger ship for evacuating citizens arrives in Shanghai, instructions for installing additional berths have not yet been received.

American Groups Discuss Reducing Fees

The US Consulate General has received over 4,000 replies from American citizens. There are no new developments beyond this. Acting Consul General Burdett said that the American President Lines is handling all transportation matters for the evacuation of American citizens. The results of the meetings held by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and the American Community Association have not been announced. It is expected that the discussion will focus on reducing travel costs.

American School Decides to Close

The "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" states that the Shanghai American School Board of Directors held an annual meeting yesterday (the 18th) and passed a resolution supporting the US government's policy of evacuating American citizens from the Far East. The resolution includes the following: "The Board of Directors supports the government's policy and will apply it to all teachers. The Board of Directors is unable to specify a definite date for closing the school but will issue a closing announcement depending on developments in the situation." It is reported that the Board of Directors wishes to fully cooperate with the government's policy of evacuating citizens and is taking this step because it anticipates that a large number of American children will leave Shanghai after the four American passenger ships specially sent here to transport American citizens home arrive in Shanghai.

American Citizens in Beiping to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

It is also learned that 358 American citizens in Beiping have decided to evacuate, mostly women and children. The first group of 100 has already left Beiping and is expected to arrive here within days, where they will wait for ships to return home. The most important American commercial businesses in Beiping include Citibank and the American Express Bank. Social and cultural institutions include the Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua University. Although American women and children will be evacuated, American men are unwilling to leave unless the situation becomes extremely serious. Therefore, there is no news of these businesses shutting down.

First Ship to Arrive Soon

The P&O passenger ship "Mundra" is expected to arrive in Shanghai within ten days. The other three ships will arrive every ten days thereafter. Normally, the "Mundra" and "Mariposa" passenger ships have 693 passenger berths each, while the "Washington" and "Manhattan" passenger ships have 1,081 each.

"Washington" Set Sail Yesterday

According to sources in the American shipping industry yesterday, the US has decided to send four giant passenger ships to evacuate American citizens from the Far East. The "Washington" set sail from New York yesterday and will sail west to the Far East via the Panama Canal. The other three ships will set sail when the "Washington" is halfway to China. It is reported that all four ships will also call at US territories such as the Philippines on their way to the Far East, as there are some goods and supplies to be delivered to the US troops stationed in those areas.

### Panchen Lama Bronze Statue Consecration Ceremony

The consecration of the bronze statue of the Panchen Lama was held yesterday morning, attended by Feng Yangshan, Lu Deshen, Gong Zhenqu, and others from the Bodhi Society. The halls and steps were filled with attendees. For days, people of all ages and from all walks of life, no fewer than three to four thousand, came to pay their respects. Thousands of lamps have been lit for twenty days, and offerings continue to be made endlessly. It may be possible to extend the lamp offering period. As a result, hundreds of people registered yesterday to dedicate merits to the deceased and extend their lives. The number of registrations in the coming days will certainly increase even more. When the consecration ceremony was held, Rongzeng Lama chanted scriptures and performed rituals. After offering khatas, conch shells and dharma drums, cymbals and gongs sounded simultaneously, thousands of lamps shone brightly, and incense smoke wafted, creating an extremely solemn atmosphere. The attendees were deeply moved.

### Public Works Bureau Shares Manipulated by Foreigners

Most of the foreign shares of the Public Works Bureau are industrial shares held by British and American individuals, with British merchants accounting for nine-tenths of them. The face value of these shares is very low, such as Jardine Matheson, which is only ten taels per share. However, due to the stable influence of British and American individuals in Shanghai, the value has been consistently inflated ten thousand times. Recently, the situation in Shanghai has become increasingly tense, and the future of foreign business is highly concerning. According to convention, foreign shares should not be able to maintain their original value. However, the opposite has been happening. In the past week, the value of foreign shares has been trending upwards instead of downwards. According to those familiar with market conditions, the reason for this is that foreigners are manipulating the market. They acquired many cheap shares in June and July and now, seeing the situation in Shanghai, they want to sell them. They are using the old trick of enticing before capturing, releasing them at high prices and transferring them to the Chinese.

### Empress of Asia Ship Arriving from Canada

The Changxing Company's "Empress of Asia" passenger ship, which departed from Canada to the Far East, has passed Japan and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 21st) at 5:00 PM, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to a small ferry, departing at 5:30 PM to the Xinguang Wharf to disembark. The passenger ship will not be delayed much in Shanghai and is scheduled to set sail at dawn the day after tomorrow (the 22nd) for Hong Kong and Luzon. The small ferry that will pick up passengers is scheduled to depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 9:00 PM tomorrow evening.

### Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Proposes Elasticity in Evaluation, Legal Profit Not to Exceed 10%, Allowing Flexibility in Setting Prices

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions, stating: "Greetings, Upon receiving your letter, stating that the price of foreign rice in Shanghai should be based on cost plus reasonable profit, and that an appropriate price should be determined in conjunction with domestic rice, etc., a meeting was convened on the 15th of this month, after

Careful Deliberation

The conclusion was that in the past month, the highest price for No. 2 Saigon foreign rice has been 79.6 yuan per bag, and the lowest has been 75.8 yuan per bag. A rough estimate, adding in quantity losses and other miscellaneous expenses, amounts to 66 yuan per 160 shijin, which is similar to the recent selling price in Shanghai. However, this figure only covers costs and does not include a reasonable profit. If strictly limited after evaluation, it would hinder continued ordering and disrupt the supply, easily leading to adverse consequences. It is proposed to allow a reasonable profit of 5% or, at most, not exceeding 10% (for example, the highest fixed price for No. 2 Saigon rice ordered at the beginning of this month was slightly below 80 yuan per bag, but the rice has not yet been fully shipped, and the subsequent fixed price has gradually decreased, currently being less than 75.8 yuan per bag. On the 17th of this month, it was 73.6 yuan. In this situation, even if the goods ordered earlier meet the aforementioned profit, it would still be difficult to guarantee the capital. Hoping for continued ordering and increased reserves would be like heading south to go north. Therefore, evaluation must be based on the price at that time, and restrictions should be imposed on price increases. In the future, evaluation will be based on cost as the standard, with reasonable profit as the margin of flexibility. Once the evaluation is announced, all market transactions must comply, but when market prices rise or fall, it should be

Left to Nature

Without restrictions. If prices rise, they can only be changed within the limit of reasonable profit; otherwise, severe sanctions will be imposed. This is the opinion of our committee on the method of changing the evaluation of foreign rice. As for the evaluation of domestic rice, the situation is indeed difficult. Currently, the source is scarce, and transportation by boat and vehicle has long disappeared, relying only on sporadic transportation by bicycle. Production costs and freight rates are erratic, and the hardships and difficulties of transportation are hard to describe. It is insufficient to serve as an evaluation standard, and domestic rice transactions have long disappeared from the market. If the selling price in Shanghai is evaluated, those who seek profit will inevitably stop, leading to obstruction of the source and loss of evaluation credibility. Therefore, under the current circumstances, it seems appropriate to postpone the evaluation temporarily. This is the opinion of our committee on the temporary postponement of the evaluation of domestic rice." It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will hold a meeting next Wednesday, and the French Municipal Council will hold a meeting next Monday. After approval, they will respond.

### Stabbed Japanese Military Police Officer Dies of Severe Wounds

Sato Seiichi, Squad Leader of the Japanese Military Police Division in Western Shanghai, who was stabbed near Qianjia Lane in Western Shanghai at 1:40 PM the day before yesterday, was rushed to the hospital by the Japanese side but died of severe wounds at 1:30 PM. The Japanese side is paying close attention to the case. Yesterday morning, they piled up barbed wire at the bridges on the roads near the scene of the incident and at the areas outside the concession where roads have been built, such as Connaught Road, Jessfield Road, and Yanping Road, and strictly checked pedestrians and vehicles.

### American Citizen Meyer Surrenders at Court, Posts US$1,000 Bail, Trial to Begin Next Monday

The "North-China Daily News" reported that American citizen Meyer, due to crimes of fraud, was recently wanted by the United States Court for China. It was later learned that Meyer had returned the defrauded funds to the original owner. However, since the case is of a criminal nature, the warrant could not be withdrawn even though the defrauded funds had been returned. Until yesterday (the 18th), Meyer, accompanied by lawyer Franklin, surrendered to the US court and posted bail of US$1,000 to guarantee that he would appear in court for the initial hearing on Monday morning.

Dangerous winds and clouds, great disasters lie ahead, fellow smokers, danger is at hand.

### Advice to Those Who Hate Opium - All Should Think While Lying Down, Speak While Sitting, Act While Standing

In these turbulent times, with crises pressing and life difficult, land prices exorbitant, and thorns everywhere, smokers can no longer afford to be self-indulgent. Thinking of the present hardships and future dangers, they should quit as soon as possible, restore their health, reduce their expenses, and gradually improve with the times, adapt to reality, and seek a better future. If they continue to hesitate and do not quit their addiction, it will be difficult to survive. Those who aspire to quit smoking but desire to do so without any pain and achieve satisfactory results should go to the Gongjian Hospital and be treated by Dr. Lai Gongliang, who will surely help them eliminate pain and regain freedom. The advantages of Dr. Lai's treatment are that it does not involve injections but relies entirely on more than ten years of rich experience to suit each individual's constitution and prescribe medication that will help them break their addiction unconsciously. With Dr. Lai's treatment, appetite increases, bowel movements become regular, sleep is restful, and spirits are high. There is no relapse after quitting. To gain the trust of those seeking treatment, Dr. Lai can first prescribe medication for a trial run. If they are satisfied, they can then proceed with formal treatment. Therefore, Dr. Lai Gongliang of Gongjian Hospital is the shore that smokers cannot miss. (Gongjian Hospital Address: 208 Baker Road, British Concession, Telephone 95111)

### French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Reaches Resolution, Official Negotiations Yesterday Largely Settled, But Agreement Not Signed Due to Disputes

The French business water and electricity company's worker strike has been holding informal negotiations for days, and the opinions of both parties are quite close. Both labor and management believe that maintaining this deadlock will result in heavy losses for both sides, and the French Concession Political Affairs Department also believes that failing to resolve this worker strike is not beneficial to society. For the sake of resolving it once and for all, official negotiations were held at the company yesterday (previous resolutions were all indirect negotiations). As a result, the matter was not resolved satisfactorily due to the impasse over the reinstatement of dismissed workers and must await further discussion. A reporter from Pingming News visited the company yesterday to learn about the negotiation details on the left.

Two Meetings

The negotiations consisted of two meetings, the first from 10:40 AM to 2:00 PM, where half of the terms were agreed upon. The second negotiation was from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. Each issue was discussed for a long time, with intense disputes. In the end, there was no result due to the company's insistence on reinstating 26 of the dismissed workers and the labor side's insistence on reinstating all 46 workers. Further negotiations are needed. Those who participated in the negotiations yesterday included the company director Favre, Deputy Director Le Doulouret, Chinese comprador Tu, a representative from the Political Affairs Department, and labor representatives Zhang Fubao and eight others.

Negotiation Results

The terms previously proposed by the labor side have been narrowed down through repeated negotiations to seven items: (1) Increase wages by 7 yuan per person; (2) Reinstate the 46 workers dismissed for misconduct; (3) Workers arrested for causing trouble during the strike period (37 people) and workers in the Chen Guohua case of ambushing Inspector No. 5 (28 people) will be released on bail by the company; (4) Pay wages for the strike period; (5) Workers who resign and have worked for three years or more will have their retirement benefits calculated at one month per year; (6) Recognize the merger with the Mechanical Affairs Department to form a new organization and provide monthly funding of 300 yuan; (7) Compensation and funeral expenses for the worker Zhang Yongkang who was ambushed and killed. After the negotiations, the company replied as follows: (1) Increase subsidies by 6 yuan per person; (2) Of the workers dismissed for misconduct, 26 will be reinstated; (3) The 37 workers arrested for causing trouble during the strike period can be released on bail by the company. However, two of them, due to more serious circumstances, still need to be interrogated by the police. The workers in the Chen Guohua ambush case have been transferred to the court and have not yet been tried; (4) Wages can be paid for the strike period; (5) Workers with three years or more of service will have their retirement benefits calculated at three months. Those suspended for misconduct are still under investigation; (6) The new organization is still under discussion; (7) The company has already provided compensation for Zhang Yongkang. With the exception of the second item, the above items are largely resolved. In the afternoon negotiations, both parties focused on the reinstatement of dismissed workers, with the company insisting on 26 and the labor side insisting on full reinstatement. After holding on until 6:30 PM, no resolution was reached, and the talks were suspended, with continued negotiations to be scheduled at a later date.

No Cars Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon, the company side, believing that the negotiations were progressing smoothly, had already prepared to resume vehicle service. The garage was also opened, and the vehicles were inspected in order to operate at any time. A repair tram was also sent to inspect the power lines for any damage, in order to avoid temporary problems.

### Million-Yuan Copper Block Theft, Whittle Escapes Net, Swiss Consul General Protests, Objects to Japanese Refusal to Cooperate in Arrest, Japanese Lawyer Demands Dismissal of Case, Police Chief Claims Matter is Extremely Abnormal

The "Continental Daily News" reports that Swiss national Whittle, the main culprit in the theft of copper blocks worth one million yuan from the Ruifeng Transportation Company warehouse, claimed last night (the 18th) that the Japanese Military Police Department had commissioned a certain Japanese lawyer to send a letter to Superintendent Peng, who is responsible for handling the case, "warning" the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to drop the theft case and release the German accomplice, Pengte, who has been arrested. The letter is currently at Police Headquarters, being translated by a Japanese police officer. According to Major Bowen, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, he has not heard that the Japanese side has made such a request. If so, he would have known immediately. If the Japanese army sent a letter to the Police Department through a lawyer, the matter is extremely abnormal because previously the letters were sent to him by senior Japanese military officers. The report that a Japanese lawyer's representative sent a letter to the Police Department, if it were true, would not have been sent through official channels and would not be regarded as a formal negotiation by the Japanese army. In addition, Whittle's lawyer, Downey, visited Swiss Consul General Fantana yesterday to request the Swiss Consul to withdraw the order for Whittle's arrest but was refused. According to Fantana, he lodged two protests with Japanese Consul General Horiuchi, objecting to the Japanese refusal to cooperate in arresting Whittle. The "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" also reported that Whittle recently stated that the matter is now being handled entirely by the Japanese authorities and that he is scheduled to leave Shanghai this afternoon (the 19th) for a holiday in the countryside.

### Seeing Schools as Commercial Tools: School Board and Principal Involved in Lawsuit; One Sues for Invalid Transfer Certificates, One Alleges False Accounting and Demands Restitution

Tong Kangling (50 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 21, Garden Lane, Rue du PÃ¨re Huc), Zhang Shiyuan (28 years old, from Wuxian, residing at No. 1, Lane 40, Route Krelong), and Feng Qingnian (35 years old, from Cixi, residing at No. 19, Rue Say Zoong) recently engaged lawyer Li Tongjun to represent them in filing a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Sa Benju (residing at No. 23, Lane 300, Route Ghisi, formerly Principal of Peicai Vocational Middle School at No. 613, Intersection of Route Amiral Courbet and Avenue Doumer), seeking confirmation of the invalidity of transfer certificates.

The statement of claim roughly states:

The defendant is the founder and principal of the private Peicai Joint Enterprise School and Middle School, while the plaintiff Tong Kangling was hired by the defendant as a school board member, Zhang Shiyuan was hired as the head of teaching affairs and a teacher, and Feng Qingnian was a teacher of Chinese. The school's organization established a teaching affairs office to oversee all school matters. The academic performance of students was determined by teachers based on daily assessments and quiz scores, which were reported to the teaching affairs office to calculate the total average score for the semester or academic year to determine whether they passed or failed, and then reported to the principal for the issuance of report cards or certificates. However, the defendant, before the end of this year's spring semester and before the teachers had evaluated the scores, closed the school. Regardless of the students' academic performance, or whether they had taken the exams or not, he issued transfer certificates indicating passing grades to all. After the defendant issued the transfer certificates, the teachers were outraged by his illegal and reckless behavior and convened on July 1 to issue a statement of denial. Some students who presented these certificates to other schools for transfer were rejected. Tong Kangling, after being hired as a school board member, had no way to oversee school affairs because the school board had not yet convened. Therefore, he was initially unaware of the matter. Now, because the educational community widely

regards this as a laughingstock, he investigated and confirmed the facts. As a school board member, he has to correct this effectively according to the law. According to the legitimate statistics of the teaching affairs office, there were a total of thirty-seven students in the entire office, none of whom had taken major exams. Therefore, they request confirmation that the transfer certificates issued by the defendant Sa Benju to the thirty-seven students from June 27 to July 29 are invalid and that he bear the costs of publishing a notice in the newspaper, as well as the litigation costs. At the same time, Sa Benju also engaged lawyer Zhou Yongquan to represent him in filing a lawsuit in the same court against Zhang Shiyuan personally, seeking

repayment of debt. The main points of his lawsuit are roughly as follows: Previously, the defendant Zhang Shiyuan, being confined to his home and having nothing to do, requested that the plaintiff invest in establishing a school. The plaintiff then raised funds and handed them over to the defendant for preparation. In February of this year, the Peicai Vocational School and Middle School was established. Unexpectedly, after the school was established, the defendant, holding the position of head of teaching affairs, seized power, used private personnel, and falsely reported accounts, treating the school as a commercial tool. In the opening expenses, he falsely reported 925.84 yuan in national currency. In the recurring expenses, he falsely reported 132.15 yuan under fictitious items. In the cooperative, he falsely reported 22.84 yuan, totaling 1080.83 yuan in national currency. The defendant has

no receipts or invoices to present for these expenses, so the court should order the defendant to return them and bear the litigation costs. The court accepted the case, and yesterday morning, presiding Judge Yu of Civil Court 7 of the Second Special Court jointly heard the case. The lawyers for both sides argued fiercely, each adhering to their own position. They were particularly unyielding on the point of treating the school as a commercial tool. The court, after reviewing the statements, noted that both parties were intellectuals serving in the education sector and that it was a great loss to the true meaning of education for them to be involved in a lawsuit over school matters. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled the judgment for 9:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. However, if the two parties can reach a settlement before the judgment, the judgment can be revoked.

### Egg Shop Owner and Manager Involved in Equity Lawsuit; Both Sides Stick to Their Own Stories; Court Orders Investigation and Review

Yang Ruitang, owner of Yang Rui Ji Egg Shop at No. 696, Rue du Nouveau MarchÃ©, recently commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Song Hongsheng (residing at No. 3, Lane Yinyu, Eight Immortals Bridge), manager of the shop, seeking confirmation that the 7,500 yuan in shares of the Zhonghe Company are owned by Yang Rui Ji Egg Shop and ordering Song Hongsheng to

return the stock certificate. The case was heard the other day by Judge Li Liang of Civil Court 7. The plaintiff Yang Ruitang's lawyer, Li Wenjie, stated that Yang Rui Ji Egg Shop was originally jointly operated by the plaintiff and Shao Jiurong, owner of He Xing Hao. In February of this year, the egg shop invested 7,500 yuan in the Zhonghe Company to operate the Heji Company, which sells eggs. Manager Song Hongsheng was appointed to represent the egg shop and concurrently served as the deputy manager of the company. Several months ago, Song suddenly took the Zhonghe stock certificate and refused to return it to the plaintiff and did not report the business situation of Zhonghe Company as usual, intending to make the shares

his own.

The letter sent by the commissioned lawyer to demand its return was ineffective, and after repeated attempts, the lawsuit was filed. Subsequently, check stubs, account books, contracts, and other evidence were presented to the court, requesting a judgment according to law. The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Danping, then argued that the stock certificate was purchased by the defendant for 9,000 yuan, part of which was paid by transfer and part of which has not yet been paid. The court, after reviewing the statements, determined that the defendant has the burden of proof regarding the purchase of the stock certificate. The case still needs to be investigated and was adjourned for further questioning.

### Gunshot Suddenly Heard in Hotel Room

At 3:50 PM the day before yesterday, a gunshot was suddenly heard in room 425 of the Yangtze Hotel at No. 287, Rue du Yunnan. The hotel immediately telegraphed the Old Zha Gate Police Station, which immediately ordered Chinese detectives Wang Yingjie and He Renrui to investigate. However, there was no one in the room, and no one was injured. It was found that the room was opened by Peng Chi, a Cantonese man who operates a gambling den in Nanshi. Usually, about ten people stay in the room every night. While the detectives were investigating, Li Yongtang, He Qi, Su Zhiqing, and other Cantonese men suddenly came forward and were detained. According to their statements, they knew nothing about the shooting incident and came to look for Peng Chi for employment opportunities. Later, Chen Liu, a Cantonese man, came and was also detained. His statement was roughly the same. The police personnel believed that the facts of the shooting had not yet been clarified and that Li and others were not without suspicion. Therefore, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested detention for investigation. Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

Mr. Xia Songbao of our newspaper, residing at No. 97, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road, his young son Ke Kun, born just nine months ago and still in swaddling clothes, recently suffered a sudden blockage of the lower genitals, making it impossible to urinate and causing swelling and pain in the lower part of his body. He cried incessantly. Many doctors were consulted for treatment, but all felt it was difficult. Later, on the recommendation of a neighbor, he went to the Pingji Hospital branch at the northern end of Old Rubbish Bridge, where the hospital's president, Chen Rongzhang, personally examined him and determined that there was a hard object blocking the urethra. He performed surgery, cutting open the glans and extracting a stone the size of a soybean. The child quickly recovered and was healthy again. Mr. Xia, deeply grateful, admired the excellence of Doctor Chen Rongzhang's medical skills and specially recorded this to inform the public.

### Charity Basketball Challenge Tournament Successfully Concluded Last Night; Paramount A and B Teams Both Defeat Shanghai Youth and Giants; Mr. Zhou Lanpu and Mr. Lan Yuan Buy Ball at Paramount's High Price

The Charity Basketball Challenge Tournament organized by the Orphanage for the Relief of Refugee Children, a grand event, concluded successfully last night after a total of six games. In the final battle last night, Paramount played Shanghai Youth. Shanghai Youth, due to team members being sick or scattered, reluctantly formed a team for charity. As a result, Paramount won by a large margin of 61 to 37. The score at halftime was 27 to 13. Before the main battle, there was a Sino-Western game between the Western Youth Giants team and the Paramount B team. As a result, Paramount also won, 24 to 10. The score at halftime was 13 to 8. The final women's performance was not held due to the late hour. The sensational charity game was declared closed.

Auction of Game Ball Worth 1,400

Although ticket prices were raised to ten yuan and five yuan last night, the stadium was still full last night, and the enthusiasm of the audience was commendable. During the break in the Shanghai Youth Paramount game, Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Orphanage for the Relief of Refugee Children, presided over the auction of the game ball. First, the ball from last night's game was auctioned off. As a result, the Paramount Sports Association bought it for 1,400 yuan, setting a record for the highest auction price of a game ball ever. After the Paramount Sports Association won the bid, they returned the ball to Mr. Yuan for a second auction in order to obtain more donations. Then, Mr. Pu Xianyuan spent 100 yuan to buy it. Then, the ball from the Paramount vs. Qunyi game was auctioned off, and Mr. Zhou Xian bought it for 500 yuan. The enthusiastic care of all parties for the Orphanage for the Relief of Refugee Children is deeply admirable. The success of this challenge tournament is beyond initial expectations, and the support of all parties is also unexpected.

Paramount A and B Teams Both Win

Paramount B first played the Giants, and the situation seemed very tense at first. Neither team scored for a long time. However, the Giants committed numerous fouls, and Paramount took the lead. The Giants adopted a slow offensive method, step by step, using a smoke screen offense. Paramount fought back with a breakthrough method to win. At halftime, Paramount B took the lead with 13 to 8 and finally won 24 to 20.

### Western League First Division Game Yesterday: Donghua Defeats French Business School 2-1; First Half 0-0, No Score; Xu Wenkui's Guest Performance is Excellent

In the second week of the Western League First Division football competition, Donghua played French Business School at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM yesterday. Jia Youliang, the right winger of Donghua, recovered from illness and played. Xu Wenkui, after coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong, in addition to playing for the Paramount charity basketball game, made a guest appearance with Donghua yesterday, winning a lot of applause. In yesterday's game, both the offense and defense of the French Business School were good. The two sides were evenly matched. The first half was 0-0, with no gains. Changing sides to fight again, Donghua finally defeated the French Business School 2-1, creating a record of one win and two wins. Four thousand fans were delighted. Today there are five games, including the First Division Portugal vs. West Patrol Team, and the Second Division Reserve Team, all of which belong to the Western world. The battle situation yesterday was as follows:

Donghua Association

Qin Bigao

Wu Qixiang Zhuang Youren

Liang Shutang Cai Shengsen Han Longhai

Fei Chunhua Huang Kehou Dai Linjing Xu Wenkui Jia Youliang

French Business School Association

Huerfei

Jiemuhuate Kelaituoke

Beier Pan Kuilai Xuegelun

Simisi Bao Xiutuo Laobotesituofu Maikefulun Saibeisi

No Score

When the time arrived, the two sides lined up to wait. Xu Wenkui arrived one minute before the game. The French Business School kicked off and launched an offensive. Laobotesituofu dribbled straight in and was easily saved by Qin Bigao. Donghua counterattacked, Han Longhai passed the ball forward, Jia Youliang dribbled to the right spot, passed to Xu Wenkui, and Xu raised his foot. It hit Pan Kuilai and bounced out as a corner kick. Jia opened it very well, but unfortunately Xu's header missed. Soon, Huang Kehou got a chance to shoot, but was saved by Huerfei diving to the ground. At this time, Donghua Dai was the center forward, and Jia Youliang had many scoring opportunities, but because he was too eager, he missed by a hair, which was a pity. Simisi of French Business School advanced from the periphery, passing the ball three times and five times. The ball reached the Donghua front, and Bao Xiutuo headed it out of bounds. Before long, Simisi made a comeback, but without success. Before the end of the first half, Donghua had a very good opportunity, but Jia was a step late and missed it. The fans sighed together. Soon the first half ended, and neither side gained anything.

Final Victory

After the break, Donghua was very active, and the front of the French Business School's goal was in danger. Liang Shutang got the ball and crossed it. Kelaituoke and Pan Kuilai fought each other, and A Dai took the opportunity to kick the ball into the corner of the net. Cheers resounded. Before long, Xu Wenkui of Donghua dribbled forward and passed to the right wing. Jia hooked it with one foot, and Huang Kehou was waiting right there and headed it into the enemy's goal. Donghua suddenly took the lead with two to zero. The French Business School lost two cities in a row and ordered the three armies to take orders. Simisi went alone, and Zhuang Youren failed to stop him. Simisi shot angrily from twenty yards away with a lightning-fast foot, and Qin did not have time to defend, so the French Business School pulled back a goal. This ball was only half a minute away from Donghua's second goal. After that, both sides had scoring opportunities, but without success. Donghua finally defeated the French Business School one to one.

The subsidy fee has now been remitted to the Party Headquarters of each county for forwarding to the Party Headquarters of each district, and the county governments have been ordered to assist in the implementation.

In addition, the Department of Education has formulated an implementation plan for the supplementary education of out-of-school people in 1940 and ordered all counties to comply with it. It has specially reprinted textbooks for mass schools issued by the Ministry of Education as much as possible for distribution to various mass schools for application. It is now found that the textbooks have been printed, and a table of the number of textbooks to be distributed has been drawn up. Volumes 1 and 2 and Volumes 3 and 4 of the textbooks for advanced mass schools and Volumes 1 and 2 of the textbooks for Class B mass schools will be issued to the county and city bureaus with the order, requiring immediate inspection and receipt of the seal, and compliance with the number of mass schools that should be run in each county as stipulated in the implementation plan for the supplementary education of out-of-school people, and distribution and forwarding in a timely manner.

Shuguang Troupe Organizes Loans for Impoverished Teachers; One-Week Memorial Meeting to Open Today

The Shuguang Troupe, an organization of primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai, is celebrating its first anniversary. A one-week memorial meeting will be held at the YWCA at 2:00 PM today (20th). Celebrities will be invited to give speeches and perform plays. In view of the high cost of living in the isolated island, the impoverished teachers feel particularly difficult. Therefore, after discussion, it was initiated to organize loans for impoverished teachers. Funds have been raised, and measures have been drafted. Application forms are available for collection. The simple regulations for borrowing are recorded as follows:

Simple Regulations for Loans for Impoverished Teachers 1. Any incumbent teacher, whether a member of the troupe or not, who is from a poor family, leads a difficult life, and encounters urgent needs may apply to the troupe for a loan. 2. If the teacher requesting a loan is not a member, he should ask a member of the troupe to introduce him, fill out an application form and submit it to the troupe. After investigation and verification, he can come to the troupe to collect the loan. However, in order to ensure the safety of the fund and facilitate the later teachers, the borrower may be asked to find a guarantor. 3. If the borrower is unable to repay, the guarantor shall be fully responsible for the repayment on his behalf. 4. The maximum loan amount is temporarily set at 50 yuan. 5. The repayment period is divided into one-time repayment and installment repayment (the period is set separately), but it must not exceed the end of the semester at the latest. 6. No interest will be charged on this loan. 7. These measures may be added or deleted at any time if they are not perfect.

### The Area on the Right Shows the Inspection of the Situation by the King and Queen of England

### Wartime Life of the British King and Queen

Since the outbreak of the European war, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England have been busier than anyone else, needing to visit various places, making them ten times busier than usual. In the past, they had very little time for private rest each day, but now it has been reduced to almost nothing. If they have the opportunity to escape London on a Saturday and meet their two daughters, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Rose, in the countryside, they feel extremely happy.

Their wartime daily life is truly not easyâ€”it requires not only a lively and adaptable spirit but also a fearlessness of trivial matters and a great deal of patience. The King and Queen are not merely figureheads, but must serve as the sole example for the people of all of Britain and its dominions. When they visit various places, they must not show the slightest sign of discouragement. Since the beginning of the war, their footsteps have covered all parts of the British Isles.

The work of the King and Queen is to put on smiles for the people and appear joyfulâ€”regardless of their inner feelings, they must do so. They have to shake hands with countless people, say countless kind words, inspect countless factories, hospitals, transport ships, bombed houses, and men, women, and children. One or both of them must attend or visit and guide public gatherings almost every day. When they are touring the "Midlands" of England, they spend their nights on trains, traveling from city to city during the day, inspecting factories, talking to workers, or casually saying a few words to the crowds gathered along the way.

The court life of the King and Queen has recently become much lonelier due to their frequent visits to various places and the absence of their two daughters from London. A few months ago, they had people bring the princesses to London for a brief reunion, which the residents of London strongly disapproved of, believing that while the government was using various methods to discourage evacuated children from returning, the King and Queen bringing the princesses back was a misguided move.

All aspects of the palace's operations have been greatly reduced due to the war's impact. The King and Queen's daily necessities and food are also restricted, just like the common people. According to reliable reports, the Queen has implemented frugality, adhering to the principle of not exceeding the state's regulations, and everyone greatly admires her spirit of thrift. The Queen has especially reduced her own and household expenses, simplifying meals and rarely featuring delicacies on the menu. When birthdays occur within the royal family, only a few relatives offer congratulations, and gifts are donated to wartime charitable funds.

In terms of appearance, the Queen still insists on wearing pleasing clothes, so that in the same venue, she is never seen wearing the same outfit. However, her purchases of new clothes are ultimately much fewer due to spending limits. There is also a small matter that shows Queen Elizabeth's thorough practice of thrift. She has a gas mask with a case made of plain thick velvet. Someone suggested making several cases of different colors to match her outfits. At the beginning of the war, British noblewomen flocked to imitate this approach. However, the Queen believed this was an unnecessary waste and refused to accept it.

German aircraft raids on Britain every night have become almost a routine occurrence. The King and Queen do not sleep soundly and often get up late at night to take refuge in air-raid shelters, similar to what the citizens of London experience. Warm overcoats and gas masks are placed at the foot of the bed every night, and as soon as there is an alarm, they go downstairs within minutes and enter the basement, following the instructions of the palace's air-raid wardens.

Once inside the air-raid shelter, the King and Queen find ways to entertain themselves. The King reads books and newspapers, while the Queen knits. Or they sit and doze in the armchairs prepared in the basement. In this air-raid shelter, there is a radio, several boxes of biscuits and sweets, and an electric stove for heating drinks. It is also equipped with a telephone, so they can always communicate with the outside world.

### New York Rooftops: Country Life

New York City is densely populated, with summer houses everywhere, a complete big-city model. For those who live in New York and want a small piece of land, a ten-acre garden, as a place for pleasure and relaxation, it is truly not easy. Fortunately, their rooftops are arranged in a decent manner. High above the rooftops, all is empty, the hustle and bustle of the downtown area is thrown to the back of one's mind, and it is replaced by sunbathing, deep breathing, or planting flowers and raising birds. The back is baked warm by the sun, the hands are sore from labor, but the heart gains unparalleled comfort and happiness. The flat roof offers even more space. You can hold pigeon races, invite friends to garden parties, run kindergartens, play handball, tennis; as for dancing under the moonlight, parking cars on the roof, and watching baseball games from afar, and roof camping, these are even more novel and delightful.

The trend of rooftops becoming places for recreation and leisure has been making significant progress in New York year by year. As for its origins, it has been around for a long time. Forty years ago, those who watched over houses on Wall Street often complained about small rooms and crowds of people, so they simply took their families up to the rooftops and built small shelters there to avoid wind and rain, becoming rooftop hermits. After living there for a while, they found that the children were all lively and jumping, full of energy, and fat and lovely. The landlords who watched over houses knew that rooftop living was hygienic, so they built more refined small shelters on the rooftops, or opened them as flat areas, planted flowers and trees, as places for rest and entertainment.

According to a survey by the municipal authorities, the middle class in New York now uses rooftops the most. Their main purpose is to use them for sunbathing. New York has a maximum of 4,467 hours of sunshine per year, while the average person gets only 2,693 hours. This number is based on statistics compiled by the New York Meteorological Bureau over the past forty-three years. Therefore, New York City's sunshine averages only 60 percent. Several large hotels and apartments in New York have sunbathing areas or rooftop gardens.

Rooftop flower gardens or farms are also a unique sight in New York's residential areas. On the rooftops, you can often see green waves undulating and tree branches intertwined, which is refreshing and pleasing to the eye. From small potted bonsai cypress to large weeping willows, they can all be found in rooftop gardens. Those who enjoy rooftops in New York are not limited to adult men and women, that includes elementary schools and kindergartens. They are also converting rooftops into amusement parks. There are seesaws, building blocks, and boys and girls all playing in the sun. There are now at least a hundred rooftops used as playgrounds for students. There is a rooftop kindergarten on the Hamilton Building on Market Street. It is surrounded by steel wire, and children around four to five years old are making all kinds of fun inside. Once the sun sets and school is over, this rooftop playground is converted into a dance practice area for adults.

Children even camp on the roof of the Madison Children's Club Building in Manhattan. Children who are unable to go to the countryside, or do not like to go out, can practice outdoor living here. Inside, it is arranged as a green lawn, a small pond. At night, they light fires and play by the pond, tell stories, cook breakfast, and have great fun.

Fifteen percent of the city's buildings have registered with the municipal authorities to prepare to use the rooftops. Therefore, the use of rooftops will be more extensive in the future, and the citizens of New York have regarded it as a fitness place.

### Talking About Responsibility

â€” Yong

Who is without responsibility? Responsibilities vary in importance, but there is no such thing as being without responsibility. Children have children's responsibilities, young people have young people's responsibilities, and adults have adults' responsibilities; students have responsibilities during their student years, and after entering society, they have responsibilities after entering society. Not taking responsibility is, in a small sense, despising oneself, and in a large sense, betraying the country and the nation.

Little friends go to school every morning and return home in the afternoon; they don't worry about clothing or food, so in your minds, you probably don't think of the word "responsibility," right? If you hold this view, then your future achievements will definitely be very limited.

Princess Elizabeth of England recently made her first broadcast to British children overseas, and in her short speech, there were these two sentences: "When peace is achieved in the future, today's children have the responsibility to improve the world." Ah! The responsibility of children is greater than anyone else's!

Since you understand the importance of your own responsibility, you should prepare everything for your responsibility now. Of course, the most important thing is to enrich your knowledge and exercise your physique.

Don't say that children have no responsibility, and don't be irresponsible children. Finally, the author wishes you all a bright future!

### The Airplane's Autobiography

â€” Chen Jinglong

My name is airplane, and I was born in the United States thirty years ago. My ability is great, I can fly into the clouds and soar in the sky.

I have done a lot of amazing work in China in the past three years. The National Government designated August 14th as Air Force Day and November 21st as Air Defense Day, probably to commemorate our achievements, right?

What I fear most is anti-aircraft guns, because when I am advancing in the air, anti-aircraft guns can shoot me down! However, when I am fighting in the air, I am not afraid of anything. I am willing to sacrifice myself to serve the country and fight against the enemy's anti-aircraft guns, because if I am afraid of it, I am a cowardly person who is afraid of death and has no courage, so I am not willing to retreat, nor am I afraid of threats: I would rather sacrifice for the country!â€”â€”Because this is glorious and great!

### Don't Read Comic Books

â€” He Wei

After night school, comic book stalls can be found on almost every street, and many children, carrying their schoolbags, stand by the stalls, watching with fascination.

Little friends! You must know that the content of this kind of book is very bad, and the impression it gives you is very poor, wasting your precious money and even more precious time on this kind of harmful book is such a pity!

There are so many extracurricular reading materials! On Sundays, you may as well go to the bookstore, where there are reading materials that will increase your knowledge. There are also libraries, where you can go to look at pictures and learn to read. If you can do this, then your learning, knowledge, and thinking can all improve in your spare time.

### Advice

â€” Su Ba

In a very large cupboard, there lived an old mouse and a young mouse, and every day they always had very delicious things to eat.

But the young mouse often secretly ran to the dining room to steal crumbs that people dropped on the floor, and sometimes even climbed onto the table to steal food.

One day, the old mouse was sleeping soundly when the young mouse ran over excitedly, pulling its mother and saying, "Ah, Mom, our dear friend has built us a very good house, just the size of our bodies, with cakes and pastries inside, ah, it's so delicious! ... Originally, I wanted to go in and taste it alone first, but in the end, I thought it would be better to call Mom to eat together, so I ran over immediately, Mom, go, hurry!" ... It was still pulling the old mouse, urging it urgently.

However, the old mouse, without waiting for it to finish speaking, hugged it tightly in its arms and said in a kind and sad tone, "My child! Although this is a very good place, it is also a terrifying trap! If we go in, we will be caught and sentenced to death! Thank goodness you didn't go in, otherwise, heaven! Where else would we be able to see each other!"

"Ah! Child, you must remember that in the future, no matter what you do, you must not blindly follow others, you must ask your elders before you do it! Because there is danger in every corner of this world, so you must use your own eyes and brain to observe and consider everything, otherwise, unexpected disasters will often come upon you!" The young mouse nodded with tears in its eyes, indicating that it understood very well.

Little friends, you should also know that on this terrible isolated island, you should do everything very carefully, don't fall into the magic net of the devil, and sincerely obey your parents and teachers.

### Lazy Li Zi Will Never Get Up Late Again

â€” Pu Jiang

Li Zi was a lazy little girl. Every morning, she was always slow to get up, so she was always a few minutes late to school.

One day, her mother said to Li Zi, "Hurry up and get up!" But she still lay in bed, unwilling to get up.

Seeing her like this, her mother said again, "Li Zi, hurry up and get up! It's time to go to school." But Li Zi was still lying in bed, not getting up.

The bed said, "Hateful girl, if you don't get up immediately, you will still have to go to school later."

So the bed lifted Li Zi out of the bedroom, then ran out of the house and onto the street. The passersby saw this girl and made fun of her.

In an instant, the bed had stopped at the school gate. The door was wide open, so the bed took Li Zi into the classroom and stopped between the teacher and a standing student.

"Good morning, children, good morning!" the bed said. "I brought this lazy Li Zi here to give to you. She is indeed too late, but it is better than not coming to school."

The teacher laughed, and the students also laughed at the fun of this, but poor Li Zi could not make a sound. Blood filled her face, and she began to ponder.

At this time, the bed took her back home.

Now Li Zi is no longer as lazy as before: she gets up very early and arrives at school on time.

### A Story About Mailing a Letter

â€” Yang Chunlu

Little friends! Do you often correspond with your friends? When mailing a letter, don't you have to stick a stamp? Since September 23rd, the post office has increased postage. Ordinary letters require a four-cent stamp for local mail and an eight-cent stamp for out-of-town mail. Postcards require two cents for local mail and four cents for out-of-town mail. Mailing printed matter requires one cent for local mail and two cents for out-of-town mail. Registration costs an additional 13 cents; express mail costs an additional 20 cents; airmail costs an additional 25 cents for airmail fees. Additional fees are also required for exceeding the prescribed weight. If you don't put enough stamps on it and mail it out, it will be returned, or your friend will be penalized.

In the early days of postal service, people generally did not understand how to mail a letter, and there were often many jokes. Some people did not put stamps on it and put the mailing money directly in the mailbox; some people did not write the address clearly and only had the name of the recipient. How do you want the postman to deliver it? Now I will introduce a story about mailing a letter here:

In the past, a master wrote a letter and told his servant to send it to the post office to mail it, and gave him the mailing fee, saying, "Buy stamps with this money, stick them on the envelope, and then put them in the mailbox, don't make a mistake!"

The servant walked to the post office and saw the mailbox hanging outside the door, with no one guarding it. He didn't buy stamps to put on it, and secretly threw the letter into the mailbox.

He returned home and returned the mailing money to his master. The master felt very strange and asked him, "Why didn't you mail my letter?" He said very proudly, "Today is really lucky, there was no one guarding the mailbox, I have secretly put the letter in, and I don't need to put stamps on it."

Smart little friends! When you mail a letter, you must put stamps on it according to the rules, and you will never do such a stupid thing to steal and save stamps!

### About the Flag

â€” Han Dajun

The day before yesterday was Double Ten Day, and all circles in Shanghai hung flags for a day to celebrate; but many of the little friends don't know about the history of the national flag, so let me describe it:

Since the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China was established, and the Qing Dynasty government with the yellow dragon flag was overthrown. At that time, three types of national flag designs were determined: one was the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag proposed by Sun Yat-sen, which was designated as the naval flag; one was the Five-Colored Flag proposed by Mr. Zhang Taiyan, which was decided as the national flag; and one was the Eighteen-Star Flag proposed by Mr. Huang Keqiang, which was designated as the army flag. Later, the National Revolutionary Army took an oath to launch the Northern Expedition, raising the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag as the national flag; within two years, it unified the country, and the Blue Sky, White Sun flag flew everywhere.

In addition, I often see little friends disrespecting the national flag. You should know that the national flag represents the country. Disrespecting the national flag is not loving the country. Now I will write down a few common problems below, please pay attention to all little friends.

(1) Flags should be hung after the sun comes out and lowered before the sun sets, not in dark or unclean places, because if the national flag is hung in the absence of the sun or in the dark, it seems that the national flag is flying in the dark world.

(2) When hanging the flag, pay attention to the top and bottom of the flag, do not hang it upside down, because hanging it upside down means that the country is poor and asking for help.

(3) The flag rope must be firm, otherwise, if it falls on the ground, it will inevitably despise our country.

(4) When the national flag is not in use, it must not be discarded at will or used as curtains or wiping objects.

Usually, we should love the national flag as we love our country.

### New Lineup of the Yifeng Society

â€” Xinye

The Yifeng Society has always been anchored by Zhou Xinfang and Gao Baisui as master and apprentice. Therefore, their acting lineup often changes. Since the summer break, they have been almost inactive for three months, and even more actors have left. Important supporting roles such as Jin Suwen, Liang Jueshan, Ge Juejiang, Liu Wenkui, and Yu Zongying have also departed one after another, which is undeniably a loss for the Yifeng Society. However, there are now many promising new additions, especially Lin Yanwen, Jiang Yunxia, and Wang Yingwu, who are worth noting. Don't underestimate them just because they come from amusement parks; they actually have some impressive skills.

Lin Yanwen

The unfamiliar name Lin Yanwen might make people think she is a newcomer to Shanghai, but she is actually the embodiment of Wang Jingyan, who was formerly Li Qinfang. Ten years ago, she performed on the same stage as Xinfang. Later, she went to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. After the August 13th Incident, she became the leading actress in the Xinshijie (New World) Dajingban (big Peking opera troupe) for more than two years. She is a versatile dan (female) role, proficient in singing, acting, and makeup. Her martial arts skills are exceptionally refined. Her tumbling, fighting, and general movements are steady and practiced. It is rare to find such skills not only among female actors but also among male actors. This renewed collaboration with Xinfang will surely allow her to improve further, benefiting both parties.

Jiang Yunxia

Jiang Yunxia has only been performing for a few years. Initially, she performed at the Shidai Juchang (Times Theater) and collaborated with Zhang Wenjuan for a long time. Later, she became a leading performer at the Sincere Amusement Park and was well-received by the public. This time, she is making her debut on a grand stage at the Carlton Theater. Jiang's voice is high and bright, and her singing style is also pleasant. However, because she has not received instruction from a famous teacher, her acting skills do not seem to have reached a high level. This is a serious issue for an actor to achieve fame. Now that she has joined the Yifeng Society, it seems that she can no longer afford to ignore and follow old ways.

Wang Yingwu

Wang Yingwu's martial arts skills, while not exceptional, are considered top-tier among the Shanghai style. His first appearance in Shanghai was at the Chunhua Stage in Zhabei. At that time, both his demeanor and appearance were good. Although his martial techniques were somewhat fiery, they did not reach the point of being noisy. He has a special quality, possessing a calm and refined stage presence and a serene and elegant demeanor. Therefore, whether singing or acting, he adheres to the standard of elegance, with clear articulation and well-defined movements. His gentle and refined aura dominates all his actions. This may be due to the subtle influence of the Beijing school. Among Southern martial arts actors, only he and Yang Ruiting possess this kind of bearing. His signature plays include "Golden Money Leopard," "Jizhou City," and "Iron Rooster." Apart from Wang Qichang, there is no third person in the South who can perform "Golden Money Leopard" like him. However, when he performs martial dramas and wields weapons urgently, whether it is a sudden flat flip or an abrupt stand-alone move, although such actions are sufficient to show his waist and leg strength, they are not elegant and should be corrected and avoided.

Chapter 9: Shocking News

Old Mao seemed unable to fathom the meaning of my question. His eyes flickered for a moment, and he replied, "What do you mean by that? I was wearing those Zhigong woolen leather-soled shoes." He pointed to the ledge of the small window, where there was indeed a pair of leather-soled shoes, soles up, not yet completely dry. "It wasn't raining when I went out, so I wore those new shoes. When I came back, it was pouring, and those shoes got completely soaked. Sir, why are you asking about my shoes?"

I didn't answer but continued my questioning. "Then, after you were awakened by the gunshot, what shoes did you put on when you got out of bed?"

He pointed again to under the small square table next to me. "I wore these leather shoes. â€”Sir, I'm telling the truth. Why don't you tell me the truth? Why are you asking about my shoes? Could it beâ€”could it be because of that leather shoe print on the floor?"

He forced me to admit, "Yes. You see, that clear footprint on the floor is the same size as your leather shoes."

He said in astonishment, "What? The same? Strange! How did you know, sir?"

I pointed under the small square table. "I just measured your leather shoesâ€”eleven inches and six, and they're also the same round toe, exactly the same as the print on the floor."

The old man seemed a little shocked. His eyes were no longer looking at me, but at his leather shoes under the table. His hands were opening and closing, and his eyebrows were furrowed. He muttered to himself, "Strange, too strange! I really haven't been in thereâ€”" He suddenly raised his head, and a light even shone in his small eyes. "Sir! Iâ€”I remember! Thisâ€”thisâ€”"
