Editorial

### Observing the Soviet Union

For the past two weeks, with the expansion of the war in Western Europe, the focus of the world's attention has not only been limited to Britain and France and Germany, which are in the midst of a bloody battle, but also more concentrated on the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union, which are currently neutral; this is because the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union are all world powers, and their actions have a significant impact. The strength of the belligerent countries is increasingly destroyed and reduced due to the war. On the contrary, the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union are now able to maintain and increase all their strength because they have not yet been involved in the vortex, and at the same time, this has also increased the importance of these three countries; therefore, how their movements will naturally have a major impact on the future international situation, and are the focus of the world's attention. The current trend is very clear: the United States is enthusiastically sympathizing with Britain and France, while Italy is somewhat biased towards Germany. In the past few days, the United States Congress has passed the special naval budget of 150 million yuan and the special army budget of 180 million yuan in the most rapid steps, the purpose of which is of course to counter the new threat of the aggressor countries and contains the role of supporting Britain and France. As for Italy, whether it is newspaper commentary or public gatherings, it is full of anti-British and anti-French cries; the government authorities are also preparing to act. Although based on a variety of complex and contradictory circumstances, Italy may not join the German side in a short period of time to confront Britain and France, and the United States is even less likely to immediately join the British and French sides to fight against Germany, but the United States' support for Britain and France and Italy's support for Germany are extremely distinct. Only the Soviet Union, which has been silent for a long time and observed the world change quietly, has an obscurity of attitude and a caution of action that is unmatched by any country; and its founding to the north, spanning Europe and Asia, its position is even more important than Italy, and on par with the United States, so its possible dynamics must be analyzed.

First, observe the Soviet Union's position in Europe. The strengthening of the Soviet Union's position in Europe is greater than today. Eastern Poland has been occupied by the Soviet Union; the three Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) have all signed mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union; after the end of the war with Finland, the demarcation work has also been completed recently; these countries were originally not a concern for the Soviet Union, but subjectively, the Soviet Union has been able to eliminate its worries; in addition, what is more important is of course the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact last year, releasing suspicion, turning enemies into friends, which is the Soviet Union's greatest success in Europe. Originally, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy were all capitalist countries, which were essentially opposed to the Soviet Union, and there was always the possibility of forming an "anti-Soviet crusade"; the Munich Conference in 1938 implicitly took the expulsion of the Soviet Union as a period. However, the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact showed that the internal contradictions between capitalist countries are greater than the contradictions with the Soviet Union, and soon the Second European War broke out. Since then, not only has Germany sought something from the Soviet Union, but Britain and France have not dared to openly confront the Soviet Union; the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations are still in progress intermittently, which is a clear sign of the strengthening of the Soviet Union's position in Europe. From various aspects, the current Soviet authorities' observation of the future of the European war is probably like this: if Germany fails, Central Europe will suffer from the long-term post-war poverty, hunger, and disaster, and it is very likely to fall into the embrace of the Soviet Union, at which time the Soviet Union will be even stronger; after the war, Britain and France will be covered with sores, and of course they will not think of dealing with the Soviet Union. If Britain and France are repeatedly defeated, but still have the courage to sell, and are unwilling to succumb to Germany, then the United States, for its own interests, and to prevent the threat of Nazism from affecting the Americas, will come out to rescue Britain and France in order to rebuild the European balance of power; therefore, as long as the confrontation between Britain, France, and Germany continues to exist for one day, the Soviet Union will certainly protect its own safety outside the game. Therefore, no matter how the European war situation develops, it will not harm the Soviet Union, but will instead enhance the Soviet Union's position in Europe. The above two assumptions are the divergent paths of the evolution of the overall European situation in the near future; the Soviet Union can always sit back and watch the decision of the divergent paths, without using its worries and hesitations; what has become a problem is that, assuming that Germany and Italy form a closer unity, trample on Britain and France, and form an overwhelming advantage in dominating Europe, then the Soviet Union, for the sake of the more distant future, will always sit back and watch. To what extent will it tolerate? Or will it combine more with Germany and Italy in order to share the spoils? This is a huge problem.

The Soviet Union's danger zone is still in the Far East; the Soviet Union's main opponent is still Japan. This can be seen from the recent Japanese public opinion. Since the recent expansion of the European war, Japanese public opinion has almost unanimously and urgently clamored for how to end the "China Incident" as soon as possible in order to reap the fisherman's benefits in the European war; their view is that Britain is focusing all its efforts on fighting against Germany, and there is a possibility of softening towards Japan in the Far East, and as long as Japan avoids stimulating it again, the United States may not break with Japan; but towards the Soviet Union, they are unanimously hostile. In our observation, what the Japanese imagine about Britain and the United States is completely self-deception. The United States is a civilized country, and President Roosevelt has foresight and ambition, and will never compromise with aggressors, needless to say. As for Britain, he is using the theory of anti-aggression to fight against Germany and to maintain the mood of national unity, and he must not destroy his soul by compromising with Japan, not to mention that Churchill is in power, with a clear and firm consciousness, which is completely different from Chamberlain's appeasement policy; and he cannot run counter to the national policy of the United States because he is too busy to integrate with the United States. As for Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union, it is because it will never allow its neighboring country to be strong, its aggression against China is based on this, and its hostility towards the Soviet Union is also based on this. China and the Soviet Union are both connected to Japan's territory, and the people of both countries can strive to make progress; in the eyes of the narrow-minded, jealous, and greedy Japanese, as long as China and the Soviet Union are weak, the entire Asian continent should be the private property of Japan; this is what Japan grits its teeth, so it must invade China and oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, when China is strong, Japan is both resentful and angry; and the more consolidated the Soviet Union's position in Europe is, the deeper the jealousy it receives from Japan in the Far East. This subtle pivot, the important relationship, is of course valued by the Soviet government, and it must concentrate its efforts to deal with it. Therefore, the trade negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are continuous, and may even conclude a trade agreement; at the same time, the Soviet Union is also working hard to maintain the Soviet-German relations just right. The Soviet Union's skillful orchestration in European international relations is to consolidate its position to the point of leaving no regrets. This is precisely the cause and effect of its strength in the Far East policy and its deep-seated hatred of Japan, and they are mutually supportive; and the unanimous anti-Soviet sentiment of the Japanese government and the public is only the opposite explanation of the Soviet Union's attitude.

### Meeting of the Northern and Southern Allied Forces: German Left Wing Under Great Threat; Fierce Fighting in Flanders; French Forces on the South Bank of the Somme Consolidate Positions

Berlin: The German News Agency acknowledged that large contingents of Allied reinforcements had arrived, especially motorized and mechanized units. Although German aircraft launched fierce attacks, they could not stop them. However, the Allied attempt to break through the German lines failed, and several divisions of fresh German infantry had also arrived at various locations. The German forces now outnumbered the enemy, according to a Reuters report on the 25th.

Paris: Today, the fighting west of Cambrai was extremely intense. The French claimed to have recovered all lost territory on the Oise and Aisne rivers and had consolidated their positions on the Somme. For internal military reasons, the authorities responsible maintained strict silence on the progress of the battle of Cambrai. It was claimed here that although the situation was serious and chaotic, there was no reason to lose faith. The French announced that the great battle in Flanders was extremely fierce. Although German losses were very heavy, there had been no practical change in the battle situation so far. According to French official reports, this morning the Germans, with more armored units, broke through the gap between Arras and Picardy and advanced towards Abbeville and Beauvais. These units, accompanied by weak mechanized infantry units, advanced towards the northwest coast. Several other weak German units were sent to the north and northwest to protect the German right wing, but were easily blocked by Allied forces near Saint-Omer. The situation in Beauvais was unclear, but Calais had not been attacked. All the territory occupied by the Germans on the Oise and Aisne rivers on Thursday had been recovered. French forces on the left bank of the Somme continued to conduct mopping-up operations last night and this morning, capturing hundreds of soldiers. The German advance south of Sedan had been halted, according to a Reuters report on the 25th.

Paris: Military observers are closely watching the development of the great battle in northern France. The war zone there is expanding daily. With the possibility of the Germans launching a general offensive at any time, the French forces are also preparing to launch a counteroffensive. Military circles are maintaining absolute secrecy on this matter. As for other fronts, matters are all of a local nature and not very important in military terms. Battle reports from various locations are recorded as follows: (1) The British authorities announced yesterday that some British and Belgian units had retreated on the Belgian front. It is now known that these units were very small in number and not worth mentioning. (2) In the Picardy region, after hesitating for several days, the Germans this morning sent tank units to attack between the city of Arras and the Somme, attempting to pursue northwest to reach the ports of the English Channel. (3) Although the situation in the port of Beauvais is very chaotic, the Germans have not yet attacked the port of Calais. (4) All the fallen towns in the Upper Argonne region have been recovered by the French forces, according to a Havas dispatch on the 25th.

London: Sources reported at 1:00 PM today that the German forces in the Strait area of French territory had lost contact with the main German forces as a result of the Allied forces closing the gap between the northern and southern armies. However, this report has not been officially confirmed. According to earlier reports describing the Allied advance, the Allied forces had reached the connecting point of Cambrai, Saint-Quentin, and Péronne, thus rejoining this large chain of defense. When the Allied forces attempted to link their two armies, the northern Allied army advanced from Ghent towards Valenciennes and Cambrai, and the southern Allied army advanced from Péronne towards Laon, Rethel, and Sedan, while the French forces in Arras and Bapaume were positioned between the Belgian and British forces. Although officials were reluctant to reveal the truth in war bulletins, it was believed here that since Wednesday, the Allied forces had made considerable progress, gradually approaching the gap through which the German forces broke through to reach Beauvais. According to this unconfirmed news today, the Allied forces in the north had broken through the German lines and joined forces with General Weygand's army south of this gap, and the narrow German lifeline between the Somme and the Scarpe was reportedly threatened by the French forces between Péronne and Cambrai. After the Allied forces in the north and south joined forces, the French, Belgian, and Dutch armies formed a strong defensive line along the Escaut River, and the German right wing on that river was under fierce attack from the British forces in Bapaume, Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Audenarde. Before the news of the Allied repair of the gap arrived, military experts had pointed out that the Allied artillery was sufficient to deal with this gap. Regardless of whether this breakthrough corridor (i.e., the gap) was twenty or twenty-four miles wide, the Allied artillery fire on both sides of this gap was sufficient to deter German activity in this area, so it could ultimately cut off the communication between the reserve troops advancing to the coast by breaking through the Allied lines and their reinforcements, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

German War Report

Berlin: The Supreme Command announced in a bulletin today that the encirclement of Belgian forces and parts of the French First, Ninth, and Seventh Armies, as well as a large British Expeditionary Force, had been effectively completed. The areas east of this encirclement, Ghent and Courtrai, had been occupied by German forces, and the Germans had also captured the Vimy Ridge. Calais had been surrounded. The high ground above Lillers and Saint-Omer to Gravelines had been taken by German forces. The enemy lost eighty-four aircraft yesterday, and seven German aircraft were missing, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

Berlin: German military circles here claimed last night that German forces had entered Calais, Beauvais, and Ghent yesterday and predicted that the war in northern France and Belgium could be ended by the end of May. The German side did not state that the three cities had completely fallen, only that German forces had entered the three cities, but the fall of the three cities was imminent. They also stated that the German forces in the south could advance to Dunkirk and Ostend within these few days and meet the German forces in the north there. According to a military source, "Once our army controls the English Channel, the enemy will be completely surrounded. At that time, our army can issue orders to encircle from all sides, followed by a final annihilation battle." German mechanized units had captured Saint-Omer, 25 miles southeast of Calais. The German High Command had not yet been able to confirm this, but German military circles said that it was possible. According to a German news agency, of the original twelve divisions of the Belgian army, only two divisions were fighting on the northern front yesterday. The German side was gradually gaining an advantage in the number of troops fighting in northern France and southern Belgium. In northern France and Belgium, the Allied forces surrounded number one million, and half have now been annihilated. The news agency said that these Allied forces could be surrounded and annihilated, or driven into the sea, or divided into small sections and then wiped out, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

The Germans Risk Everything, Cherishing the Ambition to Conquer Britain

London: According to a dispatch from a neutral country's correspondent in Berlin, German officials openly admitted that Germany was currently exerting all its strength to make a do-or-die effort on the Western Front. The Germans understood that the outcome of the war might depend on the current battle, so they dispatched all their mechanized equipment to the battle. Many believed that the battle in northern France and Belgium was the first part of Hitler's plan, but the resistance encountered by the German forces today seemed to be beyond their initial calculations, and the entire plan of Hitler's strategy was a direct attack on Britain, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

Rome: The German Supreme Command announced last night that the German forces had won great victories on both land and sea, and the highest military circles here indicated that Hitler had planned to begin a war to invade Britain by the end of May, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

London: Hitler's greatest ambition is generally believed to be the conquest of Britain. Now, the German army's direct attack on Britain is indeed imminent. The British, in view of this, are now strengthening their coastal defenses for self-preservation. King George VI warned the entire British Empire yesterday that German forces were moving north from Beauvais, threatening Calais and advancing towards Ostend. Therefore, the Empire is now undergoing a dangerous test. He said, "The enemy abroad is not only seeking the conquest of land but also plotting to completely overthrow the British Empire, and then to conquer the entire world." Officials said that Dover and other ports along the coast were all prepared, "Waiting for Hitler's magic weapon to arrive." At that time, the Allied anti-aircraft artillery would drive German aircraft away from the southeast coast of Britain. Dover, Folkestone, Harwich, and Newport were all carefully arranged, but apart from the visible artillery positions and naval and army forces, other defense situations could be kept secret. It was learned from reliable sources that new secret defense strategies and secret weapons had been invented. When the news of the fall of Beauvais reached Britain, the British remained calm as usual and did not panic and try to escape. British strategists admitted that the Germans were planning to use all the air force bases they had seized in the Netherlands to launch a direct attack on Britain. In terms of offensive, the German position was indeed better than a month ago, but the British military intelligence office had not announced that the German army had any large-scale troop movements. Many believed that General Weygand had already devised a strategy to first cut off the German salient troops, and then restore the Allied front in France and Belgium. However, the German army had launched a fierce attack on the English Channel, advancing without retreating for five days, and the Allied forces had not established anything in terms of tactics. This had to be regarded as a serious situation, according to a dispatch from the 25th International News Service.

Prelude to the German Attack on Britain: Yorkshire, England, Attacked by Air Raids Yesterday

London: German aircraft today bombed Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex in northeastern England, and Yorkshire, the center of the British textile industry. Most people believe that the German aircraft's bombing may be a prelude to a blitzkrieg attack on Britain. In Yorkshire, eleven civilians were killed or injured. One of the German bombs fell on a huge empty house, and all the glass windows were shattered. The city's huge electric clock was also shocked and stopped. Although Essex was bombed, the damage was very small, and there were no deaths or injuries. Military observers believed that the German aircraft that bombed Britain this time may have taken off from bases in the Netherlands, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

London: The possible threat of a German invasion of Britain became more serious this morning. Several German aircraft carried out extensive bombing in Yorkshire on the east coast of Britain, injuring eight civilians. When the German aircraft were discovered, the local anti-aircraft artillery immediately began firing, forcing the German aircraft to fly into the clouds, and the infantry defending against paratroopers stood guard, closely prepared, for fear that paratroopers would land. As a result, no paratroopers landed, and the German aircraft also flew away, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

Ghent, the Economic and Cultural Center of Belgium, Occupied by German Forces

Berlin: Senior German officials met with a reporter from the Hague News Agency last night and made a statement supplementing the official report as follows: "Before judging the battle situation on the Belgian-French border, two points must first be understood to have a correct concept: (1) The enemy army attacked by the German infantry had approximately equal strength; (2) The German mechanized units advanced rapidly. After fierce fighting, they had driven back the enemy forces from the strong fortifications of the Scheldt River and defeated the Belgian city of Ghent. Ghent is the capital of the province of East Flanders, Belgium, located at the confluence of the Scheldt and Lys rivers. The city has a population of approximately 230,000, mostly of the Flemish ethnicity, so the city is also the center of the Flemish national movement and cultural life. The Ghent-Terneuzen Canal is approximately 33 kilometers long and connects to the Western Scheldt. The city of Ghent is known as the 'Manchester of Belgium,' which shows its important economic position. The textile industry, with cotton, silk, and flax as the most important, is mostly exported abroad. There are many ancient buildings in the city, including the Saint Bavo Cathedral. The cathedral houses many ancient artifacts. The Flemish University is also located in the city. The school was founded in 1816. During the last World War, the city of Ghent was occupied by German forces in October 1914. The German forces withdrew from the city on November 11, 1918, the day of the armistice in Europe," according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.

The Magnificent View of German Coastal Anti-Aircraft Fire

### Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the Franco-Belgian Coast; British Spitfire Fighters Show Their Power, Shooting Down Up to Forty German Aircraft

London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that eleven of our fighters were patrolling over the French coast this afternoon when they encountered a large enemy formation and launched an attack. Eleven Messerschmitt German aircraft were shot down, and three others were severely damaged. None of our aircraft were lost. There was large-scale intense aerial activity over the Franco-Belgian front yesterday day and night and today. British Air Force bombers repeatedly attacked enemy columns near Arras and Beauvais, and at night launched fierce attacks on enemy transport lines in northeastern France, southern Belgium, and the Rhine region. The targets in northeastern France hit by our heavy bombers included military objectives in Bavay and Hirson, which caught fire after being hit. The rail junction at La Horgne was also hit. A large group of troops and transport vehicles in Givet, near the Meuse River, was heavily damaged by bombing. The rail junction at Beaumont was hit by bombs, and a large train caught fire and burned. Our aircraft also attacked the road junction at Crécy, seeing a truck team explode nearby after being hit, and also attacked Charleroi, which also exploded after being hit. Our heavy bombers flew to the Rhine region, bombing enemy transportation in Cologne and Koblenz in the Eifel region. Six of our aircraft did not return. Our fighters continued to win victories against enemy aircraft. According to the news received so far, at least eighty enemy aircraft have been shot down or severely damaged since yesterday morning. Ten of our fighters are missing, but some of the pilots may return to their units. Last week, enemy aircraft lost at least five hundred aircraft in France and Belgium. Since their invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, the total number of aircraft lost has exceeded 1,500, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

### China's Concern Over the European War Situation

Chongqing: Chinese officials are deeply concerned about the development of the European war, especially the current fighting in the ports of the Strait. They understand that the outcome of the war will inevitably have a far-reaching impact on the situation in the Far East. Chinese officials and the public are now eagerly awaiting the latest news from the European war. The ministers of the Chinese government recently convened a meeting to ask Foreign Minister Wang Chong-hui to review the latest developments in the European war, and the outcome of the European war is the topic of conversation in schools and public institutions. However, most people are hesitant and do not openly declare their support for any of the belligerents, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

### Across the English Channel: Flames Shooting Straight Into the Sky; British Warships Bomb French Coastal Highways; Rumors that Germany Will Use Long-Range Artillery to Attack Britain

London: As the residents of the northeastern towns of England experienced air raids for the first time, the people in the villages slightly south of the northeastern towns saw a sea of flames on the French coast across the sea in the areas of Beauvais and Calais, and heard the continuous rumble of artillery fire. This artillery fire was the sound of British warships bombarding the coastal highways between Beauvais and Calais, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.

Milan: According to a report from a battlefield correspondent for the Milan "Stampa" newspaper, Tolera, the German army in Flanders is about to use special long-range artillery to bombard the English Channel. This artillery has not yet been used in mobile warfare, so it will pose another unexpected threat to the Allies, according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.

### British Empire Day: British King's Broadcast Address; Fighting for Freedom and Justice as the Goal; Hoping for Universal Unity to Achieve Victory

London: British King George VI delivered an Empire Memorial Day broadcast address to the nation last night, saying that the world must discern the purpose of our country's enemies, which is no longer to occupy land, but to completely overthrow the Empire and everything it possesses, and then to conquer the entire world. If they can achieve their wishes, they will surely complete all the hatred and brutality they have already demonstrated. We sincerely find it difficult to believe that there are such vicious plans in the human psyche, but the period of doubt has long passed. At present, the people of the Empire and the people of the world who have vision and goodwill have already understood this situation. Last year on Empire Memorial Day, I addressed the people of the Empire from Winnipeg, the heart of Canada, saying that the foundation of our free people's federation is the concept of freedom, justice, and peace. Afterwards, the war clouds gathered, and I still hoped that the above-mentioned concepts could still establish more sufficient development and allow the people to avoid the pain of war and massacre. But the result was the opposite. The disaster that we constantly worked to avoid and sincerely hoped to avoid finally came. We did not realize this until this time, because what was revealed was a long-planned plan to conquer the nations of the world by force, so all our peace efforts were in vain.

At present, we have reached the time of the decisive battle. I will tell you plainly that in this time of trouble, there is nothing else you expect from me except this understanding. The current war is a life-and-death duel for us. The meaning of failure will not be a temporary setback that can be revived on the day of strength recovery, but the destruction of our world. We can imagine the darkness after this destruction. I am speaking to you today in the new phenomenon of the current British Empire. At present, this phenomenon has come into conflict with the evil system that is trying to carry out destruction and has been compared with each other. Its full importance has appeared in a brighter and more fixed light.

Our enemy is now using one word to resist us, namely "imperialism." Their use of this word contains a spirit of arrogance and conquest. In fact, our free people of the Empire have long ceased to put this word on their lips. Those who use this word are those who harbor evil intentions. The purpose we hold is peace. Our system can only develop in peace. The conditions of our people can only improve in peace. The problems of the government can only be resolved in the spirit of goodwill in peace. The enemy has now taken this peace from us. They are trying to destroy everything we have worked to maintain. Whoever resists our honesty is a disgrace, whoever resists our loyalty is a traitor, and whoever resists our justice is a barbaric force. The opposing armies are now in this clear and immovable opposition. The roar of all the people of the Empire undoubtedly shows who can prevail. They rise up in righteous anger against what they hate, and nothing can shake their determination. They are united in defending their lives and everything that makes their lives worth living. When I tell you how dangerous the disaster we are facing today is, please do not think that my confidence is dim, but this kind of confidence shines in my heart, its light is like shining in your hearts. But holding only confidence is of no avail, and it must be combined with courage and determination, perseverance and self-sacrifice. These are the noble virtues that the soldiers who come from home and abroad and fight on land, sea, and air are displaying. At this moment, our thoughts are inclined to our battles, and love and soldiers, love and mothers, wives, and lovers. Beside them stand the soldiers of our Allied France. With them are the people of Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The peaceful lands of these three countries have all fallen into the tragedy of fraud and innocent aggression.

In this critical moment, we are like our ancestors who encountered great disasters in the past, but with this heart inclined to Heaven, I have asked in this ancient country that the following Sunday be a day of national prayer. Many of our compatriots overseas may or may not join the people in this prayer. Let us be of one heart and one mind, trusting in God to accomplish the cause we hold. May we bravely defend the rights that God has bestowed upon us. People, men, and women of the Empire all over the world, I now admonish you, no matter what work you are undertaking, do your best with all the courage and will you can muster. Always keep your heart high and your will unyielding. With one heart and one mind, move forward bravely, with a smile on your face and your head held high. We rely on God's help, and we will surely fail. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

Washington: All radio stations in the United States stopped all broadcast programs to broadcast the British King's speech. The entire United States clearly heard the speech. The sections of the speech involving the Nazi ambitions that have attacked families and the loud appeal to all well-intentioned people in the world are nothing less than the call of the people. This was really impossible two weeks ago. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 24th.

### Berlin's Reaction

Berlin: After British King George delivered his speech, Dr. Dietrich, the director of the German government information office, replied, stating that British King George VI stated that Britain was based on the ideals of freedom, justice, and peace, but the history of the British Empire proves that Britain's foundation is oppression rather than freedom, plunder rather than justice, and sin rather than peace. The British King claimed that he aimed at peace, but it was Britain that encouraged Poland to fight, Britain that sacrificed Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and Britain that declared war on Germany and caused the war. Germany has repeatedly suggested maintaining world peace, but it has been rejected by Britain. The British King's cowardly words have revealed Britain's true face. Germany's weapons will give an appropriate answer, according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.

### British Prime Minister's Letter to the Trade Union Congress: Please Endure Sacrifices

London: Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the special congress of the trade union executive committees jointly organized by the Trade Union Congress and meeting today, saying that the needs of the country cannot be satisfied, cannot be avoided, and are urgent. If we cannot cope with it, the future will be even greater. We have great faith in the organized labor's readiness to accept all the obligations to endure and work hard for the sacrifices that the country is forced to demand of them. The seriousness of time is deepening every hour. All of us should make the greatest efforts to defend the country, maintain our freedom, and achieve victory. The congress has approved the General Affairs Committee's resolution to organize all the resources of the country and do everything possible to defeat the invading army, so as to help defend the people and reject all the necessary plans contained in the current situation. After Labor Minister Bevin explained the program he was about to carry out, the congress passed a resolution expressing deep admiration for those who bravely defended freedom, namely the armed forces and merchant marine navy of the Allied countries, resisting the invading army with iron enemy power in order to achieve victory, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.

London - According to a special dispatch published today, two neutral newspapers criticized the special powers granted to the government by the British Parliament. The "Gothenburg Daily" stated that a dictatorial system is more powerful and ruthless than other systems. Britain is now united and behind it, and has demanded it. The war must be won, and nothing else matters. Everyone knows that Britain's dictatorship will not last a day longer than necessary. No one dislikes dictatorship more than the British, but no one is better at using it to achieve success. The "New York Times" stated that British labour has demonstrated its extraordinary patriotism. The bill to take away the right of labour groups to advocate for their own working conditions was proposed by Labour Party leader Attlee himself. The bill also takes away the right of capitalists to manage their own property. (Reuter, 24th)

### South Africa Determined to Fight to the End, Strictly Preventing Fifth Column Activities, Clearance of Sea Mines Completed

Johannesburg - South African Prime Minister General Smuts issued a warning last night at a public banquet celebrating his 70th birthday, stating that the government would deal with "Fifth Column" elements. He mentioned the enthusiastic response in South Africa to the call for volunteers, and continued, stating that the world would be greatly impoverished at the end of the war, and that there may be unprecedented poverty after the greatest destruction in history. In the last war, the Germans failed despite having an invincible military apparatus, due to a psychological defect. This psychological defect remains unchanged and will cause Germany to collapse again. South Africa is determined to fight to the end with all its strength. (Reuter, 29th)

Cape Town - Defence authorities announced that the work of clearing sea mines off Cape Agulhas has been successfully completed, and no ships have been damaged. (Reuter, 25th)

### Canadian Fascist Party Headquarters Searched

Montreal - The Royal Canadian Mounted Police recently searched the premises of saboteurs, seized documents that have been examined, and announced that they will take "the most definite" action.

No arrests were made, but an officer said that the authorities would issue arrest warrants. (Reuter, 24th)

### German Strength Today is Not What it Was, Goebbels Publishes an Article

Berlin - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the "Greater German Weekly," stating that it would be a gross misrepresentation to compare today's European war with the previous one, as today's situation is unprecedented. For example, in 1914, Germany was surrounded diplomatically, but today Hitler has used political and military force to completely destroy the encirclement. In terms of economic conditions, Germany was also surrounded in the past. Although Britain and France are trying to repeat their old tricks, Germany is prepared for the blockade, rendering the enemy's measures ineffective. In the past, Germany did not mobilize all of its material and human resources during the war. Today, it has the latest machinery and weapons, and the people of the whole country are behind the leader, so the soldiers can use their full strength to charge forward and serve on the battlefield. In terms of psychological warfare and propaganda, Germany took a completely defensive posture in 1914, but today it has switched to an offensive one. Therefore, it is difficult for enemy countries to succeed if they fabricate news of German atrocities, claiming how brutal Germany is, in the hope of arousing the world's aversion to Germany. There is no shortage of people who rely on hearsay, believing that Germany's political and military victories this time are all due to good fortune and luck, which is biased. The famous German general Moltke said, "In the long run, only the talented and intelligent can always be lucky." How well said! (Haitong, 25th)

### Western Front War, Casualty Estimates, Allied Forces Suffer Greater Losses Than German Forces

New York - According to military officer reports from both Berlin and Paris yesterday, since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Allied forces have lost approximately twice as many soldiers, aircraft, and tanks as the Germans.

Reports from Paris stated that approximately 100,000 to 150,000 German soldiers have been killed, and approximately 350,000 to 400,000 have been injured. 1,200 German aircraft have been shot down, and 1,300 German tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed. Reports from Berlin, however, stated that approximately 200,000 to 300,000 Allied soldiers have been killed, and 400,000 to 500,000 have been injured. 2,100 aircraft have been shot down, and 2,000 tanks have been destroyed.

### Shiratori Advocates Economic Aid to Germany

Tokyo, Japan - Former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Toshio Shiratori, told reporters from the United Press here yesterday that he would request Japan to "do its best for Germany in diplomatic and economic terms." Although Shiratori advocates that Japan form a military alliance with Germany and Italy, he does not support providing military assistance to Germany. Shiratori stated, "We agree with the concept of a totalitarian state. Although I do not support military action, I advocate doing my best for Germany in diplomatic and economic terms. Joining the German side's demands is on the rise. If Italy enters the war, that demand will increase even more, but I fear interference is too late, because all the important decisions of the past ten years have led to the current direct action. There is currently no way to restrain other governments. During the tenure of Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, there is no need for democratic countries to fear, but in the event of a cabinet reshuffle, the Japanese government will adopt a tough policy." Shiratori stated that when he spoke with German Air Force Minister Marshal Goering last year, Goering stated, "The next war can be concluded before the United States can send reinforcements." (United Press, 25th)

### Rome Holds Air Defence Exercises, War Enthusiasm Fills the Country, Armed Soldiers Open Borders and Strengthen Defences, Britain Sends Halifax to Madrid to Prevent Spain from Entering the War

Rome - An official document here stated that the results of the air defence exercises and fire brigade exercises held in Rome and Turin were very satisfactory, and there was no need for further practice. (Haitong, 25th)

London - Concerns in diplomatic circles here increased last night that Italy may soon join the German side and participate in the European war vortex. Here, fears are also increasing that if Mussolini joins forces with Hitler, Italy will attempt to drag Spain into the German-Italian side to fight the Allied forces. It is widely believed that the British government sent Lord Halifax as a special envoy to Madrid, with the aim of finding a way to prevent Spain from joining the war. Britain's concern about Italy joining the European war can be demonstrated by the Mediterranean, as all British women and children in Gibraltar have been evacuated. Over the past week, Britain has attempted to alleviate some of Italy's grievances, but diplomatic circles admitted last night that relations between Rome and the Allied forces have not improved. On the contrary, the whole of Italy is filled with war enthusiasm. The public cheers as armed soldiers pass through the streets of major cities, opening the way to the Italian border to strengthen defences. The National Veterans Association in Rome passed a resolution yesterday, reaffirming their willingness to be sent to the front line to fight for Italy. Thousands of new slogans were found on the streets of Rome yesterday, declaring, "Long live Italian Corsica!" (Corsica is an island in the Mediterranean near Italy, belonging to France, with an area of 3,368 square miles and a population of 282,000.) Diplomatic circles here also noted the movements of Italian ships last night. Several Italian merchant ships have cancelled their sailing dates, while others have postponed their sailing dates to mid-June. Observers here pointed out that although the suspension of Italian merchant ships to the Far East is due to a lack of passengers, this issue does not apply to the United States, as thousands of American refugees are waiting for ships in Italy to return home. (United Press, 25th)

### Italy's Civilian Mobilization Law is Comprehensive, Published in the Official Gazette, to be Implemented Before Mobilization is Ordered

Rome - A comprehensive civilian mobilization law was published in today's official gazette, which revises existing legislation on national organization and mobilization in preparation for war. Under this new law, all civilian public and private organizations and companies, and all capital, property, and inventions, can be requisitioned. Goods can be distributed according to population, and imports and exports can be restricted or prohibited. Orders can also be issued to report all capital. Those who are not of military age, and women and children over the age of fourteen, can be mobilized to participate in civilian service under military discipline. This law can be put into effect before mobilization is ordered. The Supreme Defence Committee, with Mussolini as chairman and including all cabinet members, is responsible for organizing and mobilizing the entire country in wartime. The Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the War Industries Committee, may be ordered to join when necessary. (Reuter, 25th)

Italian People Express Willingness to Serve the Country Loyally

Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini received many letters and telegrams yesterday on the 25th anniversary of Italy's participation in the European War, all expressing the Italian people's willingness to follow the Prime Minister's orders and serve the country loyally in times of emergency. (Haitong, 25th)

Rome - Yesterday, the 25th anniversary of Italy's participation in the World War against Germany passed quietly. There were no noisy demonstrations in the streets of Rome. Rather than calling it a pro-German day, it should be called an anti-Allied day. The newspapers all said that Italy was fighting against Austria, and did not mention that today's allies were yesterday's enemies. The main points of the editorials were "the perfidy of Italy's former allies," and "the time has come for the old plutocratic countries to settle accounts." (Reuter, 25th)

Rome - The number of people in Italy who advocate joining the war has been increasing daily. The National Council of Academies, the general organization of national scientific and cultural groups, convened an extraordinary meeting today to discuss the issues raised by Italy's legitimate desires. A resolution was immediately passed, stating that at a time when the Italian nation is safeguarding its independence and seeking the development of its empire, the Council will be loyal to the King and the Prime Minister, and will fulfill its duties, regardless of any difficulties encountered. (Havas, 24th)

Rome Radio Station Reports on the European Situation

Rome - The Rome Radio Station issued a report yesterday on the current European situation, stating that the interruption of British and French telephone lines and the cancellation of music programs by French radio stations are symbolic of the current situation in Britain and France. Public opinion in both countries now recognizes that the former's assessment of the European situation was wrong. Not only is this true militarily, but Britain and France have also never understood the strength of other countries politically. All new achievements, new developments, and new realities have been ignored by Britain and France, but now they have suddenly awakened. The activities of German aircraft have made both British officials and civilians feel the threat of the British Isles being occupied. On the German side, the "Steel Pact" with Italy has just celebrated its one-year anniversary. This pact proves to the world that international relations are now being universally revised. A "New Era" is being born, and the "Old World" is about to collapse. (Haitong, 25th)

### US House of Representatives Passes Unlimited Expansion of Army Air Corps, Roosevelt Announces Training of 50,000 Pilots Starting July 1st

Washington - Today, the House of Representatives passed the bill allowing unlimited expansion of the Army Air Corps under President Roosevelt's proposed $1,182,000,000 defence program and sent it to the Senate. This bill will permit 6,000 Air Corps officers to be on active duty at any one time, and will temporarily terminate the 6,000-person limit for the Army Air Corps by June 30, 1941. (Reuter, 24th)

Washington - President Roosevelt announced here yesterday that the government plans to train 50,000 air force pilots in the next fiscal year (starting July 1st) as reserves for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The new plan is to expand last year's program of training 10,000 pilots by civilian aviation organizations. According to the President's plan, pilots will be recruited from three civilian sources: (1) high school and university students; (2) citizens with flying licenses who have stopped flying; (3) citizens aged 18 to 22 who have not graduated. Recently, the government considered a recommendation from Congress to provide 300,000 members of the civilian defence corps with military training immediately. The civilian defence corps is currently subject to military discipline, but has not received training in the use of weapons. Those in Congress who favour the militarization of the civilian defence corps said that after the corps receives military training, it can double the number of US regular troops. Furthermore, the military training of the civilian defence corps will not affect the country's main industries. It will also play an important role in President Roosevelt's $4,000,000,000 military expansion program for the next year. (United Press, 25th)

Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters that the plan to provide 50,000 people with basic pilot training within one year, starting June 1st. President Roosevelt also said that he will ask Congress to allocate additional funds to carry out this pilot training program. (Reuter, 25th)

McNutt Speech Urges Strengthening of Strength

Jackson, Mississippi - Federal Security Administrator McNutt said in a speech here last night that the United States' sea, land, and air forces are not yet sufficient and should be greatly strengthened so that no country or group of countries in the world would dare to look directly at the Western Hemisphere. He said, "I firmly believe that if the Allied forces are defeated, only the vast military power of the United States will be able to prevent war in the Western Hemisphere." He said that the United States only has a "vague understanding" of the impact on US security of the "tacit cooperation" between the three powers in the East and West. He was clearly referring to Germany, Italy, and Japan. "It is time for us to be determined to defend the entire North and South American continent. At this moment, we should not discuss the mere millions of dollars in defence costs for the Panama Canal, which is a key point for attacking any of our coasts. Our current preparations to defend both coastlines are absolutely insufficient to cope with the combined forces of the four powers and the navies of the European democracies they may be able to manipulate." (United Press, 25th)

US Government Organizes Large-Scale Hospitals

New York - US Army Surgeon General Magee said today that the US government is currently organizing large hospitals to serve in the United States or in overseas war zones in "national emergencies."

In addition, it is rumored that the government will soon replace the Secretaries of the Army and Navy. (Havas, 25th)

Sayre vigorously denounced force as the creator of chaos and degradation, saying that human culture based on law and order, built by centuries of heroic effort and sacrifice, has now been violated by organized and armed aggression, extreme barbarity, and contempt for human principles and justice. America's great undertaking will be to help rebuild a peaceful Europe with capital and raw materials, with new ideas and new methods, to establish humanitarianism, and to create unlimited international trade.

### Soviet Ambassador Maisky Visits British Foreign Office, Trade Talks Between the Two Countries Possible

London - Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office last night. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, it seems reasonable to believe that Foreign Secretary Butler's statement in the House of Commons two days ago that the British government is taking active steps to improve relations with the Soviet Union indicates that the recent Soviet note is considered to have opened the door to the possibility of trade talks. In this situation, the British government may obtain the consent of the Soviet government to send Sir Stafford Cripps, a leader of the British left wing, to Moscow, with a mission to determine what kind of basis can be obtained for engaging in trade negotiations.

### Zhenyue Air Route Negotiations; In Progress

### The Scenery of Three Capitals During Wartime in Europe (III); The Contrast Between Paris and Berlin Before the Great War on the Western Front

Even in large stores filled with shoppers, it is very quiet inside. Shops selling women's accessories, jewelry, treasures, silk, and all kinds of luxury goods are well-stocked, while other goods are mostly sold out. The clothes on sale are marked with prices and percentages, and shoppers are more interested in the reduction of the specified percentage points than the marked selling price. The display windows of the shops are full of all kinds of new goods, but if you want to buy one or two of the same kind, the shop assistant tells you that it is only for "decoration." In Germany, the authorities are holding up the facade, but the displays in the windows cause some Germans to doubt whether the wartime storage is adequately displayed.

Paris is lively, with lots of noise and convenient transportation. The street lights are only turned over a little, many door lights are on, and many curtains are casually drawn. The city does not implement a quota system, which shows that there is no shortage of goods. The method of food restriction is very simple, stipulating that certain goods are not allowed to be sold on certain days. There is no meat to eat for three days a week, and no noodles, wine, or candy for the other few days. Although the French are particular about food, they just shrug their shoulders at this kind of restriction, unlike the Germans who discuss eating and drinking all the time. German housewives spend a lot of time looking for food. Their sense of smell is very sensitive. If a merchant obtains food that is not subject to quota restrictions, such as nuts or oranges, as soon as they display this kind of thing, countless German ladies will flock to them.

The fatigue of war exists between the two countries. For seven years, Germany has been preparing for war without rest. By the last moment, their effectiveness and patience had reached their peak. As far as the soldiers are concerned, they are actually better than the civilian forces. A young engineer said when his family praised him for his radiant appearance: "I have plenty of rest and good food on the front line." But the production of civilian factories and fields is stagnant. Neither stimulation nor punishment can make the soldiers on this second line work harder. In fact, they are too tired. Women are exhausted from cooking without rice. In some places, it is said that children are also getting tired. Teachers in schools are unable to make them interested in "My Struggle" and all Nazi ideology.

We all have a feeling that the revolution of the National Socialist Party is gradually coming to an end, becoming extremely radical on the one hand and expressing boredom and the disappearance of illusions on the other. If it were not for this war, this trend would be even more obvious. But the war has forged the Nazis and anti-Nazis into one. They have been constantly propagandizing that Britain is going to smash Germany, so everyone is rising up to fight against foreign enemies, becoming the country's military force. The people hope for peace even more eagerly than the French. Most people believe that if a large-scale war cannot be avoided, then Germany will definitely win. We can often hear them say: "Everything will be over in August, and our difficulties will come to an end."

In France, no one dares to predict the end of the war. France believes that he will eventually win, and does not say that this war is short and easy. The German government's intention seems to be to divert people's attention so that they do not feel the danger. In fact, so far, Berlin has not experienced the fear of being bombed. The Paris government seems to want the people to understand that war is not child's play and that danger can come at any time. The French believe that this is right, but they do not want to panic. If the Germans do not try their best to the limit, the French will not make a concerted effort. The strangest thing is that this war has not caused great excitement on either side. Berlin is acting slowly and depressed, with a vast future and no way to end. Paris's mood and expression are relatively relaxed, but the heart is not so. The Germans see nothing in the dark under the blackout. The French see too clearly in the dim light. (Translated from the New York Times)

### Production Education Expenses for the 29th Year; The Executive Yuan, 1.2 Million Yuan; The Ministry of Education Has Distributed Separately

(Chongqing Telegraph of the 25th) The production education expenses were originally 800,000 yuan per year. Recently, the Executive Yuan meeting approved the production education expenses for the 29th year, increasing them by 400,000 yuan, which has been distributed by the Ministry of Education as follows: (1) 140,000 yuan to subsidize production funds for vocational schools in various regions. (2) 120,000 yuan to subsidize salary allowances for technical teachers in vocational schools. (3) 120,000 yuan to subsidize internship material fees for vocational schools. The Ministry of Education has established detailed measures for the above three subsidies. The remaining 10,000 yuan has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be used to subsidize various agricultural vocational schools in Sichuan Province.

### The Ministry of Education Re-Orders Schools in the Rear; Pay Attention to Students' Health

(Chongqing Telegraph of the 25th) The Ministry of Education previously stated that most of the schools at all levels in the war zone that have moved to the rear are lacking in equipment and makeshift due to funding issues, which affects the health of students. It was ordered to pay special attention to it. Now, the Ministry believes that a small number of schools have failed to comply, and has re-emphasized the previous order, ordering strict compliance.

### Guo Yubu; Academic Review Meeting

(Chongqing Airmail) The Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education held a meeting on May 12th. The attendees included Minister Chen Lifu, Vice Ministers Gu and Yu, and Committee Members Zhu Jiahua, Chen Daqi, Guo Renyuan, Wang Shijie, Cheng Tianfang, Luo Jialun, Zhang Daofan, Yan Fuqing, Zeng Yangfu, Fu Sinian, Feng Youlan, Zou Shuwen, Ma Dehan, Teng Gu, Wu Junsheng, and 18 other people. They approved the main points of the regulations on the review of qualifications of teachers in universities and independent colleges, the main points of the regulations on the appointment and treatment of teachers in universities and independent colleges, the connection of work between various research institutes, and the cases of subsidizing the study of Bi Shu and rewarding writing inventions. That evening, all committee members attended a reception hosted by the Central Party Headquarters. The news of the victory in Southern Henan arrived. Secretary-General Ye Chucang delivered a speech, stating that the great plan of resisting the war and building the country is like the two wings of a bird. One wing is military, and the other wing is education. The President once said that our country has absolute confidence in military victory. The victory in Southern Henan has been confirmed. This wing is no longer a problem. As for the other wing of education, it has also made great progress, thanks to the leadership of the gentlemen. Subsequently, Committee Member Feng Youlan delivered a thank-you speech, stating that the two wings alluded to by Mr. Ye originally meant one civil and one military. The ancient proverb said, "Civil can secure the country, and military can pacify the country," which is the meaning. The progress in the military aspect has already been made clear to everyone. As for the educational aspect, I am afraid that it cannot be as progressive as the military. Although this is affected by environmental constraints, those of us engaged in education cannot help but feel ashamed. In the future, under the leadership of our party, we should work harder to complete the mission of building the country. They dispersed happily at nine o'clock. Since the bills had not yet been fully discussed, the meeting was scheduled to continue the next day.

### St. John's University Alumni Association; Held a Parents' Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the St. John's University Alumni Association held its annual parents' meeting at the alma mater in Fanwangdu at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Many alumni in Shanghai attended with their wives and children, attracting more than 3,000 people, which was quite a grand occasion for a time. A temporary stage was set up on the lawn of the large playground, with the Chinese and American flags hanging on the left and right, and the St. John's school flag, which read "Learning without thinking is useless, and thinking without learning is dangerous," hanging in the middle. Various kinds of beautiful and elegant flowers were displayed in front of the stage. The meeting started at 3:00 PM. First, the alumni team and the faculty team played a small soccer game. After President Bu Fangji kicked off the ball, the game began. After 30 minutes, the game ended in a 1-1 tie. Next was the 50-yard race, which gathered hundreds of boys and girls brought by the alumni, who were divided into more than a dozen groups according to age and gender. Some of the youngest six-year-old boys and girls stood still in the middle of the field when the race started, not knowing what to do, which was the most laughable. Afterwards, more than a dozen Chinese and Western old professors also participated in the 50-yard race, which showed that the spirit of the old is still strong. Next was the needle threading competition. Dozens of men and women held the ends of the needle and thread and stood up. They were divided into two groups. The winner was the one who could run to the female side and thread the needle and return the fastest. This involved the use of hands, eyes, body, and steps, which won a lot of applause from the audience. The winners of the above two competitions were awarded prizes separately. Then they gathered in front of the stage for a meeting, and the rituals were performed as usual. First, the president of the association, Ou Weiguo, delivered a welcome speech to the alumni, followed by President Bu Fangji's speech. Then they sang the school song, followed by representatives of alumni from the classes of 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940 taking the stage one after another to give speeches and performances. There were also children dancing, and harmonica solos, Western music, and piano solos by alumni. Then Cai Hezhang delivered the closing speech, and finally, the students in the school performed a comical drama of "Wu Huang Testing Characters" to add to the fun. One person dressed up as a character testing master, and four other male and female students each picked a character, which combined to form the four characters "Yi Jian Sheng Cai" (making a fortune at first sight). They asked the character testing master to analyze them, intentionally making things difficult, which made people laugh. The performance lasted until evening, and the alumni dispersed happily.

### The Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Inspect; All National Colleges and Universities Above Junior College; Have Set Off on Different Routes

### The Ministry of Education Subsidizes; Dry Batteries for Various Provinces

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education pays special attention to radio education in various provinces, and provides subsidies based on investigations. For neighboring Sichuan, Kang, Qian, Xiang, and Hubei provinces, the Ministry will allocate and distribute existing goods from dry battery factories. For Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and Henan provinces, where batteries can be purchased locally, the Ministry will allocate cash for local purchases. For Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, where transportation is difficult and there are no battery factories, the Ministry will allocate additional funds to assist in setting up battery factories to meet needs. It has been notified separately. It is heard that the Ministry's principle for subsidizing batteries for remote and impoverished provinces is to assume that each radio needs three sets of dry batteries per year. The central government will subsidize one set, and the province and local governments will each bear one set. In addition, the Ministry-run battery factories sell at low prices, and educational institutions in each province that install radios can submit a request to the Ministry to introduce and prioritize purchases.

In the open events, Edward set a new Shanghai record in the 100-yard race, with a time of 10 seconds flat, breaking his own old record of 10.2 seconds. Achieving this result on the grass is the biggest harvest of the conference. In the two-mile team race, Wang Zhenglin of Hongkou Jia was the first to reach the finish line. Guan Youwen and Wan Jinsheng took second and third place, but unfortunately Wang Shiying fell behind, and the championship was won by Dong Selai. The second was Xifusi, and Hongkou Jia came in third.

Sun Zhichong won three championships in the Chinese police chief, deputy police chief, and secretary group. The stilt race in disguise was laughable. As a result, the Chinese police won first place. The equestrian performance was still a novelty in Shanghai and was twice as interesting. Xifusi's talents were average, and he dominated the competition.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers Still Dominate

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in exchange rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates was unusually quiet, resulting in minimal fluctuations. Due to Saturday's half-day trading, transactions were even more scarce. The trend was stable with a slight hardening, but news of the European war remained scarce in terms of positive developments. Buyers often lowered their bids, but sellers were willing to sell cheaply. In the morning, the Yokohama Specie Bank offered May futures of US dollars at 5.53125 yuan, but there were no takers. Speculators then released them at 5.5625 yuan, and the Yokohama Specie Bank had to sell at that price. At closing, the British pound remained unchanged at 4 pence 140625, and the US dollar closed at 5.5625 yuan, a hardening of 0.03125. The futures market showed no clear winners or losers.

Yokohama Specie Bank Sells

After the opening, the Yokohama Specie Bank wanted to offer May US dollars at 5.53125 yuan, but there were no buyers. Then, Chinese speculators sold cheaply at 5.5625 yuan, and American banks were willing to absorb them. The Yokohama Specie Bank then sold to American banks at the same price. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was revealed to have increased slightly by 3.75%. After this, the market was very quiet. Until the noon close, transactions were rare. As a result, the British pound closed at 4 pence 140625, the US dollar at 5.5625 yuan. This month's British pound was the same price as the spot price, and the US dollar was 5.53125 yuan.

### Supply and Demand for Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market was very stable, with both foreign exchange and the gold market being very calm, so foreign currencies also showed little change. The supply of British and American gold pounds was relatively strong, and the market price fell by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes were balanced, and the market price was stable. The US dollar note only fluctuated by a few cents, eventually reaching 17.85 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong notes was slightly available, falling by only one cent. The demand for Philippine notes was not high, falling by one cent. The supply of Japanese gold notes was initially smooth, and the market price fell. In the afternoon, there was a sudden demand, and the market price returned to flat.

It stabilized at noon and remained around 127 yuan in the afternoon, a rise of seven yuan. The Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was listed at 0.7 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, a flattening.

### Speculative Interest Wanes: Gold Market Peaceful

Yesterday's cash gold black market was peaceful, a rare sight in the recent gold market. The reason was that foreign exchange was stable and flat, and operators' interest waned. Large players watched the development of the environment and then determined their buying and selling plans. The day began with 5,800 yuan in the morning, 15 yuan lower than the previous day. Although it soon rose by five yuan, the money exchange industry suddenly came to sell, and the price was pushed down to 5,765 yuan due to the difficulty in finding buyers. Later, thanks to the considerable absorption by securities firms, it rebounded to 5,800 yuan, but the result was only 5,786 yuan, a decrease of 29 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday, and there were few transactions in the half-day, around 1,300 taels. Jewelry gold was initially flat, then listed down by 10 yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat.

Gold Falls by 29 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, the exchange market for each bar (10 taels) was slightly longer, and people were tired. It immediately fell by 15 yuan after opening. A gold shop issued 10 taels to a securities firm for 5,800 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank absorbed slightly, rising back by five yuan. Twenty taels were entered into a jewelry store for 5,805 yuan. Due to the continuous issuance from the money exchange industry, but the lack of buyers at that time, it fell again by 40 yuan. The money exchange sold 10 taels to a bank for 5,765 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange industry turned from selling to buying, and other sellers stopped selling to wait and see. The price gradually turned upward, and then relied on a securities firm to absorb it frequently, rebounding to the 5,800 yuan mark. Securities firms entered a total of 30 taels into jewelry stores for 5,800 yuan. After this, because buyers stopped their activities, and banks came to sell slightly, it went down again. A money exchange industry entered 20 taels of gold into a gold shop for 5,786 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 29 yuan compared to the previous day. The up and down range for the half-day was 40 yuan. The selling price of cash gold in the gold shop was several yuan higher than the smelting cost, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold抵was 50 yuan more than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed Down by 10 Yuan

The initial price of jewelry gold for each tael was still 600 yuan by Datong Bank. Until noon, it was listed down by 10 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, Datong Bank changed the listing to 590 yuan. The new bank was the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Stockpiles Overflow - Most of the Market is Pessimistic

The rice market was tired first and then tight yesterday. The late-night market trend turned sluggish, and people's hearts were shaken. The morning opening heard the news of gold falling and exchange rates loosening, which made people feel even more exhausted. Everyone tried to sell. Those who made a profit had already come out first, and the original root traders sold lightly later, and it was immediately seen to be sluggish. The general guests saw the weakness of the trend, and they were also panicked and did not dare to enter suddenly. Although the market price fell again and again, the sales field felt stagnant. By the middle of the market, the price of each commodity had fallen close to yuan. If No. 1 Chen Saigon only sold for 51 yuan, No. 2 for 48.56 yuan, fire-ground for 49.23 yuan, No. 2 Siam and Small Grain for 48.2 yuan. At this point, it was barely able to stand, and the color of hesitation appeared all the way. It often fluctuated up and down by 2 or 3 yuan. Until near noon, the gold price rose again, attracting customers from the mainland, Ningbo, and Shaoxing to purchase at a low price, and floating hoarders absorbed it, and then the shouts began to rise, the price rose again, and the original position was restored, showing a situation of no glory or disgrace.

The spot price of foreign rice generally showed a softening trend yesterday. Saigon small-ground, Min Party, and fire grain all saw a reduction of 3 to 5 yuan. It was still difficult to cheer up in the afternoon. The stockpiles in the market were abundant, and the actual sales were flat. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, all households in the countryside lacked a good appetite. Yinghua Company's original package of No. 1 Saigon, which was reported to be imported, also only opened at 59 yuan. Only those that can be reported for re-export are rare in the market. Yesterday, Xiamen, Shantou, and other gangs searched hard. There were 50 tons that were raised to 65 yuan and traded. The appetite for inland shipments has weakened, and a total of more than 5,000 bags have been traded.

Also, it was reported that another 2,574 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, which were loaded from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Qingyuan round.

Corn is constantly being transported north. Today, there are another 700 bags that will be transported to Yantai by the Nanning round. It is said that there are still 10,000 bags waiting to be transported to North China. (Grandfather)

Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was limited yesterday, only 1,000 to 2,000 bags, the market was small and smooth, echoing each other, whether it was the official market inside the venue or the black market transaction outside the venue.

### The Issue of Damaged Banknotes

— Chen Xinkui

Recently, several major banks have refused to accept damaged banknotes unless they undergo a special procedure, such as recording the serial numbers and preparing a list, before they can be accepted at a designated location. This practice was initially implemented between banks and large commercial firms with frequent transactions. Later, some stores, finding it difficult to deposit money into banks, also restricted the acceptance of damaged banknotes in their retail businesses. Recently, even post offices have politely refused damaged banknotes.

It is said that the banks' original intention was "deliberately damaging banknotes to avoid exchange." What is considered deliberate damage? Any brand-new banknote that is intentionally torn into two, three, or four pieces, and then glued together with paper, regardless of whether the joints are close and secure, is considered deliberate damage. However, the definition of "deliberate" is quite difficult to clarify. If someone maliciously tears off a corner of a new banknote, it is of course "deliberate." But if someone accidentally burns a hole in a banknote with a cigarette, it is clearly unintentional from an objective point of view. However, from a subjective point of view, whoever burns the hole is responsible. Unintentional must also be considered "deliberate." Moreover, newly glued banknotes are not generally used, so old banknotes that have been patched up are naturally even less usable. In addition, the scope of "damage" also varies. Tearing a banknote in half is "damage," but is it not also "damage" to have frayed edges or a corner torn off? The meaning of "deliberate" is ambiguous, and the degree of "damage" is uncertain. The recipient's judgment of damaged banknotes lacks a standard. For the sake of caution, they have to refuse any banknote with even the slightest damage. In this way, "caution" becomes "nitpicking." The result of "nitpicking" is that the scope of circulation of old and damaged banknotes is becoming narrower and narrower. People who hold old and damaged banknotes feel particularly inconvenient. Especially when there is only one damaged banknote left in their pocket, and the goods have already been purchased, or the dim sum has already been eaten, they are suddenly rejected at the checkout counter. The embarrassment and annoyance at that time are indeed unbearable, so verbal arguments and conflicts are often unavoidable.

Banks refusing to accept damaged banknotes has considerable grounds and reasons: First, since damaged banknotes already have designated exchange locations, the parts that perform other functions have reasons to refuse damaged banknotes to save time. Second, the cost of printing banknotes is quite high. For example, a single-yuan banknote used to cost about ten cents when prices were cheap. Now that everything is expensive, the cost of banknote paper, printing, and other expenses has also increased several times. Imagine a perfectly good new banknote that could originally be used for at least 20 years is suddenly intentionally damaged, greatly shortening its durable life. Wouldn't the bank issuing the banknote suffer a great loss? To warn those who do not know how to cherish public property, is it not very appropriate to refuse to exchange intentionally damaged banknotes?

Probably due to a lack of knowledge and disregard for public morality, many people use banknotes without any care at all: some people fold banknotes into blocks like dried tofu, some people roll banknotes into cigarette rolls, some people squeeze banknotes into wads of waste paper, some people grab the large and small banknotes they get back and stuff them into their pockets, making a complete mess. In addition, zealous believers add "Believe in Jesus Quickly" stamps to the edges of banknotes, speculators add slogans for "Frostbite Ointment" in the blank spaces, accounting clerks stamp the name and logo of their shops on the watermark, and rambling poets inscribe beautiful lines like "When Will You Return?" on the surface of banknotes. Future bank magnates add their private signatures and seals next to the original signature in a crooked and slanted fashion. In short, a very complete banknote is messed up and scribbled on by many frivolous people, intentionally or unintentionally, leaving it battered and scarred beyond recognition. It's really terrible.

Things in the world are often unfair. The troublemakers are often not the ones who suffer, but a different kind of people suffer. There is another kind of people who not only do not suffer but can also benefit from others' trouble. For example, people who intentionally damage banknotes have certainly already spent the damaged banknotes. Those who receive the damaged banknotes are often well-meaning gentlemen who disdain to quibble over every penny. Those who receive unexpected benefits are a group of "specialists in collecting damaged banknotes with special discounts on fares" tobacconists. Currently, the amount of floating capital in Shanghai and its surrounding areas is said to be 300 billion yuan. Assuming that one-sixth of it is cash, and 5% of the cash is damaged banknotes, then there are already 25 million yuan worth of damaged banknotes. Further assuming that each yuan of damaged banknotes requires a discount of 5 cents when exchanged at tobacconists, then the discount loss for the well-meaning gentlemen would be a whopping 1.25 million yuan. Based on everyone's experience, the banknotes that come in and out daily are mostly half-new banknotes, followed by damaged banknotes, and the fewest are brand-new banknotes. Since everyone has been strictly checking banknotes, the gap left by damaged banknotes has not been filled for a while, resulting in a shortage of chips in the market, especially the lack of single-yuan banknotes. It is said that the exchange rate for every 1,000 single-yuan banknotes has risen by more than 2 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the damaged yuan banknotes circulating in the Shanghai area must quickly be beyond 25 million yuan. No wonder the red-letter signs of tobacconists collecting damaged banknotes are like the "Seasonal Spring Pancakes" signs of New Year's cake stalls, and more and more people are hanging them up.

Among the damaged banknotes that are collected by banks, there must be many banknotes that can still be used. When the market needs chips in the future, will these damaged banknotes that are still usable be re-issued? Also, since the people who currently hold damaged banknotes are mostly innocent well-meaning gentlemen, can the bank's method of collecting damaged banknotes be improved somewhat, or can the locations for collecting damaged banknotes be increased and made more widespread, so that innocent people can reduce a bit of unexpected loss and pain?

### Difficult Southern Shipping: Limited Flour Transactions

The flour market trade is quiet. Northern flour sales have been quiet for a long time, and Southern port sales face transportation difficulties, hindering completion of previous orders. New deals are carefully watched. A limited number of batch deals are relied upon. Dealers from the mainland moved to purchase Wuxi flour, with Sunfeng, Shanlu, and Shuangshi brands shipped in volume. Reports claim prices have risen at the source, with limited remaining stock available for shipment to Shanghai, creating exclusivity. Selling prices are close to factory prices, instilling fear in importers, leading to a sustained stalemate. Recycled flour from old mills is also in a stalemate. Market breathing will depend on the new wheat harvest. 6,500 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 26th.

### Oilcakes: Controlling the Oil Market, Rising After a Fall

Recently, the bean oil market has been very quiet due to extremely sluggish sales in all markets and a continuous stream of sources, resulting in overflowing stockpiles (approximately 8,000 barrels of barrel oil and 7,000 pieces of basket oil). The overall situation is stagnant, relying solely on manipulators to forcibly support it. However, part of the Dalian Oil Company cooperative had different ideas. The market suddenly reversed yesterday, with Dalian oil implementing a price cut. The morning closing price was 5 yuan lower than the previous day at 85 yuan. In the afternoon, the company held an emergency meeting to implement forced measures. The market immediately returned to its original price of 90 yuan, announcing a transaction volume of 200 barrels. Others only opened 130 pieces of Yanzhi oil at the original price of 62 yuan.

Twenty-six days will transport 23 bags of Jiu Bai beans to Xianggang Port and 320 cans of tea oil and 2,993 cans of crude oil to Xianggang Port on the same day.

### Yarn and Cotton: Current Yarn Sales in Guangdong Are Still Good

The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation is softening due to the intensity of the European war, which has made people tired. However, the current yarn sales market is still relatively strong, with sporadic purchases from Hong Kong continuing unabated, so the downward trend can be reversed considerably.

The morning opening of the current yarn was still peaceful. Due to the continued unremitting demand for Double Horse from Hong Kong, popularity was stable. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,295 yuan, lower than the previous day's price. It was rumored that foreign exchange and gold prices were flat, and there were many floating profits, so the market situation tended to decline, falling to 2,210 yuan. After the price was low, it triggered short covering, gradually rising back. The result was a closing price of 1,230 yuan. The statistics for half-day transactions totaled 1,835 bales. The market for Double Horse fell by 50 yuan. Today, 557 pieces of cotton yarn will be transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Yunnan 330, Hong Kong 905

Same Industry 560, Statistics 1,835

Local cotton transactions were particularly rare. Business was even quieter at the end of the month. There were only two transactions among the same industry: Oumula flower at 205 yuan for 100 pieces and La flower at 206 yuan for 100 pieces, both warehouse transactions.

The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, showed a lively market situation from the beginning of the morning. Later, due to the purchase by the public and the short covering of some, the closing market price rose by more than 30 pounds compared to the previous day. The situation in India was very average. Yesterday, including the forecast, there was not much change.

The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was more active. However, transactions between some manufacturers and the same industry were few. The Tianjin gang was very interested in purchasing, but due to tight credit, they could only stand by. However, the general opinion is that after the end of the month, credit may loosen, and the Tianjin gang will become more active. The following is the cotton market yesterday, converted at a rate of 5.5 yuan for the US dollar, the futures delivery price to the factory:

### Piece Goods: Cloth Market Weak, Buyers Hesitant

Due to the settlement of many futures contracts this month, the cloth market saw increased selling pressure, causing prices to decline. Sellers' asking prices varied greatly, leading to a state of confusion. Market sentiment was weak, and buyers hesitated, resulting in sluggish sales. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth continued to fall by 2.5 to 5 cents per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 5 cents. Local dealers transacted over 200 deals. Sales were uniformly slow at both retail stores and for out-of-town customers. With continuous price declines, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude to avoid losses, only purchasing small quantities of urgently needed goods. On the 26th, 300 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern cloth prices fell initially and then rose. The morning opening saw continued pressure as the new futures contracts for this month were due for settlement on the 27th, and yesterday was the last day. Bulls reluctantly liquidated their positions, leading to a sharp decline. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to $37.25, and "Four Gentlemen" woolen serge fell below the one-dollar mark, with the lowest price at 99 cents per yard. Later, due to stable exchange rates and firm cash positions, buyers from Qinhuangdao and Tianjin showed strong interest. Local dealers' sentiment turned bullish, and the market gradually stabilized with tighter bidding. The after-market saw "Dragon Head" fine cloth trading at $39.50, and woolen serge at $1.0325.

### Securities: Domestic Bond Market Quiet

The securities market yesterday was relatively firm. Trading volume was about 200,000 in the morning, but only 60,000 in the afternoon, a negligible amount, indicating a generally stagnant market. Significant changes in the environment were brewing, and gold and foreign exchange showed extreme dullness. However, a drastic change is likely not far off and should not be ignored. In the morning trading, Tongyu Agency No. 4 sold Class A shares, which were bought by Datong. Hu Heji Agency sold Class B shares, which were bought by Zhenkang. The rest were sporadic transactions, with intermittent buying and selling. The afternoon was extremely quiet. Only Tiansheng bought 20,000 Class E shares and No. 7 bought 25,000 Class C shares. The rest saw only 15,000 in scattered transactions. Prices were firmer in the afternoon. Class B shares were unchanged, while others rose slightly by one or two cents. The total trading volume was approximately $300,000. A summary table is provided below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Dada Steamship Company were traded at a price of $71.

London, 24th (Friday) – The quoted prices for Chinese external debt remain stable with no changes in the prices of various bonds.

London, 24th (Friday) – The quoted prices for British Far East company stocks show that HSBC shares continue to rise. Shares registered in the UK rose by £2.5 to £82.5, and shares registered in Hong Kong rose by £1.5 to £84. The rest showed minor fluctuations.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Tight, Red Sugar Weak

Yesterday's sugar market saw mixed movements. The guild's market price showed more entries for spot 24 coarse white sugar, which was slightly tighter. Foreign warehouse goods were at $66 to $65.5, up by 5 cents. Transshipment goods arriving on June 1st were at $53.5 to $53.3, and warehouse receipts for goods arriving on May 28th were at $52.5 to $52.3. Taikoo White B was still at $4.81. Red sugar was weak, with H-marked carmine at approximately $55 and Dutch red sugar at approximately $58, both at average prices. It was heard that the National Sugar refinery was offering Fang Diao Qing at $62, with some sales. The quotation board remained inactive, and demand was very weak. Father Sugar arrived from Hong Kong with 895 bags yesterday.

### Coal: Hongji Small Coal, Ample Spot Supply

Hongji No. 1 small coal was in short supply last week, and sales were brisk. Dealers' prices had risen as high as $238 per ton, exceeding the price of lump coal. Recently, as hoarders released large quantities, spot supply suddenly became ample, and prices fell. More than 100 tons were traded on the market yesterday at a price of around $210. The engine room transported the coal themselves, with extra charges for handling.

### Dried Goods: Longan Meat Shortage Eases

Recently, shipments of dried longan meat from Xiamen, Tong'an, Guangdong, and Hong Kong have been scarce, resulting in a dwindling market supply. Shortages have become more pronounced, and market prices have risen considerably. Yesterday's market price for sun-dried meat ranged from $180 down to $160 to $120, depending on quality.

### Fragrant Sunflower Seeds Fall by $5

The previous high price for Tianjin fragrant sunflower seeds had reached $41. Recently, due to increased arrivals, prices have fallen back. It is heard that Tianjin traders released 200 bags at a price of $36, a drop of $5.

### Medicinal Materials: Continued Arrival of Tangerine Peel

Previously, tangerine peel was scarce, and demand was increasing, so prices had risen by one or two dollars. It has been discovered that the Taikoo Company's Guangdong-bound ship from Xiamen has continued to arrive with dozens more pieces, and it can be shipped within a few days. The market appears to be slightly loosening.

### Hardware: Tinplate, Water Bottle Factories Make Limited Purchases

The broadest sales for tinplate come from local water bottle factories, followed by Tianjin merchants and tin printing and can manufacturing factories. However, since the recent sharp drop in foreign exchange rates and the surge in prices, sales have been stagnant, and the market has been quiet. Yesterday, local water bottle factories suddenly showed interest, purchasing about one to two hundred boxes. Currently, local inventories are extremely low, and no new goods have arrived, so sellers have had to maintain firm prices. Huishi goods are selling for $170 per box, and standard 20-inch and 28-inch sheets are selling for $200 per box of 112 sheets.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Takes Necessary Measures: No Doubt About Security in the Concessions

#### Elimination of Crime and Strengthening of Defense Proceed Simultaneously
#### British and American Troops Implement Close Cooperation

Although the current European war situation is extremely tense, the military authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai have earnestly expressed their determination to maintain the status quo in this international market. Therefore, there are unlikely to be any changes in the situation in Shanghai. However, due to the tense situation, all relevant parties are paying close attention to security within the concessions. In addition to the troops stationed in Shanghai by the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries doing their best to assist the concession authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to rapidly increase the strength of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and strengthen concession defenses. In addition, the Council held a meeting on the 15th of this month, at which a comprehensive discussion was held, and a report was submitted to the relevant authorities. Every effort will be made to improve the current situation and maintain security. It is rumored that the consular officials believe that the increase in criminal cases is due to the existence of "badlands." Therefore, they plan to make every effort to expel secret societies from the "badlands." However, according to reporters' investigations, this matter is not progressing smoothly due to the unique views of Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura. The details are as follows:

### Elimination of Crime in the Badlands: Japanese Consul Miura Has Ulterior Motives

According to foreign sources, Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura's reasons for opposing the plan are twofold: (1) Interference by the Consular Body in activities in the extra-settlement areas is an overstepping of authority; and (2) There are more effective methods than expelling secret societies. Miura's so-called "more effective methods" refer to the rapid formation of strong and effective "special police" in the extra-settlement road areas. Miura believes that modern crime can be reduced by police officers constantly following and monitoring criminals. Therefore, he has repeatedly suggested that the organization of "special police" is now urgent, as this organization will be more effective than the existing police in the extra-settlement road areas.

### Repeated Negotiations Have Been Unfruitful

According to neutral reports, since the signing of the "Police Agreement" for extra-settlement road construction, the Japanese unwillingness to give up their gambling tax has been a major obstacle to the realization of the "special police." The Japanese have repeatedly obstructed the final decision. Moreover, since Shanghai Municipal Police Commissioner Bowen made a "final suggestion" to the head of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Ying, he has not yet received a response from the puppet government. Therefore, the Consular Body requested the assistance of Japanese Consul Miura to expel special agents from western Shanghai. The Consular Body sent representatives to the Japanese intelligence agency several times last month to negotiate, but to no avail.

### All Gambling Dens to Be Eliminated Next Month

According to reliable sources obtained yesterday morning, the eleven gambling dens currently operating in western Shanghai will all be closed in early June. It is said that the authorities have ordered the gambling dens to close several times in the past two months, but this has never been realized. The reason why the gambling dens will be closed again is that the "special police" in the extra-settlement road area are expected to be established next month. In the middle of last month, there were fourteen gambling dens in western Shanghai. Three announced their closure at the beginning of this month, so there are currently only eleven gambling dens.

### Strengthening the Strength of the Volunteer Corps: Cooperation Between Defense Forces of Various Countries

The current situation in the International Settlement is very different from normal. The borders of all areas in the International Settlement, including Areas B, C, and D, are defended by troops stationed by the various countries in Shanghai. The area along the Bund in Area A is regularly defended by members of the White Russian detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. In addition to assisting the Shanghai Municipal Police to maintain security within the settlement, the corps also assists the British, American, and other military commanders stationed in Shanghai upon request. Therefore, the corps is in close cooperation with the defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Municipal Police.

### Vacancies in the British Detachment Need to Be Filled Urgently

There are still vacancies in the British Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. As of recently, Company A has only 80 men, Company B has 100 men, the cavalry has 70 men, the armored car detachment has 90 men, the engineering detachment has 50 men, the air defense detachment has 60 men, and the Scottish Company has 70 men. All are insufficient, and there are many vacancies, which need to be filled urgently. After the British Consulate-General issued a notice on the 20th of this month, advising its nationals to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, many British nationals have joined. However, the number of people who have joined has not yet been able to fill the vacancies.

### Norwegian Nationals Enthusiastically Join

The Jewish Detachment has increased rapidly. With the large-scale arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai, there are many who have joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The detachment also had many vacancies. Recently, it has increased to 115 men, only five short of the original quota. Company C originally had only 20 men left. Since the outbreak of the European war, nationals of Nordic countries such as Norway and Sweden have enthusiastically joined the company. It has recently increased by 40 men, reaching approximately 60 men. In addition, the White Russian mercenary detachment has recently been filled to its full strength of 360 men.

### Ample Military Supplies, Complete Equipment

According to recent information, the American Detachment is lacking. The American infantry has 80 men, the cavalry has 70 men, the machine gun detachment has 60 men, and the Philippine detachment has 80 men. The number of vacancies is the highest of all the detachments. The Chinese Detachment has 160 infantrymen and 120 interpreters, all of whom are at full strength. As for the military supplies of the Volunteer Corps, they are extremely ample. The armored cars have been improved, the Lewis machine guns have been fitted with new barrels, and all military equipment is very satisfactory. However, due to funding issues, it is difficult to mass-produce uniforms for the time being.

### Silk Factories in the Concessions Shut Down: Spring Cocoons on the Market Under Control

Silk reeling factories in the Shanghai concession area have been shut down, as the acquisition of cocoons and transportation to Shanghai have been controlled by the "Central China Company." Consequently, all twenty-odd factories, including foreign-owned ones, will not be acquiring cocoons this year. At the same time, due to the lack of raw materials, they have almost all ceased operations. The original plan to start operations after the spring cocoons entered the market is now impossible to implement. It has been learned that spring cocoons have entered the market in Hangzhou and other occupied areas. However, the "Central China Company" monopolizes everything, suppressing prices and forcing purchases. Silkworm farmers are forced to sell the cocoons to the "Central China Company" out of environmental pressure. It is said that the price of local cocoons ranges from $160 to $200 per 100 catties. If calculated based on the price of silk, it should be over $250. It is also heard that silkworm farmers along the Qiantang River are trying to transport cocoons to Zhejiang Province for sale, as the price of cocoons in eastern Zhejiang is higher than that offered by the "Central China Company."

### News of the Withdrawal of US Marines: Japanese Acknowledge Error

#### Colonel Baker Formally Denies Report Yesterday
#### US Troops Stationed in Tianjin and Beiping Have Not Withdrawn Either

The China Press reports that a Japanese Navy spokesman replied to a foreign journalist yesterday (the 24th) that he was unaware of the report that the US Marines stationed in Shanghai would withdraw. However, he had received notification that there were some errors in the report.

The report was published on Friday in the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" in a prominent position, stating that the US military's withdrawal from Shanghai was decided at a recent meeting in Manila, and that the US Marines stationed in Beiping and Tianjin had withdrawn two years ago. It has been found that the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun published this absurd rumor, which has been formally denied by US Marine Corps Commander Colonel Baker. The truth has been revealed. Furthermore, the claim by the Japanese newspaper that the US Navy stationed in Tianjin and Beiping had withdrawn is also false. The US naval authorities in Shanghai also denied it yesterday. According to a diplomatic source, we can often recall the notes from the US government to the Japanese government and the declarations of US Secretary of State Hull, which have solemnly stated that they cannot recognize Japan's unilateral actions in the Far East and their attempt to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Therefore, the United States will never withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai to change the status quo and allow the aggressors to run rampant.

### National Defense Bonds: Repayment of Principal and Interest

#### Over 16 Million in Principal and Interest
#### Three-Year Deadline for Forfeiture

Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi announced that the lottery for the first repayment of the principal of the National Defense Bonds of 1938 was held in Shanghai on April 19, 1940. The winning numbers are No. 035, No. 160, No. 247, and No. 369, for a total of four numbers. All holders of these bonds whose last three digits of the bond number match the numbers listed above are the winning bonds. The total value is 2 million national currency, including 80 ten-thousand-yuan bonds, 120 five-thousand-yuan bonds, 520 one-thousand-yuan bonds, 720 one-hundred-yuan bonds, and 800 ten-yuan bonds. In addition, the second installment of interest on these bonds, totaling 14.94 million national currency, will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized banks in various locations starting on April 30, 1940. The foreign portion will be drawn by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong. These winning bonds and matured interest coupons must be claimed within three years from the date of commencement of payment, after which they will be forfeited and no longer paid. The 58 interest coupons attached to the winning bonds, from the third installment to the sixtieth installment, should be returned to the managing bank when collecting the principal. If there are any missing coupons, the amount will be deducted from the principal to be paid. This announcement is hereby made.

### French Municipal Council Approves Widening of Avenue de la Gare

In order to maintain traffic convenience due to the numerous wharves and congested freight traffic on the Bund of the French Concession, the French Concession Police Department planned to widen the roads. After submitting the proposal to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council for review and approval, it was decided to widen the road between Rue du Nouveau Canal and Rue du Petit Pont to 24.38 meters (80 feet). This decision will be implemented whenever the houses on both sides of the road are renovated.

### Establishment of the 5th Security Column

#### Appointment of Ding Yuntao as Commander
#### Gu Fusheng's Unit Supplements a Battalion of Artillery
#### Advance Units Have Already Entered Huangdu

Last September, Leng Xin, commander of the Second Guerrilla Zone of the Third War Area, appointed Mr. Ding Yuntao as the director for reorganizing scattered forces in Jiangnan. Mr. Ding, a scholar, accepted the difficult task and set up a headquarters in (illegible), with sufficient personnel, weapons, and ammunition. He has now been formally appointed as the commander of the 5th Jiangnan Security Column, and he was officially sworn in on April 1st. It has now been organized into three regiments, led by Ren Tianshi, Xu Wenlong, and Yang Zhen. All the subordinates are young and promising, sympathizing with merchants and civilians, and have gained the love of the local people. Recently, Jiangsu Province sent officials to support them officially. They are lurking in the Jiangnan area, waiting for orders to attack. In the near future, there will be good news.

### Strength of Gu's Unit

A friend from Huangdu in Shanghai mentioned that Gu Fusheng's guerrilla unit has now been replenished and that the New Fourth Army has allocated a battalion of artillery, a company of machine guns, and a large infantry unit since withdrawing from the Qingpu-Shanghai Road. The spearhead unit arrived in Huangdu the day before yesterday. The Japanese and puppet troops fled at the news.

### Turmoil in Hangzhou

The Japanese arsenal in Hangzhou was almost destroyed by Chinese guerrillas a few days ago. Because the construction of the bombs was not secret, it was discovered by the Japanese military police, who were able to avoid disaster. Afterwards, the Japanese army became extremely terrified and searched everywhere for the guerrillas, but found nothing. They forcibly accused Lu Huda and Guo Shiping of being suspects and arrested them. Their fate is unknown.

### Shanghai Merchants Reject the So-Called "Exchange Factories"

#### Nominal Recovery but No Actual Restructuring
#### Shanghai Merchants Understand the Big Picture and Ignore It

Since the emergence of the Nanjing "organization," and for the sake of its early implementation of the "economic cooperation" item, a "Factory Acceptance Committee" has been organized to publicize the return of factories operated by Chinese merchants that were occupied by the Japanese. The factories of Shanghai merchants located in Yangshupu, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, and the western suburbs have been occupied since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army. Most of the larger factories with complete equipment have been reopened by Japanese merchants. The puppet government wants to take over these factories, which are said to include those in the occupied areas of North and Central China, but in fact, they are focused on Shanghai. Therefore, they will soon set up a so-called "office" in Shanghai to handle the "registration" and "investigation" of various manufacturers. However, the manufacturers have already seen through this attempt and its true intentions and have decided not to be deceived.

The puppet government's so-called "acceptance" is actually the Japanese returning the occupied factories to the acceptance agency under certain conditions. Then, the owners of the factories are notified to "register" and must wait for "investigation." By the time the various procedures are completed, the cost may even exceed the value of the entire factory's assets. Even if "economic cooperation" and "mutual cooperation" are implemented, it is seemingly a nominal recovery but no actual restructuring. This would not only violate the recent strict orders from the Ministry of Economic Affairs warning manufacturers, but also ruin the factory's life. Unless they have ulterior motives, they would not want to take over the factories in the current environment. It is evident that all the occupied manufacturers in Shanghai understand the big picture. They do not care about their personal gains and losses and would rather take risks.

### Report of 3,000 Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai Denied by Police

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that there were rumors that 3,000 Jewish refugees would come to Shanghai at the end of this month and that they all had landing permits issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The police have denied this. They claim that the Council has never issued so many permits and that there are no ships arriving next week, so how could 3,000 refugees come to Shanghai?

### Germany Not Interested in the Dutch East Indies Issue: Japan Disappointed, Distorts Explanation

Yesterday, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published an article by Mr. Woodhead speculating whether Japan would take action in the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Woodhead said that the Japanese government felt extremely anxious about the German authorities' delay in responding after proposing to maintain the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. As a result, on the 22nd of this month, the German government replied that Germany was not interested in the Dutch East Indies issue. The Kokumin Shimbun, sponsored by the Japanese military, interpreted this reply as a "blank check," indicating that Germany was ignoring the interests of the future status of the Dutch East Indies. However, others interpreted the German side as urging Japan to abandon its neutral stance. According to Mr. Woodhead's opinion, it remains to be seen whether Japan will sincerely keep its promises to the United States and other relevant countries. Some Japanese newspapers believe that Japan is currently mired in the quagmire of the war in China and should not take any more risks. At the same time, they advocate ending the war in China as soon as possible to regain their freedom and do as they please. However, as things stand, Japan's attempt to end the war in China is difficult to achieve.

### Italian Passenger Ships Ordered to Suspend Service: Cargo Ships Continue to Operate Normally

#### Two Cargo Ships Carry Cargoes as Usual Each Month
#### Whether the Conte Verde Will Carry Passengers Is Undecided

Italian passenger ships plying the Europe-Far East routes have been ordered to suspend service amidst the tightening of the European war and the attention being paid to Italy's position on the war. A reporter from the New Life News Agency inquired with the Italian shipping company about this matter. According to the company's staff, the Italian passenger ships have been ordered to suspend service, and the company has received notification. Although the reason for the suspension was not stated, it is undoubtedly affected by the European war. The suspension only applies to fast passenger ships, which mainly carry passengers and mail. After the suspension, passenger transport will be stopped. As for cargo transport, there are many cargo ships (commonly known as "tramp steamers") that regularly travel between Italy and the Far East. On average, at least two ships sail to China each month, each with a cargo capacity of 5,000 tons. These ships have no fixed routes and travel to various ports depending on cargo needs. Small docks along the route are also called at. These Italian ships are still operating normally, so cargo transport between Europe and the Far East will continue as usual. The fast passenger ships Conte Verde and Conte Rosso are the only two ships affected. The Conte Rosso has ceased sailing to the Far East. The Conte Verde is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of next month. As the ship still needs to return to Italy, it will carry passengers as usual. However, the company cannot confirm whether it will be ordered to stop carrying passengers. If this happens, the tickets that have already been sold will be refunded accordingly. As for whether mail to Europe can be transported by cargo ships, this is still under negotiation.

### Abe's Economic Advisor Aoki Arrives in Shanghai

Aoki Kazuo, the former Minister of Finance and economic advisor to the Japanese "Envoy" Abe Nobuyuki, returned to Japan earlier to make contact. It is reported that he arrived in Shanghai from Japan last night on the Taiyo Maru and is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to report to Abe. The purpose of Aoki's trip is unknown, but he attended a meeting held by the Japanese "Asia Development Board" on the 8th to discuss the legal tender issue, indicating that he is an envoy of economic aggression.

### American Overseas Trade Week: Grand Conclusion Yesterday; American Chamber of Commerce Hosts Banquet for Admiral Hepburn and Others; Kept Simple Due to Current Situation; Admiral Hepburn's Speech

American Overseas Trade Week concluded yesterday. Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, Captain Baker, Commander of the Fourth Naval District in Shanghai, Colonel Moulay, Chief of Staff, Mr. Badeck, Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Grant, Commercial Attaché in China, Mr. Hymel, Judge of the US Court for China, and Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce, along with over two hundred others, were hosted at a banquet on the 24th by the American Chamber of Commerce at the American Club to mark the end of the "Sixth Foreign Trade Commemoration."  In previous years, the American Overseas Trade Commemoration Week had grand ceremonies, even with people taking the opportunity to fly around Shanghai's airspace and distribute colored leaflets.  In recent years, due to the current situation, extravagance has been avoided.  The beginning of American trade with China dates back to 1785.

Sino-American Relations

A brief history of US-China trade is as follows: In 1785, the "Empress of China" became the first American ship to complete a trading mission to Guangzhou and return to New York. In 1786, the US government appointed the first American Consul to China (stationed as Consul General in Guangzhou). In 1830, American missionaries began arriving in China. In 1840, the Pan-American Era ship sailed to China. In 1843, the first American Ambassador arrived in China. In 1844, the United States began to establish

Trade Treaties

In 1852, US$180,000,000 in American gold, accumulated from 1784 to 1852, was shipped to China. In 1855, the Pan-American ship "Icali Puli" continued to sail in Chinese waters under the escort of an ironclad warship. In 1871, the Chinese Ministry of Education sent the first group of 120 students to study in the United States in four batches. In 1877, the American Russell & Company sold ships to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In 1898, the American flag began to fly over the Philippines. In 1899, American political commentators advocated for the

Open Door Policy

In 1905, the United States completed the Pacific undersea telegraph cable. In 1910, the Pacific States Chamber of Commerce also sent a commercial delegation to China. In that year, China not only traded with the United States alone, but also expanded to countries along the Pacific coast. In 1911, the United States took the lead in recognizing China as a republic. In 1914, the Panama Canal opened, shortening the distance from the Atlantic to China. In 1922, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened by the United States in Washington. In 1924, the American Dollar Steamship Company (now renamed American President Lines) completed its worldwide routes and established a branch office in China. In 1915, the

Boxer Indemnity

of US$12,500,000 was returned to China. (Note: After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, China paid the foreign powers a total of 450 million taels of silver in compensation.) In 1928, the United States was the first to recognize China's national tariff autonomy. In 1930, Sino-American telegraph communication was established. In 1934, US-China trade ranked first. In 1935, the United States approved the independence of the Philippines. On May 22, 1936, Sino-American shortwave radio completed two-way communication. On October 23 of the same year,

Sino-American Air Traffic

Pan American Clippers began transporting mail and passengers in Hong Kong, via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu to San Francisco. On April 27, 1937, Sino-American air service officially began. On May 19 of that year, Sino-American wireless telephone service officially commenced. In 1939, the Golden Gate International Exposition was held, and China was invited to participate. The newest shortwave machine W6XBF at US Naval Station Pearl Harbor was completed on February 18.

Hepburn's Speech

When the American Chamber of Commerce held a dinner for foreign trade, Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, delivered a speech entitled "Free Trade," pointing out the disadvantages of trade barriers, denouncing the disasters of military rule, extolling the benefits of equal trade, and expressing the US Navy's attitude of upholding justice. The words were sincere and earnest, translated as follows:

International Trade

is the supreme method for maintaining peace and mutual benefit between nations. I would like to quote a section from a book by former US Undersecretary of State Sayre (now the High Commissioner to the Philippines) to illustrate this. Sayre said, "The interdependence and mutual benefit between peoples is based on the vast and intricate network of international trade. If trade is freed from the barriers of heavy restrictions and allowed to remain free forever, the lives of all peoples will inevitably collapse, and the standard of living will be forced to decline. The magnitude of the harm will be inestimable. To this day, no major industrial nation can be economically independent. Therefore, economic self-sufficiency is merely a policy of regression and hindrance to cultural progress." The United States and other countries have established

International Relations

following this principle for many years. In accordance with the Trade Agreements Act, we will do our best to improve international trade, carefully consider the environment, and separately conclude agreements. Those who benefit are not only the United States itself. The United States acts for its own benefit, but shares the benefits with others. We and other countries obtain equal opportunities and mutually beneficial and fair treatment. Unfortunately, the world today is running counter to this. The matter is obvious and needs no detailed explanation. However, I cannot help but say that we deeply know that there is a kind of organized distortion theory that is trying to dominate the thoughts and beliefs of some people. This situation is

Extremely Dangerous

and makes the future bleak and uncertain. The tendency of military rule is extremely strong and expanding on the earth, and the opportunity for free trade is being squeezed and becoming narrower. The United States is a powerful country, and its military power, like other factors, is also at its peak, and its naval power is growing stronger and stronger. As a member of the Navy, I firmly believe that we will never use force lightly. If our country must use its force, then our war will never be for the purpose of treating other nations unfairly in war.

### Japanese Troops in Xiaoshan

Shipping circles have learned that Japanese troops in Xiaoshan City suddenly divided into eastern and southern routes starting on the 20th of this month. The objective of the eastern team seems to be harassing Ningbo and Shaoxing, while the southern troops plan to invade Zhuji. They were intercepted by Chinese troops at different locations. As of the 23rd, the Japanese troops had retreated to Xiaoshan and were trapped in the city, not venturing beyond its walls. The fighting on the south bank of the Qiantang River has once again become quiet. Furthermore, near Xiaoshan Port, a large grey Japanese warship was suddenly spotted on the morning of the 23rd, firing six shots towards the shore, causing shock among the residents.

### Sunday School Promotion Association Holds 20th Anniversary Celebration

The Shanghai Chinese Christian Sunday School Promotion Association has been established for twenty years, during which it has set up twenty-seven Sunday schools. After the August 13th Incident, it also added twelve temporary Sunday schools in various refugee camps. Later, as they were gradually disbanded, only two remain. The work spans the entire Shanghai area. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the association's founding. Today, starting at 4:00 PM, the association will hold its annual meeting at the Yu Qiaqing Road Moore Memorial Church. Starting at 7:00 PM, there will also be Thanksgiving services and other programs, as well as achievement exhibitions, speeches, and music.

### French Veterans in Shanghai Enthusiastically Pledge Loyalty to their Homeland; General Assembly Held the Night Before Last; French Ambassador and Consul General Attend

The French-language Shanghai Daily News reported that the French expatriate veterans' association in Shanghai held a special general assembly the night before last (the 24th) at the French Concession Police Headquarters to discuss association affairs. French Ambassador Cosme, Consul General Orin, and Garrison Commander Colonel Aisoudy, among others, were warmly received by the members.

President's Speech: Willing to Obey Orders

First, Mr. Aicar, President of the French Veterans' Association, delivered a welcome speech to French Ambassador Cosme, stating, "It is a great honor for this association to have the Ambassador present to guide our meeting. The Ambassador participated in the last World War for four years and received the Croix de Guerre for his military achievements. I do not wish that the last World War would not become the final war. Now, the members of this association are willing to obey the Ambassador's orders wholeheartedly. We have only one thought in our minds, and that is to defend our country. Although the members are gradually aging, injured, or hindered by their duties and cannot shed blood for the country again, they all follow the Ambassador's command and enthusiastically donate. Because of the high cost of airplanes, tanks, and cannons, we have already purchased 50,000 francs worth of military bonds to contribute our modest efforts. Each member will certainly make every effort to purchase them as well. The members of this association have an unwavering belief in the future of France."

Ambassador's Reply: Expresses Gratitude

French Ambassador Cosme then delivered a reply, briefly stating, "Today, I am deeply moved to meet with old friends who fought together on the battlefield twenty years ago. Thinking of the current situation of French youth fighting for civilization and against barbarism (applause), our minds are bound to be even more tense. France's current situation is indeed very serious, but it should be known that there have been environments in the past that were worse than today. Twenty years ago, the Germans were closer to Paris than they are today, but we eventually drove them back and won victory. I have no doubt about the outcome of the war. In the last World War, thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the French, we were able to defeat the enemy. This time, I believe that the government leaders will be able to save our France. I am very grateful for the willingness of each member to listen to my and the Consul General's, Colonel Aisoudy's, and others' orders. I can assure you that I will never abandon you and will do my best to protect your rights. I now shout 'Long live France' to show my respect for the country." After the speech, everyone stood up and shouted "Vive la France" three times, their emotions soaring and deeply moving.

Belgian Veterans Join

Later, President Aicar reported on the case of people requesting to join the French expatriate veterans' association as members, which was approved. The association's articles of association were also revised to allow Belgian members to enjoy the same rights as French members. Afterwards, Ambassador Cosme shook hands with each member to say goodbye.

### Young Female Factory Worker Dies Tragically from Illegal Abortion; Neck Shows Signs of Strangulation; Case Highly Suspicious; All Involved Parties Arrested and Awaiting Death

The Yulin Road Police Station received a report from the Quan'an Inn at No. 5, Lane 208, Yangshupu Road, at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday, stating that a young woman was found dead in room 36 of the inn. The police station immediately ordered Chinese Detective Zhang Yunhong and Western Detective Ross to investigate. They found the woman lying supine on the bed, the bedding and pillows stained with blood, her face swollen and purple, her body covered in blisters, and her neck showing

Signs of Strangulation

They called for an ambulance, and the body was sent to Hudong Hospital, where she was confirmed dead. It was then transferred to the Coroner's Office, and the Public Works Department's prison doctor, Hall, examined the body and found blood flowing from the deceased's mouth and nose, distinct marks of rope on her neck, a torn lower body, and the head of a child visible inside her vagina. It was determined that she had died from a poorly performed abortion. The fetus was estimated to be six to seven months old, its body covered in blisters, possibly caused by taking hot medicine. It was determined that she had died within the past twelve hours. The Chinese and Western detectives then

Began an Investigation

They learned that the deceased was named Peng Genhuo, 18 years old, from Shanghai. She worked as a factory worker at the China Soap Factory at No. 2310, Yangshupu Road, and lived with her mother, Peng Yang, at a small residence at No. 112, Glen Road. She was still unmarried. Last year, Peng suddenly fell in love with someone, and they had an illicit affair, resulting in pregnancy. By now, she was six months pregnant, and her abdomen was gradually swelling. Her mother, Peng Yang, only noticed something unusual about her daughter's abdomen on the 20th of this month. Under strict questioning, the

Secret was Revealed

Considering the matter of face, Peng Yang and her common-law husband's brother-in-law, Lu Delin (also known as Zhang Yilian), from Jiangbei, discussed a plan to get rid of the child. They entrusted an old midwife, Liu Huang (62 years old, from Jiangbei, living at No. 17, Lane 795, Pingliang Road), to perform the abortion, agreeing on a fee of 40 yuan, with 20 yuan paid in advance. On the 22nd of this month, Lu, under the name of Zhang Yilian, booked a room at the Quan'an Inn, room 36. Liu Huang performed the surgery, but unfortunately, due to her lack of skill, the fetus was stillborn, and Peng Genhuo died on the night of the 23rd. The detectives quickly apprehended Peng Yang, Lu Delin, and Liu Huang.

Arrested One After Another

Liu Huang had heard the news and fled to Wujiaochang, Xujiahui. Detectives from the French Concession Police Station were also involved and arrested her, bringing her back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges of abortion resulting in death under Articles 289 and 290 of the Criminal Code and requested a postponement to allow for an autopsy to clarify the truth. Judge Xiao Peishen briefly questioned the three defendants and ordered them to be detained pending a further hearing in seven days.

### German Cotton Cloth Store Owner Sells Opium; Convicted of Smoking

Ye Yuxi, Chief Chinese Detective of the Central Police Station's Narcotics Department, along with Detective Liu Zhaonian and Detective Zhao Baosheng, cracked down on a major opium trafficking operation on the 20th of this month at the Dechangni Cloth Store at No. 19, Lane 300, Chongqing Road. They discovered 132 taels of opium in a double-bottomed chest and wardrobe and quickly detained the owner of the Dechang Store, Zhu Zhizhang from Hangzhou, along with his wife, Zhu Wu, and their seals. They were taken to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen continued the hearing of this case in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants were represented by lawyer Wu Linkun. After a clear confession, Zhu Wu was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 300 yuan for smoking opium. If the imprisonment is commuted to a fine, it will be calculated at 3 yuan per day. Zhu Zhizhang was sentenced to five months in prison, and if the imprisonment is commuted to a fine, it will also be calculated at 3 yuan per day. The opium and other items were confiscated according to the list.

### Gambling on Pai Gow Leads to Murder

Feng Zhengde (40 years old) from Yangzhou, a barber living at No. 28, Tianfu Lane, Air Force Road, loved to gamble on Pai Gow. At 10:00 PM on the 24th, Feng went to the home of his fellow villager, Zhao Qifa, at No. 9, Lane 435, Bazili Road, to gamble on Pai Gow. Zhao was the banker. As a result, Feng Zhengde lost 5 jiao 6 fen. Due to a shortage of 6 fen, a quarrel broke out, with mutual insults. This was followed by a fight, and Zhao's brother-in-law, Wang Chengfa and Wang Chengru, seeing that Feng was strong and Zhao was no match for him, stepped forward to help, knocking Feng Zhengde to the ground and punching and kicking him. Feng's lower back was the most severely injured, and he was on the verge of death. Zhao Qifa, in a panic, took the opportunity to escape. Tang Guangfu, the Chinese detective in charge of the Hongkou Police Station, arrived after receiving the report and learned the cause of the trouble. He sent the injured man by car to the Bazili Road Sanatorium, but he died shortly after despite medical treatment. The body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road Coroner's Office for examination. The two Wang brothers, accomplices, were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a postponement. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the two defendants, and their confessions were evasive. He ordered them to be detained pending examination of Feng's body and a further hearing.

### Dye Factory Employee Steals Pigments

The Yuda Dye Factory at No. 4, Lane 217, Fulili Road in the French Concession, had 54 jin of pigments worth 3,231 yuan stolen on January 12 of this year. The incident was reported to the French Concession Police Station, requesting an investigation. Detectives Guo Shaorong and Li Shuren learned that the case involved two employees of the factory, Dong Bailin and Wang Renlian, who colluded to steal the goods and sell them to Wang Ashui, a Shaoxing native at No. 162, Yu Shenfu Road, for 700 yuan, which they split. After Wang bought the stolen goods, he resold them to Wang Hongjin, a Shaoxing native at No. 14, Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, for 1,200 yuan. On the 21st of this month, Wang Renlian and the two receivers of the stolen goods, Wang Ashui and Wang Hongjin, were arrested. The main culprit, Dong Bailin, had fled after hearing the news. Wang and others were taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, the police station escorted Wang and the other two to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case and requested that the defendants be detained temporarily for further investigation and to apprehend the fugitive main culprit, with a further hearing at a later date. Wang Renlian confessed to colluding to steal and sell the goods and splitting the proceeds. Wang Ashui and Wang Hongyu admitted to receiving stolen goods. Judge Liao He approved the postponement of the hearing and ordered all defendants to be detained.

### Zhou Junchang and Gu Pengcheng Kidnapped; Returned Home Safely Yesterday

Zhou Junchang, a German doctor, and Gu Pengcheng, an engineer, both from No. 27, Lane 135, Yuyuan Road, were kidnapped by bandits on McLaughlan Road in western Shanghai at around 6:00 AM on the 18th of this month. Details have been reported in this newspaper. However, Zhou and Gu were released the night before last (the 24th).

It is reported that a special team in western Shanghai cracked the case in Qibao Town, Songjiang, recovered the hostages, and arrested two kidnappers. Zhou and Gu returned home safely by hired car from the highway yesterday morning.

### Nanjing Road Robbery; Police Announce Search for Victim

On the morning of the 24th of this month, a Chinese woman had her wallet snatched outside the Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road. The authorities now hope that the woman will contact the Lao Zha Police Station.

### Two Police Detectives Suddenly Arrested by Bogus Police; Released After Interrogation

The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 24th) afternoon, several "city police" officers on motorcycles near the former George's Ballroom on Yuyuan Road and Siccawei Road overstepped their authority and arrested two Chinese detectives from the Public Security Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. These officers did not explain their reasons, nor did they question them. Instead, they disarmed the detectives and forced them into the sidecar of a motorcycle and drove west. Minutes later, the Jing'an Temple Police Station received a report from an eyewitness and immediately began an investigation. According to a reporter's inquiry last night, the two Chinese detectives were forcibly taken to the "Sub-Police Station" at No. 39, Yidingpan Road. After questioning, they were transferred to the Western District Police Headquarters at No. 76, Jessfield Road, and questioned again for a long time. It was only then that it was determined that the two were detectives and carried credentials. They were released at 2:00 PM, and their pistols were returned. According to an eyewitness who told the reporter that the Chinese detectives had never left the Concession's roads, they did not resist when they were forcibly taken by the "city police," knowing that they had not committed any illegal acts. It is said that the two detectives were off duty when they were "arrested." On the 9th of this month, Ge Lobokov, Deputy Inspector of the Public Security Department, and a Chinese detective were also "arrested" for embezzling public funds on Jessfield Road and detained for several hours before being released.

### Wang Yijing, a Guest at the Oriental Hotel, Kidnapped Yesterday; Wang Led a Concubine to Shanghai; Suddenly, Violent Guests Snatched Him from His Residence

A kidnapping occurred on the third floor of the Oriental Hotel at No. 120, Yuqiaqing Road, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The kidnapped person was Wang Yijing from Haimen, and there were three kidnappers, two wearing Western suits and one wearing a long gown. They forced him into a waiting car and sped towards Race Course Road. The details are as follows:

Living in Seclusion with a Concubine

Wang Yijing is from Ting Su Haimen, 54 years old, of medium height, and has a short beard. He has been running the Fengtaihe grain store in his hometown of Haimen for many years. Half a month ago, he brought his family to Shanghai and stayed at the New Oriental Hotel, opening room 309. On the day before yesterday (the 21st), several fellow villagers arrived in Shanghai, so there was not enough room. They opened room 311 across the hall to

Live in Seclusion with a Concubine. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived, two wearing Western suits and one wearing a Palitot long gown. They arrived at the front of room 309 and loudly asked the waiter to open the door. When a waiter arrived, the three people asked him if this room was opened by Mr. Wang. The voice was very fierce. At this time, Wang Jidong in room 311 was also awakened and opened the door to see what was happening. He said to the three people, "Sirs, why are you asking about room 309? I opened this room too." At this time, the two men wearing Western suits used force to push Wang into room 211, locked the door tightly, and started cursing loudly. At that time, there was a waiter named Wang Hailin, No. 53,

Sudden Criminals

He suddenly saw this and knew that they were not good people. He immediately stepped forward and said, "Sirs, if you want to arrest someone, please contact the front desk first." The man wearing the long gown suddenly said, "We are here on the orders of the Military Police Headquarters." He reached out to take out a document, and then immediately ordered Wang Hailin to leave. Wang was forced to leave reluctantly. When he returned to the hall, he quickly used the telephone to report to the Shanghai Municipal Police. As he was talking to the switchboard operator, the criminal wearing the long gown noticed and struck the back of his neck with a Mauser pistol butt. Wang, fearing his power, immediately put down the phone and sat silently in the hall.

Forced into a Car

After a while, two bandits pushed Wang Jijing down the stairs. At that time, Wang was wearing a vest, white Indian silk trousers, and straw slippers on his bare feet. He had a white serge long gown hanging in his hand. At this time, the gatekeeper of the hotel was carrying a teapot out to make tea. He saw two bandits dragging Wang out of the gate and quickly put down the teapot and followed them. He saw Wang being pushed into a car and speeding west towards Race Course Road. The license plate number of the car was 8906. Afterwards, the hotel's front desk reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate and track down the bandits.

Wang's Family Background

The reporter rushed to room 309 after hearing the news and met his beloved concubine, Zhang (28 years old). According to her, Wang opened a grain store in his hometown, which was a joint venture. The family was ordinary. On the 10th of this month, he brought her and his eldest daughter, Zheng (30 years old), second daughter, Taisheng (16 years old), one son named Runsheng (5 years old), another family female teacher, Zhang Fen (21 years old), and male servant Zhiyi, to Shanghai. They have been staying here for half a month. The daily room rate is 8 yuan. Wang came to purchase goods and to treat his second daughter Taisheng's lung disease. He originally planned to find a house to stay in Shanghai temporarily, but it was not easy to rent one, so it has been delayed until now. Three days ago, several people came from the countryside and then rented the opposite door, room 311, for the rest of us to live in. This unfortunate event happened. There were no threatening letters beforehand. Wang was once in the military, but he had already abandoned his job to become a businessman. Now he was kidnapped by bandits, which is really puzzling. It is said that Wang has one wife and two concubines at home. His next wife is Chen Wenyuan, 36 years old, and the second concubine is Chen Lianying, 35 years old, both from Haimen. Zhang is his third concubine, from Changshu.

### Social News

At the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Parker Road, at about 9:46 AM yesterday, a young woman, Chen Zhang, 19 years old, and her husband, Chen Afa (31 years old), were getting on a public bus. She accidentally lost her footing and fell, causing her head to be run over by the wheel, her brains splattering. She died on the spot. Her husband then reported to the nearby police, recorded the license plate number of the driver who caused the accident, and quickly called an ambulance to transport the body to the Coroner's Office. The Shanghai Court sent someone to investigate.

Qin Liansheng, 20 years old, a guest in room 214 of the Daxin Hotel at No. 108, Hubei Road, had thoughts of suicide for unknown reasons. At about 12:20 PM yesterday, he secretly took poison and attempted suicide. He was discovered and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Tea Market

The new tea from the mountains this year has already been launched in Hankou and other places for some days. The most worrying is the first-grade, newly harvested tea. The tea from India this year is better in color and richer in flavor, even surpassing the best Chinese tea. Letters received from England indicate that the quantity of Indian tea is several times that of Chinese tea. The finest Chinese tea is even losing money, estimated at a loss of four shillings to five or six pence per pound. Lower grades, though not losing as much, still suffer considerable wastage. Sales in England are still brisk, but because there is too much of both Chinese and Indian tea, everyone is trying to sell, and the number of sellers exceeds the number of buyers. Therefore, tea prices must be set by the buyers, and Westerners are incurring losses in large numbers. In addition, the six-month bills of exchange this year have been changed to three months, and banks know that many tea merchants are losing money, so they are requiring less silver for remittance. For example, tea worth 10,000 silver taels last year could be remitted for 9,000 taels, but now it is perhaps 7,500 or 8,000 taels. Therefore, more silver must be added, and I fear no one will rush to buy tea. I hope the Chinese in the interior will be aware of this. However, the exchange rate this year may be expected to fall further, which is a good thing, because gold is becoming more expensive and silver cheaper. Currently, six-month bills of exchange are at four shillings and eleven and a half pence per tael, while bank sight drafts are at four shillings and nine pence and eight eight five per tael.

### Whom Do I Fear? (Continued)

Methods for helping people overcome fear vary. Offering good, clear, and sincere advice, making them understand that the future is valuable, can help them overcome fear. Furthermore, personal self-control and self-training can also be very beneficial. A person who can command their own spirit is greater than one who captures a great city. Because our worst enemy is ourselves, and fearing ourselves is the primary among many fears. Self-control is like a door to escape fear. If a person can grasp themselves, control their impulses, and inspire their willpower daily, they are walking on the path to overcoming fear. But even if we reach this point, we still haven't achieved the final solution to this problem of fear. The most reliable way for life to overcome fear is through religion. Unfortunately, people put fear together with religion, threatening people to do good, but true religion cannot be based on fear. Life is a great adventure, and no one knows what life can give us. There are always clouds of doubt on the path of life, but there is no need to fear. Fear only weakens our spirit and drags us down. We must use justice, courage, love, truth, and virtue to overcome fear. A person who strives to live a clean life and uses such faith as a background, believing that God will create glorious miracles from ordinary people, is a victor. They never fear death. To them, death is just a door to a more refined, greater, and more fulfilling life—a continuation of the great adventure. We are in God, with the trumpets blowing ahead, urging us to advance, not retreat. Truth and love are the panacea for conquering fear and the priceless legacy of religion. "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" (End)

### How to Aspire to Do Great Things

— Yan Maode

We should pay attention and not think that doing great things means becoming a high official. That is absolutely wrong. Being an official is to serve the people, which is just one career. However, so-called great things mean: "Whatever you do, you must do it thoroughly from beginning to end, and success is a great thing." Here, let me give an example: Former U.S. President Lincoln, in his childhood, had a very poor family, and he couldn't even get enough to eat. Of course, he had no opportunity to study, but he had a great spirit of creation, and he had the ambition to do his best for society and the country. At the age of sixteen, he strongly opposed the slavery system, and later, through hard work and practice, he finally achieved his goal and became the President of the United States. Lincoln's spirit of perseverance became a great thing, so Lincoln is immortal in history.

Based on the lessons of great success, to do great things, one must possess the following two conditions:

1. Establish Ambition: So-called ambition is the goal of doing things in life. Once you have a goal, you should always adhere to it and strive to achieve it. Never lose your ambition because of poverty, or become arrogant because of wealth.

2. Should have an indomitable spirit, a spirit of continuous efforts, courage, and consistent perseverance, in order to achieve career success.

Dear children! You are the buds of the nation, the seedlings of the country, and the source of mankind. Therefore, I hope that in your childhood, you should establish ambition, learn from Lincoln's hardworking spirit, and you will naturally be able to do great things and become great people in the future.

### Commemorating Martyr Xu Xilin

— Lu Lishi

Children, today is May 26th. Everyone does not think that today is a memorial day. Everyone will ignore this great revolutionary feat, but we cannot forget that there was a martyr Xu Xilin in the history of the revolution. He was a revolutionary practitioner. The great thing he did today is enough to illuminate the ages and exemplify the world. Now, I will introduce this matter to the children!

Mr. Xu's name is Xilin, and his alias is Bosun. He is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He was rich in revolutionary ideas since he was a child. He believes that revolution should not be empty talk, but should be done in practice. When he was the chief of Anhui Army Primary School and concurrently the director of the Patrol Police School, he contacted many revolutionary comrades to plot an uprising in Anhui.

At that time, the governor of Anhui was named Enming. One day, he suddenly summoned him (Martyr Xu) to talk, saying: "The other day, the Governor-General of Liangjiang captured a revolutionary party member surnamed Ye, who confessed that there are many party members in Anhui plotting an uprising, and a certain Xu is also among them. You go and investigate." As soon as Martyr Xu heard the name Xu, he knew that the matter had been leaked, and it was better to strike first. At that time, he superficially agreed to go and investigate, but secretly planned to launch it earlier.

On May 26th of the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Patrol Police School was about to graduate, and Governor Enming was going to come in person to preside over the examination and review the exercises. Martyr Xu Xilin thought that a great opportunity had come. When the ceremony was being held in the auditorium, Martyr Xu Xilin suddenly ran to Enming and said: "Today the Revolutionary Army is launching an uprising!" Enming was shocked and asked: "How did you know?" Before he finished speaking, Martyr Xu Xilin had thrown a bomb on the ground. The bomb did not explode, so he quickly pulled out two pistols from his waist and fired at Enming. Enming fell to the ground and died. At this time, all the officials were frightened and fled in all directions.

That night, Martyr Xu was arrested! The official said to Martyr Xu: "Why did you assassinate Enming? Do you know that you have committed a crime? Tomorrow, we will cut open your heart and liver to see if you are still fierce." Martyr Xu laughed and said: "My assassination of Enming is to achieve the purpose of the revolution. Now that the purpose has been achieved, I am willing to have my body cut into thousands of pieces. Why care about a mere heart and liver!"

The next day, Martyr Xu was indeed cruelly dismembered and his heart was taken out.

### Epidemic Disease

— Yu Zhen

Spring is fleeting and will soon pass. These few days are already the late spring and early summer. On the wooden poles on the streets and on the shop windows, there are eye-catching leaflets, which are warnings from the Bureau of Works and Hygiene to citizens to quickly prevent cholera, typhoid, malaria and other epidemic diseases. Indeed, in these few days, due to the cold and warm climate, flies have begun to be active, breeding their race, but affecting the health of the human body, because flies are masters of spreading diseases. This kind of leaflet can also be found on the road that Ahui takes to school.

Ah Hui saw a leaflet on the road about "Prevention of Cholera," but he was confused. "Cholera is an epidemic disease, commonly known as cholera with vomiting and diarrhea. This is a very dangerous disease. If you suffer from this disease, hurry up and ask a doctor to diagnose it, otherwise there is a danger of death."

"Then how is it transmitted? Why do people get this disease? Are there any preventive measures?" Ah Hui anxiously asked these two questions.

"When pathogenic bacteria parasitize in our bodies, they can secrete a kind of toxin that destroys the tissues in the body, causing the normal functions of the body to be hindered, and then diseases occur. Cholera is a kind of cholera bacteria, and their traces can be found in tap water, milk, etc. They enter our bodies through the medium of flies and mosquitoes. Of course, there are preventive methods, and there are many of them, which are countless. Simple methods: (1) Passively, do not drink unboiled raw water and unfiltered cold water, do not eat food that has been nailed by flies or overnight, and all kinds of unclean things. (2) Actively: get vaccinations, kill flies and mosquitoes, all food must be properly stored, keep the house dry and sunbathe, these are easy and achievable methods" (To be continued)

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (4)

— Min

I often like to dance. Mother has said that, and I think she must be right, because she knows everything about me and understands me better than anyone else. I've heard her say that when I was just learning to walk, I liked to dance. According to my mother, when I first walked, I was different from other children. My steps were fluttery, like a little angel. Whenever she turned on the radio in our house, as soon as I heard the music, I would dance the most beautiful steps.

Connie, I'll tell you a secret. There were many times when my mother didn't turn on the radio, and I turned it on myself. I twirled around in the living room, creating new steps. Later, in the film studio, Mr. Jack Sheasby taught me dance steps, which helped me a lot in the various films I starred in. Do you remember William Robinson, who danced the staircase dance with me in "The Little Colonel"? He said that when I get older, I will be able to create my own new steps, just like other good dancers.

One night, Dad was giving me a bath. I was only three years old at that time, and now I'm six years old, and Dad still gives me a bath. Mom started telling me that it would be a good idea to send me to dance school. Several of the children in the neighborhood were going to dance school to learn to dance. I remember Mom saying to Dad, "George, it's only one hour a week, and the tuition is only five cents."

Dad didn't look very happy. He said I was too young to go to dance school, and they didn't want me to be a dancer. He said that there had never been anyone in his family or Mom's family who had been on the stage or screen. In his view, learning to dance would not benefit our family in any way.

Mom smiled and argued with Dad for a while, and finally won the last victory. The next morning, she took me to dance school. The school wasn't far from our house. I put on my best clothes and looked very beautiful. But when we got there, the teacher protested and said that I shouldn't come like this next time, but should just wear plain clothes. It turned out that the clothes worn by the other girls in the school were very plain, and the boys just wore ordinary shirts. Moms and other moms sat on long benches against the wall, watching us learn to dance. The teacher told us to line up and do a kind of slight jumping step, and we followed her to dance, first with one foot and then with the other, and someone else played a "Down the Su River" tune on the piano.

Connie, how messy my steps were at that time! Fortunately, you weren't there, or you would have been ashamed of me. However, I can often dance my feet according to my own ideas. I can do whatever I want. You see me dancing those very simple steps on the screen, but I have worked hard for hours. Even the dance steps in "Stand Up and Cheer!" and "Baby Take a Bow" seem to be the simplest, but they were very difficult when I first learned them. But I always put my heart into learning, and after learning them, I won't forget them even if I don't need these steps. Every time I meet Jimmy Dunn on the set, I have to dance with him first. We first cooperate with the little dance in the film "Baby Take a Bow", and then shake hands with him. But I was only four and a half years old when I first learned this little dance, and it has been two years since then, but I still haven't forgotten it.

The Entertainment World

### German Amusement in the 1940 New York World's Fair

— Xin Ying

— More Spectacular Than Last Year

In this year's New York World's Fair, just like last year, all kinds of amusements are being gathered, and everything is available. Moreover, there are many venues and programs that are different from last year; therefore, it is still necessary to introduce them to the readers.

In the 1940 New York World's Fair venue, there are stage plays, movies, dances, singing, miscellaneous performances, wireless movies, wireless radio broadcasts, and everything else. Moreover, most of the amusement troupes are famous on Broadway, and their performances have already been quite successful.

Among the various amusements, what is particularly worth mentioning is a grand music hall that has been completely newly built. Construction started on February 15th and officially opened on May 11th. Various construction projects were completed in three months.

This large music hall runs from east to west, from the Sunlight Valley area in the east to the houseboat room along the fountain in the west. The interior is very spacious and can accommodate 7,000 spectators. The admission ticket is quite cheap, only 40 cents per person.

The sole purpose of this grand music hall is to introduce American historical musical dramas, operas, and comedies. In recent years, American audiences have had a strong interest in singing and dancing. The performance of classical musical dramas has given many audiences a deep understanding of the development of American stage history.

Since the grand music hall opened on the 11th, all singing programs have been performed by musical drama, stage, and radio stars. In addition, one hundred singers participated, as well as a singing class, including one hundred singing and dancing stars and male and female soloists. Moreover, two hundred and sixty-nine talented children formed a children's paradise to join the performance. With so many talents, the program is naturally more exciting than last year!

### The Drama Craze in the Temporary Capital (Middle)

— Ying

"Nation Above All"

Mr. Lao She, a new playwright who became famous for "Remnants of Mist," returned from comforting the front line and collaborated with Mr. Song Zhi of the pen corps to create a new play for the China Salvation Association of the Chinese Muslims. The name of the play is "Nation Above All." This play is set against the current era, highlighting the situation of the Han and Hui ethnic groups and the families of the Hui people themselves. As the invaders approach, everyone rises up to fight together under the premise of the nation above all and the country above all.

Under the lively writing of Mr. Song and Shu, and with the skillful guidance of the famous director Ma Yanxiang, its performance has won good reviews from audiences throughout the city, greatly arousing resonance and causing a sensation for a time.

On April 23rd, the Military Affairs Commission invited the Vanguards Drama Troupe to perform again at the Guotai Grand Theater in order to entertain the overseas Chinese returning from Nanyang to comfort the troops. At that time, many dignitaries and noble ladies drove to the Guotai in cars, enjoying the performance to their heart's content. The situation was unprecedentedly lively.

### "Army Joy" is Modernized

Following the sensational "Nation Above All," a new script written with new techniques and performed with new theatrical technology, "Army Joy," appeared at the Guotai Grand Theater.

This script is quite bland in all aspects. However, under the principle that "drama is a comprehensive art," the editors integrated the three aspects of song, dance, and music into a whole. Moreover, under the director's agile skills, the scenery, lighting, and everything that can be seen, heard, and felt in the theater are integrated into one, so that the stage and the audience are consistent in feeling. This is a very valuable achievement.

No matter which audience member watches it, they will never forget the joy of the family, friends, and neighbors in the play enthusiastically joining the army. At the same time, they can even fulfill the task of promoting conscription and achieving the ultimate goal of the script.

This script was performed for four days, and it only stopped on April 14th from April 11th. The screenwriters were Yu Shangyuan and Wang Sizeng, the director was Yang Cunbin, and the actors were students from the National Drama School.

### Twenty Kinds of Ballads (8) The Palace of Eternal Life

— Written by Yun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

The Palace of Eternal Life is a building in the Tang Palace.

On the evening of the Double Seventh Festival, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and his beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan burned incense and made a vow here. As Bai Juyi's Song of Everlasting Regret says: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, there was no one speaking in the middle of the night; in the sky, we wish to be birds flying wing to wing, and on earth, we wish to be trees with intertwined branches." The private life of the romantic emperor is still widely spread. Please have Hong Sheng compose a romance about it. Today's "Palace of Eternal Life Ballad" is adapted from the romance.

### Italy's Entry into the War and the Near Eastern Situation: Bloodshed in the Mediterranean Will Accompany the Tension on the Western Front

— Shadow

Italy's battlefront: The situation in the Mediterranean is becoming more tense day by day. Most observers have come to the impression that once Italy joins the war, it will have to deal with three battlefronts. The first is in Europe, Africa, and France. The second is in the Balkan Peninsula. The third is in the Near East. After the German and Italian forces invade Yugoslavia, or perhaps even during the invasion, Italy will begin its offensive toward the Near East. According to the opinions expressed by Germany and Italy, victory in the Near East will be easily achieved. The Axis powers believe that the Allied forces in the Near East are very weak, while covert operations in the Near East only began four years ago.

Near East Under German Influence

Over the past four years, anti-British and anti-French propaganda has been passively carried out. Books, pamphlets, and newspapers have been sent by Germany and Italy, distributed to countless Arab people. The Italian radio station in Bari is the center of anti-British propaganda, broadcasting anti-British speeches five times a week. In 1936, when the rebellion occurred in Palestine, and in late September 1939 when the civil war broke out, Germany and Italy transported large quantities of arms to Palestine to collude with the rebels. Although the German authorities vehemently denied this and fabricated contrary facts, they have now admitted it. In 1940, Germany published a 100-page booklet, distributing it to tens of thousands of people in Europe, America, Asia, and Australia, titled "British Tyrannical Politics in Palestine."

Oil-Soaked Bloodstains

This kind of activity was clearly preparing for a future war, and the work of bringing certain Arab leaders closer to the Third Reich continued even after the outbreak of war in Europe. Because even after the outbreak of the European war, many neutral citizens living in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt were still engaged in this kind of outreach work. Thus, the Nazi Party is hoping that once there is war in the Near East, the British and French Allied forces will encounter many difficulties. In the autumn of 1938, German-controlled newspapers published news from Jerusalem: "The so-called British army is unable to suppress even a few thousand Arab rebels. How can such a country threaten us with war!" The entirety of this news is to prove how clever the Arabs are and how shameful the British are. "In these desert nations, Britain will need tens of thousands of troops to control the rebels," the author added at the end, making it clear how difficult it would be to deal with a real war. The territory is well-prepared, and there is German and Italian spy activity everywhere in the Near East. Italy may want to reap the rewards of the past four years of cultivation, hoping for Arab rebellions and work stoppages. The Arabs knew about this during the First World War and understood that, according to the account of the famous General Lawrence, they are clever students. In their recent rebellions, they have proven that "Lawrence of Arabia" was indeed accurate. In addition to wanting to control the Suez Canal, a hub of Eurasian transportation, what is most important to Italy in economic and military terms is connecting the oil fields of Iraq, Haifa, and Syria. When the Arabs rebelled, the connections to these oil fields were disrupted more than twenty times. Italy will do the same, because after controlling these nations, repairs will be very convenient.

The Near East Nations in a Dilemma

If Italy can win in Syria and Palestine, it will deal with the oil fields of Iraq, attack the British and French, control the Suez Canal, and further endanger Turkey. Within a few days, it could occupy the British-controlled island of Cyprus. Covert operations have long been prepared for the Near East nations. According to Hitler's predictions for any future war, Italy's ambition is to become the master of the Near East. Within these startling goals and the current situation, there are two major obstacles: the Allied land forces and the British navy. It would be dangerous if Italy underestimates the strength of the British and French forces in the Near East and overestimates the Arab rebellion. The situation of the Allied forces is completely different from that of the Turkish army in 1918, when Turkey was already weak and powerless, and decisions were made based on the wishes of the Arabs. The army in the Near East is a new force, which is very dangerous. And Italy does not have a figure like Lawrence who can create a rebellion. Even if it can achieve the goal of inciting rebellion, the reason why the Arabs rebel is to seek freedom and independence. They probably do not want to fight to break away from the British and French only to be ruled by Italy, right?

### Women of the World: French Women in Wartime

French women do not wear uniforms during wartime, but they are more directly affected by the war than women in other countries. France has five million men serving in the military, so many of the tasks of the labor force need to be largely completed by women, especially in agriculture. This situation is even more true because, as in the last World War, the largest proportion of soldiers is supplied by the French countryside. Although agriculture is France's largest industry, no part of it is included in the preservation effort. Soldiers are granted large-scale leave from the army to work in agriculture, but only during a certain period of the year. During the rest of the time, all of France's enormous agricultural machinery is entrusted to the hands of women, the elderly, and young children.

French rural women have always been hardworking laborers, and now they have to work twice as hard, and their working days are even longer. Simple tasks such as taking cattle to graze are now often handled by old women who have been resting at home for a long time. Aside from the issue of money, there is now a strong motivation among French farm women: they want to "do things well" with their greatest efforts, and they want to ensure that the men do not feel any disappointment when they return home.

However, no matter how hard the farm women work, this is still a serious problem. The French government is now doing everything it can to maintain agricultural production at a very high level. In the last World War, wheat production fell sharply by more than half between 1913 and 1917. This situation must now be avoided. If the war continues for a long time, then rations will have an impact on agricultural production.

In the last war, France employed 400,000 women in its war industries, but it is estimated that this number will be even higher in this war. The aircraft industry employs a very large proportion of women.

In France, women are also employed on a large scale in all luxury industries such as clothing, leather goods, jewelry, and other embroidery. The prosperity of these traders largely depends on foreign markets, and in the implementation of blocking the export of German goods, many foreign markets, especially North and South America, are very promising to become new gateways for accepting French goods. However, on the one hand, French people have greatly reduced their consumption of luxury goods, and on the other hand, they are not actually encouraged by the government, coupled with the disappearance of wartime travelers, so no luxury goods merchant can operate as in peacetime.

After the tension at the beginning of the war gradually passed, the clothing factories in Paris immediately resumed operations, and the models in Paris came out as before. However, even the largest clothing factories in Paris now only employ one-fifth of their staff from peacetime. So how can those other highly skilled workers be employed? The Minister of Labor has thought of a solution and has now implemented it, which is to open many military uniform factories for 10,000 garment workers to sew uniforms and military attire.

Joliot-Curie, the daughter of the famous female scientist Marie Curie, serves as a scientific propaganda officer in the French Cabinet's information department.

### Messerschmitt Fighters

— Xi

—The Soul of the German Air Force—

According to recent telegrams, Germany will use its air force as the main force for its offensive, implementing group air raids. The British and French authorities have also repeatedly warned soldiers and civilians to be prepared for air raids at any time. What Germany relies on is its superior air force, and what the German air force prides itself on is the "Messerschmitt" fighter. We often see news agencies from various countries mentioning this aircraft in the newspapers. What exactly is this aircraft like?

This aircraft is named after its maker, Willy Messerschmitt. Messerschmitt is only forty-one years old this year, younger than the famous American aircraft manufacturer Douglas. He has a sharp nose, golden hair, and was born in Augsburg, Germany. His hometown is a quiet city with a medieval flavor. He began learning to fly at the age of fifteen.

When British and German aircraft engaged in the first major air battle over the Heligoland Bight, it was discovered that Messerschmitt's new Me.110 aircraft was very different from the Me.109. It has two Daimler-Benz engines, can seat two or three pilots, and is equipped with relatively heavy weapons. There are four machine guns between the wings and two small grenade launchers. The speed is faster than the Me.109, about twenty miles per hour faster. The effectiveness of installing grenade launchers on aircraft remains to be tested.

But in general, its impact distance is better than machine guns, and a single shell is enough to kill the enemy. However, the hope of success for grenade launchers is not great at long distances, and because aircraft need to be equipped with such heavy grenade launchers, other weapons must be reduced. The effectiveness of this Me.110 Messerschmitt fighter still needs to be confirmed by the results of future engagements.

### A Brief History of Parachutes

— Ju Chen

During the British war against the Boers in Africa in the late nineteenth century, German newspapers suggested using parachutes to carry riflemen to land and strafe the enemy's infantry, saying that victory could be assured. Although this suggestion was not valued, using parachutes to jump was not entirely a fantasy at that time. The principle of parachutes was understood by Easterners long ago. In the seventeenth century, a French person traveling in Siam described local performers who held large umbrellas and floated down from the top of a tower.

The first application of parachutes was by two famous Parisian aviators in the eighteenth century, named Blanchard and Garnerin. The two competed with each other. In 1797, Blanchard set a record by ascending into the sky in a balloon. Garnerin thought of surpassing him. On October 12, 1797, Garnerin used a parachute to descend from 2,236 feet above Parc Monceau, waving a flag. The audience acknowledged that Garnerin's skill was above Blanchard's. But parachuting cannot simply be used as a form of entertainment.

In 1808, a Polish aviator escaped from a burning balloon using a parachute. This was its first practical use. In 1912, Colonel Berry performed his first parachute jump from an airplane in Montmartre. By 1924, parachutes had become a major piece of equipment in aircraft. The lowest altitude for opening a parachute is 150 feet. The highest record for jumping down is currently 25,000 feet.

In this European war, the German parachute troops have shown great prowess. The troops jump out of airplanes at extremely high altitudes, and only open their parachutes when they are close to the ground. Otherwise, they would be floating in the air, not only unable to fight, but also becoming targets for the enemy's bullets.

### A Wedding in the Mountains of Lian County

— Zhongyi

Singing to Seek a Mate: Life Still in a Primitive State; Head Ornamentation Resembling the Attire of a Savage Tribal Chief

Lian County, at the junction of Hunan and Guangxi, is seventy li from the city and is where the Yao people live in groups. When the author arrived there, it was the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, which was the day when the Yao people seek mates and get married. The process of their marriage is quite interesting. In the early morning, they gather in the square. First, the men sing loudly, singing songs that boast about their family background. "We have two hundred mu of good farmland, countless cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks. If there is a good bride who fancies me! Come and live in my house (meaning home)! I will always bring you endless blessings, as if you have ascended to paradise!" Their voices are extremely loud, similar to those sung by Europeans. If a woman among them agrees with the man, she can freely step forward, first throwing the towel she is holding onto the man's shoulder, singing in harmony, and then holding hands shoulder to shoulder, murmuring sweet words, and then getting married in the evening. Their wedding is quite simple. The Yao people are strong and powerful, loyal and brave, but lack knowledge. Their living conditions are no different from the Middle Ages, and their clothing is especially peculiar. Their hair is tied on top of their heads, and they wear tall hats, with bare chests. The men wear long pants and leggings, while the women wear short pants. Both carry knives and swords, and hold long spears. Before jumping, they look very heroic. The village chiefs are all old men, with pheasant feathers inserted into their heads, almost like the role of a savage tribal chief in Beijing opera. It can truly be said that China is so vast that there is nothing that is not strange!

### Why Can Radio Stations Be Disrupted?

— Ju Chen

Recently, when receiving broadcasts from the Shanghai Gospel Broadcasting Station, a whooshing sound was discovered, completely engulfing the station's broadcasts. This is the interference from a certain party that has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Those who cannot see Shanghai newspapers in other cities may suspect that their own radios are malfunctioning. The author listens to the station's English news reports and sermons every day, almost obsessively. Since this situation occurred, I had to turn it off and not listen, because on the receiving end, other interferences can be avoided by installing filters, but there is nothing that can be done about this interference.

Originally, radio stations have their own wavelengths or frequencies. For example, if one end of a rope is tied to a door and the other end is held in hand, if the hand is waved up and down, the rope will bend up and down into a wave shape. The distance between the crest of the front wave and the crest of the back wave is the wavelength; the rise and fall of a wave shape is a cycle, and the frequency is the number of cycles per second. Kilohertz is used as the unit. According to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, there cannot be two broadcasting stations with the same wavelength in the same location. (This is the general idea.) Otherwise, the broadcasts of the two stations will be heard at the same time, interfering with each other. Now the wavelength of the Gospel Broadcasting Station is 3571 meters. If a certain party emits radio waves with the same wavelength, but without music and language on them (in electrical terms, amplitude modulation is not used), then it becomes a whooshing sound.

Shen Bao Weekly Supplement National Goods Special Issue: Fang Yexian

### A Fair Discussion of International Price Issues

— Baiming

In the past few days, some voices of the masses can be seen in the newspapers every day, and that is what has happened for the issue of commodity prices. When an unprecedented contraction of foreign exchange occurred on May 2, commodity prices in the market immediately rose by 20% to 30% under the pretext of the contraction of foreign exchange. Now that foreign exchange is relaxed, logically commodity prices should fall, but the commodity prices that have risen remain the same and have not decreased. As a result, some people who feel threatened by high commodity prices have expressed some unfair voices due to their personal suffering. This is human nature, and we should sympathize with them. Leaving aside the rise and fall of other commodity prices, this publication is a special publication for national goods, so let's talk about the price issue of national goods.

Regarding the issue of rising prices of national goods, the reporter has already discussed it in the previous issue. Now that foreign exchange is relaxed, why do prices still only rise and not fall? There are many people in the current society who hold this view, and some even scold national goods manufacturers for taking the opportunity to manipulate and profiteer. Of course, I cannot say that there is absolutely no one who takes the opportunity to manipulate commodity prices to profiteer, but there are also factors that prevent the prices of national goods from falling sharply. Why? First, we must know that the wartime price increase of national goods is inevitable. The price of rice is 49 times higher than before the war, and the price of coal is 78 times higher than before the war, while the ratio of price increases of national goods is much lower than that of rice and coal. The contraction of exchange rates and high commodity prices have made those engaged in the production and sales of national goods feel that it is more profitable to store raw materials or goods than to manufacture finished products or sell them. This is the first reason. Commodity prices rise under the pressure of the real situation, but the cost must be calculated when prices fall. In the past, because the cost was higher than the selling price and the prices of goods had not risen enough, even if foreign exchange is long, the cost is still high, so the price drop cannot be as responsive as an echo. This is the second reason. During wartime, due to inconvenient transportation and lack of materials, any commodity price has the possibility of rising, and this is not only the case for national goods. This is the third reason. Judging from the current market situation, high commodity prices mean a decrease in currency value. Those who have funds would rather store goods than lend money, manufacturers would rather store raw materials than engage in production, and vendors would rather store goods than sell them all. This kind of abnormal psychology under special circumstances is also one of the reasons why commodity prices cannot fall. What is even more advanced is that the more severe the contraction of foreign exchange, the more severe the outflow of raw materials. The more severe the outflow of raw materials, the higher the selling price of raw materials. In addition, the cost of power and labor is also high due to the increase in commodity prices. Although foreign exchange is long, the response to commodity prices is very small. This is also the reason why the prices of national goods cannot fall with the relaxation of foreign exchange. The above is reason, and it is also fact. Then, since we allowed national goods manufacturers to increase prices due to the contraction of foreign exchange, shouldn't national goods manufacturers automatically lower prices to reduce the burden on consumers when foreign exchange is relaxed? That's not how it works. The contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in commodity prices, and the relaxation of foreign exchange and the fall in commodity prices, this is a logical inference, but in fact, the rise and fall of commodity prices and the tightness of foreign exchange are only one of many reasons, not the only reason. The reason why national goods should reduce selling prices is one of the reasons, and reducing the burden on consumers and preserving the purchasing power that customers only have in order to achieve the coexistence of both production and sales sides is actually one of the meanings that national goods manufacturers should understand. Because the current high value of national goods, on the manufacturer's side, there is an inevitable pain, and on the consumer's side, there is the pain of being unable to buy. What is even worse is that the increase in national goods with the contraction of foreign exchange makes those who are enthusiastic about buying national goods switch to buying foreign goods, then it is like driving fish into the deep, and driving sparrows into the forest, which is not a blessing for the future of national goods. In these extraordinary times, those engaged in production and business should have the concept of serving the country and the nation. Although it is inevitable to willingly lose money, it is not the way to love the country and the people to use extraordinary times to obtain excessive profits. It must be known that the foundation of the national goods business is built in a large consumer group. If consumers' faith becomes increasingly weak and they are unable to buy, then even if the selling price of national goods is as high as the sky, who will ask? This kind of suicidal policy is also not what those who love national industries want to hear. Therefore, I believe that national goods increase prices due to unavoidable circumstances, but when circumstances permit, for the burden of consumers and for the reputation and business of themselves, they cannot only rise and not fall. Where to go, this is the decision of the Mingda in the national goods industry.

### Sincere Pharmaceutical Factory

— Ta Zhen

History

The Sincere Pharmaceutical Factory has been established for twenty years. It was very small when it was first established. Later, capital was gradually expanded. The main factory was established on Route Massenet in the French Concession, and the first branch factory was established at No. 187 Hujunying Road in Nanshi, and the second branch factory was established at No. 132 Nanjing Street in Nanshi. After the Shanghai War broke out in the 26th year, the two factories in Nanshi were destroyed by artillery fire, but the authorities held a unyielding heart, and another branch factory was established on Avenue Avénard, and the Sincere Glass Instrument Department and Serum Vaccine Factory were established. At all costs and at great expense, various machinery and instruments were added from European and American countries, and efforts were made to develop them, which is worthy of admiration. The factory now has a total capital of 600,000.

Organization

The factory is a joint-stock company, with the highest being the board of directors, followed by the general manager, who is in charge of all factory affairs. Under this, there are accounting, propaganda, advertising, sales, transportation, storage, packaging, manufacturing, chemical research, documentation, general affairs, editing, printing, box, intaglio printing, coppersmithing, personnel, carpentry, and other departments, each with a director to manage it.

Employees

The factory has more than 70 employees and about 400 male and female workers, with female workers accounting for the majority. Most of the employees are from Ningbo, Dinghai, and local areas. The lowest level of education is junior high school dropout, and there are many college students serving. The manufacturing department, packaging department, etc., are all female workers, mostly around 20 years old, and there are also women in their 30s and 40s. The level of education is slightly lower, but they are very willing to work hard.

Business

The factory's business is extremely developed, with an average daily number of about 120,000. Although foreign ports are in the midst of the war, they are not inferior. Offices have been established in Hong Kong, Shantou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Chongqing, Singapore, and other places. There are representatives in Ningbo, Suzhou, Jinhua, and other places to promote business.

Equipment

The factory's equipment is extremely sophisticated. Most of the manufacturing department's equipment are the latest European, American, or German machines and instruments. The equipment in the chemical research department is also quite complete. The factory has special personnel to manage the machines and is equipped with repair craftsmen. When there is any damage, it will be repaired immediately. There are more than 20 electric heating furnaces, which are used exclusively for sealing the ends of injection liquid glass tubes. There are also baking rooms, which are equipped with radiators to bake various drugs. There are also Cibaoming Room and New Xihua San Room, and the equipment seems to be more substantial. The printing department has four printing presses and is equipped with movable type and English type to print price lists, brochures, notices, envelopes, etc. However, there are not many ordinary lead characters, and there is also an intaglio printing department, which is even smaller than the equipment in small printing shops in the market.

Introduction to National Goods Factories

### Full View of the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Thermos Factory - Latest Invention, Crystalline Material Bottle, Creating a Glorious Record of Domestic Manufacturing

— Zhong Wangshu

The manufacturing of domestic thermos bottles has only a history of a few decades. Previously, we relied on imports, with Japanese goods especially flooding the market, and the outflow of profits was countless. Thanks to the efforts of insightful individuals who quickly caught up, we have now reached the point of self-sufficiency. In terms of product quality, we have even surpassed foreign goods. This is a remarkable historical creation, and the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Thermos Factory has truly borne the greatest responsibility. Here is an overview of the factory based on my visit.

Development History: In 1928, Mr. Gan Fengnan from Dinghai, with a small amount of capital, established a small-scale manufacturing factory on Dongyouheng Road. Through diligent management and careful research, its products surprisingly sold well in society. Later, to meet the increasing demand, a branch factory was established on Qingyang Road in Zhabei to increase production. In 1934, Mr. Gan further demonstrated his great ambition by building a new factory on Qimei Road. The scale was grand, the equipment was complete, and it was unparalleled in the industry. Unfortunately, the entire factory was destroyed by the August 13th Incident. However, Mr. Gan, with his spirit of perseverance, strived to recover. The following year, a new factory was rebuilt at the current address on Gordon Road near the Bubbling Well Road intersection. The internal equipment is even more typical of a modern factory. The factory's business, which initially had an annual turnover of only over ten thousand yuan, has now increased to over one million two hundred thousand yuan. Its sales reach not only within the country but also as far as Southeast Asia, Europe, and America. With its affordable and high-quality products, it has gained an excellent reputation overseas, so the future is very promising.

The crystalline material thermos bottle is the factory's unique product, based entirely on scientific principles. Its durable heat retention is truly creating a new page in the history of thermos bottles worldwide.

### Yunnan Porcelain Company

— Sansan

The Central Relief Commission, in order to develop the porcelain industry in Yunnan, plans to establish a porcelain factory in Kunming and has sent He Jiefu, head of the city's refugee station, to Qujing for investigation. After the investigation, it was decided to establish the "Yunnan Porcelain Company" in Yunnan. The organizational method was drafted, and the company was established in Liaohu Town, Qujing, merging with the local existing Yongchang Porcelain Factory. The factory is one of the shareholders, with its original production equipment valued at 15,000 yuan in national currency as the company's share capital. In addition, the Central Relief Commission will contribute 15,000 yuan, and Yunnan porcelain merchants will contribute 15,000 yuan, for a total capital of 45,000 yuan. The Central Relief Commission designated Huang Bodu and He Jiefu as directors, and the Yongchang Porcelain Factory nominated Ou Chiqi to join. The porcelain merchants nominated representative Wang Ji to participate in the company's affairs. The company now owns more than 300 acres of clay land, and the raw materials are extremely abundant. The Relief Commission has entrusted Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to hire 86 porcelain technicians to improve the porcelain within the company, so that it can be compared with Jingdezhen porcelain. The company held its opening ceremony on the 2nd of last month and began manufacturing. It is reported that the first phase of the plan aims to increase ordinary supplies to relieve the domestic porcelain shortage. The second phase of the plan is to produce a large number of fine art products for export in order to obtain foreign exchange.
