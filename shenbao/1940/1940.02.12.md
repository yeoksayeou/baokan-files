### A Great Victory for Chinese Troops Near Shanglin; Japanese Offensive in Southern Guangxi Stalled; Japanese Troops Invading Wuming Encircled by Chinese Forces and Defeated, Retreating to Shuangqiao; Chinese Troops Annihilate Over 16,000 Japanese in Continuous Fighting

Chongqing - According to news received here today from the Chinese side, on Friday, after the Chinese army launched a fierce counter-offensive near Shanglin, the Japanese offensive in southern Guangxi collapsed. Japanese troops began retreating southwest that same afternoon. Recent military dispatches indicate that the key town of Shanglin is now in the hands of the Chinese army. This area has been the site of numerous decisive battles in the past few years. Shanglin is a small city on the south bank of the Qianjiang River (transliterated), serving as the gateway to northern Guangxi. It is generally believed that crossing the river north of Binyang to directly reach Liuzhou would be exceedingly difficult, as the river's eastward flow passes through treacherous gorges. (Reuters, 11th)

Liuzhou - Japanese troops attempting to invade Wuming were encircled and fiercely attacked by Chinese forces. Fighting to the morning of the 10th resulted in Japanese corpses covering the field, with over half of their forces killed or wounded. They retreated to Shuangqiao, pursued by the Chinese army. Remaining Japanese forces near Shanglin were swept away by the Chinese, with many captured or killed. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese in the vicinity. (11th)

Liuzhou - Continuous rain on the southern Guangxi front has hampered Japanese activity. Japanese troops attempting to harass the area near Shanglin were fiercely attacked by the large Chinese army, resulting in a disorganized retreat. (10th)

Guilin - The headquarters announced that Japanese troops in Litang were fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, resulting in over 1,500 Japanese casualties. They retreated to Binyang. (10th)

Guilin - Since the 9th, the major battle in southern Guangxi has unfolded as anticipated by the Chinese. Chinese troops in the Shanglin area launched a sudden and fierce attack on the morning of the 9th, making rapid progress. By noon on the 10th, they had annihilated over 2,000 Japanese troops in the area south of Shanglin. The Chinese army continued to pursue with great courage, encircling and attacking in multiple directions, eliminating another 2,400 Japanese troops and capturing countless personnel, equipment, and ammunition. By noon today, this group of stubborn Japanese had been completely wiped out. At present, between Shanglin and Binyang, only Japanese corpses are visible, the vegetation stained red. Not a single Japanese soldier survived. On the Yongwu Road, the Chinese army, having lured the Japanese into areas of absolute Chinese advantage on the 8th and 9th, immediately began encirclement and annihilation operations in the area south of Wuming on the evening of the 9th, cutting off the Japanese forces section by section. In the fierce battle until noon yesterday, over half of the Japanese forces were annihilated, estimated at about 5,000 men. The remaining Japanese troops repeatedly attempted to break through, retreating towards Silong (northwest of Binyang), but were firmly intercepted by the Chinese army and ultimately failed to escape. On the evening of the 10th, they were driven to the vicinity of Shuangqiao (south of Wuming) and subjected to a devastating attack. Currently, there are no surviving Japanese soldiers between Shuangqiao and Wuming. In the Binyang area, since the Chinese army broke through the invading Japanese troops at the Litang Bridge (southeast of Binyang) and Liangping, they continued to advance towards Binyang, reaching the west of the city. In the past two days, remnants of the Japanese troops inside Binyang City and in the northwest area have repeatedly attempted to escape, but were repelled. The fate of this group of Japanese troops is also entirely in the hands of the Chinese army. It is estimated that the Chinese army, having launched a successful major battle, has annihilated over 16,000 Japanese troops in the past few days. The brave soldiers on the Chinese front do not appear complacent, considering it only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the intended goal. (10th)

### Japanese Attempt to Land at Xiepu Repulsed by Chinese Troops; Japanese Troops Advancing Eastward into Xiaoshan Fail

Eastern Zhejiang Front - Recent activity of Japanese warships off the Zhejiang coast suggests an attempted troop landing. At around 8 PM on the 9th, three Japanese warships and ten motorboats, carrying over 200 Japanese soldiers, arrived off the coast of Xiepu, northwest of Zhenhai, and forcibly attempted to land. The Chinese garrison calmly responded, waiting until the Japanese approached the shore before unleashing a fierce barrage of artillery fire, causing the Japanese to suffer heavy casualties and retreat back to their ships. At around 11 PM that night, the Japanese attempted a second landing, but were again bravely repulsed by the Chinese garrison. After these two unsuccessful attempts, the Japanese warships and boats remained in the area for some time, only heading towards the Li Yang coast after midnight. Also, at 9 PM on the 9th, a Japanese warship off the coast of Ruian launched six motorboats to pursue a Chinese merchant ship, but no damage was inflicted. (10th)

Eastern Zhejiang Front - There has been a slight increase in Japanese troops in Xiaoshan. On the morning of the 10th, a portion of the Japanese army advanced towards Xinlinzhou, east of Xiaoshan, but was repulsed. The Chinese captured many supplies in this engagement. On the evening of the 7th, Chinese troops infiltrated the Japanese警戒line at the Qianjiang Bridge under cover of darkness, using swift and agile movements to destroy portions of the bridge that the Japanese had repaired, and kill the Japanese sentries. It is also reported that Chinese forces in western Zhejiang are very active behind Japanese lines. On the 5th, they completely destroyed the telegraph lines erected by the Japanese along the route from Lingjiaqiao in Fuyang to the Fuchun River. (10th)

Yinxian - At 1 AM on the morning of the 9th, three Japanese warships suddenly appeared off the coast of Longshan in Xiepu, Zhenhai, launching eight motorboats which approached the coast and began firing machine guns wildly, attempting to land. They were met with fierce resistance from the Chinese garrison, which destroyed and sank one Japanese boat. By 9 PM, they were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated, only to attempt a second attack. The Chinese army again inflicted heavy casualties, and by 10 AM on the 10th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated. The three warships also headed northeast. (10th)

### Japanese Aircraft Shot Down West of Nanning

Chongqing - A delayed dispatch from Liuzhou received here today states that on the 2nd and 3rd, two Japanese warplanes were shot down over the skies of Laibin 池方, west of Nanning. That morning, over 30 Japanese aircraft attacked Laibin. Intense anti-aircraft fire shot down two of them, and another was forced to land. All five crew members were captured. (Reuters, 11th)

### Japanese Troops Invading Dahong Mountain Suffer Heavy Losses on All Fronts – Japanese Troops North of Sanyangdian Have Been Defeated and Retreated

Fancheng - Japanese troops invading the Hongshan area have been repulsed by Chinese forces on all fronts. Chinese troops on the eastern foothills are pursuing the enemy towards Maping (southeast of Suixian) and Duchong Mountain, west of the suburbs. Another unit is besieging Sanyangdian (east of Suixian). (11th)

Fancheng - Japanese troops invading the eastern foothills of Dahong Mountain have suffered extremely heavy casualties after continuous engagement with Chinese forces. Japanese troops north of Sanyangdian were subjected to a night attack by Chinese forces on the evening of the 8th. In the fierce battle until the morning of the 9th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated towards Sanyangdian under cover of fog. The Chinese pursuit force has advanced to the vicinity of ×××××. Of the thousand or so Japanese troops fleeing west from Maping, one group was defeated by Chinese forces at Tongxinzhai, with over a hundred Japanese killed or wounded. Another group attacked the area of Hua Ci Gang from Kongjiatian, engaging in a bloody battle throughout the night, with over ten hand-to-hand combats. Over two hundred Japanese were killed or wounded, and over ten Japanese vehicles were destroyed. The remaining Japanese troops have retreated to Dushan. (10th)

### U.S. Ambassador Johnson Arrives in Hong Kong

Hong Kong - Ambassador Johnson, along with his secretary, military attache, and two others, arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the morning of the 11th and will travel to Chongqing within days.

### Guangxi Province Plans to Establish Flour Mill

Guilin - Guangxi Province and Chongqing business leaders have discussed organizing a Guangxi Flour Mill, deciding to establish three mechanized flour mills in ××××××, and smaller mills in other wheat-producing counties, utilizing local wheat to manufacture flour for sale in the southwestern provinces. The capital is 300,000 yuan, with 150,000 yuan subscribed by business leaders, 50,000 yuan by the provincial government, and the remaining amount currently being raised. (10th)

### War Situation for the Week - February 3rd to 9th

Chongqing - The military commission spokesman stated that, recently, due to the opening of the Japanese Diet, the Japanese army is making aggressive moves to conceal its military failures in China, deceive its people, and hopefully pass its massive military budget. In particular, in western Suiyuan and southern Guangxi, the Japanese have greatly increased their troop deployments, betting everything on a single throw. Over the past week, our loyal and courageous soldiers have fought with the Japanese army on the northern and southern battlefields with great spirit and fearlessness, and will ultimately shatter the arrogant ambitions of the Japanese. The fierce battle is currently underway. The following is a summary of the operational progress:

Japanese Army in Southern Guangxi

Since reinforcements were greatly increased on the 5th, they have divided into three routes and advanced northwards. One route travels along the Yongwu Highway, attempting to reach Wuming. One route is rapidly advancing along the Yongbin Highway towards Binyang. One route is advancing east from Nanning towards Yongchun, flanking Binyang. They are utilizing both land and air forces, displaying a fierce offensive. They are also desperately publicizing and implementing the so-called "Great Encirclement and Annihilation Battle" to confuse observers. Our side, recognizing their deceit, is adopting a resolute posture and utilizing strong forces to meet the enemy head-on, while simultaneously using large forces to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's rear, cutting the enemy into numerous pieces in the intricate mountainous regions, and encircling and annihilating them separately. Although a small contingent of the enemy on the Yongwu Road managed to bypass and advance to the north of Shuangqiao, the majority have consistently stalled in the Gaofengao area. The enemy on the Yongbin Road is still being besieged by us in the areas north and south of Binyang County. In addition, the enemy blindly charging towards the vicinity of Shanglin is providing our army with an excellent opportunity for capture and annihilation. Therefore, annihilation operations have already begun. Important strongholds such as Yongchun and Gantang have been successively recovered, killing thousands of enemies. Simultaneously, along the Yongqin line, our army, with sharp momentum, has successively captured strongholds such as Bainazhina, Mengna, Bailangwei, Dasi, Guitai, etc., completely controlling the enemy's rear communications, causing the enemy to feel greatly threatened. The enemy's morale has plummeted. In recent days, there have been many instances of suicide among soldiers on the front lines due to war-weariness and fear of battle, with internal anxiety beyond description.

Area of Wuyuan

Since being defeated by us last week, they have continued to reinforce, launching a large-scale assault on us in several routes. Our army had already made thorough deployments, inflicting heavy casualties by attacking them on separate routes, while simultaneously using a large force to bypass the enemy's rear and strike directly at the enemy's stronghold while it was empty. The enemy's return route was cut off by us. Furthermore, all areas west of Suiyuan are being cleared and evacuated, preventing the enemy from establishing a foothold anywhere, forcing them to experience the suffering of being increasingly entrapped, with no way to advance or retreat. The invading enemy has thus been separated by us and is being eliminated piece by piece. In recent days, our northern soldiers have leveraged the natural terrain of the Wula Mountains to unleash powerful attacks on the recklessly advancing enemy, achieving remarkable results. The sacred western Suiyuan battlefield will undoubtedly become the burial ground for the stubborn enemy.

Japanese Army in Hubei Province

After suffering repeated heavy losses in the Tongbai Mountains, the enemy recently gathered remnants of their forces, advancing actively towards the Dahong Mountains from both northern and central Hubei. Our army met the enemy on separate routes, engaging in fierce battles in areas north of the Jingzhong Road. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Strongholds such as Dongerling and Huanggujians were successively recovered, and an assault was launched on Sanyangdian, relentlessly pursuing the defeated enemy, killing over a thousand of them. Simultaneously, our elite forces behind enemy lines took advantage of the situation to launch fierce attacks on Suixian, Yujiadian, and Xujiadian in northern Hubei, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. They then attacked the enemy's core strongholds, southeast and east of Suixian, killing countless enemies. Due to the cleverness and agility of our strategy and tactics, the enemy was caught off guard and suffered crushing blows everywhere. Our army in that area has established an absolutely dominant position and is currently intensifying the mop-up operations against the remaining enemy forces.

Southeastern Shanxi Province

The enemy has suffered repeated heavy blows from our army in the past month, with seven to eight thousand casualties. They are currently trapped in Changzhi, Huguan, Changzi, and other places, afraid to make any aggressive moves. The enemy in the areas of Jiexian, Yuxiang, and Yongji in southern Shanxi has been reinforced by over three thousand troops and over ten artillery pieces in the past week, attempting to resist our attacking army. Our army, taking advantage of our victory, continued to attack, achieving great results in recent days. On the morning of the 7th, enemies from Xin, Wenxi, and Jiangxian County ventured out in several groups, attempting to contain our army, but were repelled in a counter-attack, killing the enemy's battalion commander, Kubota, and several hundred others, capturing many spoils of war. Our battle-hardened warriors, defending the strongholds of Zhongtiao Mountain, repeatedly displayed their skills in killing the enemy during the Spring Festival, providing cause for national excitement.

Chinese Army in Southern Henan Province

On the night of the 5th, taking the enemy by surprise, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy's important stronghold, Wulidian, east of Xinyang. The enemy, numbering about a thousand, was more than halved by our annihilation. The remaining enemy retreated westward, and the area was recaptured. They are currently continuing to press towards Xinyang. Over a thousand enemies in Qinyang, northern Henan, have been invading Mapo in the west for several days, but were also repelled, with many killed or captured.

Remnants of Japanese Troops in Xiaoshan

After continuous attacks, the Chinese have successively captured outposts such as Shiwujian, Hanjia Mountain, Jinjia Mountain, Huzhua Mountain, Dashang Village, Shiyan Mountain, Shijing Mountain, Chang Mountain, Mojia Port, and Jiangtang. The enemies have retreated back to the north bank in disarray, stricken with fear.

Chinese Artillery

Continuous shelling of enemy warships has been exceptionally effective. It is estimated that over the course of a week, a total of fourteen enemy warships, both large and small, have been damaged, and one has been sunk in the waters of Huangshi, Wuxue, Pengze, Xiangkou, and Hukou. The enemy's traffic on the lower Yangtze River has been almost completely controlled by us, causing them to be in a difficult situation of communication and supply issues. (11th)

### Brief News

Chengdu - Many unemployed vagrants in Chengdu recently volunteered to the authorities to go to Sichuan to kill the Japanese. The police chief of the provincial capital gave each person a bonus of one yuan and presented them with a flag at a farewell ceremony at the police station on the 10th. (10th)

Shaoguan - Over three thousand able-bodied men from Yingde, Yangshan, Lianxian, and other counties have volunteered to join the fight against Japan. Many continue to volunteer. The师管区 has submitted a report to the military district, requesting the formation of volunteer corps in accordance with the law. (10th)

### Recent Sino-Japanese Military Dynamics

Since the end of winter, the Japanese forces on each front seem to be making moves, but the southwestern and northwestern fronts seem to be more active. In southern Guangxi, the Japanese forces, without diminishing their ferocity despite repeated heavy losses, are instead attempting to circumvent and break through, advancing lightly and recklessly, causing disturbances in the areas between Binyang, Shanglin, and Litang. On the western Suiyuan front, they are making incursions along the river and mountains in several routes towards Wulin, all the way to the border of Suining. Bitter battles are being fought daily along the Baoningsui Highway and between the Daqing Mountains and the western Ula Mountains. Furthermore, south of the Qianjiang River, although the Chinese forces have recovered Xiaoshan, the remnants of the Japanese forces are still putting up a stubborn resistance; on the side of the Dahong Mountains, the Japanese forces, exhausted, are nevertheless reinforcing and intruding. Combining these dynamics, it seems that today's Japan, although in dire straits politically, economically, and diplomatically, still possesses the strength to make some aggressions in its military operations in China. However, is this evidence of Japan's remaining strength or evidence of a spent force?

Speaking of Japan's failures in the economic, diplomatic, and political fields, it is something that no one can deny; even among the Japanese themselves, their dissatisfaction often manifests itself invisibly. Saito's speech, which shook the Japanese political world, seems to criticize the Konoe Statement, which the previous authorities held as a guiding principle, for being too passive and insufficient to compensate the Japanese people's losses. However, its implicit meaning exposes the general Japanese people's significant frustration and disappointment with the military and political authorities. Even if the Japanese authorities punish Saito and censor the record, they cannot deceive the people. The precarious political situation in Japan, which has resulted from this, is continuing to evolve, and it is difficult to predict how it will ultimately unfold. However, what can be recognized is that this kind of political unease is a reflection of its military failures in China. Even in military operations, although the Japanese can still hold some points and lines in China today, or perhaps seize the opportunity to attempt some aggressions, they have achieved no significant success in strategic deployment. Since the war entered its second phase, the Japanese military's actions have become increasingly fragmented and scattered, engaging only in trivial speculation. Its objectives are extremely disorganized, and its actions are sluggish. Moreover, repeated failures and heavy losses have depleted its elite forces; even if it occasionally makes some progress, it has no value in military strategy, nor does it have any stimulating effect domestically or internationally. Recently, the Japanese political commentator, Baba Haruki, said of Japan, "Even if the Japanese army can attack Chongqing in the future, what should be done then?" This is a pointed remark, and, like Saito's speech, it represents the general Japanese people's suspicion of the war of aggression against China and their lack of trust in their authorities. Truly, to speak of military affairs today, it is impossible to separate them from political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. All kinds of phenomena in the rear area are sufficient to affect the success or failure of the military operations on the front lines. The level of hardship of the Japanese military forces in the current stage may not be as great as that of the political, economic, and diplomatic aspects, but compared with the early stage of the war of resistance, the strength and sharpness have been greatly reduced. Judging its situation afterward, it will inevitably get worse and worse. This is not subjective opinion but is inevitable and certain according to reason and principle.

Last autumn, the Japanese zaibatsu, seeing that the war of aggression against China had been making little progress for a long time, took the step of unifying military power in China. As a result, Nishio and Itagaki came to China. What has been their performance in the half-year since then? For example, on both the northern and southern ends of the Yuehan Railway, in the autumn, they advanced from northern Hunan, and this spring, they targeted northern Guangdong. Since they failed to take the offensive simultaneously at both ends to coordinate, this has shown the exhaustion of their strength, and the results, a defeat in Hunan and another defeat in Guangdong, have even more clearly shown that their sharpness has been exhausted. Recently, in the southern Guangxi campaign, they were unable to seek out strongholds in the West River in advance to act as supports for Yongfang, so the invading troops were forced to go deep alone, only able to rely on a single fortress to conflict back and forth. Also, in the northwestern campaign, the Japanese forces only used light cavalry to appear and disappear in the vast desert wilderness, and there were no significant military actions on both sides of the Yellow River to echo. All of these kinds of things, on the one hand, originated from the Japanese military's shortfall in strength, and they could not cope with the extensive battlefield; on the other hand, they can also be seen in the fragmentation of the Japanese military deployment, and the so-called unification of military power in China to facilitate dispatch and deployment is just empty talk. In the southwestern and northwestern wars, in form, the Japanese seemed determined to cut off China's foreign communications; in fact, the Japanese forces in southern Guangxi had more than enough power to cause disturbances, but had insufficient remaining strength to delve deeper, and it was difficult to secure each stronghold near Nanning. Furthermore, there are many external channels in the southwest, and the Japanese are hardly able to block them. As for the northwestern region, from western Suiyuan to northern Ningxia, the area is impoverished, barren, and desolate for thousands of miles, and has little significant value in economic or military terms; and as for Sino-Soviet communications, the line from Linyi to Kulun has always been seldom used by China and the Soviet Union, so the Japanese military's invasion of western Suiyuan is not enough to affect the northwestern transportation routes, which is very clear. Some say: "The Japanese military's recent offensive is only intended to excite domestic and foreign opinion, and will end with the closure of the Diet." Judging the state of the war situation, it is quite close to this; because this kind of action, which lacks careful deployment, can only seek luck by taking risks. It has no value whatsoever in military or political affairs. Moreover, the Chinese army's strategy and strength are advancing rapidly day by day, and even if the Japanese army gains something by taking risks and seeking luck, it will lose it soon after. In the face of his restlessness, and this perseverance, can it be said that we will achieve results? The time of collapse and departure has come.

### President Roosevelt's Speech Criticizes Soviet Dictatorship; Nine-Tenths of the American People Sympathize with Finland; Encourages Young People to Fight to Maintain Democracy

Washington - Yesterday afternoon, President Roosevelt stood on the steps of the White House and addressed members of the American Youth Citizen Association. He began by recounting the American history of the past decade, then spoke of Finland. When the word "Finland" had just been uttered, the audience applauded non-stop. The President said that 98 percent of Americans sympathize with Finland. The assertion that the Soviet Union will declare war on the United States is sheer nonsense, akin to saying that the United States will declare war on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a dictatorship, similar in its autocracy to other dictatorships in the world. The Soviet Union's war against Finland is a direct invasion of the territory of a neighbor which is very small and will never harm the Soviet Union. I no longer have any illusions about the Soviet Union's experiment in its political system. Twenty years ago, I was very sympathetic to the Russian people. At the beginning of the implementation of communism, I recognized that many Russian leaders were providing education, hygiene, and better opportunities to the hundreds of millions of people who were ignorant and enslaved under the imperial regime. However, I do not like communism. I detest the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people. I especially hate the elimination of religion. However, I know that one day Russia will return to the embrace of religion, because four to five thousand years of history have proven that humanity always believes in the true God and will not change because of actions to reject the true God. We all used to hope that Russia could solve its own problems and eventually form a democratically elected government that loves peace and does not interfere with the integrity of its neighbors, but this hope is now either shattered or put on hold for the future. I have heard that some of you are members of the Communist Party. This is not a matter suited to the current sentiment of the people. Although you are legally and constitutionally entitled to call yourself communists, you do not have the right in the United States to change the government and the constitution of this country by any actions. But I am confident that I will have the support of your group and the majority of any other group of American youth. What you and I represent is essentially the same thing. When I step down from office in the future, it will be your responsibility to continue to strive to protect free politics and to improve its working methods and efficiency. We should especially help all those who have proven their hard work and want to improve the happiness of our people every year. May you each maintain noble ideals, stand firm, and gain eternal joy. May this be your aspiration. (Reuters, 11th)

Washington - President Roosevelt delivered a speech to the members of the American Youth Citizen Association at the White House today, discussing the United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union. He said, "The Soviet Union is an absolutely autocratic country, no different from other autocratic countries in the world." Regarding the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, he expressed deep sympathy for Finland and declared that he was willing to provide financial assistance. Diplomatic circles here have commented that there is an unbridgeable gap between democracy and dictatorship, whether it is a communist or national socialist dictatorship. As for the assistance to Finland, Lewis, chairman of the Industrial Improvement Association, recently expressed his opposition, which is completely contrary to the president's views. It can be seen that the president is willing to sever ties with the extreme left in the country, thereby comforting the conservatives. This aspect is extremely important in domestic politics and is sufficient to greatly influence the election campaign. (Havas, 10th)

### U.S. Navy to Hold Large-Scale Exercises in the Pacific on Schedule; Purpose Clearly to Demonstrate Strength to Japan

Washington - The U.S. fleet's naval exercises in the Pacific are only sixty days away. Diplomatic and naval circles here unanimously believe that these exercises have serious repercussions for the United States' national defense and foreign policy. Although U.S. naval officials say that these exercises have nothing to do with foreign policy, experienced naval diplomatic observers all recognize that these exercises have an important significance in diplomacy, fully demonstrating that the United States will show its strength in its border at the appropriate time. As U.S.-Japan relations become more tense this year, this type of exercise has a significant meaning for Japan. (United Press, 11th)

### America Tightens Pressure; Japan Feels Anxious; Assemblymen Ask the Government What Measures to Take

Tokyo - At the Budget Committee yesterday, Diet member Yutani claimed that the actions of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee have enabled the US to lend another 20 million US dollars to China, which clearly shows that the US is intensifying its pressure on Japan. According to Prime Minister Yonai's statement in the Diet the day before yesterday, if the US takes a more pressing attitude towards Japan, Japan is prepared to take responsive steps. Considering the current US attitude of continuing to lend to China, the situation mentioned by Prime Minister Yonai can be said to have already occurred. He asked what methods the government will use to deal with it. The Foreign Minister replied that the Japanese government has not received formal notification of the US intention to lend to China. He also said that the Japanese government is currently considering various ways to cope with the new situation, but these measures cannot be announced at this time. (Eleventh day, United Press dispatch)

Washington - Well-informed sources in Congress claimed yesterday that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee intends to lend a new loan of 20 million US dollars to China, which, while reducing congressional pressure for an embargo against Japan, Republican Senator Johnson claimed that the embargo situation is "mysterious." (Eleventh day, United Press dispatch)

Tokyo - The general questioning at the House of Representatives Budget Committee will end on the 12th of this month. Starting from the 13th, it will switch to questioning by various subcommittees. However, because the questioners at the general meeting only finished nine people by the 10th, and on that day, the questioning by Mr. Miyoshi Nobufusa needs to continue on the 12th. Others include Zhu Song Xieyilang (Minseito), Ogasawara Sankuro (Seiyukai Nakajima faction), Nakamura Sanzojo (Minseito), Tsukamoto Juzo (Social Masses Party), Oyama Ryo (Shikyoku Doshikai), Nagawa Kanichi (Seiyukai Kuhara faction), Sakamoto Sotaro (First Control Room), and Matsumura Kozo (Seiyukai Unification Faction). As such, after discussion on the 9th, it was decided to extend the questioning to the 14th, with the subcommittee starting on the 15th. It is also planned that the subcommittee will be completed on the 19th, with a decision-making meeting held on the 20th. (Eleventh day, Domei dispatch)

### Difficulties in Adjusting Japan-Soviet Relations; Negotiations on Various Pending Issues Stalled; Japanese Assemblymen Frequently Ask the Government Questions

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Arita expressed optimism about Japan-Soviet relations in a speech he delivered in the House of Representatives on the first of this month. Unexpectedly, before the words were even cold, the news of the dissolution of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Joint Committee was announced on the same day, which surprised public opinion. According to Foreign Minister Arita's explanation, the dissolution of the committee was only announced at 4 p.m. on the first of this month, so he could not mention it in his speech. On the 7th of this month, when the House of Representatives Budget Committee met, several assemblymen raised questions about the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. The details of what happened are not fully known to outsiders, and are now recorded as follows:

Minseito assemblyman Matsumoto first asked, "Since the Japanese government is adjusting its relations with the Soviet Union, I wonder if it intends to find a way to make the Soviet Union stop assisting the Chinese Nationalist government?" Foreign Minister Arita immediately replied, "The Japanese people must still be wary of the Soviet Union and must not be negligent in the slightest." He also said, "The Anti-Comintern Pact is not aimed at the Soviet Union. For this reason, Japan's attempt to adjust relations with the Soviet Union does not conflict with the Anti-Comintern Pact." Then he answered another assemblyman's question, saying, "In my opinion, Germany and the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression pact does not mean abandoning the Anti-Comintern Pact. Japan still firmly adheres to this pact." Minseito assemblyman Kuboi then asked about the deadlock in the work of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Committee. Foreign Minister Arita replied that a small committee could be formed on general boundary issues to discuss them anew in order to seek a solution. Land Minister Hata also replied, "The continuous intrusion of a small number of Soviet troops across the boundary line has made it impossible to resolve the boundary issue. The boundary work was originally the responsibility of the military authorities of both sides, and then it was transferred to the diplomatic representatives to preside over, and some progress has indeed been made."

At this point, assemblyman Matsu further asked, "It is rumored that after the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement was concluded, Japanese officers and soldiers were illegally captured by the Red Army when they were searching for the remains of fallen soldiers in the area based on the agreement. I wonder if this is true?" Land Minister Hata avoided answering directly, only saying that he would find a way to explain the implementation of the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement at an appropriate opportunity in the near future. In addition, Yamaoka, the chief of the police bureau of the Ministry of the Interior, also submitted a report to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, stating that regarding the deadlock in the work of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Committee, "The Japan Times actually published this news on July 30, two days before the official announcement of the matter. The police bureau therefore detained the newspaper on that day." The assemblymen paid considerable attention after hearing this report. The news of the "Japan Times" caused a great shock, but the authorities only officially released it two days later and announced at the same time that there were two other joint committees organized by representatives of Japan and the Soviet Union, which had never been mentioned before, and would meet in the short term to discuss general boundary issues and other ways to resolve pending issues. The purpose of this was obviously to correct the negative impression caused by the news published in the "Japan Times." As for other negotiations conducted by Japan and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Arita's main answers are as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of concluding a long-term fisheries agreement, there has been no progress in the negotiations between the two sides. This year, the temporary agreement will still be used as the basis. (2) Regarding the issue of concluding a business agreement, the two sides are negotiating in Moscow, and there are still some difficult points that need to be resolved. (3) Regarding the issue of protecting Japan's interests in Sakhalin Island, the Japanese government has repeatedly protested to the Soviet Union, but as of now, the situation has improved very little.

### Japanese Assemblymen Express Distrust of the Wang Puppet Government

Beijing - When the House of Representatives Budget Committee met on the 8th of this month, Seiyukai assemblyman Ando Masazumi asked about the relationship between the Jingwei "new regime" and the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, saying that the anti-Japanese and pro-communist Chinese Nationalist government and Wang both claim to adhere to the Three Principles of the People, "but in fact, the Three Principles of the People is communism." Therefore, there is still a possibility of causing an anti-Japanese movement in the future. Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa, replied at the time, "The interpretation of the Three Principles of the People is very broad and often involves ambiguity. According to Wang Jingwei's explanation, this doctrine is based on Orientalism. He has been influenced by Japanese thought and has revised some of the principles included in the Three Principles of the People. In my personal opinion, Japan must be careful to prevent the Three Principles of the People advocated by Wang from tending towards anti-Japanese and pro-communist doctrines."

### Japan's Naval Expansion Plan Targets the United States

Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch states that a certain assemblyman of the orthodox faction of the Seiyukai raised a question in the Budget Committee, asking the government to explain whether the government can ensure the safety of national defense if there are no problems with the expenses required for the military expansion plan of the army and navy listed in the 1940-1941 budget案. Navy Minister Yoshida said that national defense can be guaranteed without problems if the above-mentioned naval expansion plan is based on the Second and Third Vinson Plans, which are related to each other. Japan's naval replenishment plan is divided into the 1937-1938 naval replenishment and the 1940 naval replenishment plans, both of which were formulated by the authorities after careful study of the Vinson Plan. Land Minister Hata Shunroku said that the army believes that the military expansion plan must be re-established in order to ensure the minimum amount of armaments, achieve the goals of the China Incident, and adapt to the ever-changing international situation. The plan formulated by the army is based on national strength and is a minimum requirement. The army is determined to strive for the complete safety of national defense. (Eleventh day dispatch)

### Japan's National Foundation Day; Promulgation of Amnesty

Tokyo - Today is the 2,600th anniversary of Japan's founding. The Japanese Emperor issued an amnesty decree, releasing approximately 222,000 prisoners, reducing sentences for approximately 40,000, and maintaining the original sentences for approximately 180,000. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)

### Central Government's Instructions; Discussing the Scope of Constitutional Government

Chongqing - Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang resolved on November 6 last year to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of this year, all parties have attached great importance to this. The government is also actively preparing for the assembly. However, during this preparation period, there are still many issues that all parties are eager to understand, such as the powers of the National Assembly, the issue of representative elections, the issue of the draft constitution, and the way in which all parties study constitutional government, etc. It is now learned that the central government has concrete instructions to the party departments of various provinces and cities and other relevant agencies regarding these issues. The content is specially explored and recorded as follows:

(A) The Meaning of Implementing Constitutional Government

(1) Implementing constitutional government is a consistent proposition of our party. The Premier's lifelong efforts and the President's years of struggle have all been aimed at realizing constitutional government as the main policy. Only our party has adhered to the advocacy of democratic constitutionalism for fifty years. Therefore, the decision of our party to convene the National Assembly this time is actually to realize the consistent proposition of our party for decades. All our party comrades and the whole country should approach it with the utmost loyalty and prudence. (2) The relationship between constitutional government and political tutelage. Although the division of the three periods of military government, political tutelage, and constitutional government contains the meaning of gradual progress, the government can implement constitutional government before the work of political tutelage is completed in order to respond to the requirements of the times and promote political progress, and continue to complete the work of political tutelage after the start of constitutional government. This is something that everyone can appreciate from the Premier's will and the President's speech at the National Political Council in September last year. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand the implementation of constitutional government, and on the other hand, we demand that after the implementation of constitutional government, we continue to carry out the unfinished work of political tutelage.

(B) Election and Powers of the National Assembly

(1) Election. The National Assembly Organization Law and the National Representative Election Law have been solemnly promulgated by the National Government in accordance with legislative procedures, and have been implemented by the National Government. The representatives elected in accordance with the election law should be valid in principle, except for those who are near to and have evidence of rebellion, and should be dealt with by the government in accordance with the law. (2) Powers. According to Article 1 of the Organization Law, the task of this National Assembly is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution. Its nature is purely a constitution-making organ. As for the exercise of the powers conferred by the constitution, it remains to be seen in the future. The reason why the National Assembly Organization Law elected in accordance with the constitution does not stipulate that this National Assembly should exercise the powers conferred by the constitution is because the constitution should stipulate which agency should implement the constitution. If the Organization Law stipulates that the constitution-making National Assembly should exercise the powers conferred by the constitution, it would be tantamount to determining the issues that should be determined in the constitution by the Organization Law, limiting the power of the constitutional organ by the Organization Law, predetermining the content of the constitution, and granting it in advance, which is not in accordance with the law for the constitution-making organ.

(C) Issues Concerning the Draft Constitution

(1) The legality of the draft constitution. The draft constitution announced by the National Government was drafted by the Legislative Yuan, which gathered public law scholars from all over the country, based on the Outline of National Reconstruction and the achievements of the administration during the period of political tutelage, after two years of effort. After the completion of the first draft, it was publicly solicited for criticism from the people all over the country within six months, and then it was carefully studied by the Central Executive Committee of our party, and the opinions of the people all over the country were incorporated as much as possible, and it was designated as a draft and sent to the National Government for promulgation. Therefore, the promulgation of the draft has actually completed all the procedures, and its legality is beyond doubt. The National Government must submit the draft to the National Assembly in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction. (2) The National Assembly's right to decide. The National Assembly naturally has the right to decide on the draft constitution. The opinions of our party comrades on the draft constitution can be contributed to the Central Committee within a certain period of time, and submitted to the National Assembly after verification by the Central Committee. The claims of the National Political Council's Constitutional Government Promotion Association on the draft constitution can also be sent to the government and transferred to the National Assembly for adoption after being passed by the National Political Council. The opinions of other legal organizations on the draft constitution will also be submitted to the National Assembly for consideration through the introduction of representatives of the National Assembly or other legal means.

(D) Discussion on Constitutional Government Issues

(1) Meetings. Regarding meetings to discuss constitutional government issues, such as seminars, discussion meetings, and lectures, etc., each province and city will be convened by each city's party department and government, together with the local council, in order to collect public opinion widely, and use it as an aid to constitutional government propaganda. (2) Organizing groups. Before the end of this war, the government cannot but set necessary restrictions on the organization of groups for the study of constitutional government, so as to avoid abuses. In Chongqing, the Constitutional Government Promotion Association of the National Political Council is a legitimate organ for studying constitutional government and contributing opinions to the government. For the sake of concentrating opinions, there is no need for other organizations. If it is necessary to organize in other provinces and cities, the party department and government of each province and city must also organize a constitutional government research group in conjunction with the council to lead the research on constitutional government issues in each place. (3) Scope of discussion. All remarks that oppose constitutional government, violate the Three Principles of the People, and distort constitutional government should be included in the list of bans. From now on, party members of our party must not violate the established policies of our party and publish remarks that oppose constitutional government. (Eleventh day dispatch)

### American Reporter Young Still Not Released; Editor of Yomiuri Shimbun Summoned by Japanese Police Bureau

Tokyo - American International News Service correspondent in Tokyo, Young, has not been released since he was arrested by the Japanese police bureau on January 1 of this year. "News of the News" Weekly Special recently carried a story saying that Suzuki, the editor of the international edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun, had dealings with Young and was recently summoned by the police bureau to clarify what kind of relationship he had with Young. Young has lived in Japan for ten years and knows many important figures in Japanese society. He is familiar with Japanese customs and can do Japanese-style dances. When he traveled to China, he repeatedly sent manuscripts to the Yomiuri Shimbun, which the newspaper adopted and published one by one. The president of the newspaper is also a friend of Young. When Young arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing, he made a statement to the reporter of the Shanghai Continental Newspaper, saying, "The situation in Japan this winter will definitely be very bleak." At this point, the Japanese authorities began to pay close attention to Young's words and deeds. After Hearst, the general manager of the American International News Service, heard of Young's arrest, he was furious and immediately telegraphed Young, warning him, "All Hearst's newspapers and periodicals publish news impartially and powerfully. What you have done is 'shameful'," etc. The conclusion of "News of the News" is that in the past, there were many boring foreigners who engaged in other work in Japan under the guise of foreign newspaper reporters. For the sake of Japan and for the sake of foreign reporters themselves, these scum should be eliminated." (Eighth day, Havas dispatch)

The English-language Great American Evening Post said that American International News Service correspondent Young, after coming to Shanghai in October last year, spoke freely to a reporter of the Continental Newspaper on October 20 about the lack of important materials in Japan, the sharp decline in foreign trade, the turbulent political situation, and unfavorable foreign relations. This is the main reason why Young was recently arrested in Japan. According to a Tokyo newspaper, the Japanese side has carefully investigated Young's words and writings ever since. (Note: Young's statement to the reporter of the Continental Newspaper was translated and published in the Shen Bao on October 21 last year.)

### American Industrial Improvement Association Suggests Merger with the AFL

Washington - Industrial Improvement Association Chairman Lewis has proposed that all members of the association join the American Federation of Labor (AFL) on March 15. At the same time, Lewis also asked President Roosevelt to inquire whether AFL President Green would be willing to accept this proposal. According to Lewis's proposal, the Industrial Improvement Association and the AFL will hold a joint conference to establish a merger bill between the two associations. He is willing not to seek any position in the merged AFL. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)

### US Under Secretary of State's Mission to Europe; Seeking Sound Post-War Reconstruction Economy; To Achieve Lasting Peace Goals

Washington - Secretary of State Hull claimed here yesterday while hosting newspaper reporters that post-war peace and economic soundness are the objectives that the United States seeks through talks with other neutral countries, and are also the mission of Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe. The United States has long strived to promote basic concepts in order to formulate the methods and procedures for the stable period of international relations after the end of the war. There are two main points of this policy: one is the reduction of armaments, and the other is the adoption of sound and free commercial policies by various countries. If there is to be economic soundness rather than an all-powerful system after the war, it is necessary to achieve the above-mentioned goals for the sake of the world. When peace comes in the future, it is hoped that all countries will give extremely sincere understanding and restraint to the basic principles necessary for a peaceful world. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)

Washington - After President Roosevelt sent Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe for inspection, Secretary of State Hull then announced that he would hold talks with various neutral countries. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in the United States were quite perplexed and confused, but one point that all parties agreed on was that President Roosevelt still held the same views as before on the fundamental principles on which the European solution should be based. In other words, the main condition for world peace is to eliminate the attempts of various dictatorial countries to dominate and the theories they represent. Then, the reasons why President Roosevelt launched the "peace offensive" can be explained by the following three assumptions: (1) The US government deeply feels that if the belligerent countries want to use military force to resolve the current European war, they must make endless sacrifices. As a result, Europe will eventually fall into an irrecoverable situation. President Roosevelt intends to contact various neutral countries in order to seek a peaceful solution and avoid suffering for the belligerent countries and even the neutral countries. (2) President Roosevelt has probably obtained special intelligence about the truth of the situation in Germany, knowing that the country is in a desperate situation economically and politically, and is afraid that the National Socialist Party authorities will take risks, causing the country and even the entire Europe to encounter a catastrophe. Therefore, he advocates restoring peace as soon as possible. (3) President Roosevelt may, as he claimed, only want to obtain a more detailed report on the European situation, especially the German situation. Therefore, he sent Welles to Europe on the one hand, and exchanged views with various neutral countries on the other hand. In any case, observers believe that these two actions are not detrimental to the basic interests of Britain and France and the belligerent countries of Europe. As far as the current situation is concerned, Roosevelt and Hull do not believe that the views held by both sides of the belligerent countries are likely to be close. Therefore, this launch is not a direct attempt to restore peace, but an attempt to carry out a reconnaissance work. In other words, on the one hand, Vice Secretary Welles will personally go to Europe to inspect the situation, and on the other hand, he will hold talks with various neutral countries in order to ascertain the true views of the belligerent countries and the neutral countries on the future peace. Therefore, it can be seen that the talks that the United States will conduct with various related countries in the future will not only not have any immediate consequences, but will also be based on the assumption that Britain and France will achieve victory. If victory in the future belongs to the two dictatorial countries of Germany and the Soviet Union, then those countries can force other countries in Europe to accept their will, and there will be no need to conduct talks at all. Judging from the launch of this talk by the State Department at this time, it can be seen that it deeply believes that the views held by Britain and France will eventually win. (Eleventh day, Havas dispatch)

Washington - Well-informed sources believe that officials here all know that if the Hitler regime still exists, any attempt to establish a sound and stable international policy will be impossible. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)

New York - The local newspapers have made many comments on President Roosevelt's dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe. Although officials said that this trip was purely for inspection purposes, most newspapers did not believe it, and most believed that the President's move was an attempt to end the current European war, and warned the people not to have excessive hopes for Welles' trip. The "World News" stated that if Welles could find a common basis for conducting peace talks between Britain and Germany, it would not be impossible for the President to put forward peace proposals. As for whether Welles can find this basis, it is extremely foolish to make speculations at this time. What can be asserted is that the information received by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull is no more detailed than what we know. Therefore, the authorities need to make further investigations. In any case, we do not need to be pessimistic about the future of the situation. (Tenth day, Havas dispatch)

### Berlin Maintains Silence

Berlin - Officials here have remained silent on US Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Germany, without any expression. At the same time, the German press has not commented on it, but political figures have felt great "interest" in this matter. (Eleventh day, United Press dispatch)

The Hague - The local "Tele-News" correspondent in Berlin recently sent a telegram saying that German officials were very concerned after hearing that US Under Secretary of State Welles was about to visit Europe, but on the surface they still pretended to be indifferent. In fact, the National Socialist Party authorities have declared to foreign reporters more than once that "only the United States can launch peace talks." One thing that deserves attention is that before the outbreak of the European War, when US President Roosevelt sent a telegram calling for peace, German leader Hitler and the leaders of the National Socialist Party were very indifferent to it. But this time, they felt great interest in Welles' trip. Their attitude was obviously different before and after. Moreover, German commentators mostly compared Welles' trip to the trip of the late US President Wilson's Colonel House to Europe during the last European War. However, the result of Colonel House's visit to Europe did not restore peace, but made the United States join the Allied Powers and fight together to defend freedom. This is something that must be known. (Eleventh day, Havas dispatch)

### Rome Recognizes Difficulty in Achieving Success

Rome: The news that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles is coming to Europe for inspection and is scheduled to travel by ship to Italy on the 17th of this month has been received with great interest by the general public, who believe that the Italian government will be sympathetic to Welles' mission. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's purpose is to explore the possibility of mediating peace in the future. The U.S. government attaches equal importance to both "Fascist Rome" and "Vatican Rome," as evidenced by the simultaneous arrival of Under Secretary Welles and President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, in Italy. However, some sources say that Welles' mission is unlikely to achieve any results. (Havas, 11th)

Rome: Although the news of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe has aroused great interest in political circles here, the general public cannot help but doubt the actual results of U.S. Secretary of State Hull's discussions with neutral countries on peace issues. Only one Italian newspaper commented on the matter, saying that President Wilson's previous actions have not been forgotten, and President Roosevelt's repeated speeches are still fresh in people's minds. It is almost impossible to create hope that Washington can launch an initiative that will produce practical results. A semi-official Vatican source said that anything that can clarify the situation and help the peace movement can only be viewed with goodwill. (Reuters, 11th)

### Dutch Public Opinion Expresses Welcome

Amsterdam: Although official circles here have not expressed an opinion on the mission of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe, various newspapers have stated that the Netherlands welcomes such steps, even if it does not hold great hope for them. The Dutch government learned of this U.S. action after receiving a telegram from the Dutch ambassador to the United States, which seemed unexpected. It is currently studying the telegram. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, no informal or diplomatic talks have actually begun. A Rotterdam newspaper said that Germany and Italy may not trust Welles because the United States sympathizes with the Allied Powers. Furthermore, the U.S. plan does not involve Finland and the Soviet Union, which is also a weakness. (Reuters, 11th)

### Balkan Countries Conduct Staff Talks; Aim to Establish Mutual Assistance Measures; Economic Conference Scheduled for May

London: According to sources in the political circles of the Balkan Peninsula countries, staff members of the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia) will conduct talks in accordance with the agreement established at the permanent political conference in the capital of Yugoslavia on the 2nd of this month. The goal is to establish mutual assistance measures, that is, if one of the Entente countries is attacked by another country in the Balkan Peninsula or any country outside the peninsula, the other Entente countries should immediately come to its aid. It is expected that the staff members of the four countries will conduct talks with strict confidentiality. This is not to keep the military agreements established by these countries secret, but because these countries do not want to publish this information to avoid causing misunderstandings by other countries. As for the policy of active assistance to Finland by Britain and France, the Entente countries deeply agree and believe that British and French aid to Finland indirectly helps the Balkan Entente countries. Because the Soviet Union has concentrated all its efforts on Northern Europe, it will inevitably have no time to attend to other matters, so Southeastern Europe can remain calm. Regarding this, according to British informed sources, the policy of British and French aid to Finland is not only supported by the Balkan Entente countries, but also more likely to win the sympathy of the United States. U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles will inevitably discuss the war between Finland and the Soviet Union with British and French authorities when he comes to Europe in the future. The hope of success in this regard is greater than the hope of restoring peace in Europe. (Havas, 10th)

Yugoslav Capital: The Balkan Entente countries conference previously passed a resolution to convene a Balkan Entente countries economic conference. It has been learned from here that the Yugoslav cabinet has begun preparations for the conference, which will be held in May, possibly in the Yugoslav capital. (Haitong, 11th)

Budapest: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, "Magyar Hírlap," published a surprising editorial yesterday, heavily criticizing Romania for attempting to expand the existing military agreements between the Balkan countries into a military alliance against Hungary and Bulgaria. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's remarks denied that Romania was willing to make territorial concessions to Hungary and Bulgaria. The newspaper strongly stated that Hungary is willing to continue to pursue a peaceful policy, but it would be a mistake to think that the Romania-Hungary issue can be resolved with a government gazette, a commission, or a minority rights law. (Haitong, 11th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in the Government; Herriot Delivers Speech; All Doubts Cleared

Paris: The Chamber of Deputies held a closed-door meeting from the day before yesterday to discuss various measures the government intends to take to increase military strength. It was not until 6:30 PM yesterday that the meeting was opened to the public, and the vote of confidence motion jointly signed by the leaders of the various parties was passed unanimously with 534 votes to zero. The motion stated, "After the government authorities made explanations in the closed-door meeting, the discussions among the deputies were filled with patriotism. The Chamber of Deputies is deeply impressed by the government's efforts to enhance the country's material and spiritual strength. It hereby expresses its trust and supports it in achieving the final victory with the assistance of the parliament." Speaker Herriot also delivered a speech after the vote, stating, "The result of this debate has cleared away certain doubts. Not only has Prime Minister Daladier revealed his sincerity and explained everything to us, but the parliament, as the representative of all parties and elements of the French nation, has also obtained clear evidence of this. In short, the spirit of national unity in our country is based on freedom and patriotism, and cannot be destroyed by anything. This debate in the Chamber of Deputies over the past two days has promoted and enhanced this spirit." (Havas, 11th)

Washington: After the passage of the vote of confidence in the government, political figures here have been deeply impressed. They believe that at a time when U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles is about to go to Europe, the French Chamber of Deputies has made this statement, which proves that the country is determined to make the elimination of the national socialist crisis a preliminary condition for peace negotiations. On the German side, Minister Frick's speech yesterday was extremely strong, which is not conducive to Welles' mission. (Havas, 11th)

### Goebbels Makes Speech; Germany Needs Colonies; Included as One of the War Aims; Opposes Hypocritical Neutrality

Brussels: The semi-official Belgian News Agency recently issued a message stating that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels invited eight journalists from neutral countries to a villa near Berlin today and made a speech to them, stating, "Germany is determined to find comprehensive solutions to various major problems, thereby establishing a new order. Therefore, it will not make any concessions on the issues of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Shameful and useless peace conditions will only allow all the problems in Europe to remain, which is not what Germany wants to accept." Regarding the colonial issue, it was not acute before the outbreak of this war, but it should also be included in Germany's war aims thereafter. Regarding the issue of neutrality, Germany is willing to respect all neutral countries, but opposes hypocritical neutrality. Because the country and the people are two and two and two. If a country here declares a neutral policy and allows its people to be manipulated by foreign forces and deliberately show hostility to Germany, it is hypocritical neutrality. Because no matter what country, if it wants to enjoy the benefits of neutrality, it must abide by certain obligations, and it cannot use democracy and freedom of the press as an excuse. (Havas, 10th)

### British Military Fishing Vessels; Two Sunk by Bombing; Three Merchant Ships Damaged

London: The Admiralty announced that as a result of an enemy air raid in the North Sea on Friday, the British military fishing vessels "Bovene" and "Royal Battery" were sunk, losing four officers and eighteen sailors. It is reported that German aircraft descended from the clouds and first sank the "Bovene," and then fired two aerial torpedoes at the "Royal Battery." The "Bovene" weighed 290 tons, and the "Royal Battery" weighed 351 tons. It was also disclosed that several merchant ships were also attacked on Friday, and three were damaged, but none sank. For example, the "Cliveden" (3106 tons) was able to sail into the port on its own after being bombed and strafed. The "Boston Merchant" (371 tons) was also strafed and bombed, but the ship was not hit by a bomb, but was damaged because a bomb exploded in the water. The "Formaster" (306 tons) was damaged by bombing and has been towed to the port. None of these three merchant ships were armed. (Reuters, 11th)

London: German radio claimed that German Grand Admiral Raeder gave a speech to the crew of a German submarine yesterday, saying that submarines and aircraft are Germany's most important weapons against Britain. He said, "This is sufficient, and it will be so in the future." (Reuters, 11th)

### Large-Scale Swedish Raids

Stockholm: Yesterday, the police in Stockholm and Gothenburg conducted the largest investigation of Communist Party members in many years. About 300 police officers participated. The locations of Communist Party agencies and the houses of several Communist Party leaders were searched. Several people have been arrested, and many people have been arrested in Gothenburg, which has long been an important stronghold of the Communist Party. (Reuters, 11th)

### U.S. Government Issues Order; Census to be Conducted Nationwide; Starts on April 1st

Washington: President Roosevelt recently issued an order, co-signed by Secretary of State Hull, stating that a national census will be conducted from April 1st of this year. (The U.S. census is conducted every ten years.) All people aged 18 and over must answer the questions of the investigators, and those who violate this will be punished according to law. (Havas, 10th)

### Takao Saito's Explosive Interrogation; Official Record Translation; Reflects the Suffering and Anxiety of the Japanese People; Shows the Internal Collapse of the Aggressors is Gradually Occurring

Chongqing: Newspapers here believe that the "Saito Incident" that occurred on February 2nd fully demonstrates the internal collapse of Japanese aggression. What Saito said not only questioned the "East Asia New Order" and whether the Konoe Declaration was reasonable, but also questioned the power of Wang Jingwei's government. "Saito's position is completely on the side of the aggressors, but it also shows that the Japanese warlords are no longer able to end their war against China." However, the Japanese parliament has no power to discuss the war, nor does it have the power to discuss peace treaties. This parliament is purely a toy in the hands of the warlords. The power of the political parties in this kind of parliament cannot withstand a kick from the Japanese warlords. Therefore, the only way for the Japanese people to express their true will is through a major revolution. (Associated Press, 6th)

Tokyo: When the Japanese House of Representatives met on the 2nd of this month, Saito, a member of the Minseitō Party, raised an important inquiry. The following is a translation based on the official record of the proceedings:

"Since the outbreak of the China Incident, it has been two and a half years. Japan has now encountered various serious problems at home and abroad. After the formation of the current cabinet, Prime Minister Yonai issued a statement on some current policies, but the content was extremely empty. The declarations he made at the plenary meeting of the Diet were also unclear. After all, what is the cabinet's understanding of national policy is not something that these statements can explain. I hereby raise inquiries on the following three points: (1) the handling of the China Incident, (2) international issues, and (3) domestic issues, with particular emphasis on the first point. I will also present my humble opinions and ask the Prime Minister to frankly explain his views.

### Handling of the China Incident Has Achieved Nothing So Far

How to handle the China Incident is a major issue at present and is the most important of our country's political issues. Therefore, not only I want to know the truth, but also people across the country want to know it. What I want to know is what the future of the China Incident will be, how long it will take, and what the government's proposed solution plan is. The whole country is awaiting answers from this Diet.

The previous Konoe Cabinet resigned without resolving the China Incident. What about the Hiranuma Cabinet? You all know it. The Abe Cabinet declared that it would handle the China Incident with all its strength, but in the end, it achieved nothing and resigned en masse. Now that the current cabinet has taken the stage, it can take this opportunity to jointly review this issue with the people and dare to ask Prime Minister Yonai frankly about the scope and content of the plan for handling the China Incident. These two questions must be answered.

### Significant Military Losses Due to Miscalculations

In my opinion, regarding the current incident, regardless of how China handles it, there are indeed some miscalculations on the Japanese side. We originally decided not to expand the situation and to seek a solution on the spot, but this policy was rejected due to the challenge from the Chinese side. Since then, day after day and month after month, the incident has expanded to this extent. The miscalculations on the Chinese side are self-evident. I have a document here that is worthy of your consideration. The Cabinet Intelligence Bureau published a weekly report on December 13th of last year, containing an article written by the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Staff Department of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, stating that the Sino-Japanese War was caused by China, especially General Chiang Kai-shek, not clearly understanding Japan and accusing Japan of not studying and not understanding China. In other words, the China Incident was caused by the lack of understanding between China and Japan. In fact, even if both countries make the necessary reflections, a large-scale incident is still unavoidable. The eventual occurrence of the Lugouqiao Incident is the destiny of China and Japan and cannot be avoided.

It is no longer in doubt which country will win this war, so it must be resolved as soon as possible. Eliminating the various misfortunes between the Chinese and Japanese nations and laying the foundation for peace is not only the responsibility of Japanese politicians, but also the responsibility of Chinese politicians. As for how to eliminate these misfortunes and how to ensure future stability, this is the only issue at present. Regarding this, the views of China and Japan must be considered together. However, one point that cannot be ignored in handling the China Incident is that the Japanese people and the entire nation have suffered great sacrifices in the past two and a half years. The losses suffered by the people, such as life, property, and freedom, are not easy to compensate. Although it is called an "incident," it is a large-scale war that the Japanese Empire has never experienced. According to Minister Hata's report in the House of Representatives yesterday, the land occupied by the Japanese army is as large as the entire Japanese Empire. This is due to the heroic fighting of the Japanese soldiers. So far, about 100,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed in battle, and hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers have been injured. Those who speak of handling the China Incident cannot but take this into consideration.

### Gambling with the Nation's Fate, Not Caring About Throwing Everything In

Our country fought with China forty years ago and with Russia thirty years ago. You should all be able to recall them. In these two wars, our country threw everything in for the survival of the nation, but the scope of the sacrifices cannot be compared with the current war. What, then, is the way to restore peace? This must be explained. Considering our country's history and its future, the resolution of the China Incident, if it does not compensate the sacrifices suffered by the entire nation, as in previous wars, it will be difficult for the entire nation to accept it, not to mention the soldiers on the front lines. (Applause from the deputies) Whether the government is preparing for this is what I urgently want to know. Prime Minister Yonai once said that the government has formulated an unchanging policy for handling the China Incident. This policy is probably the statement issued by former Prime Minister Konoe on December 22, 1938.

### Doubts About the Five Points of the Konoe Declaration Cannot be Avoided

In my opinion, I cannot help but doubt this statement. I am not opposed to this statement, nor do I disapprove of it. My approval or disapproval must be decided after the government's explanation. I hope you understand this. Since today is the day of inquiry, the concerns we have must be explained. I dare to ask you to also base your thinking on my spirit. There are five points in the Konoe Declaration: (1) respect for Chinese sovereignty, (2) no territorial ambitions in China, and no demand for reparations, (3) Japan does not want to monopolize the Chinese economy, (4) respect for the legitimate rights of third countries in China, and (5) withdrawal of Japanese troops from various places, except for anti-communist areas such as the vicinity of Inner Mongolia. This statement was not only addressed to China and Japan, but also to the whole world. Its content cannot be changed, otherwise Japan will lose face internationally, which goes without saying. Wang Jingwei has made efforts to establish a "New Central Government" in accordance with the spirit of the Konoe Declaration and has repeatedly stated that this statement will not harm the well-being of the Chinese people. According to his explanation, Japan has abandoned imperialism in military and economic terms and said that China and Japan should conduct peace negotiations on an equal footing. Japan should not treat China as a victor at all, and the peace conditions should not hinder China's freedom and independence. If this is the case, then no one can oppose the realization of peace. Wang Jingwei's statement has the above meaning. It has been more than a year since it was issued. During this period, Wang has worked hard to carry out the peace movement. He personally experienced hardships and suffered great sacrifices. The Chinese people and General Chiang Kai-shek's faction have attacked him. Observing the situation from Wang's standpoint, I deeply feel that he cannot abandon the statement he made.

### Increased Burden on the People; How Will the Sacrifices be Compensated?

If not, the peace movement and the plan to establish a "new regime" will inevitably fail. When I mention this, I want to ask about the scope and content of the government's proposed plan to resolve the China Incident. In my opinion, the government's answer must be that it fully respects Chinese sovereignty, that is, it will avoid interfering in China's internal affairs and diplomacy in the future. Any action that has the suspicion of interference is an infringement of Chinese sovereignty. In addition, Japan does not intend to seize Chinese territory or demand reparations. I do not know how much our country has spent on the China Incident, but judging from the military expenses approved by the House of Representatives, it has reached 1.2 billion yen. The total may be between 20 billion and 30 billion yen, or perhaps even more. After our country has spent so much military expenses, it has not gained a single cent in China. All the expenses will be borne by our national people, and even future generations will have to bear them forever.

Also, although the saying that the Chinese economy will be developed by our country in the future is very popular, according to the Konoe Declaration, our country cannot demand to monopolize the Chinese economy, nor can it demand that the new China restrict the rights and interests of third countries. If this is the case, I cannot help but be confused. Our country's politicians have loudly called on the people, saying, "The goal of the current policy is to exclude the forces of European and American countries from China, liberate China, not allow it to be exploited by European and American countries and be in a colonial position, and make China once again belong to the Chinese people." This kind of statement is groundless and is completely different from the Konoe Declaration. I do not know why it is still said today.

### Absolutely Believe That It Is Impossible To Withdraw Troops From China

As for the issue of troop withdrawal, according to Wang Jingwei, troop withdrawal is the most important point in the Konoe Declaration and should be implemented simultaneously on all front lines as soon as possible. Only the area of Inner Mongolia can allow Japan to station troops after China and Japan sign an anti-Comintern agreement. If this is the case, after our country's troops withdraw from the occupied areas, what will be left? This is what I am very confused about. If you compare Wang Jingwei's statement with the Konoe Declaration, you can find that they are completely similar. In other words, both of them believe that in order for Japan to establish peace with the "new regime" in China, the first step is to withdraw troops from China, with the exception of North China and Inner Mongolia. That is, the land where the Japanese army has fought and suffered pain for two and a half years should be withdrawn. Is this the meaning of the Konoe Declaration? Does the Japanese government really intend to implement it? This is what I require the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Army and Navy to explain."

### What is the Meaning of the So-Called "New Order"?

Furthermore, regarding the handling of the China Incident and the establishment of a "new order" in East Asia, discussions have been frequently mentioned. Just yesterday alone, in the House of Representatives, numerous speakers mentioned "the new order in East Asia." However, at the beginning of the China Incident, this term was unknown. It was first used when former Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement on November 3, 1938. According to Foreign Minister Arita's statement to the House of Representatives yesterday, the term "new order" had already appeared in Europe several years ago. It is unclear whether the so-called establishment of a "new order" in Europe refers to poor countries demanding land from wealthy countries, which is a form of international communism. In reality, it seems to be the destruction and annexation of small countries by large countries in a struggle for survival, a violent act of destruction. As for our country, we have no interest in Europe and need not consider it. Then, what is the nature of establishing a new order in the Far East? According to the statements issued by Konoe and Wang Jingwei, the establishment of a "new order in East Asia" should be based on the following three principles: first, good neighborly relations; second, joint anti-communism; and third, economic cooperation. We have further questions: Is this definition approved by the government? Are the basic principles of the "new order in East Asia" limited to these three items? Are there other goals included? If there are other goals, we request the government to provide explanations. If the government is unable to disclose them, I dare not insist on this request. But in any case, the current war is wasting huge sums of money. It is aimed at establishing a "new order in East Asia," resulting in such great sacrifices. I sincerely hope that the government can frankly express its views on the so-called "new order in East Asia." Regarding this matter, the Special Committee of the Asia Development Board previously conducted research on the "new order in East Asia." The results were reported to the government by the board on December 11, 1939. I also have a copy of this report. The contents contain various terms that people like us who do not participate in politics cannot understand. (Applause from the members) This will be set aside for the moment. But since the "new order in East Asia" is the goal of this large-scale war and the various sacrifices it has caused, why did this term only appear after a year and a half of fighting? And why is it necessary for a special committee to study the basic principles or spiritual background of establishing a "new order" in East Asia? I do not understand all of this. I wonder if the government has anything to tell me? (Applause from the members) I also want to know why the Asia Development Board organized a special committee. It would be welcomed if the Prime Minister or the Director of the Asia Development Board could provide an explanation." (The official record of the assembly ends here. The following is likely deleted. The following is based on a report from the Japan Times.)

### The Puppet Regime Lacks Strength, and Ideals are Difficult to Realize

Member Saito then reviewed world history, stating that in the past thirty-five centuries, the world has enjoyed true peace for only two hundred and fifty years. Most nations have struggled to maintain their existence. As for talking about peace without the backing of real power, it is no different from a cannon without bullets. Now, referring to world history and taking the struggles of various nations as a lesson, it is unknown whether the ideals set forth in the Konoe statement are truly feasible. According to the Japan Times, members of the Social Masses Party and other parties were greatly disturbed by these words. Some even said that Saito's speech slandered the actions of the Japanese army in China and should apologize. The atmosphere became noisy and chaotic, but Saito remained unmoved and continued to inquire, saying, "It is fortunate that a 'new regime' is about to be established in China, but according to what I have heard, these 'two new regimes' have no military. Generally speaking, an administrative organization without a military backing cannot have strong power. Then, whether this 'new regime' has the power necessary for survival is a question that we should consider. Also, after the establishment of the 'new regime,' the issue of Japanese recognition will arise accordingly. What is the government's view on this? As for the relationship between the 'new government' and the Chongqing National Government, I have heard that the 'new regime' has recently been in contact with the National Government. I believe that since the Chinese National Government's policy is anti-Japanese and pro-communist, the 'new government' should not contact it. I wonder what the government's view is on this point. I have heard that the land occupied by the Japanese army in China is equal to two and a half times the territory of Japan. I wonder if the Chinese 'new regime' can place such a large area of land under effective management? Please explain this as well. I believe that the Chinese 'new regime' should not have any contact with the Chongqing National Government in accordance with the policy of the Japanese government. In short, all the facts regarding the government's handling of the China Incident are what the Japanese people urgently want to know. If the government does not inform the public of the war's objectives, then the resolution of the China Incident will be meaningless. Since the outbreak of the incident, the government has changed more than once. Under these circumstances, how can the current difficulties be overcome? The people believe that the government will be able to resolve the China Incident satisfactorily, so they follow the government's orders in every move. If the government betrays the people's trust, it will lead to unfortunate results. The government should carefully consider the attitude of previous cabinets towards the people since the outbreak of the China Incident and provide a clear answer to my inquiries." (Havas dispatch from March 3rd)

### Soviet Army and Air Force Fiercely Attack the Mannerheim Line. Finland Claims to be Firmly Defending its Positions. Several Rear Areas are Bombed by Soviet Planes.

Helsinki: Fighting continued unabated along the entire Finnish front over the weekend. In Karelia, Soviet artillery fire remained heavy. Soviet forces made some progress towards Viipuri. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Finnish position between Summa and Lake Muolaanjärvi seemed to be under heavy pressure from Soviet forces. Further east, Soviet forces at Valkjärvi advanced along the railway. Soviet forces are now between Punnus and Poleikkala. It has been reported that the Finnish front line at Terppel has loosened slightly. The Finnish side stated that all Soviet attacks were repelled and that the enemy suffered heavy losses. There were no reports from the southern war zones such as Kummo and Salla today. Viipuri and Hanko were heavily bombed. Some bombs weighed up to 200 kilograms. The fire in Viipuri was quite serious. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

Helsinki: The headquarters issued a war report today, stating that our troops won a great victory northwest of Lake Ladoga, killing 800 enemies, destroying 60 vehicles, and 2 tanks. Soviet Colonel Borisov, commander of the 11th Division, was killed in action. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line yesterday. The Soviet Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights and bombed enemy military targets. (TASS dispatch from the 11th)

Helsinki: The second battle of Karelia intensified further yesterday. Soviet forces launched attacks simultaneously at four important points, fully demonstrating that the Soviet high command has decided to break through the Mannerheim Line at any cost. According to the Finnish side, as of last night, Finnish forces were still firmly defending their positions and had not retreated an inch. (United Press dispatch from the 11th)

Helsinki: A communiqué issued here last night stated that Soviet forces were heavily damaged and retreated after attacking Karelia last night. Thirty tanks were destroyed. Soviet forces were defeated northeast of Lake Ladoga. Several rear areas of Finland were bombed by Soviet planes, killing one civilian. Four Soviet planes were shot down. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

Stockholm: Yesterday, Soviet forces launched a fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line throughout the day. Soviet planes resumed bombing Finnish forces from early morning, and Soviet artillery also shelled simultaneously. Soon, Soviet forces launched an attack along the entire line. Finnish forces in Karelia were exhausted and could only try to hold on. However, Finnish forces north of Lake Ladoga seemed to be still on the offensive. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

Bern: The Swiss Telegraph Agency recently sent a dispatch from its correspondent in Moscow stating that the Soviet military authorities are currently conscripting reservists born in 1920 and 1921. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)

Rovaniemi: Snow has fallen on the northern Finnish front for the past two days. It is expected that this is a sign of a major storm in February, which may severely hinder Soviet activities in the area. Roads between the front line and the border are impassable. It is reported that Soviet supplies have been blocked halfway, and all transportation has been hindered. In addition, the Finns have another reason to welcome the snowfall, that is, to hope that Soviet bombing may be temporarily suspended as a result. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

### Norwegian Representative Asks the League of Nations to Assist Finland Quickly

The Hague: The Norwegian representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Hambro, yesterday asked the League of Nations to provide relief to Finland quickly. According to Mr. Hambro, the number of Finnish refugees fleeing to Scandinavian countries is increasing daily, which is a serious problem. At the same time, the corpses of Soviet soldiers frozen to death on the Finnish battlefield will decompose and cause epidemics when the ice melts in the spring. At that time, diseases will spread to the Scandinavian countries. Furthermore, millions of brave Finns are currently being attacked by the Red Army, which is larger than the entire population of Finland. Therefore, they are in dire need of assistance. At the very least, we should immediately send 15,000 well-armed and well-trained soldiers to rescue them, which is only reasonable. The British and French representatives were very moved during Mr. Hambro's speech. (United Press dispatch from the 11th)

Montevideo: Uruguayan President General Baldomir yesterday consulted with Congress and suggested lending 100,000 pesos to help Finland, saying that the whole world does not want to see Finland sacrificed again. Finland's appeal for help is extremely justified. If we do not help these heroic people, we will fail in our duty. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

### US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Goes to Tallinn

Stockholm: A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Estonia confirmed by telephone last night that U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Steinhardt had gone to the Estonian capital on business on Friday night. The spokesman denied knowing the ambassador's mission or whether he was going to Helsinki. (United Press dispatch from the 11th)

### US Exports to the Soviet Union Increase

Washington: The New York Times reported that U.S. exports to the Soviet Union are increasing. It is reported that the export figures for December last year were approximately 15.5 million yuan. Among the main goods purchased by the Soviet government from the United States, machines for manufacturing aircraft were also included. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)

### Hurricane Causes Disaster in Southeastern United States

Albany, Georgia, USA: A hurricane occurred in southern Georgia today.

### Current Situation of Export of Products from Southern Fujian, with Hong Kong as a Transit Market, but Reduced Compared to Before the War

Fuzhou Correspondence: The counties in southern Fujian are all coastal or near-coastal areas. Water and land transportation is mostly concentrated in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. All import and export goods are shipped through Xiamen. After the fall of Xiamen, they were re-concentrated in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou for direct import and export. Except for Quanzhou Port, which is still open, Zhangzhou Port has not yet been opened and still relies on Gulangyu. Gulangyu is often disturbed by the Japanese, and the Chinese army's inspection along the coast is also very strict. Therefore, the import and export of goods is very inconvenient. Although Xiamen has fallen and become a dead island, the foreign shipping routes have not changed much and still dock at Xiamen and Gulangyu on schedule. Xiamen no longer has any commerce to speak of. As a result, Gulangyu, a residential area, has suddenly become a commercial port. However, almost all of Gulangyu's import and export goods are related to Zhangzhou. In other words, Gulangyu is only a storage and unloading place for Zhangzhou's concentrated import and export goods. Its commercial center is still in Zhangzhou. The export market for products from southern Fujian is divided into two aspects: domestic and foreign. Domestically, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shantou, and the three northeastern provinces are all important sales areas, especially Shanghai, which distributes goods to various cities and towns in the Yangtze River basin. In foreign countries, Southeast Asia is the most important, including the Philippines, Annam, Siam, and the British, Dutch, and Portuguese archipelagos. As far as Europe and the United States, and Japan and Taiwan before the war, are concerned, there are some, but not many. However, since the war, the domestic sales market has changed. Only Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and other places are still active. Last year, because all the important towns in the Yangtze River basin below Wuhan had fallen, the Shanghai sales market was relatively weak. The port of Wenzhou, however, has increased dramatically due to the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Fuzhou through northern Fujian to the Jiangxi and Hunan area, it is also an inland trading station. However, recently not many goods have been transported to Fuzhou. The main foreign sales market is in Southeast Asia, but because Quanzhou and Zhangzhou merchants have limited capital and a narrow vision, there are very few who can engage in long-term operations. After the fall of Xiamen, it is even more lacking. Now most of the transactions are made in Hong Kong, and then re-shipped to Southeast Asia by Hong Kong merchants. Therefore, Hong Kong has become a transit market for the export of goods from the southern Fujian area. (Some overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also directly purchase from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, but not regularly.) As for Zhangzhou and Quanzhou merchants directly distributing goods to Southeast Asia, Singapore, Manila, Batavia, and other places are the most common. The main products of each county in southern Fujian are listed below:

(A) Common Products: (1) Rice: Longxi, Haicheng, Nanjing, Zhangpu, Pinghe, Changtai, Huaan, and other counties all produce rice. The annual export value is 3 million yuan, mostly sold to Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Huian. Dehua also exports a small amount, but only to Yongchun. (2) Sugar: Longxi, Haicheng, Nanjing, Pinghe, Changtai, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, and other counties all produce sugar. The annual export value is 2.7 to 2.8 million yuan. (3) Salt: Huian, Jinjiang, Dongshan, Zhao'an, and other counties all have salt fields, which are transported and sold inland by the Salt Bureau itself. (4) Fish: Huian, Jinjiang, Dongshan, Zhao'an, and other counties all produce fish, with Huian being the largest. The total annual value of domestic and foreign sales is 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. (5) Bamboo and Wood: Anxi and Yongchun produce bamboo and wood, which can only be supplied to Quanzhou. Dehua produces bamboo and wood, which are transported to Fuzhou. There are no exports, only Zhangping and Nanjing, which are exported through Zhangzhou, with an annual value of more than 100,000 yuan. (6) Paper Foil: Originally a superstitious item, it used to be sold well in the three northeastern provinces and Southeast Asia. Both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou produce it. Last year, 800,000 yuan worth of paper foil was sold to Southeast Asia. In addition to the above, Zhangping, Anxi, and Dehua also produce paper, Huian produces peanuts, Zhangpu and Yunxiao produce peanut oil, Yunxiao produces charcoal, and Pinghe produces tobacco. Most of these are sold domestically.

(B) Special Products: 1. Usually larger exports: (1) Tea: Anxi produces Tieguanyin, Oolong, and other teas, about 7,000 dan, of which about 6,000 dan are exported annually. In the past, they were concentrated in Zhangzhou for export, but last year they were exported through Quanzhou. Nan'an and Yongchun export about 600 dan, all collected in Quanzhou. According to statistics, the total annual export value of Quanzhou is more than 500,000 yuan, which is transshipped to Southeast Asia through Shanghai and Hong Kong. (2) Citrus and Pomelos: Longxi, Changtai, Zhangpu, Nanjing, Haicheng, and other counties produce citrus and pomelos, which are concentrated in Zhangzhou for export. The annual value is more than 600,000 yuan, mostly sold to Shanghai, followed by Southeast Asia. (3) Dried Longan and Lychee: Longxi, Zhangpu, Nanjing, and Haicheng produce dried longan and lychee, which are concentrated in Zhangzhou for export. The annual value is more than 200,000 yuan. Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Tong'an produce dried longan and lychee, which are concentrated in Quanzhou for export. The annual value is more than 200,000 yuan, all transported to Shanghai, Wenzhou, and other places. There are no sales to Southeast Asia. (4) Porcelain: Dehua products are a special handicraft of this province, mostly sold in southern Fujian, western Fujian, and the Fuzhou area, with an annual value of more than 100,000 yuan. 2. Usually smaller exports: (1) Daffodils: Longxi produces daffodils, which are difficult to transplant, making them a unique specialty. The sales areas are Shanghai, Guangdong, and Southeast Asia, as well as Europe and the United States. The annual value is more than 80,000 yuan. Last year, due to the fall of Guangzhou and the lack of access to North China, only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan worth of daffodils were sold. (2) Bananas: Longxi and Nanjing produce bananas, especially the Tianbin bananas produced in Nanjing, which are famous. Most of the annual output is sold domestically. The export market is almost entirely occupied by Taiwan. (4) Kumquats: Yunxiao produces kumquats, which are mostly transported to Southeast Asia and often purchased by some overseas Chinese, but the number is not large, only more than 10,000 yuan per year. (6) Flower Rice: A by-product of tea, or used as a spice, Anxi, Longxi, Changtai, Nan'an, and other counties all produce it. It is mostly exported with tea, with an annual value of about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. (6) Shenqu: A special product of Jinjiang, mostly sold to domestic and Southeast Asian Chinese medicine shops, with an annual value of 50,000 yuan. 3. Famous handmade specialties without adequate promotion: (1) Embroidery Paintings: Yongchun products. (2) Porcelain Toys: Dehua products, such as Guanyin statues. (3) Zhang Velvet and Zhang Gauze: Zhangzhou products. (4) Ink Paste: Zhangzhou products. (5) Scented Beads: Quanzhou products. In addition to the above, products from western Fujian that are transshipped through Quanzhou and Zhangzhou for export include paper, bamboo shoots, and other bulk items.

### The Puppet County Government of Kunshan Investigates the Household Registration in Each District

Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government is now following the instructions of the Japanese to order each district to investigate the household registration in order to issue county citizen certificates. The method is to register each item such as origin, name, age, gender, and occupation, and order each household to submit two photographic portraits of the whole family for use in pasting on the county citizen certificate and household registration book. It is said that this county citizen certificate obviously has the effect of restricting the residence of county citizens.

The Japanese ordered the puppet county government to instruct each district to search for and purchase military rice, limiting each district to 300 shi. The price of rice was initially set at 18 yuan, and then increased to 20 yuan. At first, no one responded. Then the village chiefs and bao chiefs were ordered to force farmers to supply as much as possible, and the required amount was obtained. However, after this search and purchase, the private reserves of the people were emptied, and problems will inevitably arise in terms of people's food in the future.

The Japanese prohibit the export of rice and eggs. Those who violate the ban will have their rice and eggs confiscated and be imprisoned in the bunkers (the Japanese have built bunkers next to the platforms of each station along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway) for a day and night before being released. Most of the personnel in the puppet organization are former political, police, and party members. There are also many educational figures. The current head of the Third Section, Mr. Hong, is a graduate of Jiangsu First Normal School. The head of the Youth League, Mr. Zhou, is a graduate of Chi-Tsih University. The district head of Qidun District, Mr. Li, is a graduate of Fudan University. There are too many others who hold puppet positions to list. There is also a type of person who secretly receives missions from the central government to engage in restoration work, while secretly colluding with the puppet organization, and even receiving subsidies from them, creating a situation of "cats and rats sleeping together." Most of these people are party members.

It is divided into departments of language, science, and technology, as well as a women's remedial class. It is affiliated with Yixin Primary School in Xihu Lane, Ximen Road, and Malang Road and will be opening soon.

### The Final Act of Interport Football: Shanghai West United Wins Against the Hong Kong Team - Decisive Victory in the Last Quarter with a Score of 3-1

The final act of the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match took place yesterday, with the Hong Kong team facing the Shanghai West United team. The match started at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground. The morning drizzle slightly affected the fans, but the number of spectators still reached three to four thousand, showing that Shanghai football fans are developing a higher level of appreciation for pure football skills, despite the fact that both teams were composed entirely of Westerners. As a result, the Hong Kong team suffered another defeat, losing 3-1. They were behind 1-0 in the first half and equalized in the second half, but then conceded two more goals in quick succession. The performances of both sides were brilliant, clean, and progressive. The lineups were as follows:

Shanghai West United

Su Shi

Kaimoer, Weiketai

Gelinbo, Jielai, Panjietuo

Kaluoliequ, Fulase, Kekelan, Kelasha, Paier

Hong Kong Team

Moshihan

Baoen, Haxian

Hannibolu, Gan, Maikewei

Shidulanqi, Dagao Shannu, Hexi, Hualu, Fokesi

First Half

The Tang Qiaosi orchestra once again performed on the field to provide entertainment, earning much praise from the audience. The Shanghai team's forwards were exceptionally sharp, and the defense was very solid. The Hong Kong team also launched attacks from time to time, but unfortunately, their shooting was poor, resulting in the loss of several good opportunities. Shanghai West United kicked off and immediately penetrated the Hong Kong formation, but was forced to retreat. Kaimoer kicked the ball out, and Paier also launched a diagonal shot. Fulase flew up and powerfully shot the ball into the net, giving the Shanghai team the lead. Only five minutes into the game, the Shanghai team continued to attack. Five minutes later, Kekelan charged into the penalty area, and Baoen's push was deemed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. The Shanghai West United captain, Kaimoer, took the kick, but missed. Subsequently, both sides had dangerous moments, but none succeeded. Shanghai led 1-0 at the end of the first half.

Second Half

In the second half, the two sides remained in a stalemate for as long as twenty-five minutes, before the situation began to unfold. The Hong Kong team actively counterattacked. Little Shidulanqi flew down the left side. Weiketai lost his footing, and the ball fell to Dagao Shannu's feet. Dagao then passed it back to Little Shi, who shot it into the net, immediately leveling the score. Stimulated by this, the entire Shanghai team rose to the occasion. After ten minutes of fierce attacks, Kaluoliequ received a diagonal pass from Gelinbo and flew in from the left side, shooting towards the goal. Moshihan jumped up and parried the ball, but Kekelan headed it backwards, and Pan Jie, who was waiting behind, swept the ball in, giving Shanghai West United the lead again. Two minutes later, Kaluoliequ received a long shot from Fulase, charged in alone like a flying man, and scored again from fifteen yards out, resulting in a 3-1 victory. In total, the Hong Kong team suffered two defeats and one draw in Shanghai.

### Manli Maler Arrives in Wenzhou, Grounded Once - Fortunately in Shallow Waters, No Losses

The British merchant vessel Manli Maler, which operates on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, loaded passengers and cargo in Shanghai at the beginning of this month and set sail for Wenzhou. After many days, it had not yet arrived. Dashin Company, the local agent for the vessel's operations, telegraphed to inquire, but received no reply. It was recently learned that the vessel telegraphed Shanghai on the 9th, reporting that it had run aground on a sandbar near Huanghuaguan, outside the port of Wenzhou, on the 6th due to inconvenient nighttime navigation after arriving outside the port of Wenzhou. Fortunately, it was in shallow waters, and there were no losses. It was successfully refloated the next day during high tide. The hull was undamaged, and the passengers and cargo were safe and sound. It arrived safely in Wenzhou on the evening of the 7th.

### Fake "Central Market" Eager to Open - Local Goods Industry Refuses to Join

The fake "Central Market" has been in preparation for two months. Internally, it is divided into four departments: local goods, northern and southern goods, fresh eggs, pickled goods, and preserved meats. It has sent personnel to entice the relevant industries to join. It was originally scheduled to open on New Year's Day, but was postponed due to unfinished construction work. It is now learned that the local goods industry has refused to cooperate. It has held repeated meetings to discuss countermeasures and has decided to hold a general meeting within the next few days to discuss specific methods. It is said that the fake organization plans to be established on March 1st, while the branch "market" in Hongkou has already opened ahead of schedule.

### Japanese Gambling Extravagantly - Japanese Consulate Police Mobilized - Over Two Hundred Arrested in Two Days

Because of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, nationals at home and abroad have suffered unprecedented difficulties, so the Japanese authorities have imposed strict restrictions on their nationals, especially on Japanese residents in Shanghai, strictly enforcing the rules. For example, all gambling dens in western Shanghai are strictly ordered to prevent their nationals from entering to engage in gambling. Those who comply outwardly but violate inwardly are severely punished. However, many Japanese residents still secretly enter and leave gambling dens, gambling as before, making it almost impossible for the Japanese authorities to deal with. Therefore, the Japanese authorities recently ordered the police department of the Japanese Consulate to strictly enforce the rules. The Japanese police department then mobilized all police officers on the 8th and 9th, distributing them on key roads on the north bank, such as Sichuan Road Bridge, to conduct strict checks and interrogations. At that time, Japanese residents who were returning from gambling were unaware of the situation and were stopped and interrogated. They had to present documents showing where they were going before being released. It was later learned that on the 8th and 9th, more than two hundred Japanese residents were reported for gambling and are being severely punished by the Japanese Consulate.

### Border Road Construction Negotiations - Expected to Have Rapid Development - Expected Signature After Fan Keling Returns to Shanghai - Fei Lipu Noncommittal About Rumors

The Continental Daily reported that, according to well-informed sources yesterday (the 10th), Fei Lipu, Director General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now in Shanghai, and Fan Keling, Chairman of the Municipal Council, is also scheduled to return here from Dalian on Wednesday or Thursday. The negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" regarding the construction of roads beyond the border are therefore expected to have rapid development. On the investment side, rumors have been circulating for more than a month that the negotiations have reached the final stage, which was later confirmed by "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. Until recently, it was also rumored that the two sides had reached an agreement on the policing of the roads built beyond the border. Although this statement has not yet been officially confirmed, it is indicated by those close to the Municipal Council that the only thing that has not been completed is the formal signing of the document that has already been prepared. According to reports, Fei Lipu recently went to Singapore for a short vacation. During this period, negotiations did not stop and Vice Director Ge Bo met with Mr. Fu to discuss various matters. These negotiations to temporarily resolve the issue of road construction beyond the border have been going on for more than a year and have suffered major setbacks but have not stopped. It was initially rumored that the document stipulating the organization of the "Outer Border Police Bureau" would be signed a week ago, but this plan was suspended due to Fan Keling's trip to Dalian. It is now heard that this document will be signed after Mr. Fan returns to Shanghai. The Shanghai Times also reported that recently, the local newspapers have reported news about the early resolution of the issue of road construction beyond the border, especially the policing of the roads built beyond the border. A reporter asked Fei Lipu about this news yesterday. He replied that he could not tell him anything at the moment and that he did not want to confirm or deny the rumors. According to reports, the two sides have reached an agreement, everything is ready, and Chuan Xiao'an and representatives of the Municipal Council are preparing to sign the agreement, and a joint policing system will be established in the area of ​​the roads outside the boundary in western Shanghai. Regarding this point, Mr. Fei said, "It's too early to say."

### Commercial Registration in this City

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved the temporary commercial registration of Shanghai City, including Wang Shengji, Shen Nanchang, Xin Chang Min He Shenji, Chunghwa Company, and seven others. Their business scope, amount of capital, names and addresses of the principal or partners, location, and date of approval are all published in the January issue of the Commercial Monthly in accordance with the Ministry's orders.

### Internal Province Certificates Verified and Released - Products of Shenxin and Wing On Released

The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the verification and release of products from Shenxin and Wing On Yarn Factories, saying, "Your telegram is noted. It has been verified that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has telegraphed that before Factories No. 29 of Shenxin and No. 3 of Wing On submit a method for distinguishing the trademarks used in their products from those of other branch factories for approval by the Ministry, all products should be certified by the Chamber of Commerce as being from these three factories before they are allowed to be imported. Orders have been telegraphed for compliance. The incident mentioned in your telegram that products from Factory No. 3 of Wing On are still being detained may be due to a misunderstanding caused by the Chamber of Commerce not providing certification. In the future, the procedures stipulated by the Ministry must be followed for verification and release. Please be informed." Huang Shao-hong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, [seal]. It is also learned that the Jiangxi Provincial Industrial and Commercial Management Office also telegraphed the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that they will verify and release the products from the three factories upon presentation of the certificate of certification.

### Public Works Department, Shanghai Municipal Council: Volunteer Corps Annual Report, 1939

Section One (1) Overview

Local Conditions

The local situation this year was largely the same as the previous year. The defense area south of the Suzhou Creek was still garrisoned by regular foreign troops. The Volunteer Corps, on the one hand, maintained internal security, and on the other hand, served as a reserve force for the foreign troops. The use of the Hongkew Rifle Range was still restricted. All officers and men on duty were required to travel to or from the range in specially prepared Volunteer Corps transport vehicles, and were not allowed to stay overnight at the range. Members of the Chinese Company were not allowed to go at all. As a result, the Volunteer Corps' permanent barracks could not be fully utilized, and the training of the members was hampered. Within the defense area, the most noteworthy situation was the deteriorating security in the Western District. The security of this area was jointly maintained by the police and the foreign troops stationed in the "D" area, but the Volunteer Corps was also affected. This was partly because the Volunteer Corps members were ordered to mobilize during certain periods, and partly because all of the corps' armored vehicles had been transferred to the police for use. The armored vehicles were transferred on July 25 of last year, and there is no hope of their return in the near future. The Volunteer Corps' armored car unit has long been recognized as the most elite and capable unit, and the transfer of the vehicles has inevitably diminished the Volunteer Corps' strength. Moreover, frequent use of armored vehicles leads to easy wear and tear. (On January 26 of this year, after this report was drafted, all but two of the armored vehicles had been returned to the Volunteer Corps by the police.)

Anniversaries

In the past, whenever there were local anniversaries, a tense atmosphere would arise within the Settlement. The same was true last year. However, the Volunteer Corps, the police, and the foreign troops were able to cooperate thoroughly and be jointly prepared. All arrangements were very effective. The increasing number of local anniversaries has created a serious problem for the Volunteer Corps. Most of the members have jobs and cannot immediately leave their work to respond to mobilization. In order to solve this difficulty, the Volunteer Corps headquarters has established a special procedure: whenever it is necessary to dispatch members for patrols, the headquarters only summons the required number of people, orders each member to perform duty for several hours, and then allows them to return to their original positions. This procedure inevitably increases the responsibility of commanders at all levels. Fortunately, since its implementation, the results have been good. This is due to the efforts of all concerned personnel, which is highly commendable. The effectiveness of the Volunteer Corps' service has been maximized, while the impact on the members' own careers has been minimized.

Summer Training

In previous years, the Volunteer Corps routinely underwent training from May to October 1, with few holidays. This was because the increasing number of local anniversaries and the changing international situation made it necessary to strive for the Volunteer Corps' strength to be as elite as possible. The training subjects last year were more numerous than usual. The members enthusiastically participated in the training, which was very satisfactory. Not a few members competed to participate, but were left out due to the limited number of places. The foreign troops stationed in Shanghai often sent personnel to the Volunteer Corps to participate in training. The Volunteer Corps expresses its deep gratitude to the commander of the British forces in Shanghai and the commander of the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps. In addition, when the Volunteer Corps used the streets for training, the Commissioner of Police of the Public Works Department often ordered appropriate arrangements to be made, and should also be thanked.

(2) Service from December 1 of the previous year to September 30 of last year, and the Double Tenth Festival service of last year.

Training Overview

Most of the training subjects for the previous year had been completed before December of the previous year. The members' performance showed obvious improvement. The methods of stacking sandbags and erecting barbed wire fences have been taught separately to each company. The use of the Hongkew Rifle Range was still restricted. The usual night shooting was temporarily suspended last year. All members had to travel to and from the range in Volunteer Corps transport vehicles. However, the excellent shooting results were satisfactory. The rifle competition could not be held due to various restrictions and the rising price of military equipment. However, a competition was held to encourage members to use the range at least once during the summer. In December of the previous year, the Volunteer Corps participated in the overseas competition organized by the British Rifle Association, and achieved second place, winning nine medals. Although the Volunteer Corps' permanent barracks could not be used, the annual weekend camping activities of each company were held, with day and night work carried out separately at the rifle range and the headquarters parade ground.

Anniversaries

Last year, the number of times that Volunteer Corps members jointly maintained security with the police and foreign troops in the International Settlement and the Western District was less than in previous years. In the past, the Volunteer Corps was often ordered to mobilize when there was a risk of an incident. This practice has been changed, partly because the number of mobilizations in previous years was too high, partly because mobilization was very uneconomical, and partly because the members' own affairs were so numerous that it was inconvenient to leave their work unless absolutely necessary. During the year, the Volunteer Corps assisted the police on a total of eighty-four days, including eighteen days when volunteers were also called up for duty. The number of days that the Russian Company was stationed on the Bund and the number of times that the Transport Company assisted the police in performing special duties were not included in the calculation. The service performance of the Russian Company always maintained its highest level. Around the August 13th anniversary, the Volunteer Corps was ordered to be on alert. At 5:00 AM on August 9th, the Volunteer Corps took precautionary measures. From that time until 5:00 AM on August 12th, a considerable number of patrol and guard members were dispatched. At 5:00 AM on August 12th, the Volunteer Corps mobilized, and at 8:00 AM on August 14th, precautionary measures were resumed. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, the alert was lifted. The measures taken during the mobilization period were as follows: (1) armored car patrol in the Central District and west of Yu Qiaqing Road (one vehicle each); (2) military vehicle patrol in the Central District (two vehicles); (3) foot patrol in the Central District (five teams); (4) stationing guards; (5) protecting ten newspapers in the Central District; (6) patrol in the (C) defense area with the assistance of the US military; (7) guarding the headquarters. The performance of all of the above duties was excellent. In addition, the Transport Company also performed a number of duties. The armored vehicles were transferred to the police on July 15. After that, except for one time in August, they were managed by the police. Drivers were dispatched from the Russian Company, but the number was limited and insufficient. The Transport Company assisted in dispatching additional personnel. Section Two (1) Overview of service from October 1 to November 30 of last year.

General Remarks

The annual training year begins on October 1. According to past practice, most of the training courses are concentrated in the first half of the year, so that officers and non-commissioned officers can review old lessons and pass on the knowledge they have gained to the members under their command. As for the content of the courses, in previous years they usually included weapons training, sand table technique lectures, drill and administrative training, etc. However, last year, because the Public Works Department had ordered all members to receive thorough training in dispersing rioters and street fighting tactics, the content of the training courses was revised accordingly. Weapons training, except for bayonet combat, was temporarily suspended, but each company was required to review it on its own. A special weapons training class for senior instructors of each company was held in June and July, which proved to be of great value. The Volunteer Corps headquarters also held two cadre training classes for the instructors of each company. All trainees agreed not to be absent during the training period. Class time was from 1:45 PM to 8:00 PM on Saturdays, and from 6:45 AM to 7:00 PM on Sundays, with short breaks for meals and rest in between. An examination was held at the end of each class, and the results were very good. The headquarters also stipulated that each company should hold a cadre training class separately, and all members were required to participate. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Municipal Federation Letter to the Authorities of the Two Settlements Requesting Control of Coal Prices: Fuel and Grain are Necessities for People's Livelihood, Only Through Control Can Threats be Removed; Coal Prices Rise Endlessly, Many Hot Water Shops Close Down.

The high price of coal in Shanghai has affected people's livelihood. The First Special District Citizens' Federation has sent letters to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Municipal Council of the French Concession, requesting that they carry out coal stock investigations, strictly set price limits, and prevent hoarding and manipulation in order to stabilize coal prices and secure people's livelihood. The original letter states: The prices of goods in Shanghai are soaring, and people's livelihood is difficult, especially the price of coal. Before the war, each ton sold for more than ten yuan, but now it has reached one hundred and sixty to seventy yuan. Coal is a necessity for people's daily use, and also the driving force for various industries. Since the price of coal has risen, it has been followed by price increases by the water company, the electricity company, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, and "tiger stoves," all of which are closely related to people's livelihood. Due to the rising price of coal, many factories have been forced to reduce their work, and those who barely maintain the status quo have high costs and will inevitably seek compensation from general consumers, thus stimulating and evolving into the current state of expensive goods. The Federation, witnessing the difficulties of the times, believes that stabilizing coal prices is as important as stabilizing rice prices for the current stabilization of people's livelihood, and therefore sends this letter, requesting your Board to follow the measures for controlling rice prices, strictly set the maximum selling price of coal, and order all coal firms to comply. At the same time, investigate coal stocks, strictly investigate hoarding and manipulation, and hope to find ways to dredge the source. It concerns the public livelihood, social stability, and the elimination of threats. Sincerely request implementation.

### The Situation in Eastern Zhejiang is Gradually Stabilizing: Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Unobstructed; Japanese Troops in Xiepu are Annihilated; Fenghua Xikou Bombed Again.

After the Japanese troops crossed the Qiantang River and invaded Xiaoshao, and after China dispatched a large army to block them, the landed Japanese troops were already unable to support themselves. They retreated to the west of Xiaoshan riverside and are about to be completely wiped out. Heavy troops have long been stationed along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, strictly guarded and ready to wait. On the 9th, Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port attempted to land in Xiepu by stealth, but after being severely attacked by the garrison, they were immediately annihilated and a Japanese boat was sunk. However, the Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port have not retreated, and Japanese warships patrol the ocean surface from time to time. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the shipping industry that Xiepu is a small coastal town belonging to Zhenhai, very close to Longshan. The Ningci-Zhen Highway has a branch road to Xiepu, which was completely destroyed long ago after the war. In the past, there was a Xiepu branch of the Zhejiang Customs. Yesterday, foreign ships anchored outside Zhenhai Port reported their itineraries to Shanghai, and did not mention the Xiepu incident, which proves that the Japanese army's landing in Xiepu has been resolved. The German ship "Deping" of the Italian firm Sino-Italian Company left Zhenhai yesterday at 4 PM and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8 AM this morning. It is also heard that there was an air raid alert in Ningbo yesterday and artillery fire at Zhaobao Mountain outside Zhenhai Port, but the local area is still peaceful as usual.

Remnants of Japanese Troops Retreat North from Xiaoshan

After the Japanese troops who crossed the Qiantang River intruded into Yiqiao, Wenjia Yan, Qianqing Town and other places, they were successively defeated by the Chinese army, and were forced to remain in Xiaoshan County and the riverbank, forming turtles in a jar. At 2 PM on the 9th, the Chinese army once again rushed into the city, launching fierce street battles. Many Japanese soldiers were annihilated and they could not support themselves, and withdrew from the county seat. A portion retreated to the river bank to board boats and retreat across the river. That night, because Xiaoshan County had become a rubble empty field and had no value, the Chinese army automatically gave up again, and closely surrounded the county on different sides.

Forty-Eight Shells Hit Xikou

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired from the Ningbo community in Shanghai, at 1 PM on the 10th, nine Japanese planes flew to Fenghua Xikou town again to bomb, dropping forty-eight shells, killing and wounding more than a dozen farmers, women and children. A portion of the Jinxi United Transport Company's bus station was destroyed. The remaining shells fell in the residential area of the town. Xikou is the hometown of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and this is the second time it has been bombed.

Parcel Post Service Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Temporarily Suspended

Since Xiaoshan in eastern Zhejiang fell into the war zone, the local situation in Shaoxing, Jinhua, Ningbo, and other counties has become tense. The highways and the Xiaoshan-Zhuji section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been destroyed one by one according to the pre-set plan. Moreover, local military transportation is busy, and it is difficult to deliver light mail to various places in eastern Zhejiang. However, the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration is doing its best to dredge the channels. Express letters, registered letters, and postcards to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Zhuji, Jinhua, Yuyao, Shangyu, Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, Yiwu, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Yongkang, etc., are still delivered as usual. However, remittance services are temporarily suspended only in Zhuji, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Linpu, Baiguan and other places. In other places, drafts are still issued according to the original amount. Large commodity packages have been suspended due to transportation difficulties. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Parcel Post Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration that small parcel mail to Shaoxing and its surroundings, as well as along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, will also be temporarily suspended from today. It is reported that postal service to Ningbo, Yongjia (Wenzhou) and other places along the coast is still normal.

Foreign Ships Resume Sailing, Schedules Set

Shipping companies in Shanghai have been closed for four days since the Lunar New Year. Shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines has been scheduled to resume today. However, due to the closure of various businesses, all passengers and cargo must wait until after the reopening before they can be loaded. Therefore, the sailing dates are all after the 13th. British shipping companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have also temporarily suspended all shipping lines for five days since the 8th due to the closure of the shipworkers and dockworkers. They are scheduled to resume normal sailing on the 14th. However, during the New Year period, there are not many merchants buying goods, and cargo transportation will not be congested for the time being.

Although the weather in Shanghai has been slightly warmer recently, the number of frozen and exposed corpses found on roads, streets, and alleys has not decreased. Although it is the Lunar New Year, the funeral parlor's corpse collection vehicles are still busy with frequent trips. In the past four days, a total of 322 exposed corpses, including 73 adults and 249 children, have been discovered in the Public Concession.

### Sailor Robbed While Drunk

Chi Along, a Ningbo native working as a sailor on a Japanese Mitsubishi ship, drank too much on the 6th of this month and wandered around the entrance of Lane 291 on Wuchang Road. The lane was full of brothels, and he was dragged into the lane by a group of Jiangbei ruffians who specialized in attracting customers. They took advantage of the opportunity to steal 23.80 yuan in legal tender from Chi Along and fled in all directions. It was reported to the Hongkew police, who arrested Yin Kezhi, a Jiangbei native involved in the case. On the morning of the 7th, he was sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the details and questioned the defendant, who denied the charges. Lawyer Jiang Chiping was retained to defend him. The victim, Chi Along, did not appear, and Liu Yugui announced a verdict of not guilty and released him.

### Coal Firm Runner Swindles and Obtains Money; Sentenced to One Year and Six Months Imprisonment; Lu Shouxiang Fined for Receiving Stolen Goods.

Lu Yili, a Changzhou native, 37 years old, worked as a runner for the Huacheng Coal Firm at No. 33 Sichuan Road. On March 4 of last year, Lu falsely claimed to Wu Tiemei, the owner of the firm, that the Great China Rubber Factory needed to purchase 500 tons of Hongji coal dust, but because the firm was short of stock, it needed to be purchased from the Yuanxiang Coal Firm at No. 106 Ganshi East Road, which could yield a high profit. Wu believed him and the next day ordered Lu to accompany clerk Weng Shaoyou to bring 6,680 yuan in cash to the Yuanxiang Coal Firm to contact runner Chen Kangyuan. At that time, they settled the deal and obtained a Tongchang Coal Firm No. 3 mine Hongji coal dust warehouse receipt for 300 tons. On the 7th of the same month, Wu sent a partner to hire a boat to Pudong to pick up the goods from the No. 3 mine, only to find that the receipt was a forgery. Knowing that he had been swindled by Lu, he reported to the police, but Lu had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Chen Kangyuan was arrested and sent to the criminal court of the Second Special Court. The trial concluded with a verdict of not guilty. The Third High Court of Appeal held that Chen was suspected of forging the warehouse receipt and sentenced him to six months imprisonment, suspended for three years. Lu Yili, seeing that the matter had passed, was active in society again and was discovered by Wu, who reported it to the police and arrested him. Based on Lu's confession, his brother Lu Shouxiang was also arrested and brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Qiu has now concluded the trial and ruled that "Lu Yili is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business; Lu Shouxiang is fined 500 yuan for receiving stolen goods; both defendants shall compensate the plaintiff 6,680 yuan in national currency."

### Sugar Firm Broker Gambles Away Swindled Funds; Arrested and Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison

Zhang Jingxian, a Huangdu native, 37 years old, lived at No. 13 Shantou Road and worked as a broker for the Yisheng Sugar Firm opened by Shen Yansheng of Jiaxing at No. 59 the Bund, No. 16 wharf. In December of last year, because he lost a large sum of money in a gambling den in western Shanghai, he devised a plan to swindle 200-300 bags of red and white sugar worth 9,563.50 yuan from the firm and issued checks from Kenye and Huizhong banks under the names of Tianyuan, Xiyuan, and Laoda Fang sugar and food stores. When Shen sent someone to collect the money, they were all returned, and he realized that he had been swindled. Zhang was subsequently spotted by Shen on the road, who reported it to the police and arrested him. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Qiu has now concluded the trial and ruled that "Zhang Jingxian is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business, and shall compensate the plaintiff 9,563.50 yuan in national currency."

### Young Woman Dies After Taking Poison

Xu Aijin, a 22-year-old woman living at No. 283 Xiansi Road, was beautiful. Because her fiancé had been away for a long time without any news, she became depressed. A few days ago, she had an argument with her mother, Xu Qian, over a trivial matter, and developed a desire to end her life. On the morning of the previous day, she secretly mixed medicine and chilblain medicine at home and swallowed it to commit suicide. At noon, her mother discovered it and sent her to Guangci Hospital, but she had been poisoned too deeply and died before she could be saved.

### Landlord Raises Rent; Tenants Object; Soaring Prices Cause Daily Anxiety; Further Rent Increases Are Difficult to Bear.

The New Voice News Agency reported that the tenants of Lianxi Fang on Guangxi Road, including the Jili Laundry Company, jointly sent a letter to the First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating: "Since the Shanghai war, prices have skyrocketed, and food prices have soared, which is unprecedented. The livelihood of citizens is in imminent danger, which is self-evident. Those who live on the isolated island are all eagerly hoping that various public organizations will make every effort to suppress prices, so that citizens who are sitting on pins and needles can be relieved. Just as we were waiting for assistance, we suddenly received a letter from the landlord stating that the rents for the shops along the road and the residential houses in Lianxi Fang on Guangxi Road would be increased by 30%, 50%, and 60%, and that if we did not agree to the rent increase, we would have to return the empty houses. Such blatant threats are completely unreasonable. In the current situation, we tenants are in a fiery pit and cannot bear any further burden. Therefore, we have unanimously decided to send a letter to the rental agency to request that they withdraw their decision, but we have not received a reply. We suspect that there is a hidden agenda. We are therefore writing to you to complain and ask for your guidance and assistance. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions."

The Daguang News Agency reported that the Zhonghui Bank Building on Aiguo Road in the French Concession has hundreds of rooms, which are rented as offices and residences. The current rent has already increased compared to before the war. Recently, the bank's rental department has proposed a further rent increase, by as much as 30%. Therefore, all the tenants have unanimously expressed their opposition. After a meeting, they decided to ask the French Concession Taxpayers' Association (which is also a tenant of the building on the second floor) for assistance, and have scheduled to register from today in order to negotiate with the bank authorities to reduce the rent increase and ease the burden.

### Robbers Burned the Victim

Wang Dabaozi, a Jiangbei native, in his thirties, and his wife, Cai, built a thatched hut on the eastern section of Meixie Road on South Railway Station Road and raised pigs. Last year, they raised more than ten pigs and sold them for more than 700 yuan in cash at the end of the old year, which attracted the attention of local hooligans. On the eve of the old Lunar New Year last year, at about 8 PM, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, each holding a pistol and a box gun. They tied up Wang and his wife separately with ropes and searched the premises, only finding more than 130 yuan in cash. The robbers were still not satisfied and hung Wang and his wife up with ropes. They first beat them with gun butts and wooden sticks, and then burned Wang's ribs and Wang's wife's lower body with candles, forcing them to reveal where they had hidden the silver. Wang's wife had no choice but to reveal the 300 yuan in cash hidden in an iron box in the soil under the bed. After the robbers found it, they put Wang and his wife down, took the loot, and left. Wang and his wife were covered in injuries and are still bedridden.

### Robbery Log

Zhu Hexiang, a 48-year-old native of Nanxiang, rented a house with his family at No. 3 Zhangjia Lane, Fahua Town, in western Shanghai after August 13. But yesterday at 8:45 AM, three robbers suddenly came in and rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching arbitrarily. Zhu was still fast asleep and woke up with a start. He had a slight argument with the robbers and was shot in the right leg by the robbers and fell on the bed. The robbers then calmly fled. His family later transported him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Also, Fan Liangbo's family, a Jiading native living in the kitchen of No. 2 Rongyang Lane, Pingwang Street, in the British Concession, was visited by three robbers at around 7 PM the night before. They threatened them with guns and forbade them from making any noise. Clothing and silver dollars worth a total of about 1,000 yuan were robbed. The victim then issued a loss report and reported it to the police for investigation.

### Cost of Living Index in This City Hits New High Last Month; Purchasing Power of Currency Greatly Reduced; One Legal Tender Dollar Worth Only Slightly More Than 30 Cents

Various sectors are concerned about the livelihoods of the poor, hence the organization of a Fair Price Rice Committee, which will begin fair price rice sales on the 21st of this month.  Saigon broken rice is ordered and sold at six and a half catties per dollar, equivalent to twenty-four dollars per stone.  Each person is limited to one dollar's worth per purchase.  The Salvation Army has also started providing hot meals, using paper bags to hold half a pound of rice to help starving beggars on the streets.

Among various prices, vegetables have risen the most sharply.  The price of green vegetables has increased by 103.28% compared to last month.  Spinach has increased by 64%, and sprouted beans and radishes have also increased by more than 45% each.  Fish and meat have also generally become more expensive.  Fresh pork has increased by 7%, and fresh fish has increased by 26%.  Soybean oil and lard have each fallen by about 10% compared to last month, which is a reaction to the sharp rise last month.

In January of this year, the semi-annual rent survey was conducted as usual.  Within half a year, rents continued to increase.  The average increase for shikumen buildings was 6.91% compared to the second half of last year.  Western-style buildings increased by 9.64%, and bungalows increased by 6.31%.  The average total increase was 7.94%.  More than half of the increases were for water fees.

The prices of all kinds of clothing have increased, ranging from 6% to 11%.  The increase in dyeing fees and expensive raw materials are the main reasons.  The price of coal and coal dust has soared due to the surge in transportation costs and the strong demand in winter.  At the end of the month, coal balls reached a high price of five dollars per dan, which is a far cry from the pre-war price of one dollar and ten cents per dan.  Among miscellaneous items, tea has risen the most sharply, increasing by 68.42% compared to last month.

### Two People Abducted in Die Village, Yuyuan Road; Incident Arose from a Minor Matter; Nouveau Riche Abusing Power and Bullying People

In Die Village, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West, at number 20, live two Zhu sisters who work as dancers in a certain dance hall. Yesterday at around 6:00 PM, the two sisters, accompanied by their boyfriend (a certain nouveau riche), took their own car, number 3414, and left home. When the car drove to the entrance of the lane, Wang Shouye and Wang Maoxia, residents of number 24 in the same lane, were seeing off a friend in a rickshaw. Somehow, the car and the rickshaw collided, and the two sides had an argument. At that time, the dancer's boyfriend got out of the car and ran out of the lane. After a while, he returned with six fake policemen, who, without asking the reason, kidnapped Wang Shouye and Wang Maoxia. In the midst of the chaos, the concierge at number 1121 of the lane saw the situation and was greatly shocked. He immediately telephoned the Jing'an Temple Road police station. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately sent detectives to investigate. By the time the detectives arrived, the fake policemen had dispersed and the two Wangs had been taken away. The police station is currently investigating the details.

### Department Store Owner Sun Qilong Accused of Interference with Family

Shen Chang Department Store at 55 Avenue Dubail is owned by Sun Qilong (45 years old this year) from Yangzhou. He sublets the remaining rooms upstairs as a second landlord. Sun Chenggui, the owner of Gong Xin Department Store at 605 Wenlu, had his wife renting rooms from Sun Qilong's department store upstairs. Shen Chang store owner Sun Qilong, seeing that Sun Chenggui's wife, Ms. Gu, had a beautiful appearance, secretly seduced her and began a relationship without the knowledge of Mr. Sun Chenggui. Recently, while Sun Qilong was managing affairs in the store after dinner on the 4th of last month, he was suddenly attacked by thugs who splashed nitric acid, causing injuries to Sun Qilong's head, face, and left eye. The assailants fled the scene. After being injured, Sun Qilong reported the incident to the French police station and was sent to Guangxiang Hospital for treatment. The police station began investigating the perpetrators. After Sun Qilong was discharged from the hospital, he hired lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Sun Chenggui of instigating the assault. He also admitted to having a relationship with Sun Chenggui's wife, Ms. Gu. Over time, Sun Chenggui learned of the affair and threatened revenge, which has now come to fruition. He requested that the court investigate according to Article 178 of the Criminal Law. Judge Miao Qingbang opened a trial on the case. The defendant Sun Chenggui and his defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang appeared in court, denying instigating the assault. During the time when the plaintiff was injured, the defendant was transporting his concubine's coffin back to his hometown and was not in Shanghai. The court ordered the police station's files to be investigated and adjourned the hearing. Subsequently, Sun Chenggui, through his lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Sun Qilong of interference with his family, requesting that the court investigate according to the law. Judge Jiang Quan opened a trial on the case the morning before yesterday. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. After the court questioned both parties in detail, the court ruled that the case required a detailed investigation and adjourned the hearing.

### Female Hostess Runs Away; Woman Instigates and Receives Sentence

Qu Shusheng, a local resident, 34 years old this year, lives at 272 Rue Sainte Marie, Avenue du Roi Albert, and runs the Qu Shengxing Cotton Shop. In 1927, he met Yu Taohua (22 years old this year, from Ningbo), a female hostess at the Great World amusement park, and soon rented a house to live together. They have a daughter. Recently, they had disagreements, and the woman hired a lawyer to file a petition in the Civil Court of the Special Second Court, requesting mediation, seeking to terminate the cohabitation relationship with Qu, and demanding 50 yuan per month for living expenses. After mediation by the court, the two parties reached a settlement and reconciled. However, Qu discovered that the woman's hiring of a lawyer was instigated by Lin Xu, the wife of his neighbor Lin Genfa, who colluded with the woman. Qu then reported the woman to the police for running away and accused Lin Xu of inciting theft. Both were arrested by detectives and sent to the Criminal Court 8 of the Special Second Court for trial. After trial, Judge Zhu Chuzhe ruled that Yu Taohua was guilty of theft and Lin Xu was guilty of inciting theft, each sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for three years.

### Robbery Fails and Thieves Are Arrested; One Thief Sent Back for Trial; Two Thieves Sentenced to Five Years

The robbers Cao Youfa from Ningbo and Yu Quhai from Tongzhou, at around 9:00 PM on January 30th, with their accomplices Jiang Asan and Shen Atao, who are still at large, each armed with fake pistols and knives, broke into the Yu Shunfeng tobacco and paper shop at 1783 Yangshupu Road, intending to rob the property. Cao Youfa pulled out a knife and dragged the shop owner, Yu Agao from Ningbo, into a small room behind the shop, threatening him to make a sound. At that time, Yu's wife, Ms. Wang, was quite alert and climbed to the roof, shouting for robbers and sounding the alarm. Jiang, Shen, and Yu, seeing that things were not going well, scattered and fled. Cao, inside, was unaware and was captured by the shop owner, Yu Agao. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Liu Changgen of the Yangshupu police station arrived after hearing the alarm and took Cao to the police station. He learned that his accomplice Yu Quhai was hiding at 4 Tangshan Road. He went to arrest him and arrested Cao. In the morning of July, they were sent to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu gave a detailed account of the case, requesting an extension of the detention of the accomplices. Then the tobacco and paper shop owner Yu Agao testified about the incident. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two thieves Cao and Yu briefly and ordered them to be sent back for trial and further verification. Also, the robbers Zhang Ajin, a local, and Huang Hanyang, from Tongzhou, at 6:00 PM on January 31st, joined with two others who are still at large to rob the property of the Li Da Cloth Shop at 17 Lloyd Road, worth 880 yuan. The case was discovered, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. On the morning of the 7th, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Court 3 conducted a trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the two accomplices who were at large could not be arrested.

### Preliminary Discussion on the Public Treasury Regulations

— Xia Gaobo

Scholars have often said that the organization and facilities of our country's financial administration are quite unique: that is, the joint comprehensive organization of the four powers. Joint comprehensive organization, abbreviated as joint organization, except for a very small number of scholars (such as Mr. Hu Shanheng) who have offered comments and criticisms, is generally regarded as a good structure for our country's financial administration. Its essence lies in the transcendence of rights and responsibilities, hoping to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. This type of organization is based on the structure of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution, so it cannot be effectively copied by other countries with the separation of three powers or a cabinet system. The effectiveness of the joint organization is based on the establishment and soundness of the four major systems. The four major systems refer to the administrative system (i.e., the command system), the cashier system (i.e., the public treasury system), the accounting system (as active auditing), and the auditing system (as passive auditing). In the past, from the perspective of laws and regulations, various organizational laws of accounting organs (specifically referring to the four aspects of administration, accounting, cashier, and auditing) have been promulgated and clearly ordered to be implemented; various procedural laws (such as the Budget Law, the Accounting Law, the Audit Law, and the Settlement Law, etc.) have also been promulgated and implemented one after another. However, although the Public Treasury Law (promulgated on June 9, 1938) and its implementation rules (promulgated by the Executive Yuan on June 27, 1939) have been promulgated one after another, they have not been implemented due to insufficient political conditions. Recently, considering that at the time of resistance and national construction, the unification of national income and expenditure is urgently needed, so that public funds can be returned to the public and strengthen national financial strength, and a clear political situation can also be realized, the National Government issued an order on June 24, 1939, that the Public Treasury Law will be gradually implemented in stages and regions from October 1st. Thus, the four major systems under the joint organization, which is admired by the world, are all established, and the time for vigorous governance has arrived. Therefore, the implementation of the Public Treasury Law has great significance in the history of our country's finance and cannot be taken lightly.

The author once drafted an article "The Public Treasury Law About to Be Implemented" (see Volume 23, Issue 29 of the Banking Weekly), making a brief introduction to the Public Treasury Law before its implementation, attaching my own views and placing unlimited hope in the future. Now I will study the provisions again and offer a preliminary discussion, but I am afraid that my opinions are not as good as those of ordinary people.

1. Regulations on Public Treasury Deposit Contracts Considering that our country's public treasury system adopts the "bank deposit system," Article 8 of the Public Treasury Law (hereinafter referred to as "this law") states: "The cash and matured bills and securities received by the bank as an agent shall be deposited in the form of deposits..." Then, the agent bank or postal institution has the right to use and the obligation to pay interest on the deposited public funds. The rights and obligations between the two parties (the public treasury competent authority and the agent bank) shall be determined by contract in accordance with the law and approved by the superior authority of the public treasury competent authority (according to the note, the superior authority of the national treasury competent authority is the Executive Yuan; the superior authority of the provincial treasury and the municipal treasury directly under the Executive Yuan is the Ministry of Finance; the superior authority of the county and municipal treasury competent authority is the provincial finance department) (see Article 8 and Article 2, paragraph 2 of this law, and Article 17 of the implementation rules).

The contents or necessary items of the contract are not thoroughly regulated in this law and its implementation rules, and it is vaguely stated that "except for specific restrictions by laws and regulations, it shall be determined by contract..." I believe that this provision is too general and lacks thoroughness. It is true that the relationship between the rights and obligations of the two parties varies due to different circumstances. If it is clearly stipulated by law, it will be obstructive and inappropriate. However, some basic relationships and matters can also be generally regulated, so that the agent bank and the public treasury competent authority have something to follow when signing a contract, and the necessary items will not be omitted. Otherwise, once signed and approved by the superior authority, it will be troublesome to amend it if it becomes inconvenient. In order to speed up the time and facilitate the smooth implementation, the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have appropriate regulations on this matter.

2. Discussion on Appropriation Notification According to the provisions of the implementation rules, after the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury receives the payment order from the public treasury competent authority, it shall transfer the amount from the total deposit to the ordinary expenditure deposit account of the requesting agency and issue an "appropriation notification" to the requesting agency. The receiving agency shall fill out a receipt after receiving the payment notification from the public treasury competent authority and then claim it from the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury (Articles 23 and 24 of the implementation rules, and Article 26, paragraph 2). Whether the receiving agency must wait until it receives the appropriation notification from the agent bank before it can fill out the receipt and claim the amount, or whether the receipt of the appropriation notification is irrelevant, there is no clear provision in the law.

Judging from the facts, the agent bank and the receiving agency are mostly in the same place. After the agent bank receives the payment order from the public treasury competent authority, it makes a transfer record and then fills out the appropriation notification and sends it to the receiving agency. The receiving agency receives the payment notification from the public treasury competent authority before receiving the appropriation notification (because the latter passes through the agent bank). Therefore, if the receiving agency can claim the amount only with the payment notification, the appropriation notification will be equal to a dummy and have no effect. Also, from the bank's point of view, since the law stipulates that an appropriation notification must be issued, it can be known that it will not allow payment before it is issued or before it is delivered, because the bank believes that the appropriation notification is one of the good payment vouchers. If there are no clear regulations on the procedures, unnecessary disputes will often occur.

Therefore, I believe that the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have clear regulations, such as: the receiving agency must wait until it receives the appropriation notification from the agent bank before it can go to claim the amount together with the payment notification and the completed receipt. However, when the receiving agency receives the payment notification but not the appropriation notification, it can only inquire with the agent bank based on the notification.

3. General Regulations on the Qualifications of Bank Agents Our country's public treasury system is a bank deposit system, so the agent of the public treasury is a bank or postal institution. Regarding the selection of banks, the laws and regulations only indicate four principles: (1) The central bank shall be the principle for the national treasury. (2) For public treasury affairs at all levels other than the national treasury, local banks in the province, city, or county may be designated to act as agents where there is no central bank. (3) Where there is no local bank, other banks may be designated to act as agents, but they must first be approved by the superior government's public treasury competent authority (see the note in the first point of this article). (4) In places where there are no banks, the postal institution should be designated as an agent.

The so-called selection of "other banks" is not regulated by law and does not seem to have a standard to follow. For example, the nature of the bank, Chinese banks and foreign banks, the size of the bank's capital, the determination of the postal institution, etc., are quite problematic. Although its "designation" must be approved by the superior authority of the public treasury competent authority, although the law does not clearly state it, it should not be arbitrarily contacted and established. However, because there is no standard to follow, it will inevitably hinder it. In our country, official correspondence between government offices is often delayed for a long time, with many twists and turns, which will inevitably suffer from delays and lose its agility. Therefore, general regulations are essential for the implementation rules. For example, other banks should (1) be commercial banks in principle, followed by savings banks, and then agricultural banks (with the flexibility of capital turnover as the priority), (2) foreign banks shall not be designated except in special circumstances, (3) quasi-public-private banks should be designated first where there are quasi-public-private banks (reliable), (4) strong capital and stable operation should be the top priority (which can be obtained by analyzing the recent settlement statements of each bank), and (5) postal institutions refer to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the post office may be designated where there is no Savings and Remittance Bureau.

4. Regulations on Property Trust According to the Public Treasury, the duties of the agent are two: (1) the receipt, payment, custody and transfer of public treasury cash bills and securities, and (2) the custody of property deeds. Property deeds refer to documents of ownership and warehouse receipts, bills of lading or other documents, this is clearly stipulated by law (Article 2 of this law, Article 2 of the implementation rules).

In fact, however, property is not only kept in custody but can also be used (for production or interest-bearing purposes) to maximize the economic benefits of the property and increase the income of public funds. This is the natural principle of financial management.

The purpose of establishing a public treasury system, in short, is two: one is to hope to unify income and expenditure, so as to achieve the effect of economic agility, and the other is to avoid self-management of income and expenditure, so as to prevent the disadvantages of cutting off and embezzling. Therefore, the use of property for profit shall not be handled by the administrative heads of each agency. This is not to measure a gentleman with the belly of a villain, but the basic principle of the public treasury system. Now that the custody of property is entrusted to the bank, its use should also belong to the same. However, entrusting the use is not a "deposit relationship" but a "trust relationship." Therefore, it is very clear that the contract originally signed by the public treasury competent authority and the agent bank should not be included incidentally and should be signed separately as a trust contract. However, the laws and regulations have not clearly stated this, nor is there any provision that can be applied.

I believe that the implementation rules of this law should have the necessity to regulate this, the main points of which are the qualifications of the trustee (whether it must or must not be assumed by the agent bank), the procedures for signing and its approval, etc.

5. Regulations on Accounting Year and Month The words "year," "daily report," "ten-day report," and "monthly report" are repeatedly mentioned in the Public Treasury laws and regulations, but there is no clear regulation on the starting and ending dates. According to the example of analogy in law, this point does not seem to be a problem, because the accounting year can be based on the Budget Law (Article 11 of the revised Budget Law), and the "daily" report and "ten-day" report can be based on the Accounting Law (Article 21 of the Accounting Law), and there should be no objection. However, from the three elements of legal thoroughness, consistency, and certainty, it is still necessary to regulate in the Public Treasury laws and regulations. For example, the accounting year has already been regulated in the Budget Law, and Article 21, paragraph 1 of the Accounting Law still has the phrase "the beginning and end of the accounting year shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Budget Law," which is the reason for this. Therefore, I believe that the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have similar regulations as listed above: "The accounting year shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Budget Law. The determination of the day, ten days, and month shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Accounting Law." It is also to show the legal thoroughness, consistency, and certainty.

I remember eight or nine years ago, there was a loud slogan, "Down with corrupt officials!" Considering the reality, greed and corruption all refer to financial fraud. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, it has been very rare for those who entered officialdom to remain clean. Why is this? Because the financial administration is extremely chaotic, and most of the administrative heads also manage finance, and it is easy to embezzle and intercept. After the establishment of the National Government, it was determined to govern clearly and severely punish corrupt officials, but it was mostly inclined to be passive and to punish after the fact. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve accounting and politics, and there have been some achievements. Now, the establishment of a public treasury system and the clear order to implement the Public Treasury Law are another warning to corrupt officials and are what our people are happy to hear. Therefore, the author has tried not to avoid his own shallowness and wrote an article to introduce it before the implementation, in order to welcome this great event in financial history. Now, I will express my own views to contribute to the authorities and colleagues, as an expectation of throwing a brick to attract jade. December 1939 at Fudan University

### The Abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty and the Shanghai Black Market

— Cao Linye

Japan is a country with innate deficiencies, and all the necessities for industry are completely dependent on the supply from other countries. The needs during wartime increase as consumption increases. As for the detailed statistical figures, they are unknown because they have stopped being published since July 1936. In peacetime, Japan's annual needs for heavy industrial raw materials are roughly as follows:

Steel 4.441 (thousand tons) Unknown

Pig iron 4.195 30%

Iron ore 13.248 90% Obtained from our country, India, the United States, etc.

Scrap iron 1.497 50% Completely supplied by the United States

Coal 4.42 Unknown Some are supplied by our country as well as active producers

Petroleum 85.523 90% Obtained from the British, American, and American-occupied areas %

Japan's main source of raw materials is now in fact only the United States. However, because Japan's invasion of China has sacrificed American interests in China, and the American people absolutely sympathize with China's war of resistance, the US-Japan Treaty has been abrogated.

After the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty, the only way for Japan to obtain raw materials from the United States is to seize them in Shanghai. It is not that Shanghai is the place of production of these raw materials, but that they can be purchased from the United States in Shanghai. Naturally, the Japanese will use unscrupulous merchants to purchase on their behalf. However, the Japanese currency will plummet. The foreign exchange rate will change greatly. However, the exchange rate of the legal tender will remain unchanged. This is because the legal tender is only acting as a medium. The recent depreciation of the Japanese puppet currency against the legal tender is the reason for this.

### Market Knowledge Consultant

Mr. Yi Ziqing inquired, and Mr. Wang Haibo replied as follows:

Question: In the "Shanghai Newspaper Commercial News" (12th of last month) column, it states "Tianjin telegraphic transfer to Shanghai exchanges three yuan for one hundred and seven yuan." Does this mean that delivering Tianjin local legal tender of one hundred and seven yuan in Tianjin will receive one hundred yuan in Shanghai?

Answer: It means delivering Tianjin legal tender of one hundred and seven yuan will receive one hundred yuan of legal tender in Shanghai.

Question: Also, "Joint Notes" traded at 96 yuan, up half a yuan. Does this mean that one hundred yuan of legal tender in Tianjin can purchase ninety-six yuan of Joint Notes?

Answer: It means that one hundred yuan of legal tender in Tianjin can buy ninety-six yuan of "Joint Notes," but this is an illegal act.

Question: What is the meaning of "under the table" in the above question? What is the value of each "Joint Note" in shillings? Are there restrictions on purchasing foreign exchange with "Joint Notes" in Tianjin?

Answer: "Under the table" here is interpreted as illegal. "Joint Notes" cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange. They must first be exchanged for legal tender before they can be used for purchase.

Mr. Li Wenyu inquired: "Is legal tender with North China place names (such as Peiping, Tianjin, Shandong, etc.) generally usable in the interior?"

Answer: As far as this reporter knows, it is redeemed by inland banks, but cannot be generally used in the interior.

### Eating Sycees

— Chen Liang

Sycees were a type of currency in ancient times, including gold sycees and silver sycees, used to exchange for goods. Whoever had more sycees was the wealthy person. Over time, sycees have long disappeared, replaced by colorful legal tender. Even the homes of true millionaires may not be able to find a single sycee in their silver chests. It is easy to imagine what other people's homes might be like. Perhaps one can still see a wooden one during the "adding officials" performance on stage.

Although sycees have disappeared, people still consider them precious and lovely. Beggars deeply understand this mentality, and when begging, they always offer auspicious and prayerful words: "Big boss, congratulations on earning sycees all year round." The big boss may, for the sake of the sycees, generously give him two cents for a tram ticket. In these recent days, the sound of sycees has become even more pervasive, not only spoken but also materialized, and even edible. Eating sycees is indeed a miracle, wouldn't it be like "swallowing gold!"

Once explained, it is not surprising. It turns out that this is precisely the long-standing custom and habit that has been reformed but not eliminated. At the New Year's banquet, almost every dish is a substitute for sycees. Pork hocks are sycees, pig trotters are also sycees, soy sauce eggs are sycees, and meat-filled egg dumplings are also sycees. Other foods such as clams, carp, and even salty baked long-life fruits are all sycees. The host raises his chopsticks and invites: "Come, come, let's eat sycees." The guest declines with humility, accepts with shame, and offers a new year's greeting: "Congratulations on your household's constant flow of sycees." The host is naturally happy: "Thank you, thank you, everyone gets rich, everyone earns sycees." Thus, cups are exchanged, and the host and guests part happily.

### Four Keys to Prolonging the Life of a Felt Hat

— Zhao Shi

Newspapers best serve the social population through prompt service. The best form of service advertisement is also called service. Recently, a British hat factory that sells particularly expensive felt hats always inserts a piece of paper inside the hat, clearly stating four conditions for those who are good at using hats, ensuring they can return the hat for exchange.

"1. Do not expose to excessive dust, brush gently daily.

2. Do not allow unclean hats to get excessively wet.

3. Do not touch this hat with dirty hands.

4. If the hat is not worn on the head, store it properly immediately."

Those who are good at using hats are said to preserve the color and shape without change, meaning without discoloration or change in appearance.

"If the hat user fulfills the above four conditions and still finds any non-compliance, a return for exchange is guaranteed."

Purchasers, seeing that the British factory's hats specifically note methods for long-term use, are driven by a desire for knowledge, deeply trusting the factory's products. Consequently, the factory's goods spread far and wide without promotion. This is the effect of psychology.

Our country faces resource constraints. Whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, we should conduct in-depth research. If merchants know to emulate the service spirit of advertising experts in advanced countries, providing detailed usage instructions to benefit compatriots, while also enhancing the reputation of national products, it would be a new opening, truly a win-win situation.

### Year-End Dinner

— Zhang Mengzhao

Another year has passed easily. Today (the 12th) is again the "Fifth Day of the New Year" (also known as the God of Wealth Day) in the lunar calendar. According to custom, every old-fashioned industrial and commercial organization must have a grand "Year-End Dinner" on this day, saying that after eating it, everyone will surely get rich throughout the year. Chinese people emphasize "eating" and also emphasize "money." Everyone cannot help but blurt out, "What is life for?"

In the customs of Wuxi merchants, the "Fifth Day of the Year" is also called the "Bedding Birthday." The departure and retention of staff are decided on the eve (the fourth day of the new year). Managers deliberate on which staff members are diligent, honest, and hardworking; and which are irresponsible and absurd. The diligent are retained, and the absurd are dismissed. Beforehand, staff members are very secretive about the issue of their job retention, kept in the dark, and must wait until the "Year-End Dinner." If there is no place for them, they will be shocked and realize that they will be packing up and leaving. Therefore, friends who have a seat at the Year-End Dinner are all smiles, overjoyed. The unfortunate brothers inevitably knit their brows, and sorrow arises from within. In fact, breaking through the magic mirror, can managers truly base retention and dismissal on the standards of diligence and laziness in the past year? That is not necessarily the case, because people with nepotistic connections often occupy important positions, as stable as Mount Tai. Despite being absurd at ordinary times, when it comes to eating the Year-End Dinner, they always sit in the seat of honor. Therefore, the anger and resentment in the hearts of those who are dismissed is truly "unable to complain, like a mute eating Coptis chinensis." From this point of view, although the "Year-End Dinner" is delicious, it is indeed somewhat edible but not edible.

### A Week's Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Among the New Year dishes, one thing occupies a very important position, and that is vermicelli. The vermicelli we usually buy is always soaked in water, but at the end of the lunar year, dried vermicelli appears on the market. Probably every household, large or small, has dried vermicelli; because a hot pot is indispensable for the New Year's dinner, and vermicelli is indispensable in the hot pot. Speaking of the price of vermicelli, it was only twenty cents a pound before the war, but now it has risen to more than one yuan. It is really shockingly high, but because it is indispensable in the hot pot, everyone has to endure the pain and eat it. Vermicelli itself has no taste and relies entirely on the fresh soup to help it. Apart from being used in hot pot, it doesn't seem to go well with other meat dishes. In vegetarian dishes, it can be stir-fried with pickled mustard greens, spinach, or green vegetables, or it can be blanched yellow in hot oil and then braised with wheat gluten and dried tofu. There are no other new variations. White dried vermicelli is considered superior, and yellow vermicelli becomes mushy and unpalatable once cooked.

### Adapting to the European War Environment in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Tian Shi, from The Hague

The Second European War, which began in September 1939, although not as widespread as it was twenty-five years ago, has greatly changed the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of Europeans. I will mention a few things to illustrate the rest.

First, clothing. The easiest thing to change with the times in Western society is women's clothing. The women's clothing that is particularly convenient during wartime, originating in London and Paris and popular in major cities, mostly adopts dark green or dark red in the style of grapes, or brown in different shades, and the fabric always has light-colored patterns or light-colored decorations. Skirts must be shortened to save materials. The price of tailor-made coats is particularly high, making it most inconvenient to change with the times. The difference between wartime and peacetime is only to add a light-colored belt on top. Gloves should match the color of the coat, mostly using dark colors with light-colored inlays. Raincoats should be changed to buy slightly lighter colors. The use of light colors as embellishments in the above items is entirely to avoid collisions during dark runs during air raid alarms. Shoes should be warm colors of brown-red or dark green. Rubber overshoes and long boots should be purchased as soon as possible, fearing that the lights will suddenly go out during an alarm and standing water on the road cannot be seen. At the same time, women's handbags should be enlarged so that they can also store emergency flashlights and large, unsightly gas masks. Men's clothing and footwear all remain the same, except that they must wear light-colored metal lapel pins, badges, school badges, or hat badges before going out every day to prevent collisions in the dark under the alarm. In addition, the knitting of lines by women can enable trapped people to forget panic and worry at any time and anywhere through work, such as when traffic is blocked, trains are delayed halfway, and those who are idle in a small room under light control can use knitting to pass the time, while the knitted winter clothes are also convenient for comforting and rescuing compatriots in distress or sending them to soldiers on the front line. It is truly a win-win situation.

Second, food. Digestion is sufficient to affect the health of the body. In wartime, people should prioritize health care. Those who live in the rear eat too much meat, which harms digestion. Meat is an acid-producing food, unlike vegetables, which are alkalizing foods. Meat eaters cannot exert force for a long time and are easily fatigued, and even suffer from nephritis, or lead to high blood pressure. Prevention cannot be started too soon. Common people suffer from stomach diseases and cannot eat, half due to nervous action. Medical experts, drawing lessons from the previous European War, have seen that soldiers who go to the front lines, because they have no time to think about stomach diseases, often find that their suffering is suddenly cured. Those who linger in the rear can still feel the suffering of indigestion. To avoid this suffering, the first thing to do is to choose food. First, eat small, very oily things. When eating fatty items, only eat dishes made with butter or vegetable oil. Second, do not eat too much bread. Third, do not indulge in baked meat. Fourth, do not eat irritants such as pepper and mustard. Fifth, drinking alcohol should not be too drunk. Sixth, eat slowly.

Third, housing. In wartime, the health of the body is certainly very important, but the adjustment of the spirit is even more urgent. The first requirement of living is sleep. Sufficient sleep doubles the spirit, and the efficiency of work will definitely double. The card games of Eastern society are most harmful to body and mind. According to Western experts, six or seven hours of sleep may be enough to satisfy the physical labor, but those who use their minds to govern the rear should have at least eight or nine hours of sleep every night. Taking the experience of the previous European War as an example, the soldiers on the front lines are actually easier to fall asleep than the people in the bombed areas in the rear. If the soldiers on the front lines do not get a good sleep after a major battle, then in a few days, the elite soldiers will turn into a defeated army. Therefore, the latest method of the First European War was to first seek appropriate allocation, so that those who exerted effort on the front line could have timely alternation and rest, and the people in the rear should know the indispensability of sleep. Another requirement of living is that men and women can live together in peace and harmony. In wartime, all industries are tense, and quarrels and conflicts are inevitable due to dissatisfaction with home life. Westerners call it easy to get angry as having a "hot temper." Judging from today's scientific perspective, it may be possible to control it with mental treatment. The method should be to have the man and woman who are prone to anger diligently write a diary, and write down and remember in detail the words or actions that caused anger each time. The technique of treating anger lies in being able to know how anger arises and when it will arise, and from then on, control it. It is naturally twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, if men and women living together can mention the person they love and the thing they like to recall at any time, it is also a wonderful way to calm anger, thereby overcoming adversity and reaching a smooth situation.

Fourth, transportation. Whether warring countries or neutral countries, they all know to save kerosene and avoid using motorized means of transportation. Vacations and car trips are particularly prohibited, and bicycles are used instead. For a time, the bicycle business profited tenfold. Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, as the head of state, also personally rides a bicycle to go out. This is in stark contrast to the situation in China, where important figures abandon cars and take rickshaws.

### A Realistic Theme

— Ye Yufan

My roommate, Mr. L, has been suffering terribly these past few days. When he comes back in the evening, he stands on the second floor and shouts to his younger brother:

"Lei Sheng! Come up! Come up! It's getting late."

The reply is: "There are still two rounds to go." Still the crisp sound of bamboo tiles.

This set of "winter vacation homework" is like this day and night. I live on the third floor, Mr. L's family lives on the second floor, and below is the so-called "Shanghai landlord." The landlord's room is simply a hotbed of mahjong (mahjong atmosphere). Several of his children also play a good hand, which truly deserves the title "teaching children well" (Square City).

Mr. L's younger brother, who is also a junior high school student, spends almost every day during the winter vacation immersed in mahjong and Twenty-one. Sometimes, he goes out with friends for snacks and, when he's happy, he even runs to the jai alai court.

This is indeed a realistic theme worthy of attention. Schools cannot do without vacations, but it is questionable that young students with vacations waste their time like this. Moreover, in the vacation, the winds of gambling and the formation of nonsense, ruin the youth in this furnace, which is not the original intention of the school to give vacations. Therefore, it is necessary to awaken the attention of parents, otherwise, the future is worrying. Mr. L's younger brother, the roommate, is a realistic specimen.

### A Little Story of Giving New Year Gifts

— Ji Fufang

Mr. Zhang borrowed ten yuan from a friend and said to Mrs. Zhang when he got home, "Mr. He recommended this matter to me, and I haven't thanked him yet. Now that it's the end of the year, I should give some gifts." Mrs. Zhang also agreed. So he bought a few pounds of New Year cakes and a ham and sent them to the He family.

When he went to give the gifts, it happened that Old Mrs. Li was eating at the He family. She saw Mrs. Zhang giving gifts and discussed it with her son when she got home, "The Zhang family's friendship with the He family is about the same as ours. They gave gifts, and we can't avoid it either." Her son always obeyed his mother, so he took out ten yuan and asked her to buy New Year gifts.

When the gift was sent to the He family, Mrs. He felt bad again. She told her husband, "This gift from Old Mrs. Li cannot be accepted for nothing." So the next day, the He family sent gifts to the Li family again.

Old Mrs. Li saw that most of the gifts were sweets, which she and her son didn't like very much, so she took two pieces at random and sent them to the Xu family next door, just to be kind.

But the Xu family couldn't accept her gift for nothing, and they were also trying to send a gift.

In the cries of difficult life, giving gifts is not what people willingly want, but only中了"人情", "心愿"的毒。

### Busy with Entertainment

— Chun Liang

"Shanghai As It Is" Essay Contest

Shanghai indeed has a part of the population suffering from the cruel oppression of work, resting all day long, but most of them are almost busy for entertainment and running around for entertainment.

There are many idle people on the streets, pacing their square steps. There are many boring people in teahouses and bathrooms, leisurely discussing their nonsense.

No matter what play is being performed in the theater, they all put up a full house sign. Escort companies are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. Prostitutes are trekking from east to west from time to time; all to solve the "entertainment" hunger and thirst of the Shanghainese.

Except for those who make a living by gambling, everyone regards money gambling as an "entertainment item." Although they gamble every day, they would never admit that this is their daily routine, but just "entertainment entertainment." For the sake of "entertainment," the threshold of the casino is almost worn through, and almost every room in the hotel is fighting in Square City. The sound of tiles can be compared with the sound of gunfire, and "ancient people" such as Zhang Jiuguan and Zhang Sanhuai will be memorized by heart.

There are many, many other entertainments that are too numerous to mention. For the sake of entertainment, everyone is a busy person. So Shanghai is prosperous, the cars on the road are like flowing water and the horses are like dragons, and it is also filled with a group of crowded pedestrians. Emerging industries are booming, and unpopular things are also taken into account, let alone the fact that vain dreams will be noticed and cherished.

Time continues to come, never ending. And the Shanghainese just want to kill the current time in order to welcome the time in the future.

### After the Rain Comes Clear Skies

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 20 World Transportation, Common Language, Children's Education, Scholarship, Pity for Talent

Jiang Jingrong lost his father at the age of eight. He was an orphan, and his family was poor. After his father's death, he had no family property. Fortunately, his mother was very virtuous. At that time, the old Chinese morality regarded remarriage as unchaste. Although Jiang Jingrong's mother was only twenty-nine years old, she thought: I have a son and two daughters. Dragging a group of children, marrying a husband again will definitely make them suffer. Moreover, after marrying a husband, who knows if they will not have more children, and the children of the former husband and the children of the latter husband will be divided. Therefore, she preferred to remain chaste and raise her orphans, relying on her ten fingers to do some needlework, which actually enabled Jiang Jingrong to graduate from elementary school. The more orphaned children are, the more diligent they are. In addition, Jiang Jingrong was intelligent and achieved higher grades than other students in school. However, after graduating from elementary school, Jiang Jingrong's mother could no longer afford to send her son to middle school. Unlike modern China, elementary school is completely free, and the state assumes the obligation of educating its citizens. Middle schools also charge very little tuition, making it easy for citizens to afford. Jiang Jingrong was thirteen years old at that time. He said that he was unable to go to school, so he did not want to go to school. He loved his sisters very much. His two sisters, one was nine years old and the other was seven years old, had not yet attended elementary school. He would rather not go to middle school himself and send his two sisters to elementary school, even if his two sisters could not all go to elementary school, first send his older sister to elementary school and delay his younger sister for a while. Because his older sister is nine years old this year and can no longer delay. Fortunately, when Jiang Jingrong was studying in higher elementary school, he would definitely teach his two sisters every night when he came back, like a small teacher. Now that his older sister has entered elementary school, his younger sister can still be taught by himself, or it would be best to be able to send his younger sister to elementary school next semester if he can afford it. Because his older sister was taught by her older brother, the small teacher, at home, she was promoted to the third grade as soon as she entered elementary school, which made Jiang Jingrong particularly happy. Originally, the reason why he did not continue to middle school after graduating from elementary school was, firstly, because middle school tuition was very expensive and his mother could not afford it; secondly, he thought that although he was a child, he also wanted to help his mother and wanted to find a job. It was a pity that there were very few job opportunities for children in China at that time. To be an apprentice in that kind of shop or factory was simply like being a slave or a servant, and his mother would not send him in. Later, he found a job as a newspaper boy himself. No matter how cold or hot it was, he always ran around every day, always delivering newspapers for people to read. Because of his diligence, his life was not bad. (236)

### "Diligence Flag" to Prevent New Year's Truancy

— Encouragement

Now that all elementary schools have started and classes are about to begin, the current abolished lunar New Year falls within class time. Because families are celebrating the New Year with joy, elementary school students are bound to play truant. They will play at home, and the school will become a situation where "students abandon the teacher."

The best solution is naturally for parents to urge their children to go to school. The school should also indirectly persuade or reward students for attending classes. Now, I have a method to offer to the principals of elementary schools for reference. This is to make several small flags with the word "Diligence" written on them. Make a daily statistic and award the flag to the class with the highest attendance during the New Year to show encouragement. Because these small flags are considered by the innocent elementary school students to be a great honor and prestige. Once they get the "Diligence Flag," they are unspeakably happy, encouraging each other, and hoping to obtain it again tomorrow. Those who have not received it will definitely work hard to promote attendance so that classmates do not miss classes without reason, and thereby capture the prize flag.
