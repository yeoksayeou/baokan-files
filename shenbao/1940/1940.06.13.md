### German Forces Advance in Two Routes, Completing the Great Encirclement of Paris. Vanguard Units are Only Fifteen Miles from the French Capital. Germany Claims to Have Occupied the Key Town of Reims.

Paris: The General Headquarters announced in its war bulletin this morning, "Fighting is still ongoing on the front lines. There were no significant changes along the entire line last night. However, the enemy has launched a major offensive towards the city of Reims, supported by two armored divisions. This has been confirmed." (Havas News Agency, 12th)

Berlin: The German Command announced that the fall of Paris seems inevitable today. German troops have advanced from the area between the Oise and the Ourcq, reaching a point fifteen miles from Paris. They have also occupied Reims, a key city northeast of Paris. Simultaneously, advanced German units have crossed the Suippes River in the Champagne region. Northwest of Paris, German forces have broken through French lines, reaching a point twenty kilometers from the French capital. The German Air Force is now constantly flying over Paris to bomb the city. German tanks and infantry have also occupied Allied positions on both sides of the town of Solesmes, northeast of Paris. (Associated Press, 12th)

Paris: Last night, upon hearing that the European war had spread to Africa and that Italy had begun attacking British and French Somaliland, the French General Headquarters declared, "The fate of Paris, as well as that of all French territory north of the Seine and Marne rivers, will be decided today. The most intense fighting is now taking place on all fronts, indicating that the enemy hopes to achieve a decisive victory at this time. While French forces in southern France are firmly defending their positions, awaiting the advance of Italian forces, British and French troops along the Seine and Marne rivers launched their final desperate resistance last night, hoping to prevent the fall of Paris by reversing the German tide, as in the Battle of the Marne in 1914." It is reported that the German offensive on all fronts last night intensified because Hitler reinforced it with new mechanized and infantry divisions. German tanks, under cover of German aircraft bombing the outskirts of Paris, which engulfed the entire French capital in flames, launched an attack on the Allied lines from both the east and west, attempting to encircle the French capital. German mechanized units rolled over battlefields littered with corpses. The pressure on the Allied lines around Cuigy-en-Chaussee, Le Mesnil-Théribus, and Fresnoy-en-Thelle was greatly increased. According to military sources, the German forces hope to avoid passing through the forests that protect Paris from the north, as these forests have been heavily mined. German mechanized units or infantry passing through this area would suffer enormous losses. French military authorities acknowledged last night that, despite suffering extremely heavy losses in several battles during the previous month, the German offensive has not diminished but has intensified. This shows that the German side has mobilized its entire national strength in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough." (Associated Press, 12th)

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that the situation on all fronts today is extremely intense, and can be described as follows: (1) On the line west of the Oise River, the enemy clearly seeks a decisive battle and is attempting to forcibly cross the Seine River between the cities of Vernon and Gaillon. Under the cover of smoke, the enemy attempted to build pontoon bridges across the river to transport tanks to the south bank, but our forces immediately launched a fierce attack, preventing their advance. (2) On the line east of the Oise River, a large enemy force is pressing towards the Ourcq Canal. Under the cover of numerous tanks, they repeatedly attacked the towns of La Ferté-Milon and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. Our main forces in that area have been ordered to move south of the Marne River to fight, with only rear guard units engaging them. (3) On the line north of the Marne River near Reims, the enemy used a large number of tanks to advance to the areas of the Vesle River and the Ardre River, and then attacked the city from both the east and southwest. The fighting is extremely fierce. (4) In the Champagne region, the enemy transferred a large number of fresh troops south of the Aisne River last night. From dawn today, the two sides resumed contact along the Retourne River. Our forces resisted fiercely, launching several counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy south of the city of Attigny. (5) On the Aisne River and the Meuse River, enemy forces repeatedly attacked our positions but were repelled. (6) Our air force units flew to the German cities of Mannheim, Neustadt, Frankfurt, and the steel mills of Villingen, bombing them heavily. Another naval air squadron flew to the vicinity of the German city of Rostock and bombed the Heinkel aircraft factory, which was immediately hit and caught fire. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German war report stated that military operations in the area between the English Channel and Laon, which began on the 5th of this month, have achieved complete victory. Gaillon has been occupied by German forces for several days, and the Seine River has been crossed by German forces in several places. Saint-Valery has been surrounded by German forces, and another isolated unit has been heavily encircled. German forces advancing along the Oise River have taken control of Villes-sous-Gondreville, approximately 15 miles northwest of Paris. On the 9th of this month, German forces also launched offensives along the Oise, Aisne, and Meuse rivers. After fierce fighting, they forced the enemy to retreat. Reims has been occupied. Although French forces launched repeated counterattacks and armored vehicles charged bravely, they ultimately could not stop the German advance. Many enemy soldiers were captured, and much military equipment and supplies were lost. The number of casualties is countless. Since the 5th of this month, the German Air Force has been very active, bombing the port of Le Havre and enemy troop transport ships near the west coast of the English Channel, sinking seven ships, including one troop transport ship with a displacement of 5,000 tons, and heavily damaging ten troop transport ships, the largest three of which are between 10,000 and 15,000 tons.

Where is the Prosperity of Paris Now? French Forces Prepare for Scorched-Earth Warfare.

Paris: Paris is surrounded by dense smoke, resembling a besieged city. The doors and windows of all buildings are tightly shut, and the heavily guarded streets are almost deserted. Trains have stopped running, and it appears that more than three-quarters of the residents outside the city have been evacuated. Rental cars leaving the city for other provinces are carrying as many as fifteen people each. (Reuters, 12th) Some people say to the Germans that it is not worth surrendering Paris to the enemy to avoid the destruction of priceless art treasures and famous buildings. "We firmly believe that Hitler's bandits will not find a single lamppost standing in Paris. Every building will be destroyed. It is better for Paris to be razed to the ground than to fall into the hands of the Germans." (Associated Press, 12th)

Paris: General Hering, the Governor of Paris, recently issued an order advising all French youth aged seventeen and above to leave Paris. (Reuters, 12th)

German Forces Advance in a Pincer Formation, Aiming to Capture Reims

London: According to reliable sources, French forces on the western front have been ordered to withdraw to the outskirts of Paris in order to reorganize their defenses. French forces have been redeployed to the Marne River and the plateau of Terte-Noir, a site celebrated in French military history. The town of Noyon has been replaced by the vicinity of Senlis, twenty miles north of Paris. German forces in the Soissons area have passed the town on either side. The Terte-Noir and Ourcq River are both located on that part of the front line. German forces have repeatedly attempted to cross the Seine River, but have been repelled by French forces. The fortifications at the ends of the bridges on the river have been destroyed by counterattacks using tanks and mechanized units. Today, German forces have not attempted to advance towards the Seine River, but a large number of divisions have advanced from the west, with two armored divisions attacking Reims between Fismes and Dormans. In the past two days, German forces have attacked in a pincer formation from north to south. The battle has been progressing smoothly so far. (Reuters, 12th)

German Forces Stake Everything on a Desperate Gamble; France Resolves on a Do-or-Die Stand

Paris: German forces are now exerting all their strength to achieve a swift decision on the western front, deploying a hundred divisions to participate in the Battle of France. However, French forces, reinforced by fresh British troops, are fighting extremely bravely, contesting every inch of ground and inflicting heavy losses on the Germans. Italian forces have not yet launched an offensive. According to a French military spokesman, if Italian forces do launch an offensive, they will encounter effective resistance at the strong defensive lines blocking access to Nice and the Alpine passes. There is no confirmed news of an Italian offensive towards Gp and Menton. A French military spokesman declared that the battle for Paris is now actively underway. German aircraft are bombing the Paris area, while Allied aircraft are attacking enemy supply trains, troop concentrations, bridges, other transportation lines, and battlefields. The intensity of the battle for Paris is increasing daily. General Weygand's strategy is to deplete German strength, regardless of the territory lost. The current intensity of the fighting has clearly exhausted the German infantry. Although successive waves of tanks are replacing them in the offensive, the swift French counterattacks are now reducing their strength. The current fighting appears to have become a battle of attrition. The hardships suffered by French forces over the past eight days cannot be described in words. However, there are signs that British troops are moving into position, and even the addition of a small number of troops may have a decisive impact on the battle. According to reliable sources, the German offensive shows no sign of slowing down, and the situation remains extremely difficult. It is reported that the German forces are staking everything on this battle, and everything depends on the French forces' ability to resist the superior enemy. The most serious development at present is the progress of the fighting around Reims, where German forces are launching a fierce offensive with armored units. According to French sources, there are two German armored divisions in the area, but this does not mean that there are no other German armored units in the region. The French General Headquarters has been carefully preventing the transportation routes from being blocked by refugees. The experience gained in the fighting in the north has made them wary, as German tanks and paratrooper attacks in that area were carried out under the cover of refugees. The German forces are unlikely to have the opportunity to use this tactic again around Paris. The German forces are now forced to fight for every inch of ground, and have suffered heavy losses as a result. Generally, this is considered the most promising factor in the war situation.

Washington: President Roosevelt issued an order tonight extending the "War Zone" to the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting American ships from sailing there, with the exception of the Portuguese port of Lisbon and the ports on the northwest coast of Spain. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

Washington: Yesterday, the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 67 to 18, passed a bill authorizing the U.S. War Department to sell surplus military supplies to Britain and France, thereby fulfilling President Roosevelt's promise to provide all possible material assistance to the Allies. The bill authorizes the War Department to sell to the Allies U.S. Army aircraft, transport vehicles, artillery, ammunition, rifles, and other military supplies that the Army Chief of Staff deems "surplus." Earlier, the Senate, a few hours after the President's speech, passed a $1,823,000,000 Army supplementary bill and a $350,000,000 emergency Army bill. The Congress is now preparing to introduce another bill authorizing the President to freely provide Britain and France with materials, without waiting for congressional approval.

It is generally believed that this is an important step by the United States to provide full assistance to Britain and France. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

Washington: Sources here claim that President Roosevelt intends to provide the Allies with various forms of assistance, one of which is that the United States may supply the Allies with its most closely guarded secret weapon, namely a new type of bomb sight. According to U.S. pilots, using this bomb sight, it is possible to hit small targets from an altitude of 10,000 feet. U.S. sources also claim that the Allies are safe with this secret weapon, as the bomb sight is complex in structure and would take eighteen months to imitate even if it fell into German hands.

Editorial

### Maintaining Confidence Amidst the Deteriorating European Situation

German troops have approached Paris, and Italy has seized the opportunity to participate in the European war. The flames of war are raging, not only with Asia and Europe standing in opposition to each other from east to west, but also extending from the Arctic Circle all the way to the Mediterranean, and even to the Near East and North Africa. Looking back to the twenty years since the end of the previous World War, this is perhaps the darkest era, and the arrogance of the aggressors has reached its peak. Military expansion and the suppression of justice, when compared to the scenes at the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, cannot but make one feel that the times have turned against us and wonder what kind of world this is! Looking again at those many regions that have not yet fully recovered from the wounds of the last war, now facing even more tragic catastrophes; the orphans left behind by the previous war must now serve their country, and the surviving veterans of the battlefield must send their children and grandchildren into battle, fighting with their lives and with fire. Going forward, we don't know how many more small nations will become sacrificial lambs under the trampling feet of aggression; moreover, the spread of war knows no bounds, and even if some countries are spared the direct disaster of war, they cannot escape its indirect and severe impact. Regardless of how it develops in the future or where it ultimately leads, this is an unprecedented hardship for modern humanity, a final moment of light or darkness.

Faced with such a painful world crisis, people should no longer hesitate or waver; they must know that the only way out is to fight back, determined to find life in the face of death. Anyone with a sense of justice, under the rapid and intense changes and stimuli of recent days, will inevitably feel a hidden pain in their heart. Looking out into the universe, it seems that only the extremely cruel and selfish aggressors are strutting proudly, full of complacency. Willing to turn what belongs to others into ashes, while aiming to seize all available space for themselves, this is the shared mentality of all aggressors, and also the main cause of the wars in both the East and the West today. However, no matter what, human civilization has already advanced to the electrical age. Although international and political issues cannot be handled with the same ease and precision as machines, there are undeniable fundamental foundations, and their evolution must always be consistent with the principles of progress. Even if there are setbacks or reversals, people will rely on their intuition or the power of reason to make effective use of and correct them; in the final reckoning, it will still be very clear that the world is revolving around a core of justice, progressing steadily. This is not subjective fantasy, but a conclusion revealed by the historical record of thousands of years. Alexander's conquests did not create a permanent empire for him; Napoleon's ambition ultimately perished with him on the desolate island of St. Helena. Moreover, in the 1940s of the 20th century, the concepts of justice, fairness, and anti-aggression are deeply rooted in people's hearts, and their subtle influence has become an unparalleled force; this is by no means comparable to or capable of resisting the madness achieved by those who start wars through drug-induced delusions. Therefore, the evolution of the current international situation, although extremely chaotic, is not hopeless; it should be invigorating, not pessimistic: it should be known that the deeper the night, the closer the dawn, and the extreme darkness of this day is undoubtedly the harbinger of the world's transition to light. As long as all the members of the world do their utmost to fulfill their tasks of upholding justice, fairness, and resisting aggression, there is still room for remedy and opportunity for reversal in the unprecedented calamity that is expanding.

If we put aside the overall world situation and focus solely on the corner of the Far East, there is still no reason to waver in our basic beliefs. The rise of Western aggression has indeed made the Eastern aggressors happy to find that they are not alone, and they are attempting to intensify their efforts. Look at how they are desperately learning the strategies of blitzkrieg, and continuing to implement the policy of indiscriminate bombing with madness. But these measures cannot conceal their inner hunger and thirst for a quick end to the war; the dissemination of a constant stream of peace offensives only proves their outwardly fierce but inwardly weak nature; and the blitzkrieg offensives are just an imitation of style. Even those military officials who are trying to learn blitzkrieg strategies do not have the confidence to achieve all their goals with it. Moreover, the vastness and greatness of China is completely different from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; the front lines stretching for thousands of miles and the mutually intertwined positions of the front and rear cannot be conquered by blitzkrieg strategies. Exhausting Japan's current military and financial resources, it is fundamentally impossible to supply such a surprisingly large expenditure. The recent concentration of international attention on the European continent is naturally secretly gratifying to the Japanese side, but in reality, it does not compensate for their declining fortunes. The few people in the United States who are advocating the revision of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty undoubtedly contradict the current policy of the U.S. government, and will never receive the support of either the public or private sectors; even if the United States is ultimately drawn into the European war, it will not favor the Eastern aggressors and give them concessions or favor. As for the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy, on the one hand, it is avoiding unnecessary conflicts with Japan, and on the other hand, it is not abandoning China's interests in resisting Japan, always adapting and applying these two extremes. Even when the Soviet Union used force against Finland, Japan did not gain much benefit; thus, the Japanese and American sides' various extravagant hopes because the Soviet Union gave them a slight pretense are nothing more than illusions to comfort themselves.

Violence will eventually receive its due punishment, and justice and fairness will surely be the final victors; this is an unshakable belief and the basic principle that the world should strive for.

### Roosevelt Speaks; US Fleet to Remain in Pacific; House Passes $650 Million Navy Expansion Bill; Calls for $100 Million in New Taxes Annually

Washington. President Roosevelt told the press here yesterday that the US fleet would remain stationed in the Pacific indefinitely. When asked if the fleet would be transferred to the Atlantic if there were new developments in Europe, President Roosevelt said that he was not considering ordering the fleet to leave the Pacific. President Roosevelt did not clarify his intentions and did not make a general discussion of the situation in the Pacific. The question was raised during the President's meeting with reporters. US newspapers had previously discussed in editorials whether the US should send part or all of its fleet to the Pacific because of the situation in Europe. (20th United Press dispatch)

Washington. The shocking news that has swept the nation and made people aware of the need to expand land and air forces has prompted some prominent political commentators to suggest that now is the time to propose something to Japan, mainly a new commercial treaty, and hope that Japan will respond with a pledge to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. This suggestion seems to stem from the belief that the United States may soon have to withdraw at least part of its fleet from Pearl Harbor. When White House and State Department officials met with reporters, reporters tried to obtain official statements on whether the government would change its policy, but to no avail. Last week, the State Department and President Roosevelt yesterday gave visitors the impression that the government had not considered changing its policy or seemed likely to do so. However, there are signs that the US government's ban on the shipment of machine tools and scrap metal to Japan may make Japan feel more uncomfortable. The embargo bill has been passed by the House of Representatives without dissent. People believe that the government's position is that Japan's actions to harm American interests in China have worsened relations between the two countries. (12th Zhongtou News Agency dispatch)

### Analysis of Italy's Participation in the Second European War

Although the Italian people have very little sympathy for Germany and strive to avoid war, its government, after Germany's invasion of Denmark, Scandinavia, and Norway, has been making every effort to create the impression that the Allied forces have been defeated in Northern Europe and have lost their position. On the one hand, this kind of argument aims to warn the powers with ambitions in the Balkans about Italy's sphere of influence, and on the other hand, it is preparing to attack France from both sides and suddenly invade Greece and Yugoslavia from Albania.

Italy's war with Britain and France hinges on two main factors: first, the strength of the two sides' naval and air forces, and second, the extent of Italy's economic preparations. Although naval deployments are military secrets, we can assume that the Allied fleet in the Mediterranean has not been significantly weakened since the summer of 1939. The British Mediterranean Fleet has four capital ships, one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, thirty-nine destroyers, seven submarines, and six torpedo boats. The French Mediterranean Fleet has only two old capital ships, but it has twelve heavy destroyers, nine cruisers, and many other small destroyers and submarines.

All of Italy's naval power is concentrated in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, with four pre-war capital ships, two of which have been completely refitted, and the other two may currently have undergone similar refitting. There are four newly built 35,000-ton capital ships, one is the Littorio, one is the Vittorio Veneto, one is the Impero, and one is the Roma, of which the first two may be completed recently. As for cruisers equipped with six-inch caliber guns, Italy's navy is slightly stronger than France, but torpedo boats (including destroyers) and submarines are far superior to France. The strength of the German navy has been partially damaged, and Britain can mobilize part of its Atlantic fleet to manage the Mediterranean.

After Italy's participation, it can cut off east-west traffic in the Mediterranean, possibly concentrate its forces in the Greek area for a rapid landing, and at the same time launch a land offensive from Albania to provide support. If this military action is successful, the Allied forces of 250,000 to 500,000 in the Near East, although they can maintain communication with the Far Eastern parts of the British and French empires, will find it difficult to obtain manpower and material support from the West. Whether Italy can concentrate its fleet in the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean is naturally a question. Such an action would expose its own easily attacked western coast to Allied attacks. France may use land and air forces to attack its main industrial areas in the north. At the same time, if Britain blocks the entrances and exits of the Mediterranean at Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, it can cut off Italy's overseas supplies (which account for 70% of Italy's imports) and cut off its communication with Abyssinia. Italy's attack on the Allied forces will inevitably trigger Turkey's action, thereby driving Italy away from the Dodecanese Islands, and Britain's ally Egypt can also invade Italy's territories in Africa.

Regardless of the danger of Italy being attacked by the Allied forces in Europe and its territories, Italy's economic resources are also insufficient to engage in large-scale wars. If Italy, like Britain and Japan, were located on a free ocean, its food, fuel, and resources could be imported from overseas, but after Britain blocked the entrances and exits of the Mediterranean, Italy could not rely on the supplies that must pass through Gibraltar or the Suez Canal.

Mussolini wanted to make up for the lack of natural resources with a policy of economic self-sufficiency. For example, wheat, until recently, Mussolini insisted that 85,000,000 hectoliters should be produced annually to achieve self-sufficiency. (In the abundant wheat harvest years of 1937, 1938, and 1939, the average output exceeded 80,000,000 hectoliters. In the past eight years, wheat imports have varied from 3,627,660 hectoliters in 1934 to 16,437,500 hectoliters in 1937.) But at present, Mussolini needs Italian farmers to increase wheat production to 90,000,000 hectoliters, which many neutral observers believe is difficult to achieve.

Coal is also an important item of Italian imports, and has been for a long time. Its average annual consumption is 12,000,000 to 14,000,000 tons, of which, in 1938, only 2,300,000 tons of the worst quality were produced in Italian coal mines. In recent years, due to the increased production of coal in Sardinia and Istria and the electrification of Italian industries and railways, Italy's coal imports have gradually decreased. After the outbreak of the European war, coal imports have further decreased due to the Allied blockade and other reasons. The Italian government is very optimistic about increasing domestic coal production. However, the London Economist magazine believes that two-thirds of Italy's estimated 700,000,000 tons of coal reserves are lignite, and only 13% of the coal can be used as industrial fuel.

Kerosene is an even larger import commodity for Italy. In 1937, domestic production was only 14,260 tons, while imports were 2,250,000 tons. Italy's only controllable and unaffected kerosene supply is in Albania, where production may reach 300,000 tons this year at most. There are several large-scale oil refineries in Italy, some of which can refine crude oil and lignite from Albania.

The Italian government is making every effort to explore oil fields within its own borders and in Abyssinia, and is striving to develop substitutes for kerosene. But unless there are unexpected developments, Italy will still rely heavily on overseas supplies. Italy currently spends an average of 800,000,000 lire per year on oil purchases. This expenditure is a major blow to its weak foreign exchange reserves. The lack of kerosene is also one of its biggest weaknesses in combat. The two sources of kerosene closest to Italy geographically are Iraq and Romania, the former being controlled by Britain, and the latter being in the grasp of Germany and the Soviet Union.

As for cotton, the annual demand is about 2,100,000 hectoliters. But Italy currently only produces 1% of this amount, although the government hopes that after the development plan in Abyssinia is realized, cotton imports can be completely eliminated.

It will obviously take considerable time for Italy to be self-sufficient in these materials. At the same time, it also lacks raw materials such as iron, tin, copper, chromium, manganese, and rubber, which are extremely important for modern industrial nations, especially when a nation is preparing for modern warfare. These are all problems that the Italian government, whether it belongs to the Socialist Party, the Liberals, or the Fascist regime, must consider.

For several years after the Fascist Party came to power in 1922, Mussolini adhered to his so-called "independent policy." Italy, as the victor in the First European War, turned to sympathize with the defeated and prepared to retaliate because Britain failed to fulfill the secret agreement of 1915. The era of liquidation declared by Mussolini will arrive between 1935 and 1940.

When Hitler rose, Mussolini cooperated with him. In September 1937, Mussolini personally visited Germany. In November 1937, Italy formally joined the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan and Germany, creating the Rome-Berlin Axis.

From May 6 to 7, 1939, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop signed the German-Italian Defensive Alliance Treaty in Milan. Article 3 stipulates that when one of the contracting parties is at war with another country, the other party must fulfill its obligations as an allied country to provide all military resources in the land, sea, and air. Article 4 stipulates that the two signatory countries should cooperate closely in military and wartime economy. The treaty is valid for ten years.

Germany's gradual progress in Central Europe forced Italy's expansionist ambitions to turn to the Mediterranean, causing constant conflicts with France, another strong power in the Mediterranean. After the Munich Agreement, France took a firm stand on the colonial issue. Italy's demands on France included Tunisia, the Suez Canal, and Djibouti. Former French Prime Minister Daladier firmly declared that France would never cede an inch of land.

By the eve of the Second European War last September, the French military authorities still believed that it was possible to fight on three fronts: the Spanish border, the Italian border, and the German border. But after the outbreak of the war, Mussolini declared that Italy would adopt a "non-belligerent status."

Last December, Ciano explained that Italy had not fulfilled the obligations stipulated in Article 1 of the German-Italian alliance treaty, saying that there was an undeclared clause in the treaty that the signatory countries could avoid participating in the war for three years. As a result of the previous war, Italy's material resources were greatly depleted, and it needed a minimum of three years of recuperation to achieve maximum war preparations. Mussolini obviously hoped to persuade or force Britain and France to hold a Mediterranean Munich Conference during these three years. At the same time, he hoped that by forming an alliance with Hitler, he could often inquire about Germany's plans. (To be continued)

The sound of firecrackers resounded throughout the city, and the people's cheers and emotions were particularly enthusiastic. In recent days, all institutions, organizations, and stores have been displaying county flags to celebrate. In order to express their respect for the great achievements of Chief and Deputy Commander Li, all circles have presented a consolation fund of 1,000 yuan, 100 dozen towels, and 600 headscarves. A mass meeting of citizens was held at the Taixian Grand Parade Ground at 9:00 AM on the 31st, and a

Victory Celebration Conference was also held. Deputy Commander Li Changjiang was invited to speak. More than 2,000 people attended, including all personnel from various institutions and organizations, students from various schools, and the general public. The atmosphere at the meeting was very enthusiastic. After County Magistrate Qiu, Chairman of the meeting, led a review of the report, Li Changjiang spoke, briefly saying: "Since the troops of the Lu-Su-Wan Border Region have been stationed in Taicheng, they have not given up an inch of land. I hope everyone will remain calm." Finally, he urged the troops to

### The Unnatural Case in Wuxi: Tao Yijing Willingly Degenerates and Strangles His Elderly Mother

Wuxi Correspondence: The social customs are declining, and morality is lost. In Shanghai, there was the case of Zhou Qinji and his brothers killing their father. Recently, an unnatural son killing his mother has also occurred in Wuxi, a fallen area. The details are recorded below. Tao Qizhou of Xiren opened Yuan Da Lai Firm and Minyi Warehouse and Huaying Yefang before the war. He had a very wealthy family. When the war broke out, all his businesses were turned to ashes. Tao's whole family took refuge in the countryside of Wujin. After returning to Xiren, they saw that all the businesses they operated

Had become ashes. In addition to the heartache, he committed suicide by taking poison. He left behind his wife, Zhu, who was nearly half a century old, and his concubine, Su, who gave birth to three sons. The eldest son, Yiyu, studied the money industry. The second son, Huiming, was raised by Zhu as his own son and worked at Jiefu Silk Store in Da Shi Qiao. The third son was still young and lived with his mother, Su, in Ximen. Zhu and Huiming lived in He'an Bridge. After the war, his uncle Yin Fu set up a rice store in Si Xiang in the city. The eldest son, Yiyu, and his wife, Shen, lived in Nanyang Li, Yingshan South River, and did not engage in proper work. He smoked opium and associated with bandits. The tragedy resulted from this. Because the Tao family's business declined after the war, fortunately, Zhu still had a jewelry box, containing three pairs of gold bracelets, two diamond rings, two pearl flowers, and scattered gold beads worth more than 20,000 yuan, which was taken to Shanghai by his uncle Xianfu to do business on his behalf for safekeeping. The eldest son, due to financial exhaustion and addiction, tricked his mother, Zhu, to his home in late May and forcibly demanded the jewelry box. When Zhu did not see the money, Yijing gathered his accomplices, Jing Qiaoqiao and two others, and strangled Zhu to death. After death, they used ropes to tie her

Into a jar, picked it up and buried it in the riverbed of Tianjiabang. Three days after her death, her son, Huiming, searched for her everywhere, but there was no trace. He reported to the "police station" and learned the truth, and arrested the murderer Tao Yiyu. The mother's body was found, looking like a wonton, with blood flowing from her mouth and nose, and her tongue sticking out. The murderer is now being interrogated and detained by the "court." The two accomplices are still at large. This incident has caused a sensation in Wuxi, and everyone regards it as a violation of morality, which is truly shocking.

### General Situation of the Peking Library After Moving to Kunming, Promoting Southwest Culture

More than 100 kinds have been rubbed this year and are still in progress. (3) "Special Ethnic Documents" In addition to sending the shadow copies of the documents collected abroad to the museum, special personnel are commissioned to collect them.

(B) Compilation and publication This year, due to the soaring paper prices and printing difficulties, the compilation business has been deeply affected. Only the following types have been printed or published: (1) "Library Quarterly" This publication was previously published in Peiping and was suspended after the incident. This year, in order to introduce new books and spread news in academic circles, it has been reissued in Kunming since March. Each issue is divided into reviews, book lists, school diligence notes, feather reviews, book introductions, periodical introductions, academic and publishing news, and appendixes (introductions and criticisms of Westerners' research on Sinology) (each issue is about 70,000 words, and the new issue has been published to the fourth issue). (2) "Catalogue of Books on Chinese Borderlands" The Chinese books on Northeast China, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guangxi are compiled into a classified bibliography, with a total of more than 10,000 trees, and commissioned to be printed by the Commercial Press. (2) "Shunxianzhai Rulers and Letters Wu Dacheng was a famous epigrapher, and the museum previously obtained hundreds of letters he sent to Chen Shouqi (Lingzhai), which are very important for archaeology. Therefore, it was entrusted to the Commercial Press to print and distribute them, and they were bound into seven volumes, which are one of the museum's epigraphy series. (4) Subject Classification Index of Qing Dynasty Literary and Historical Notes" Following the full cut of the table of contents index of Qing Dynasty collections of essays, fifty kinds of books on cultural history notes and legal notes in the Qing Dynasty are analyzed into subjects, resulting in tens of thousands of entries, which are classified and compiled into an index and entrusted to be printed by the Kaiming Bookstore. (5) "Shadow Photos of the Ancient Books of Dunhuang" The ancient manuscripts of Dunhuang are divided into the collections of the British and French museums.

A total of several thousand photos were taken this year. After the outbreak of the European war, these photos were sent to the United States and are now stored by the Library of Congress.

(C) Reading and reference (1) "Reading" Since the museum moved to Kunming, it has closely cooperated with the National Southwest Associated University, so the books collected are kept by the university for public reading. The distribution of the museum's books is as follows: the six faculties of law, liberal arts, and the magazine of the Associated University are for liberal arts and law books and magazines, the Associated University's Faculty of Science is for science books and magazines, the Associated University's Faculty of Education is for education books and magazines, the Associated University's Faculty of Engineering is for engineering books and magazines, the Institute of History of the Peking Research Institute is for Southwest literature, and the Sino-Japanese War History Material Collection Association is for historical materials of the War of Resistance.

### Pei Cheng Girls' School Displays Might: Table Tennis Team Triumphs Over Shang Yi; Result of Four Wins to Three Creates Tense Situation; Pei Cheng's Doubles Performance Particularly Outstanding

Pei Cheng Girls' Middle School's table tennis team, located at 34 Xiao Sha Du Road in this city, has had a record of half wins and half losses since it began competing. The girls have gained opportunities for mutual improvement through the matches, and their experience and skills have steadily improved. The team has successively defeated Bao Lian Girls' School and Soochow University Girls' School, achieving excellent results and leaping to become a strong force among girls' teams in Shanghai. They, along with the talent-rich Girls' YMCA and the powerful Hua Lian Girls' School, stand shoulder to shoulder, forming a formidable trio. This is thanks to the advocacy of Principal Cao Jing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the school accepted the challenge of the Shang Yi table tennis team at the Pei Cheng gymnasium. Ms. Zhu Zhiying, Pei Cheng's physical education director, served as the referee. The two sides competed in a total of five singles matches and two doubles matches. After the start of the competition, Pei Cheng's momentum was strong. Except for the first and last matches, where Shang Yi won under thrilling circumstances, the three female swordsmen of Pei Cheng, Gui Rongzheng, Zhang Lizhi, and Feng Mingyin, displayed great power, using close-range smashes and long-range chops with ease. The Shang Yi male players were unable to resist and lost in straight sets. In the doubles match, Shang Yi's main player, Zhang Huanzhang, paired with Shen Lisheng to compete against Pei Cheng's Feng Mingyin and Guo Huichao. Although Zhang and Shen's smashes were fierce, Feng and Guo did not show weakness. Ms. Guo Huichao's feints were cleverly executed many times. Zhang and Shen lost their footing and were defeated by Feng and Guo with a score of 17 to 21. In the second doubles match, Pei Cheng's doubles champions, Gui Rongzheng and Zhang Lizhi, took the field. Gui and Zhang's coordination was seamless. However, because the team victory had already been secured, they played very politely. Shang Yi's Chen Nanjiao and Tong Jincai doubled their efforts, and when the score was tied at 18, Chen and Tong used their serve to their advantage, winning three points in a row and defeating Gui and Zhang with a score of 21 to 18. In the overall result, Pei Cheng Girls' Middle School narrowly defeated Shang Yi by a score of four to three, which was not easy. According to the team's coach, Chen Shengjun, Pei Cheng will begin hosting a Shanghai-wide girls' school team table tennis championship in the next semester. He hopes that all girls' schools will prepare and participate in the grand event. The match results for both sides are recorded below:

Pei Cheng Girls' School vs. Shang Yi Boys' School Score

Zhang Xia vs. Tong Jincai 1–2

Gui Rongzheng vs. Shen Lisheng 2–0

Zhang Lizhi vs. Chen Nanjiao 2–0

Feng Mingyin vs. Zheng Yaozu 2–0

Guo Huichao vs. Zhang Huanzhang 1–2

Doubles Matches

Feng Mingyin & Guo Huichao Won against Zhang Huanzhang & Shen Lisheng 21 to 17

Gui Rongzheng & Zhang Lizhi Lost to Chen Nanjiao & Tong Jincai 18 to 21

### National Defense Forces Maintain the Status Quo: Settlement Situation Trends Toward Tranquility; Italian Embassy Will Move North as Usual; Defense Forces Restrain Soldiers to Avoid Conflicts

Following Italy's sudden declaration of war on England and France the day before yesterday at dawn, the situation in the two settlements in this city, due to the efforts of the US military authorities stationed in Shanghai, has been to vigorously advocate maintaining the status quo. After negotiations with the British, French, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai, all agreed to get along peacefully and jointly maintain the security of the settlements. The result was very harmonious. According to observations from foreign diplomatic circles yesterday, the situation in this city can definitely be maintained and will not change. However, the key to the situation in Shanghai does not lie in friction between the defense forces of the warring countries, but rather in ambitious adventurers taking advantage of the situation.

Italy Has No Time to Attend to the Far East

After the European war expanded, the situation on the Western Front suddenly became tense. Italy, believing that the final moment had arrived, also declared war on England and France. Thus, the development of the war seems likely to affect the entire world. According to a spokesman for the Italian Embassy yesterday, Italy has now joined the war and has no time to attend to the situation in the Far East. As for how the war progresses, it remains to be seen. An announcement may be made in a week. At that time, the embassy will print war information and distribute it to all sectors after the translation is completed. When asked if the Japanese report that the Italian government will recognize the "Nanjing organization" is accurate, the spokesman said that the Italian side has no knowledge of this news. Since the report was issued by the Japanese side, they themselves know about it. As for the rumor that the Italian and Japanese sides in this city had planned to seize the French Concession by force, the Italian authorities also had no knowledge of it. As far as the current situation in this city is concerned, everything is calm as usual, and there are no abnormalities. The Italian ambassador continues to reside in his official residence in the French Concession and has not moved to the International Settlement. All Italian nationals live and work here in peace, and have not yet been called back to their country for military service. When the reporter was at the embassy, the telephone rang constantly, but all the answers were limited to the words "no news."

British and French Defense Forces Determined Not to Retreat

Yesterday, the Japanese-language Continental News reported that "the Japanese cabinet decided on the eleventh to advise the warring countries to withdraw their defense forces from the Chinese settlements." It is clear that the Japanese side is attempting to take advantage of the situation to exclude British and French forces in the Far East. A reporter from the Heiminsha News Agency inquired about this matter with the relevant British and French authorities. Britain is determined not to withdraw its defense forces stationed in Shanghai, and France also holds the same attitude as Britain, not withdrawing its defense forces stationed in Shanghai. Basically, there will be no incidents involving the defense forces of the warring countries in Shanghai. In the past, Britain and France and Germany had long been in a hostile relationship. Except for a very few German nationals, four or five people, who were advised to move out of the French Concession due to political relations, no incidents occurred, which can serve as proof.

Italian Embassy Moves North in Summer

The Italian Consulate General in Shanghai and the Italian Embassy are both located at 369 Chengdu Road. Armed Italian soldiers are stationed there, and the atmosphere seems very tense. The Italian Embassy is now planning to establish an information office to specialize in propaganda. It is rumored that its information commissioner is Feli Elias. As for the Italian ambassador and his embassy in Shanghai, they will soon move to Beidaihe. The Italian side calls it a customary summer retreat. According to a report in the American newspaper Great American Evening News, the Italian Embassy claimed that the news that the Italian Embassy would move its office to North China was a misunderstanding. In fact, the Italian Embassy moves to Beidaihe every summer, and this year it will move north "according to normal procedures" within the month.

Italian Ambassador's Residence is Heavily Guarded

There are only about a hundred Italian men and women living in the French Concession, most of whom are in the business world. Although Italy is a warring country in Europe, Italian nationals in Shanghai are not facing significant impact. As for the French authorities' visit to the residence of Italian Ambassador Machio at 118 Jin Shenfu Road the day before yesterday morning to discuss the issue of hanging flags, an agreement has been reached, and on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, personnel from the Italian Embassy voluntarily took it down. When the reporter passed the above-mentioned location at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, he also did not see the Italian flag raised on the roof of the Italian Embassy (the flag is usually raised every morning). Rumors that the Italian Embassy has moved elsewhere on its own initiative and that the French side has not consulted with the Italian Embassy are all inaccurate. The residence of Italian Ambassador Machio is a tall Western-style building with a large garden. Therefore, the large iron gate of the embassy has been closed since yesterday morning, and all visitors must be reported by the doorman before they can enter. In addition to the two Chinese police officers dispatched by the French police department to guard the gate in shifts as usual, ten armed French soldiers have been stationed in the Italian Embassy day and night for protection, and the six Italian sailors previously dispatched by the Italian defense forces headquarters have been withdrawn, and the French soldiers are fully responsible for maintaining security, which is very strict.

British Defense Forces Regulate Entry and Exit

At 6:00 PM yesterday evening, the British Embassy issued a message, the original text of which reads: "British troops have been allowed to leave the camp since 5:00 PM this afternoon, but they must strictly abide by the agreement established by the commanders of the British, American, and Italian forces. That is, when British and Italian soldiers leave the camp at the same time, the territory should be appropriately restricted. There are satisfactory measures to avoid encounters between British and Italian soldiers. With a few exceptions, the British Army and Navy are not allowed to enter the Italian military zone, and the British Army is absolutely not allowed to enter the Italian military zone. However, the French Concession is not subject to this restriction. However, it should be noted that this measure does not apply to British troops who are on duty. The British Defense Force Commander-in-Chief, Major General Simmons, is continuing to study the development of the local situation on his hospital bed at Hong En Hospital. It is understood that the British Commander's injuries have largely healed and he will soon leave the hospital."

US Marine Corps Temporarily Prohibits Leave

The US Marine Corps authorities have allowed their soldiers to take leave, because the two US Marine Corps regiments are currently conducting military exercises in Qinhuangdao, and the US defense zone now needs soldiers to patrol, and it is also feeling that there are too few people. As a last resort, a temporary measure is being taken. Once the two US Marine Corps regiments in Qinhuangdao return to Shanghai in the future, the measure may be cancelled and restored to normal.

British and Italian Defense Forces Get Along as Usual

After Italy joined the war, rumors spread in this city that the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai had set up a special search and gun team in the western district. It was also rumored that the Italian defense forces had taken the same measures. The authorities on both sides denied the report, saying that in addition to implementing the necessary measures to maintain security and treating each other with sincerity to cope with this complex environment, there were no other measures. Yesterday, the highest commanders of the foreign armies denied that the heads of the defense forces of various countries, including the leaders of the rising Italian volunteer army, had held a meeting. However, the British and Italian defense forces still did not allow their soldiers to leave the camp, and the patrols patrolled the defense zone as usual.

Designate Areas for Recreation to Avoid Disputes

According to foreign sources, in order to avoid disputes, the Shanghai defense forces of various countries, through the efforts of the authorities, have not only prohibited their officers from crossing the designated defense zone, but also designated areas for British, American, French, and Italian naval and land forces to visit pubs, coffee shops, and other dance halls. British and French soldiers are limited to the French Concession, while the two countries on the line are also limited to the International Settlement. If these regulations are followed and each stays within its own area, disputes can be avoided.

### British Embassy Warns British Businesses to Sever Trade with Italy; The Content of the Promulgated Articles is Extremely Strict; British and Italian Businesses Separately Engage in Closing Down

After Italy declared its participation in the war, Britain and Italy became hostile states. The most important anti-Italian measure taken by the British side in this city was to prohibit British commercial firms in this city from trading with Italy, and to announce that special attention would be paid to nine Italian institutions. The British Embassy, in accordance with the will of the British government, issued a warning to British businesses in this city, divided into seven articles, the content of which was extremely strict. As for the Italian institutions that were listed as requiring special attention by the British side, they were the Italian Shipping Company, Hua Yi Bank, the Italian Chamber of Commerce, Hua Feng Trading Company, Kaili Company, Fu Zhi Limited Company, and the Italian merchant Hua Yi Trading Company.

Cancel Contracts

According to sources, several British merchants have ordered Italian goods to be shipped out by yesterday, and several British firms have cancelled contracts for silk fabrics and other goods ordered from a certain Italian firm. The relationship between British and Italian banks has been severed. British and Italian firms that have not yet severed their relationship are also conducting liquidation and will end trade within a few days. Although the German side has not issued a similar announcement as the British side, French merchants have taken the same steps as British merchants and severed trade relations with Italian merchants.

Italian Merchants' Inventory

### Shanghai Has Sufficient Rice Stocks: Food Supply Should Not Be Lacking; The Rise in Rice Prices is Unexpected; Further Orders Placed with Siam for Foreign Rice

After the price of domestic rice in Shanghai soared to 60 yuan per picul in recent days, the industry authorities, because food is of great importance to people's livelihood and security, especially in this tense situation, urgently needed to make adjustments. In addition to placing an order with the foreign firm Vi Fu and others in Saigon for 500,000 bags of No. 2 tribute rice the day before yesterday, and because the rice shortage in Ningbo and Shaoxing this year is very severe, and if Shanghai does not continuously export relief supplies, the food prospects for the people in those places will be even more unbearable, a further order was placed with Siam for 100,000 bags of No. 1 rice, specifically for the use of purchases in Ningbo and Shaoxing. Because customs regulations require that all goods exported be subject to a transit tax, rice is no exception. Therefore, most of the rice is purchased back and forth from Shanghai by fishing boats, each boat carrying one or two dozen bags for relief. Because the European war has expanded, Shanghai can no longer directly order from Saigon, because transportation is obstructed and the arrival date in Shanghai will be seven days later than before, and foreign firms no longer provide insurance, so it must be transshipped through Hong Kong. An examination of the rice stocks in Shanghai shows approximately 500,000 bags. Based on this amount, there should be no shortage of food for the people of Shanghai until the new grain is harvested. Moreover, the source is unimpeded, and in theory, rice prices should not continue to rise. The current market price is abnormal again, which is unexpected by the citizens.

No Rice for Sale in Pudong and Along the Coast

All rice stores in the Pudong coastal area have stopped selling rice since yesterday, forming an invisible strike, which is almost a world without rice, and the situation is quite serious. The local "organization" is still turning a blind eye. The cause of this incident is that the Japanese naval gendarmes have arbitrarily intercepted military rice. The reason is that when rice shops purchase rice from various places and pass through the Huangpu River, the Japanese naval gendarmes must forcibly purchase half of it at a price of 37 yuan per picul to be used as military rice. Therefore, the rice merchants have suffered heavy losses and have no place to complain, so they sold out the rice in their stores as soon as possible the day before yesterday. Although they opened their doors as usual yesterday, they had no rice to sell and no longer purchased it. Unless the local "organization" provides guarantees, they will remain closed as before, and residents are at risk of running out of food.

Request to Dredge Wheat Sources

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, believing that wheat in various places is being monopolized, the source is not prosperous, affecting the entire people's food is huge, in order to urgently seek to dredge the source, especially yesterday presented Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, forwarded to the authorities, dredge the source.

### Safety Campaign Suspended

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council had originally scheduled a Safety Week from the 17th to the 23rd of this month. However, the Chief Inspector of the Motor Vehicle Department issued a notice yesterday postponing it indefinitely. Although the reason for the postponement was not stated, it is generally believed to be related to the sudden increase in political tension due to Italy's entry into the war.

### Famine Throughout Shaoxing Region, Widespread Suffering – Fellow Shaoxing Natives in Shanghai Request Implementation of Price Stabilization Measures – Swift Implementation Modeled After Ningbo Region – Hoping Fellow Provincials Abroad Will Join in Saving Our Hometown from Calamity

The famine in Shaoxing is severe, with suffering everywhere. Poor people are eating tree bark and grass roots, and starvation is rampant. Zhao Ziyun, Zhu Baoluo, Yi Zhi, and over a hundred other Shaoxing natives in Shanghai jointly sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Shaoxing Seven Counties Association, requesting that they quickly implement price stabilization and disaster relief measures, following the example of the Ningbo-Lishui region. The letter stated: "We respectfully report that a severe rice shortage has recently occurred in various counties of Shaoxing, making it difficult for the people to obtain food. Urgent disaster relief is needed, as the severity of the disaster is unprecedented. If we Shaoxing natives in Shanghai do not find ways to raise funds and provide relief, our poor compatriots in our hometown will inevitably become starving corpses. News reports state that Mr. Xiao Lai in Hong Kong has already obtained permission from the government authorities to transport foreign rice to Shaoxing, with special approval for remittances. This will greatly benefit the disaster victims. However, this matter is of great importance, and if a proper way to generate revenue is not found, it will not be sufficient to provide widespread relief. Therefore, we dare to humbly request that your association promptly convene a meeting to discuss and follow up on Mr. Yu Qiaqing's management of price stabilization in the Ningbo region. Set a date to raise donations, organize an emergency relief agency, and implement price stabilization measures in Shaoxing, so that the poor people of our hometown can share in the benefits. We deeply and earnestly look forward to this." The fellow provincials also sent separate letters to Wang Xiaolai in Hong Kong and Wang Yansong in Chongqing, making the same appeal, requesting them to encourage donations nearby to save their hometown from the famine.

According to visitors from Dinghai, the price of rice has soared in various parts of Dinghai County recently, and the situation has become increasingly serious due to transportation difficulties. The price of rice in the city has reached 70 yuan per dan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Ordinary people are mainly using seaweed and other items as staple foods. The islands of Daishan, Xiushan, Chongming, Shengsi, and Sijiao, which originally had fishing boats purchasing and transporting rice from the rice-producing areas of Taiwan, are also experiencing shortages. This is often due to the declaration of a ban on rice exports during times of rice shortage. Therefore, fishing boats and ice boats are now switching to purchasing from Zhapu and other places.

### Brutal Methods of Kidnappers – Three Innocent Children Strangled to Death – Three Students Lured Away to See a Circus and Then Kidnapped – Taken to Baoshan, Strangled to Death, and Ransom Demanded from Their Families – Mastermind Was an Employee of a Tailor Shop, All Accomplices Arrested

On the 11th, the Central Police Station uncovered a barbaric case of kidnapping for ransom. The kidnappers strangled the three child hostages one after another in a single day, and then sent letters to their families demanding a huge sum of money. The viciousness of their methods had never been seen before. The details are recorded below:

Three Children Disappear

The nine-year-old son of Mrs. Qian, the wife of the owner of the Sai Hongbang Tailor Shop at 311 Tongfu Road, Pan Xixi; the nine-year-old son of Mrs. Chen of 282 Lane 5 Tongfu Road, Yongkang; and the eleven-year-old stepson of Mrs. Li of 336 Lane 5 Tongfu Road, Gan Changfa, all attended the Dazhong School at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihai Road. On May 11th of this year, after school at 12 noon, the two children Pan and Shen were reported missing. Their families initially thought they had been abducted and jointly placed missing person advertisements in the Shen Xin newspapers, offering a reward of 300 yuan.

Strangled to Death

However, the reality was not so. Zhong Bingchu, an employee of the Yunji Tailor Shop from Pudong, and his elder brother Zhong Jianchu, along with accomplices, arrived at Dazhong School at noon on May 11th. Using a false story that they were taking the child hostage Pan Xiangxi and the two children Shen and Wang to see a circus, they first went to the circus, then took them to the Bund Park to play. Eventually, they took them to Baoshan Road in Zhabei, to the vacant land of the Oriental Library opposite the Commercial Press, and strangled all three children to death one after another, burying their bodies in the rubble.

Demanding a Huge Ransom

Then, they sent letters to the families of the children, demanding a ransom, and successively obtained 3,000 yuan. This was discovered by the Central Police Station, and on the 11th, Zhong Bingchu and his accomplices Liu Bingcheng, Xu Jinxiang, and Yao Hexiang, all from Pudong, were arrested. Subsequently, Wang Shangxian from Shaoxing and Wu Shengxiang from Pudong were apprehended at Tongfu Road and 43 Kangdi Road in the French Concession and brought to the police station. Under interrogation, they confessed everything and led the detectives to the rubble field at the old site of the Oriental Library on Shishan Road, where the bodies of the three children were unearthed.

Inhumane

Because they had been kidnapped for a month, their faces were blurred. The families of the children identified them by their clothes and took the bodies to the morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the six arrested suspects, including Zhong Bingchu, to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianwu stated the above situation, saying that there was another mastermind in the case, Zhong Jianchu, who was also arrested this morning but could not be brought to court and was detained at the police station. The bodies had not yet been examined, so he requested a postponement.

Arrest of the Criminals

Under questioning, the defendant Wu Shengxiang confessed: "Zhong Jianchu and I strangled the three children to death one after another." Zhong Bingchu confessed that he had planned the kidnapping. Liu Jin ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody and reviewed in seven days. It is understood that the criminals used such cruel methods because Zhong Bingchu was an employee of the Yunji Clothing Store and feared that his young master would reveal the truth after being released, so he killed them to silence them.

### Abortion Leading to Death Case – Perpetrators Punished Separately

He also has a concubine named Wang Guzhi, a well-known socialite, who resides at 264 Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road, which he uses as a place to hide his mistress. Lu would visit his concubine every afternoon.

Shot Immediately After Leaving His Concubine's Residence

At around 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Lu left his concubine's residence. He was wearing a gray long gown and yellow leather shoes, and was about to leave in his own car (Concession license number 11603) to go to his apartment. As soon as the engine started and the car began to move west, when it reached the entrance of the Huaxing Gas Company opposite the Guanghua Theater, two men suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One was wearing a black suit, and the other was wearing a white Western-style suit. Each pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at Lu in quick succession. One bullet entered through the rear window of the car, hitting Lu's left arm. The other bullet entered through the left car window, hitting his left leg and being injured by shards of broken window glass. Lu collapsed in the car in pain.

One Assailant Wounded and Arrested

The gunshots immediately triggered the alarm. Nearby detectives rushed to the scene to pursue the assailants. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the assailants opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire, one assailant was shot and wounded by the detectives and fell to the ground. The other assailant escaped. The Chengdu Road Police Station also received a report and dispatched patrol cars to the scene to maintain order. The wounded Lu Xihou was taken to the Shilong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries were minor. The wounded assailant, named Wang Yue (23 years old), was wearing a black suit and is currently being treated at the police hospital.

Chen then pulled out his pistol and fired two shots at Wang Wenbin, both hitting Wang's lower abdomen. He immediately fell to the ground, seriously injured and bleeding profusely. People urgently called for an ambulance and sent Wang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died before reaching the hospital.

At the start of trading in the morning, the exchange rate rose again by a huge 28 cents, resulting in a tight British exchange rate and a firm U.S. exchange rate. Then, speculators and those with profits frantically sold off, leading to extreme loosening. The U.S. exchange rate reached 6.375 yuan. However, after 9:30 AM, the Mercantile Bank entered the market and purchased US$300,000. Then, the Japanese bank and others also followed suit and started buying, and the price softened again all the way. Before long, British gold fell into the four pences level, and the U.S. exchange rate tightened back to 6.0625 yuan.

After the opening, speculators started selling off aggressively, causing the market to loosen. The foreign exchange firms absorbed the US exchange rate for June from 6.12125 yuan, cheaper by 375. Those with profits also came to sell the US exchange rate for the same month at 6.375 yuan. The British gold for the same month was quoted at 4 pences 0625. HSBC's listed rates were announced, with no change in the British exchange rate and an increase of 375 in the U.S. exchange rate. The silver balance tax was not announced. Subsequently, Mercantile Bank suddenly purchased US$300,000, causing the market to turn tight. At first, the U.S. banks and those with profits mutually sold the U.S. exchange rate for June to Mercantile Bank at 6.375 yuan, but then it shrank to 6.1875 yuan, and they also started buying back the British currency, causing it to soften by 4 pences 03125. The Japanese bank also followed suit and bought, with the forward U.S. exchange rate being 5.96875 yuan. At that time, the underlying trend became tighter, and there was a sudden positive atmosphere in the European situation.

### Foreign Currency: Rapid Retreat and Fierce Advance

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw an initial continuation of the previous day's decline. Trading opened low, with a strong supply of British and American gold pounds, causing market prices to continue falling. However, due to a sharp reversal and surge in gold prices, gold pounds followed suit, ultimately closing three yuan higher than the previous day. British gold notes also initially fell before surging, ultimately rising sharply by two and a half yuan. American gold notes initially weakened in the black market, retreating to 15.40 yuan. Subsequently, rumors of favorable developments in the European situation were rife, coupled with speculation surrounding the local settlement issue, causing a sudden tightening in foreign exchange. Demand for American gold notes surged, driving market prices sharply higher, with the evening market rising to 16.50 yuan, ultimately closing up five jiao. Hong Kong notes followed the rising exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai, increasing by eight fen. Other currencies, such as Singapore dollars, miscellaneous pesos, Canadian dollars, and Philippine pesos, also rebounded successively. Korean notes also experienced slight demand, with the evening market at 9.35 fen. However, Japanese gold notes remained in ample supply, with the evening market continuing to decline to 1.085 yuan.

### The Environment Has Not Improved; Gold Prices Have Been Driven Up by Foreign Exchange Again; Morning Opening Sees a Low of 5,120 Yuan

Yesterday's cash gold market, after falling, rebounded. The three-day decline came to an end, with prices ultimately rising. However, this was not due to an improvement in the environment. Operators were uncertain whether the various news coming from Europe was beneficial or detrimental. The gold price followed the tightening of the exchange rate market. The morning opening was at 5,150 yuan, a decrease of 130 yuan from the previous day. Money exchange businesses and banks sold off, pushing the price down to 5,120 yuan, the lowest recent price. Shortly after, the foreign exchange market reported a contraction, and retail investors flocked to buy, followed by securities firms and banks. Prices quickly jumped to 5,390 yuan. Later, a money exchange business, taking advantage of the high price, sold off its long positions, causing a drop of over 100 yuan. Ultimately, supported by the tightening foreign exchange market and buying from gold and silver firms, the market closed at 5,380 yuan, a gain of 100 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the market remained strong outside the trading floor, with few sellers even at 5,420 yuan. Trading during the half-day was brisk, reaching nearly 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold prices ultimately rose by 20 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Gold Rose by One Hundred Yuan

Since morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially rose due to the exchange rate, with the American exchange rate reported weaker. The opening price was lowered by 130 yuan. Banks helped with selling thirty taels for 5,150 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange businesses and banks sold off, but buyers were happy to absorb the supply, and the price continued to decrease by 30 yuan. The money exchange business sold fifty taels to the bank for 5,120 yuan. Later, the American exchange rate tightened, and the trading floor suddenly felt a shortage of sellers compared to buyers. Banks and securities firms rushed to buy. Soon after, gold shops and retail investors also joined the buying, and the market sentiment reversed, jumping sharply by 270 yuan. A securities firm bought twenty taels from a bank for 5,390 yuan. At that time, a money exchange business sold off a large number of overnight long positions, about five or six hundred taels, and retail investors and gold shops also sold, pushing the price down by 130 yuan. Another company sold ten taels to a securities firm for 5,260 yuan. Ultimately, due to positive market sentiment, a bank came to buy, and a money exchange business had already liquidated its positions, the price rose again, passing the 5,300 yuan mark. At that time, rumors of favorable European news circulated, further fueling the buying frenzy. Securities firms, money exchange businesses, and gold shops competed to buy aggressively. By the close, the price had risen by dozens of yuan again, with a gold shop buying twenty taels from a money exchange business for 5,380 yuan, marking the closing price. The market's underlying strength remained strong after the close, rising by several dozen yuan again, with no sellers even at 5,420 yuan. A large swing of 270 yuan occurred in half a day. Cash gold shops sold their own brand of gold at a premium of a dozen yuan compared to the market price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was lower than the listed gold by over 50 yuan, and trading was light.

Jewelry Gold Is Listed at a High Price

At the beginning, each tael of jewelry gold sold by the larger gold shops was still listed at 540 yuan. Around 9:30 AM, it was lowered by 10 yuan. At 10:00 AM, it returned to 10 yuan higher. At 10:20 AM, it was raised by 10 yuan again. After 12:00 PM, there were no further changes. As a result, it increased by a total of 20 yuan. The larger gold shops revised their listing to 560 yuan. New gold shops had the same price as the previous price. The buying price was reduced by around 30 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Sees a Boost in the Afternoon

The securities market yesterday was extremely sluggish in the morning, but suddenly rebounded in the afternoon, causing market volatility. Due to the potential renegotiation of the trade treaty between the United States and Japan and the uncertain settlement issue, public sentiment was very weak. The downward trend intensified in the morning, but a large short covering rally occurred in the afternoon. It was generally believed that the conclusion of the US-Japan trade treaty would also affect the peace between China and Japan, but the continuous bombing of Chongqing and other places made peace seem more distant. Therefore, this rebound was only a temporary short covering phenomenon and was not related to the overall trend. Yesterday morning, there were not many sellers. Only Yue Mao, Tong Kang, and Tong Shun sold, while Hong Kang, Hong Da, and Sheng Da all bought. Market prices continued to decline by three or four jiao. In the afternoon, Zhen Da Chang of the 22nd District absorbed the market at a low price, and the 4th District and Lian He also bought along with the market. Market sentiment suddenly improved. Although Tong Kang and Tong Shun continued to sell, and Hong Kang also switched from buying to selling, Jiu Fu consistently sold, the market price suddenly became stronger. As a result, both Class C and Class E bonds rose by one jiao, while the rest fell by about one jiao. The market situation remained unclear due to the uncertain environment, so it may tend to fluctuate. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Continued stock trading with the Greater China Match Company, with 200 shares traded at a price of 22.25 yuan.

London, 11th (Tuesday): Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks saw the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (MCG) fall by five shillings, with the price at eight pounds. The rest remained unchanged. London, 11th (Tuesday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in any bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton: "Double Horse" Yarn Once Fell Below the 1,000 Yuan Mark

The yarn market initially plunged and then rebounded, making it difficult to grasp the situation. As the European war situation became more serious and Italy joined the war, people were frightened. At the same time, the American exchange rate increased, making it difficult for speculators to feel secure. Long positions were liquidated with great pain, causing the market to collapse. However, as prices fell deeply, buyers became active again. 20-count Fa Ma yarn once broke below the 1,000 yuan mark, but soon rebounded.

The opening of the yarn market in the morning was weak due to the previous day's declining sentiment. Sellers followed each other. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,030 yuan. Then, news of a further increase in exchange rates caused short selling, and the price fell straight to 990 yuan. However, as the price had fallen significantly, those seeking to profit covered their short positions, and the price soon rebounded. By the close, rumors circulated that a certain bank was issuing banknotes, increasing buying interest and causing the price to rise to 1,062 yuan. According to statistics, 1,885 bales were traded during the half-day. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 40 yuan. Today, 50 pieces of yarn were shipped to Amoy, 1,080 pieces to Hong Kong, 1,125 pieces to Kwangchow Bay, and 35 pieces to Haikou. The amount bought by each port is listed below:

### The Cotton Market Is Stagnant; New York Reports Price Increases

Trading in raw cotton was particularly dull and lifeless. This was due to the increasing exchange rate, the average yarn market, the unenthusiastic market, and the closure of factory operations. As a result, business was completely stagnant.

Another message indicated that the price of foreign cotton in the New York cotton market initially fell in the morning due to selling by overseas merchants, but later recovered due to buying by industry participants and some short covering. As a result, the closing market was extremely firm, with near-term contracts rising by 29 points and deferred contracts rising by 22-23 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell by two rupees along with forecasts yesterday.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trade has been exceptionally quiet recently. All parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, the New York cotton market rose by more than 20 points, exciting the public. This is because all parties firmly believe that the New York cotton market will rise again. The following is the factory price for futures converted at an exchange rate of 6.25 yuan for US dollars yesterday:

American cotton continues to arrive in Shanghai. The "Frederick," a cargo ship managed by the American shipping company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday morning with over 1,000 pieces of cotton loaded from the United States. It was scheduled to dock at buoys 34 and 35 for unloading. It is heard that the British company's "Tila槐" ship will arrive today. The ship is loaded with a large batch of cotton, totaling 22,300 pieces, from Bombay and is scheduled to dock at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### Grains: Rice Market Is Highly Speculative; Changes in Weather Can Change Market Prices

Although the rice market rose by two or three yuan the day before yesterday, it fell back by nearly one yuan in the afternoon. Yesterday morning, trading was limited due to the weak exchange rate and the threat of rain. The opening price of foreign rice had already fallen by about one yuan, with Fukuka No. 2 Saigon priced at only 52.50 yuan and Small Clamp at 52 yuan. However, when the sun suddenly shone brightly, public sentiment strengthened again, and by midday, the prices of all kinds of foreign rice had fully recovered to their original levels. However, actual sales in the mainland tended to be cautious, and those who profited from the goods in their hands rushed to sell, causing the situation to become more depressed. Until the close, the market did not recover and fell by about one yuan compared to the morning closing price. In the afternoon, selling quieted down, and prices were raised according to the contracted exchange rate. The market rebounded again. Small patterned rice, which fell to 52 yuan in the morning, rose to 53.20 yuan in the afternoon. In the evening market, long positions were closed, and the closing price of Small Clamp was flat at 52.80 yuan. There was no formal trading of returned goods. In the new trading, Jianyuan sold 1,500 tons of Siamese rice No. 2 when the exchange rate was at its highest in the morning, with a price of only 58 yuan. Renji made the deal in the afternoon, with the price raised to 59.50 yuan.

Although the arrival of glutinous rice was scarce, only two or three carts, the sales were good. Only some retail shops and food vendors had some scattered demand, but they were able to maintain their normal prices, and the market was rather cold. Prices fell by about half a yuan, with Jin Li special grade selling for only 48.50 yuan and 48 yuan, Chang Dan white yuan at 46-47 yuan, and Jiangbei white yuan at 45 yuan in retail.

The supply of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice continued but was not strong, with only six or seven hundred bags reportedly traded on the off-market. Public sentiment remained firm because of this, and sellers remained confident. Chang Bang special grade clear japonica was once offered at 63 yuan, but buyers were less eager to buy as they saw foreign rice decline. As a result, this price was not realized, and the market was limited under standoff conditions. The selling price was similar to the previous market, with Chang Bang special grade clear japonica still at 62 yuan, Kun Chang japonica at 61 yuan to 60 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 60 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice at 58 yuan.

### Wheat Supply Is Mostly Obstructed; Kunshan New Wheat Is Reported to Be on the Market

The flour market remains stable. In terms of sales, in addition to the daily needs of local retail sales, there are also some scattered purchases from Quanzhou and other places by customers in the South Seas region. However, the amount is small, and each factory's supply to these customers is also limited. This is due to the many obstacles to transporting new wheat by Chinese merchants. The supply of foreign wheat is also affected by the expansion of the European war and the lack of shipping slots to Shanghai. As a result, factories are defensively setting limits on supply. The total transaction volume is estimated to be around 7,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour factory remains at the original price of 13.8 yuan, with a retail price of 16.25 yuan to 16 yuan. The selling price varies slightly, and the market remains in a confused state. 22,500 bags of flour were shipped to Amoy on the 13th.

After being blocked by a certain party, new wheat from Changshu, Wuxi, and Jingjiang in Jiangsu Province cannot be freely transported. Although a small number of Japanese factories privately transport some to Shanghai, this is kept secret. Chinese merchants have no possibility of transporting it. However, yesterday, the market suddenly reported that Kunshan new wheat was on the market with a price of 23 yuan. The quality of the goods is better than last year, but buyers and sellers have not yet widely acknowledged this, because the problem of the source of new wheat has not been effectively resolved. Two hundred bags of wheat were shipped to Amoy on the 13th.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Are Subject to Control; Small Amounts Are Smuggled In Secret

New broad beans have been on the market for about ten days. Recently, it was reported that they have been subject to control, resulting in no large shipments arriving in port. It is only heard that a small amount is being smuggled by retail shops in secret to meet the needs of the retail market. Given that the supply is not continuous, the market is expected to improve. However, the trend is sluggish, because the sales channels of various gangs are not sustained, resulting in a market with no real trade.

Soybeans were once active the day before yesterday, but the market softened again yesterday. Looking at the influencing factors, the price of oil has fallen, so the drop is appropriate. Yesterday, a total of 300 bags of Anqing beans, three carts of Bengbu beans, 100 bags of inferior Wuhu beans, 160 bags of Yangzhou mountain yellow beans, 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans, and over 100 bags of Pinghu Du beans were traded.

On the 13th, 2,200 bags of bran were exported to Amoy, 2,480 bags of soybeans to Amoy, 550 bags of soybeans to Hong Kong, 2,000 pieces of soybean cake to Hong Kong, and seven white pieces of crude oil to Amoy.

### Piece Goods: Panic Has Not Subsided; There Are No Wholesale Transactions for Cloth

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market stabilized yesterday after falling. The main reason was that the price of "Double Horse" yarn fell below the 1,000 yuan mark, causing panic. Sellers could not hold on, and new low prices emerged one after another, causing extreme chaos. Each holder of goods was acting in their own interest, and there was no accurate market price to speak of. In general, white cloth and bleached and dyed cloth continued to fall by five jiao to one and a half yuan. Later, as the exchange rate tightened, the market stabilized. There were no wholesale transactions throughout the day. Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, Yong, and Tai gangs bought hundreds of pieces of fine cloth, twill cloth, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The Fujian and Guangdong gangs bought nearly a hundred boxes of colored cloth and printed goods. The Anhui gang and northern Jiangsu gang bought over a thousand bolts of fine cloth and blue cloth. The northern Tianjin gang bought over a hundred boxes of colored cloth and woolen cloth.

Eastern Cloth: The morning market was weak due to the continuous increase in foreign exchange rates, and the downward trend was still strong. The lowest price for existing Longtou fine cloth was 33.7 yuan. Sijunzi Serge fell to 8.86 fen per yard. Because the drop was too large, some shorts covered their positions, and the closing price of fine cloth rebounded to 35 yuan. Later, it was heard that the yarn market rose. The Tianjin gang started trading 500 futures Longtou fine cloth from Dongmian Abushi and other firms. Tongji Jinyi was active in this street. The highest price for Longtou fine cloth was once at 36.5 yuan, but ultimately fell back to 35.5 yuan due to a lack of real sales, with no difference from the previous day. Sijunzi Serge was offered at 9 jiao per yard in the late market, continuing to fall 2.5 fen.

Exports: Today, sixty pieces of piece goods were shipped to Amoy, 285 pieces to Hong Kong, 275 pieces to Kwangchow Bay, forty pieces to Haikou, and 305 pieces to Haiphong.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Returns Slightly By Four Or Five Jiao

Yesterday's sugar market, with a continued increase in the foreign exchange rate, saw suitable prices for coarse white sugar and fell downward. The association set the price for existing coarse white sugar at 69.2 yuan initially outside the warehouse, and slightly raised to 69.3 to 69.5 yuan, dropping by half a yuan. Transshipment goods opened at 55.5 yuan to 55.3 yuan, dropping to a minimum of 55 yuan, and later returning to 55.5 yuan, with the closing price at 55.1 yuan, dropping by four jiao. Taikoo 車白 B唛 opened at 82 yuan, then reverting to 82.5 yuan. Dutch赤 was at 60.5 yuan, dropping by five jiao. The domestic sugar was not well received, resulting in a lack of transactions. Yesterday, 1,678 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong, and today, 2,000 bags are being shipped to Tsingtao.

### North-South Goods: Tong'an New Dried Longan -- A Major Crop Failure

Longan near the upper-market stocks are seen to be in short supply, with listed prices rising. New items of large-sized were raised by five yuan, while middle to lower-grade items remained flat. According to a telegram from Tong'an, the flower seedlings of the new dried longan this year were initially lush, but due to two storms, most were destroyed. Only 30% remain, it is reported.

### Hardware: Flat Iron Has Wide Demand

The flat iron trade, since the dragging of Jiangsu, Yantai, and Qingdao gangs along the Yangtze River, has been active. Daily trading has been over hundreds of boxes. Each half for domestic and foreign customers. As the foreign exchange relaxes, it is inevitable that the standard price will fall. The current market price is 155 yuan per box (equivalent to two bundles per box, with each bundle selling for 77.5 yuan), which is about two or three yuan lower than the previous market.

### Blue Lead Iron Prices Fall Back

青鉛司 iron and 青鉛条 iron trade has been very light since the opening price increased. However, the recent foreign exchange rate has slightly increased, and the market price has gone down. Yesterday's market saw can goods sold for 160 yuan per box, strip goods sold for 145 yuan per 200 pounds, and the total flower color sold for 135 yuan to 40 yuan, with all prices dropping by five or six yuan to eight or nine yuan.

### Seafood: Shrimp Tail Market Turns Slack

Due to seasonal reasons, the sales of shrimp tails have slowed down. All existing goods are stored in cold storage. Currently, the market has two boxes of Yantai Longxu Island shrimp tails, with the price at 324 yuan. Tens of bags of Jiangbei Zaohong tails were transported, but few were received. It has been found that the price of Wenzhou Kaiyang is not good, so the arrival of goods has long been silent. Other foreign goods include Annam Jingo tail sold for 330 to 340 yuan, Quanbian tail for 285 yuan, Tianbian tail for 250 yuan, Kan tail for 220 yuan, and Jinshan tail for 430 yuan.

### Sea Moth Prices Fall Sharply

Since the southern gang stopped operating, other customer gangs had little appetite, so there has been more supply than demand. For example, the highest price for the new Waishan sea moth in the previous market was 190 yuan, but currently, it has gradually fallen, with a market price of 105 yuan. The difference is as much as 75 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Rayon Transported to Tianjin

Rayon is continuously being transported to Tianjin. Jardine Matheson's Desheng ship sailed to Beiyang yesterday, transporting 276 packages of rayon from Shanghai to Tianjin. Previously, Taikoo's Hunan ship loaded 450 packages of rayon in Shanghai and transported them to Tianjin. Due to a worker strike, the ship was unable to export. It has now been learned that work has resumed yesterday, and the ship is scheduled to depart for Tianjin this afternoon.

### Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Has Strong Sales

Honeysuckle is a good medicine for summer needs. Now it is midsummer, so sales are increasing daily. It is heard that a batch recently arrived from Tsingtao. Upon inspection, the color appears to be too white and tender and is a normal product. A medium grade product is sold at 200 yuan in the market, and the price varies for lower grades.

### Scaly Anteater Scales Rise To Eighty Yuan

Due to the foreign exchange rate, the cost of pangolin scales (穿山甲鳞) coming from Hong Kong was extremely high, making it difficult to sell, so those who wanted to buy them hesitated. Recently, a few pieces of Hainan goods arrived, which seemed slightly cheaper, but the market supply was extremely short, so the listed price has also been raised to eighty yuan, and it will likely be traded soon.

Old Newspaper Excerpts from Sixty-Seven Years Ago (413) (See this Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty)

### Parrot Dies for its Master

A certain Mr. Jia from Shaanxi, who lived in Suzhou, raised a parrot that was both intelligent and tame, and for more than ten years they were inseparable. This year, Mr. Jia fell ill and, lacking funds, sold the parrot to a certain Mr. Yi for fifty taels of silver. Since arriving at Mr. Yi's home, the parrot refused to eat or sing, and plucked out its feathers with its beak, which fell like autumn leaves. Mr. Yi, feeling compelled, returned the parrot to Mr. Jia. Last month, as Mr. Jia was on the verge of death, the parrot mourned and cried all day, and then also fell dead. Mr. Yi, moved by its loyalty, placed the parrot in Mr. Jia's coffin, thus allowing it to die as a martyr.

### Secretly Peeking Into the Divine Mirror

At the City God Temple in Suzhou, groups of children often gathered and played pranks. There was a yin-yang mirror in the temple that they all dared not to look into. On the sixteenth, a group of children went to the pavilion and mischievously lifted the cover of the mirror. Before they could finish looking into the mirror, the children turned and ran away as if someone was chasing them. But after leaving the temple gate, they still ran and scattered in all directions, without saying a word. One of the children, who was slightly older, about eleven or twelve years old, also ran wildly until he reached the Liujiabang area, where he fainted. After half an hour, he gradually woke up. When people asked him why, he said that there were countless snake gods and bull demons in the mirror, and he was so frightened that he ran to escape them, not knowing how he had gotten there. This story was recounted by a Suzhou friend. If there was a man like Ruan Zhan in the world today, he would surely consider it another absurd tale.

The causes of fires are generally due to negligence and carelessness, but children playing with fire are also often a cause. Explosions and spontaneous combustion are also causes of fire, but they are relatively rare. The so-called "heavenly fire" and "fox spirit fire" in Chinese folk tales are actually due to items being too dry, causing explosions and spontaneous combustion. Therefore, if you are particularly careful about the placement and use of matches, coal, kerosene, and gasoline, fires can be greatly reduced.

Most people who die in fires do not die directly from the flames, but from being burned or suffocated by thick smoke. Therefore, when a fire breaks out in a neighboring room, it is best to close the connecting doors to block the fire and smoke. Then, cover yourself with thick clothes or blankets and crawl along the ground, because fire and smoke rise upwards, and the lower you go, the thinner the smoke will be. It is naturally best to cover your head with a wet cloth. However, the most important thing is to remain calm and find a way out in the thick smoke.

There is probably no better way to avoid a fire than to prevent it in advance. Prevention also involves avoiding negligence and carelessness. The National Fire Protection Association of the United States has laid down several fire prevention measures that are worth mentioning:

Stoves, fireplaces, and other open hearths must have a screen or cover. Do not place clothes too close to the stove to dry.

Bundle up old papers and sell them if you don't need them. Do not pile ashes in wooden buckets. Oily fragments and rags must be placed in metal cans.

Do not pile up small debris together. Quickly extinguish small sparks flying out of the stove.

The above are also the first few rules in the so-called "Fire Prevention Tips" of the US Department of Education. In addition, you should train yourself to take emergency measures in case of danger, and you should educate others with persuasive power to avoid the bad habit of carelessness, and you should also be able to quickly carry out firefighting work.

Using water to extinguish a fire is slow and has many shortcomings. Materials such as wood, oil, and textiles cannot be contained with just water. Ordinary fire extinguishers can only be used for small fires, and they are not enough for large fires. Spraying carbon dioxide foam in large quantities is a more effective firefighting method, but it is very expensive. Moreover, in densely packed houses like those in Shanghai, it is really difficult to carry out extinguishing work after a fire breaks out. Regarding this point, we must plan ahead and take preventive measures as early as possible. By learning from the horror of major fires, we can get a better lesson.

### Optimistic Life

— Cao Lingyou

People are very strange. If you are always thinking that you are a healthy, happy, and successful person, then what you think will really come to you, and you will really get happiness, health, and success. But if you are a pessimist, always looking at the bad side, thinking that you will soon suffer from a serious illness, thinking that what you do will definitely fail, it is very strange, your affairs will really fail, and you will really get sick. For this reason, we should focus on the optimistic side when observing every event.

If we stand in an objective position to observe the people in the world, we will find that many people live in frustration and unease because they often look at the pessimistic side! These pessimistic friends often sigh that their lives are not as good as others, and often say that the world is too uncomfortable. They forget that the world is transformed by the power of each of us, making it better and more reasonable day by day! A pessimist's constant sighs only make the world seem very miserable.

In our daily lives, when we read history and biographies of famous people, we get great excitement! Among the elements of success of successful people from ancient times to the present, we find a very important element of success, that is, an optimistic mentality. Many things seem to have no hope of success to ordinary people, but in the end they are created by this group of successful people. Their names will be remembered forever, and their careers add glory to the world.

In short, pessimism is useless, only optimism makes things possible. I hope everyone will work together to bring more sunshine to this world and make our environment more suitable for us to live in. No matter how dark the current environment is, we must always look towards the bright side. If we keep looking towards the optimistic side, in the near future, light will be added to us. What can a person do if they do not have an optimistic heart?

### Haste

— Liu Jiagan

In a bright atmosphere, I hastily went to attend a friend's wedding; the host's hospitality, the bride's shyness, the intoxication of tobacco and alcohol...; I smiled dazedly; the jewels of life shone ahead.

The next day, my father hastily went to mourn a deceased friend; solemnity and tears mingled together, sighing that a flourishing flower had suddenly withered; I felt sadness: life is too hasty.

Should a hasty life just be allowed to slip away hastily? Without stirring a single ripple, without leaving a single trace; why not make this fleeting life more meaningful?

Summer has hastily arrived again, the wilderness has become even greener; but, remember that a desolate autumn will hastily follow!

Seize every moment, life is too hasty.

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One: "A very beautiful lady!"

Her figure was very plump, her facial features were very well-proportioned; when alive, she must have been very beautiful and enough to captivate men. However, the impression she gave me at this moment was "horror" replacing beauty. Her eyes were open, and the two lifeless pupils not only stared blankly upwards, but also contained a look of intense pain and fear, as if she had suffered some unexpected terror at the moment of her death. Her lips were also open but not closed, revealing two rows of pearly white teeth, which, set against the crimson pigment on her lips, made her seem even more frightening. Her face was still white, but the whiteness was somewhat chilling. There was a trace of blood sputum on her ear, and I don't know how she was injured. I guessed her age was about the same as that of Jiang Anna.

As my gaze reached the most terrifying point—the part of her fatal wound—Hawthorne had already begun to move. He unbuttoned the shimmering, fine-floral, moon-white, short-sleeved silk gown. A pool of dried blood on the front of her chest was particularly glaring. The white spun silk undershirt inside had the same bloodstains, indicating that the wound was just below her left breast. Ni Jinshou had taken out a small knife and cut open the front of the undershirt; even the white ramie undershirt next to the skin was also cut open casually. She was also wearing white high heels on her feet, but her stockings were flesh-colored.

I saw that the once seductive breasts were still very plump, and the wound was indeed at the corner below the left breast, running diagonally along the ribs, about an inch wide, with blood congealed on the wound.

I couldn't help but say softly, "It looks like a knife wound."

Ni Jinshou shook his head and replied, "No, it's a gunshot wound." (13)

### Self-Inflicted

— Wei Ouwen

My young brother raised a silkworm; he fed it very carefully every day.

The day before yesterday, the silkworm stopped eating mulberry leaves and raised its head as if waiting for something. My brother was extremely happy and hurriedly placed it on the wardrobe so that it could rest quietly.

Today, when I took it down, I saw that it had already surrounded itself in a white, soft shell.

Ah, the result of "silkworm eating" is actually "spinning a cocoon around itself"! This gave me another kind of explanation.

### Gleanings from the Opera Stage

— Junmei

Drama contains the most life issues, and is also the most profound. Therefore, whether it is clever admonishment, satire, enlightenment, or advocacy, it is enough to make people reflect, even to feel ashamed and weep, unable to control themselves. In the early Qing Dynasty, Xu Juyuan, a recommended scholar from Nanchang, wrote a play about Li Taixu and Zhilu defecting after the rebel Chuang captured the capital, and when they heard that the Qing army had arrived, they hurriedly fled south to Hangzhou. The pursuers were already close behind, and Li Gong had no choice but to hide under the iron-cast Madame Qin Hui statue in Yue Fei's tomb. It happened to be the time when Madame Wang was menstruating, and when the soldiers had passed and they came out, their faces were covered in blood. This play was popular among the common people at the time and was slightly heard by Taixu. When Zhilu was demoted to Guangdong and passed through Nanchang, he also heard about this matter. The two secretly summoned opera singers in the middle of the night to perform and see what was going on. When they performed the part where the two crawled out from under Madame Wang's legs, covered in blood, their appearances were extremely wretched. They couldn't help but look at each other, cover their faces, and weep bitterly, saying that their reputations had been swept away to this point, and what else could be said. It can be seen that the emotional impact of drama is so deep that it can not only awaken the deaf and enlighten the ignorant, but also punish the wicked and awaken the stubborn. This play has now been lost.

Opera singers like to perform chivalrous deeds. The story of Mei Qiaoling burning bonds is still circulating in the opera world, relished by everyone. More than ten years ago, Jiangnan opera troupes were prevalent in the Jiangnan and Zhejiang countryside. Young actors such as Xiao Kunlun, Xiao Jiru, Xiao Maobao, and Xiao Fulou were eagerly sought after by various troupes and were all very famous at one time. In Shizuka, western Zhejiang, there is the Shizuka Niangniang Temple. Every year in March and April, when the incense season arrives, there are performances to thank the gods. At that time, the Jin Stage had famous actors such as Xiao Maobao and Xiao Fulou. Wherever their art and sound reached, it caused a sensation far and wide. One day, after the main show began, the audience was packed, and everyone was listening attentively. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out backstage. The opera stages of various temples in the countryside are mostly located behind the mountain gate, connected to the two corridors as box seats. The area in front of the hall is a stone yard. Therefore, after the fire started, they could only rely on one side door for entry and exit. However, the door was small and there were many people, all vying to rush out, which gradually became blocked. The elderly, weak, women, and children were practically like fish in a pot. The audience in the box seats were all family members of wealthy families, and the spread of the fire was even more dangerous than in front of the hall. At that time, the people in the troupe were also fleeing in confusion, but Xiao Maobao, with his ability to run across eaves and walls and his agility, rushed back and forth. In the chaos, he carried hundreds of women and children out of the temple, allowing them to escape. He also forcibly knocked down two or three zhang of the temple wall, allowing the audience to surge out like a tide. Although hundreds of people were killed or injured in this incident, those who were rescued were more than ten or a hundred times that number. Last year, after the August 13th Incident, the Sujia railway line was bombed from time to time. Pingwang Town in the county was a vital point for water and land transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. At that time, iron birds were circling. Xiao Fulou, who had been performing for many years, was living in the town at the home of relatives. One day, during a heavy bombing, Fulou happened to be drinking tea at a certain teahouse and witnessed three or five women with three or five children taking shelter from the bombs on the banks of the city river. At that time, the water flow was rapid, and they gradually could not support themselves, crying and calling for help, but no one came to help. Fulou could not bear to see this, so he jumped into the river without regard for his own safety and dragged the women and children to the bushes on the shore. At that time, machine-gun fire was intense. As soon as Fulou stepped out of the bushes, bullets rained down and he died a martyr's death. These two actors, who were members of Jianghu opera troupes and not renowned among magnates and nobles, had behavior similar to that of ancient knights and can be praised!

The most important thing in performing is to be considerate. In the past, when Jiao Tian was asked about his accomplishments in opera, he would always say, "Nothing else, just the word 'likeness'. For example, if you play a sage, you must be like a sage in spirit. If you play a famous general, you must be like a famous general in spirit. When I sing opera, I don't know that I am Tan Jiao Tian. I only feel that when I sing 'Ti Tang Zhou', I am Qin Shubao. When I sing 'Li Ling Bei', I am Yang Linggong. When I sing 'Kong Cheng Ji', I am Zhuge Liang." In just a few words, one can gain a deep understanding of the cultivation of drama and draw inferences from one example.

### More on Fairbanks' Estate

— You

Yesterday I read "Fairbanks Died Seeking Happiness" in this publication, which made me think that his distribution of his estate also deserves to be discussed.

According to news from New York, Fairbanks' estate is worth a total of 400,000 pounds, and the will distributes it as follows...

Mrs. Sylvia Fairbanks receives 50% of the estate - 200,000 pounds.

Little Fairbanks receives 30% - 120,000 pounds.

Charitable causes - 17.5% - 70,000 pounds.

The remaining 10,000 pounds are to be given to relatives and friends by Little Fairbanks in accordance with the supplementary will in the deceased's letter. It is said that Fairbanks' most popular period was five years ago, when he could earn at least 100,000 pounds or more per year. Calculated at the current rate of about 50 yuan per pound in legal currency, this figure is indeed astonishing.

### Hollywood Urgently Needs a Large Number of Child Stars

— Xinliang

Hollywood is currently lacking good leading actors (in fact, this situation has always existed). Of course, the lack of child stars is also a problem. Most notably, the famous red child star—Shirley Temple—is about to announce her departure from the screen, isn't she? Now, every child from the ages of nine to thirteen has a good opportunity to try their hand at the major studios. If the test results are satisfactory, they have the hope of being hired by the film company.

The reason why Hollywood needs so many child stars is that the films currently being shot or about to be shot in the next few months all require a large number of boys and girls. Take MGM, for example. If they cannot find a twelve-year-old, thin child who speaks in a low voice within a short period of time, they will inevitably be unable to start filming "The Yearling." Warner Bros. also spent a lot of effort to find Johnny Sheffield (Tarzan's son) to play the child in the famous story of Notre Dame's four-wheeled carriage, Knute Rockne.

Columbia needs two clever children in their film "Arizona," but so far they have not found their ideal child stars. Universal also has three films recently that cannot be started unless the company finds more than ten child stars.

### Xinhua Races to Shoot Folk Films, Golden Star to Shoot "Tears of Flowers"

— Haixing

Xinhua's plan to produce folk films, after several discussions by various directors, was immediately divided into cooperative efforts to speed up progress. It is learned that three films will be started soon, one is Yue Feng's "Yu Qing Ting," one is Wan Cang's "Pearl Pagoda," and one is Tang Jie's "Miao Jin Feng." It is scheduled to meet the audience in a month. It was also heard that Zhonghua had decided to produce "Pearl Pagoda," but has abandoned it, and "Yu Qing Ting" and "Miao Jin Feng," which were pre-announced by Guohua, are also willing to give way due to Xinhua's relationship. This is because Guohua and Yihua are jointly filming "San Xiao" this time, and Xinhua has helped both sides.

"Tears of Flowers" has been decided to be the first production of Golden Star. The story of this film focuses on dancers and requires a large number of modern daughters. In addition to hiring a famous actress to play the leading role, the remaining important roles will be played by famous dancers who love movies. Yang Wenying, who is no longer performing, has signed a contract with Golden Star and will play one of the important roles. Another famous dancer, Yao Tian Xiuli, will also be invited to play an important role. There are also some other celebrities in this field who are also in contact.

### Quick Sketch of a Tea Party at the Drama School

—

The Shanghai Drama School specially invited Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and others to visit the school the night before last.

In addition to Ma and Zhang, there were also Ye ShengLan and Ma Fulu, as well as Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Fei Mu, and the Chinese director Li Shimin, who is about to return to Hollywood, totaling no less than sixty people.

The tea party began at around six o'clock in the classroom upstairs. Principal Chen Chengyin and Ma Lianliang sat in the center of the table. Then, Principal Chen explained the meaning of the reception. Then, Ma Lianliang stood up and gave a speech, expressing his opinions in extremely simple and complete terms. Then, the students' achievements began to be performed. The first was Liu Zhengrong singing a section of Liu Bei from "Changbanpo," his tone was very high, and he was praised by the guests. The second play was "Er Jin Gong" sung by six children: Xu Zhengjun, Zhou Zhengli, Xia Zhengfeng, Zhou Zhengwen, Guan Zhengming, and Gu Zhengqiu. They are all ranked with the word "Zheng," and although they are children, their singing skills are really good. Next was a rehearsal of Wu Hua Dong by all the male and female students, a big fight, and their kung fu was all very good. The fight was even more enthusiastic than on stage. There were still programs after that, but Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and others had to rush back to Huangjin to dress up, so they said goodbye first. Before leaving, they praised Principal Chen and thought it was very satisfactory. The other guests did not leave until around eight o'clock.
