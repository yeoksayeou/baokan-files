### One Week of War Situation

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that in the past week, the war situation (13th to 19th) has been more intense in Guangdong and Hubei. The elite Japanese troops in northern Guangdong and Hubei have suffered heavy losses. The Chinese army has also made repeated gains on other fronts. The operational process is described as follows:

The Japanese invading northern Guangdong attempted to penetrate Shaoguan but were defeated by a fierce Chinese attack. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them fiercely and inflict heavy damage on them along different routes. One route captured Guotai Fengcun and forced an attack on Guanke. Another route captured Pa Jiangkou, Yuantan, Yinzhan Ao, Juntian, and Huaxian, key locations, and advanced towards Xinjie. Another route captured Liang Kouxu and Conghua, two major strongholds, and separately besieged Zengcheng and Shengang. At the moment, all the vanguards have approached the vicinity of Guangzhou.

On the border between Hubei and Hunan, the Chinese army has been sweeping and suppressing the stubborn Japanese troops in Tongcheng and Dashaping for days, repeatedly capturing Yangfanglin, Huafenqian, Tiezhugang. On the 14th, it captured 10 data points like Poshan, Guming Mountain, Dawuli, Longwangjian, and others tightly encircling the port and continuing to attack fiercely. On the 13th, the Japanese troops in Dashaping gathered more than 3,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and launched a large-scale counterattack towards Wuguizui, but they were met with a head-on attack. After a day and night of bloody battle, the Japanese suffered more than 2,000 casualties. On the 14th, more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Yueyang Linzhou invaded Zhengshan, attempting to contain the Chinese forces. However, they were also repelled, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recover Lukoupu. Another Chinese army in southern Hubei captured Hesheng Bridge, cutting off the traffic between Daye and Wuyue, and once charged into Daye, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in Jiaxiang and Suixian in central Hubei are still surrounded by the Chinese army. At the moment, the battle outside Zhongxiang, in the vicinity of Yangzi and Huangjiaji, and outside Suixian, in the vicinity of Gaocheng and Jiangjiagang, is extremely fierce. On the 13th, the Japanese troops in Yangzi and Huangjiaji gathered more than 10,000 troops, using artillery fire to cover their counterattack towards Luojiadoup. The fierce battle lasted for two days and nights, killing more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers and seizing countless spoils of war. Also, on the 17th, the Japanese army attacked near Echeng along different routes, but they were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army. More than 3,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, and one Japanese aircraft was shot down, more than 10 tanks were destroyed, and countless light and heavy machine guns and artillery pieces were captured. At the moment, the remaining Japanese troops have been surrounded and are being annihilated.

More than 5,000 Japanese troops in Huguan and Changzhi invaded southward along different routes, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the area north of Zhoucunzhen (south of Huguan) and Henghetou Handian (south of Changzhi). Under the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army, the brave Chinese soldiers charged back and forth, fighting fiercely all day, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 13th, more than 5,000 Japanese reinforcements arrived from Changzhi, and 7 Japanese aircraft bombed in turn. Multiple Japanese artillery pieces fired poison gas shells. The Chinese soldiers calmly responded to the battle, entering and exiting the positions five or six times. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. By noon on the 14th, the Japanese army had abandoned more than 1,500 bodies in the Liuyincun, Baichicun (south of Huguan), and Xicheng areas. Also, on the afternoon of the 13th, 3,000 Japanese troops in Changzi detoured northward from Zhangdian (south of Changzi) towards Beidian. The Chinese army fought bravely to intercept them, and the Japanese suffered heavy losses. At the same time, another Chinese unit attacked from Zhangdian to the east, successively capturing the Chilingshan and Miaocun areas (southeast of Changzi), capturing many Japanese soldiers and seizing a large amount of supplies and military materials. At the moment, the Chinese army is advancing towards Tangwangmiao. In southwestern Shanxi, the Chinese army has been attacking Jishan and Wanquan for days, and the Chinese army has captured Zhaidianzhen in Jishan, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army has retreated to Bei Wu and Dongmendamiao, stubbornly resisting, and the Chinese army is still continuing to encircle and annihilate them.

War Situation in Suiyuan and Hebei In addition, in Suiyuan, the Japanese army near Kuntulun was repeatedly attacked. In southern Hebei, the Chinese army forced the cities of Daming, Weixian, Gaoyang, and Anguo and captured Heyangtun. In Gaomi near Shandong province, six or seven hundred Japanese troops were annihilated, and Huangxian and Yishui are still surrounded by the Chinese army. The Chinese army raided Kaifeng in eastern Henan and besieged De'an and Xingzi in northern Jiangxi, recovering Shayuan and Hucun. In southern Anhui, a large Japanese transport ship was severely damaged off the coast of Zhijiang. These are all important achievements in the past week. (19th dispatch)

The leaders of Nanjing and Beiping, Wang Jingwei, will soon hold a meeting, at which time a committee will be organized to resolve the issues of the "Central Government of China."

Editorial

### Tensions Rise Again in the Netherlands and Belgium

The Second European War has been going on for nearly five months, and the main forces of both sides have maintained a poised posture, without engaging in close combat. For Britain and France, this is a war of attrition of military resources. Based on the principle of "steady progress," there is no need to gamble except to intensify the blockade. It is noteworthy that Germany, which has always taken "quick victory" as a shortcut to victory, is also hesitating to launch an offensive easily. It turns out that Germany knows that there is a strong enemy in front of it, and does not dare to take risks. Therefore, it is considering between two paths: whether it should continue to join hands with the Soviet Union in the future, and at the same time develop towards the Balkans, in order to obtain the rich resources of the two sides to supply, and make a long-term deal with Britain and France? Or should it occupy the Netherlands and Belgium first, as a base for attacking Britain and France nearby, so that the war will be easier to end? A quick attack and slow defense, different policies, between choices, must be solemn, so the German army will attack the Netherlands and Belgium, rather than saying that she is bluffing and agitating people, it is better to say that she is exploring the situation and acting on the opportunity.

In recent days, there have been widespread rumors in Europe that because the climate in the Netherlands is severely cold, the effectiveness of the "water defense" plan has been greatly reduced. The German military authorities believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, and plan to implement the offensive strategy decided in November last year again. It is also rumored that both countries are mobilizing urgently, and the situation is extremely tense. Although Germany has many concerns about the Netherlands and Belgium, we believe that there are probably the following factors: First, since Germany has been stationed on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium, the situation has been tight and relaxed, but the army has not retreated; because the Netherlands is indeed an excellent base for attacking Britain and France. If the eastern Netherlands is occupied, the distance to attack the British Isles is greatly shortened, and the transportation of supplies is much more convenient; and attacking Belgium across the Netherlands can only peek at the weaknesses of the Maginot Line, which can pose a great threat to France. Therefore, this plan has never been abandoned. Second, in winter, the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, and the Dutch river surface is very thick, so that soldiers and cars can pass through without hindrance, which is much more convenient than in other seasons. Third, the Soviet Union is trapped in the war against Finland, and the economic and technical negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union have not yet materialized for a while. Germany's supply to the Soviet Union and the Balkans can be expected but not immediately available, and the "quick victory" theory has therefore reappeared. The cadres of the National Socialist Party strongly advocate it. Although the General Staff opposes speculation and adventure, it may not be able to dissuade Hitler. Fourth, if there is no shocking incident in a short period of time, it will not be possible to give the domestic people a new stimulus and boost their fighting spirit.

Assuming that Germany's attack on the Netherlands and Belgium is realized, its impact will be very worthy of attention. The most important of these is, first, as we have pointed out, if the Netherlands and Belgium are really involved in the whirlpool of war, it is actually equivalent to the outbreak of the Western Front War, and the European war situation will enter another stage. Therefore, the Netherlands and Belgium issue is the key to the European war situation. First, as early as November last year, Italy and Spain notified the German government through normal diplomatic channels, stating that they were very concerned about respecting the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and Belgium. It was also rumored that the initial news of Germany's secret mobilization to this place was secretly notified to Belgium by the Italian side. The Crown Princess of the King of Italy is the Princess of Belgium. According to a dispatch from Paris on the 16th by the Associated Press, the mechanized troops that Germany recently sent to the Dutch border were mostly transferred from Poland. This action shows that the Soviet Union and Germany are now completely colluding and will take joint action against Western Europe and Eastern Europe. There is a contradiction between Germany and Italy, one because of the conflict of interests in Central Europe and the Balkans, and the other because of the irreconcilable enmity of the Soviet Union; however, the axis is about to be abolished, and the national relations are close and far, and it has reached the extreme point so far; once the war between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium breaks out, Italy will not be able to maintain its ambivalent neutrality, but will have to show its attitude clearly to the world. Third, the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark) and the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, etc. have the Oslo Commune. Although this is not an offensive and defensive alliance, nor does it have a military meaning, the member countries all yearn for peace, and because of various links in geography, race, history and politics, the feelings are particularly harmonious. The overall interests are all shared. Since the start of the Soviet-Finnish War, the people of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have expressed sympathy for Finland, and if the Netherlands and Belgium are also among the invaded, the countries will feel even more that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold; what is more, Britain and France have repeatedly declared that all countries invaded by Germany are within their aid, and their sympathy for Finland is also very explicit. Therefore, the day when the German army invades the Netherlands and Belgium will be the time when the European War expands. From these three points, it can be seen that the tense situation in the Netherlands and Belgium is by no means a matter in the Netherlands and Belgium, and the impact is related to the overall situation. Continuing to deduce according to the current trend will force the Scandinavian and Baltic coast small countries to unite and form the periphery of Britain and France. By then, except for the chaotic situation in Southern Europe and the Balkans, the outline of the division of power in European countries will be more obvious, and what is doubtful is how long the German-Soviet alliance in the same bed but different dreams can cooperate?

### Pittman Warns Japan to Abandon Hegemonic Policy, Embargo Against Japan Has Won Support from All Sides, Will Be Too Late If Thoroughly Awakened

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said in a speech today that Japan must abandon its Asian policy, because it is tantamount to Japan's absolute control of China. We sailed ships on the Yangtze River and have obtained more rights than Japan allows in China. If we want to use American assets in China, we also have this right, but now we have to use Japanese assets. Mr. Pittman continued, "Public sentiment is increasingly in favor of the resolution he proposed to ban the export of oil and other exports to countries that violate treaties signed by the United States and attack other countries." (20th Reuters dispatch)

Washington: Representatives of public organizations across the United States who wish to establish legislation to ban exports to Japan are now gathered in Washington, preparing to promote it further after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is terminated on January 26. Senate President Pro Tempore Pittman, the drafter of the American Neutrality Act, has already proposed a bill aimed at prohibiting the export of American oil and other export goods to countries that violate treaties signed by the United States and invade other countries. Yesterday, someone asked Secretary of State Hull about this case, but Hull seemed to give an uncertain answer, saying that the case is currently between the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department. (20th Reuters dispatch)

Washington: With the expiration of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation only one week away, US-Japan commercial relations remained at a standstill yesterday. The Japanese side had previously requested the United States to sign a transitional treaty replacing the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. On this point, the Japanese Embassy here still did not receive a reply from the US side yesterday. The State Department declined to comment on this matter. Also, a Japanese official in the sickbed is now trying to meet with Secretary of State Hull next week. At the same time, US Ambassador to Japan Grew will also meet with the Tokyo Foreign Ministry, but everyone believes that there will not be satisfactory results in this short period of time. Senator Pittman told reporters, "The abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will not have much impact on Japanese businessmen in the United States or American businessmen in Japan. Japanese propagandists are now intimidating American businessmen, saying that all trade will completely stop after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished. This report is completely inaccurate. The United States and the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations for many years, but the commerce between the two countries continued." Pittman also said the day before that after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished, Japanese businessmen can still reside in the United States. (20th Associated Press dispatch)

Washington: Japanese Councilor to the United States, Morishima, visited State Department advisor H. Bayard today and spent more than an hour in earnest talks on various issues related to the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Ambassador Horinouchi also plans to meet with Hull from the State Department as soon as next week to discuss issues relating to the right issue. (19th Allied dispatch)

### Japan's Kerosene Needs: 90% Reliant on Foreign Sources; Significant Difficulties Anticipated After Expiration of U.S.-Japan Treaty

Tokyo: Regarding the impact on Japan's kerosene supply after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on the 26th of this month, the president of the Japan Kerosene Joint Sales Company, Mr. Tateishi, stated that Japan is not necessarily constrained by the United States. He said, "Our country relies on foreign sources for 90% of its kerosene needs, with only 10% produced domestically. Therefore, after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on the 26th of this month, we will undoubtedly encounter significant difficulties in obtaining sufficient kerosene from abroad. However, opinions on this matter vary greatly. Pessimists believe that anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States is increasing, and once the commercial treaty expires, the U.S. may prohibit the export of kerosene to Japan. But optimists say that even if the U.S. government takes this action, other countries can purchase kerosene from the United States and resell it to Japan. Furthermore, after the commercial treaty expires, California kerosene companies may see the need to maintain the Japanese market and request government permission to make kerosene an exception, continuing its export to Japan. In his view, Japan's kerosene needs are not necessarily constrained by the United States." (Havas Dispatch, 19th)

### Japan Expresses Goodwill to the U.S.: No Discriminatory Taxes on U.S. Imports

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese government will issue an important order on the 24th of this month, effective from the 27th, stipulating that after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, Japan will not impose discriminatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods. U.S. goods will continue to receive most-favored-nation treatment. Japanese authorities will also take appropriate administrative steps to protect the rights of Japanese and American residents. This law will maintain friendly commercial relations between the two countries. The U.S. government announced on December 22nd that it would not impose discriminatory taxes on imported Japanese goods, ensuring that the U.S.-Japan commercial relationship would not change in the treaty-less situation after the existing commercial treaty expires on January 26th. Therefore, the Japanese government is issuing the above plan in response. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)

### U.S. Firm Stance: Japan Anxious, As Seen in Public Opinion

Tokyo: The Japan Times commented today on the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty negotiations, saying that Japanese newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka have used strong language in the following comments: "We will not yield to pressure. The U.S. is trying to force us when we are in difficulty. The Japanese people will never forget this," and "The Yangtze River is not yet open. If it is opened for the sake of the U.S., Japan will certainly suffer." The attitude of domestic Japanese newspapers is extremely important at this time. The government learns the opinions of the people, especially those of business leaders, from newspaper commentaries. According to newspaper editorials, Japan is willing to establish a temporary arrangement to continue the usual commercial relationship between the two countries while negotiating a permanent treaty with the U.S. The general opinion in Japan was that its actual actions and dignity in China could be negotiated in an economically amicable way. Unexpectedly, the U.S. is attempting to force Japan to adjust the pending issues between the U.S. and Japan based on Washington's policies. At this point, all Japanese newspapers believe that this is unfair treatment and are becoming resentful, resolving not to make concessions. At present, no practical proposals for adjusting the relationship between the two countries have been heard, apparently waiting for the new government to initiate a plan that will not sacrifice the rights of the people, will not close the door to friendship with other countries, and will not hinder trade relations between the two countries while achieving certain objectives. The government has a great opportunity in this position, but its difficulties are also not few. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)

### Japan Urges Britain to Change its Attitude Toward China; Military Circulates Leaflet Yesterday Calling for Attention to Three Matters

Tokyo: The Japanese military circulated a memorandum yesterday in various departments, the Diet, and public places, containing three main points: (1) Please pay attention to Japan's military preparations and compare them with those of other military powers. (2) Demanding that Britain revise its policy toward China, otherwise Anglo-Japanese relations will inevitably become strained. (3) Appealing to the entire Japanese people to support the government, overcome the critical juncture, and assist in the implementation of the military expansion plan. (Haitong Dispatch, 20th)

### Chongqing Newspapers Comment on Japanese Political Situation: Attempts at Enticement and Reconciliation are in Vain; the Current Cabinet's Life is Unlikely to be Long

Chongqing: Today, the newspapers here continue to devote considerable space to reporting on the new Japanese cabinet, paying close attention to it and predicting that Japan, under the new government, may make even greater efforts to entice Chongqing into reconciliation. The "Sweep Away Daily," the organ of the Chinese Army, stated, "Such efforts are bound to fail. Prime Minister Yonai's efforts with Wang Jingwei are hopeless and will only strengthen China's determination to continue resisting." The "New China Daily" stated, "If Yonai's efforts to entice China into reconciliation fail or do not make progress in his impending political offensive, its significance will not only be the collapse of the Yonai cabinet but also Japan's adventure in China will be trapped in an impasse." According to some Chinese observers, Yonai is a fierce opponent of Japan's military alliance with Germany and Italy, while Arita is the initiator of Japan's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, now that Yonai is Prime Minister, he has appointed Arita as his Foreign Minister. Arita's assumption of this position cannot satisfy the Soviet Union or the United States. It is predicted that the Yonai cabinet will be the last national cabinet appointed by Japan, to be followed by a 100% army cabinet, which will also be the last Japanese cabinet during the current Sino-Japanese War. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)

Chongqing: The "Sweep Away Daily," the organ of the Chinese Army, published an article criticizing Wang Jingwei. The newspaper believes that Wang and Yonai are now attempting to end the war against China through propaganda policies and the establishment of puppet political authorities. As for the attitude of the National Government towards Wang, it can be clearly seen in President Chiang Kai-shek's expulsion of Wang from the Kuomintang in December 1938 and the National Government's explicit order for Wang's arrest on January 1, 1939. Yonai has no other way to resolve the war in China except to copy Konoe and Abe's old articles, which shows his skill in wanting to save face. It is precisely because of this that our belief that final victory will belong to us is becoming stronger. If Yonai and Wang can see this point, they should refrain from speaking.

### Japanese Government Considers Budget Cuts

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, according to well-informed sources, the industry has designated February 2nd to explain the cabinet's political program in the assembly, so the government does not intend to make any special announcements before February 2nd. All parties believe that the new cabinet, due to time constraints, will still submit the next fiscal year's budget proposed by the Abe cabinet. However, Finance Minister Sakurai has reportedly planned to reduce the budget as much as possible. In addition, the new cabinet, in order to avoid malignant inflation, high prices, and raw material shortages, has discussed the issue of reducing the next fiscal year's item calculation. After consulting with the Finance Minister and the Army Minister, a new budget proposal may be submitted. (Dispatch, 19th)

### Japanese Diplomatic Frustration: Pro-U.S. and Pro-German Factions in Opposition; Arita's Remarks Send Signals to Axis Powers to Alleviate Resentment from Pro-German Elements

Tokyo: Upon taking office, the new Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made remarks to reporters, explaining his aspirations. He praised Germany and Italy and expressed his concern for the Anti-Comintern Pact. He said, "Although the Anti-Comintern Pact has been affected to some extent after Germany and the Soviet Union reconciled, it has not been abolished in essence. In terms of the friendly relations between Germany, Italy, and Japan, they are of long standing. Germany and Italy have always been very friendly to our country, and it goes without saying that we should maintain friendship with each other in the future." Since the establishment of the Yonai cabinet, some people originally thought that the Anti-Comintern Pact had come to an end and that the new cabinet would immediately work to promote relations between the U.S. and Japan. Now, upon hearing Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, they cannot help but feel surprised. However, well-informed sources in Japanese political circles said that the real motive behind Arita's remarks is very clear. First, the new cabinet must reiterate the principle of "independent diplomacy" advocated by the Abe cabinet. Therefore, it must maintain a balance between democratic countries and totalitarian countries. At a time when the new cabinet is planning to promote a pro-U.S. policy, it is necessary to send signals to Germany and Italy, especially Germany, so that German newspaper correspondents stationed in Japan can send better "telegrams" to their home country. This is because General Yonai was the person who overturned the plan to conclude an alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan last year. This time, he formed a cabinet, and the initial reaction from Germany was quite unfavorable. Second, the "pro-German" elements in Japan still occupy a very large force and are closely watching the official expression of the new cabinet. This faction is mainly composed of military figures and those who maintain close relations with the army. They advocated "strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact" last year, but as a result, they achieved nothing due to General Yonai's opposition, thus "losing face." It is difficult for these people to quickly forget their regrets. In addition, this faction may still intend to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in the future, so that they can indirectly establish a link with Germany. They are very afraid that General Yonai will come out and obstruct them again in the future. Foreign Minister Arita's praise of Germany and Italy is probably intended to appease these people, so that they will not harbor doubts and oppose the new cabinet. In short, judging from Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, it can be seen that if Prime Minister Yonai wants to approach Britain and the United States in diplomacy in the future, he must be cautious. In other words, he must take into account the powerful pro-German faction in the country, because these people have not forgotten their desire to "restore face" and may still put pressure on the government to accept their views in diplomacy in the future. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)

Tokyo: Regarding the resignations submitted by the cabinet councilors, Prime Minister Yonai met with each councilor individually and tried his best to persuade them to stay. As a result, councilors Suematsu and Matsui have decided to resign. (Allied Dispatch, 20th)

### Prominent U.S. Isolationist Senator Borah Passes Away Suddenly; Known for Eloquence During His Lifetime, He Opposed the Embargo Against Japan

Washington: Republican Senator Borah, a prominent isolationist, passed away suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage at 8:45 pm last night (10:45 am Shanghai time today), at the age of seventy-four. Borah had been in a coma since falling in the bathroom on Sunday, so he seemed to feel no pain at the time of his death. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)

Washington: The death of Republican isolationist Senator Borah is a major blow to Japan's hope of concluding a new commercial treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which has been terminated by the United States. Recently, Borah opposed the imposition of an embargo against Japan, pointing out that Japan is the United States' best customer and advocating the conclusion of a new treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which expires on January 26th. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)

Washington: Republican Senator Borah, a prominent isolationist, accidentally fell at his home on the 16th of this month, causing a cerebral hemorrhage. He was bedridden for many days, and medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away last night at the age of seventy-four. The story of his life is briefly described as follows. Borah's name was William, and he was born in Fairfield, Illinois, on June 29, 1865. In 1890, he practiced law in Kansas. The following year, he moved to Boise City, the capital of Idaho, and continued his old profession. In 1907, he was elected as a Republican Senator from Idaho and has been re-elected every time since then. Among the members of the U.S. Congress, he has always been regarded as a outstanding person. There are three reasons for his success: profound knowledge, straightforward speech, and eloquent debate. Since entering his political career, his main goal has been to attack trusts and large organizations. He often criticized them mercilessly, so he often had conflicts with Republican leaders. During 1936, he once submitted his qualifications as a candidate for the election. Subsequently, he withdrew automatically before the vote of the Republican National Convention. He was known at the time for advocating humanitarianism, adhering to the Constitution, and opposing "militarization." He was also well-known abroad for serving as a member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years. He was also the most vigorous advocate for general disarmament and international peace. Although he strongly opposed the idea of the United States joining the League of Nations during his lifetime, he was still an "internationalist" on all other issues related to American diplomacy. Looking back on his diplomatic activities, his efforts to promote the Washington Naval Conference in 1922 and his opposition to President Roosevelt's resumption of relations with the Soviet Union in 1933 were the most popular. As for his economic views, many famous domestic economists criticized them as being too broad and impractical, saying that the economic plan he advocated was too large in scale and impossible to realize in practice. In recent years, he vigorously advocated isolationism, arguing that the United States should stay out of international events outside of the Americas. Until the outbreak of the European War last year, when Biderman, the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed an amendment to the Neutrality Act, advocating the abolition of the arms embargo clause, he tried his best to oppose it, believing that this move would plunge the United States into the whirlpool of war. However, this amendment was finally passed by vote, because the general trend was that the American people, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, deeply knew that events happening in any corner of the world could affect the United States. Therefore, they could no longer agree with the isolationism advocated by this gentleman. (Havas Dispatch, 20th)

All Sectors of the United States Express Mourning in Unison

Washington: President Roosevelt expressed his condolences on the death of Republican isolationist Senator Borah, stating, "Borah's death is a great loss to American political life. The U.S. Senate and the American people all express mourning in unison. However, we will always remember Borah's indomitable spirit." In addition, prominent figures in American political circles all expressed sorrow over Borah's death. According to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, "Borah was one of the most important politicians in the United States in this century. When the sad news came, people across the country were in shock and mourning." Secretary of State Hull said, "Borah served the American people for the longest time and was the American politician who most firmly adhered to his personal beliefs and will. Today, America has lost a strong politician." Biderman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, "Borah was an American politician with strong self-confidence, outstanding personality, and independent spirit. In the Senate, he was one of the few constitutional scholars in America." (United Press Dispatch, 20th)

Borah's Funeral to be National Funeral

Washington: According to news from here today, the U.S. will hold a national funeral for Borah, probably on Sunday or Sunday, with the ceremony held in the Senate. At that time, President Roosevelt, cabinet ministers, members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and foreign envoys to the U.S. will all participate in the funeral. In addition, the Senate convened at noon today to hear Senator Clark's official announcement of Borah's death. At the same time, from this morning, all public and private organizations and groups here have lowered their flags to half-mast to express their condolences. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)

### China Loses a Friend; Chongqing Expresses Condolences

Chongqing: Here, many express condolences for the death of American Senator Borah, recognizing Borah as a "friend of China," because Borah did uphold justice at the Washington Conference. According to Chinese officials here, although Borah was not very familiar with Far Eastern affairs, he was still a friend of China. Therefore, the National Diplomacy Association has sent a telegram to Borah's family to express their condolences. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)

Chongqing: Chinese officials deeply regret the death of U.S. Senator Borah. Although this isolationist politician recently opposed the United States taking a more active policy in the Far East to prevent Japanese aggression in China, the Chinese have not forgotten that fourteen years ago, Borah, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocated the abolition of unequal treaties between China and the United States. It is said that Borah was the first American leader to sympathize with the National Government. Therefore, it is believed that when the Chinese newspapers publish articles of mourning tomorrow morning, they will not criticize his isolationist concept. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)

### Pope and U.S. President Cooperate; Advocating Peace Movement Based on Justice and Equality; Pope Sends Handwritten Letter to President Roosevelt, Saying that the Strength of the Peace Movement is Increasing

Washington: The Pope of Rome yesterday sent a handwritten letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, praising his efforts for peace. The letter was personally delivered to President Roosevelt by Archbishop Cicognani, the Pope's representative to the U.S. At the same time, the Pope's letter was also a reply to President Roosevelt's peace call issued on December 23rd last year. According to the Archbishop, President Roosevelt smiled when he received the letter and looked very pleased. He also said that although peace has not been achieved in recent times, a peace movement based on "justice and equality" should be launched and prepared early. According to the Pope's letter, "If the current situation of the belligerent parties does not fundamentally change, then there is little hope for the achievement of peace." After greatly praising Roosevelt's peace efforts, the Pope expressed his willingness to cooperate with the U.S. President to seek the solution of various world problems through peaceful means. The Pope believes that his and the U.S. President's peace calls were coincidentally inspired by heaven. "...Since then, the anti-war, anti-killing, anti-aggression, and anti-threat to human civilization movements in the new and old worlds have increasingly strengthened their strength." (All-China Dispatch, 20th)

Washington: Pope Pius XII wrote a long letter in response to President Roosevelt's peace proposal, which he sent a few days before Christmas. The contents of the letter first thanked Roosevelt and believed that the letter in spirit was able to coincide with the thoughts, emotions, and hopes of the general public and the class that had sacrificed the most in this war. People's hearts are longing for peace. Once the war stops, there will be a possibility of establishing a true peace that is in accordance with the principles of justice. However, it is necessary to have a highly skilled political power, thoroughly understand the voice of humanitarianism, and those who truly worship the Gospel of Jesus Christ can identify the right path and create a peace that can compensate for the great sacrifices of this war. It also stated, "We fully understand that the current obstacles are not easy to remove. If the belligerent countries' attitude does not change one day, our hope will be difficult to realize one day. However, we firmly believe in peace, regardless of the current difficulties, regardless of the speed of success, we will always work for peace. Therefore, we welcome the important representatives sent by Your Excellency, because they can understand Your Excellency's psychology, bear a major mission, and they themselves have an excellent reputation." The letter concluded by saying, "We sincerely pray for the prosperity of Your Excellency and all the people of the United States." (Haitong Dispatch, 20th)

Helsinki: The Soviet offensive to penetrate Kemikavavi has been repulsed. The Finnish army counterattacked, driving the Soviet troops back several miles. Fierce fighting is currently taking place around Mukikavavi, the outcome of which is yet to be determined. The Soviets are now concentrating their forces to build temporary fortifications along a semicircular front line. The supplies and food for the Soviet troops in this area are better than those of the Soviet troops retreating on other lines. It is expected that they will put up a stronger resistance. It is believed that another extremely important battle is brewing. The strength of the Soviet forces is not known for certain, but military circles here estimate that there are two Soviet divisions in the Sala area. Although they have lost important military advantages due to the retreat, they have gained better transportation to the rear and have received food and ammunition transported along the road they built connecting to the Murmansk railway.

### Norwegian Political Parties Support the Government

Oslo: The Storting convened today, and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold attended and delivered a speech stating that the government's duty is to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war, and it must strictly adhere to neutrality, without taking sides with any belligerent. Although the Norwegian nation has the right to express its feelings, it must do so with caution so as not to harm its neutrality. As far as the current situation is concerned, if our country is attacked, it will certainly do its best to defend itself. If the Storting believes that it is necessary to form a united national cabinet by uniting all parties to cope with the difficult times, the current government is also prepared to do so. Foreign Minister Gulbrand Lunde then spoke, saying that since the outbreak of the war in Europe, our country has experienced various difficulties, especially the mine warfare. So far, our country has lost a total of 28 ships, and more than 100 sailors have been killed. All of this cannot be blamed on any belligerent, but only to curse the war. Our country had previously lodged a protest with Germany, which replied that its submarines had never entered Norwegian territorial waters. In addition, the Soviet Union protested because our country aided Finland. What we have always stated is that the sentiments of our people cannot be suppressed, and relief work does not distinguish between national boundaries. However, our country must still strictly adhere to neutrality, which is also the case in our two neighboring countries, Sweden and Denmark, which are also pursuing the same policy. In short, the cooperation of the Nordic countries has absolutely nothing to do with military issues. The diplomatic authorities of the various countries have already explained this at a meeting held previously in the Swedish capital. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### British Nation Will Never Tolerate Any Country Dominating Europe; British Foreign Secretary Asks Nationals to Commit All Efforts to the War; Unwilling to Disclose Methods to Aid Finland

London: Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax recently delivered a speech in Leeds, stating, "We deeply know that in order to win this war, we must use all our strength and greatest determination to achieve success. Our country is a democracy, and private individuals have the freedom to judge and are not restricted by a secret police. This situation may increase difficulties in government preparation and design, but in times of trouble, the government's decisions are known to all the people, and are approved with free judgment and unanimous will, so its strength will inevitably be doubled and overcome everything. This kind of spiritual solidarity has always been despised by Hitler, but it will eventually be the main cause of his failure, because all the burdens of modern warfare, in a justified nation, will naturally be willingly endured, and can never be compared with a nation forced to fight. Previously, in September 1938, various outstanding cases had been resolved by the Munich Agreement according to Germany's claims, but Hitler's ambitions were still clearly visible. It should be known that our nation will never tolerate any country's desire to dominate Europe. This can be seen in history. I dare to resolutely and decisively tell the world today that the British nation's struggle against hegemonic attempts in the past was justified, and in today's situation, it will inevitably become more and more justified. Some say that we can sit idly by and allow Germany to do whatever it wants in Central and Southern Europe. We dare not agree with this view, because even if we disregard morality and sacrifice the freedom of other nations, it will never be the good fortune of the British Empire." (The audience cheered.) "As for the British government's methods of aiding Finland, if they are disclosed, it will actually harm the public interest, but this aid is by no means lip service. This can be told to the people of the country. As far as the threat of German mine warfare is concerned, it has been lifted since the Admiralty implemented countermeasures." (The audience cheered.) (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Rome: Secretary-General of the Fascist Party, Muti, recently made a statement, saying that Italy's position on the current European war is not immutable. This has been prominently published in various newspapers, and diplomatic figures have commented on it, saying that the outside world is spreading the rumor that Italy will not be drawn into the current European war vortex. Muti's words are intended to dispel this misunderstanding and advise the people not to think that Italy can remain a non-belligerent country for a long time. In addition, since Germany and the Soviet Union established an alliance, Italian public opinion has become increasingly dissatisfied with Germany and has turned to the United Kingdom and France. Muti's remarks are a warning to public opinion and a recounting of the strained relations between Italy and various democracies in the past, in order to prevent domestic public opinion from tending to be biased. The leaders of the Fascist Party believe that how Italian policy should evolve and when it can act must be decided by itself. At present, preparations should be made in the psychological aspect of the people, so that once the time is ripe, the policy can be decided regardless of emotions and move forward. As for the Fascist Party's policy of anti-democracy, anti-Soviet Union, and anti-bourgeoisie in ideology, it is the foundation of the Fascist revolution and should be maintained. This has also been expressed in Muti's remarks. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### French Senate Approves Revocation of Communist Party Members' Qualifications; Cabinet Minister Ydan Delivers a Speech to Vigorously Ban Communist Propaganda Movements

Paris: The government's proposed emergency motion to revoke the qualifications of Communist Party members was passed by the House of Representatives on the 16th of this month, and the Senate has now unanimously approved it with 294 votes. This case has been established. There are a total of two Communist Party members in the Senate. One of them, Mr. Cachin, was not present today. The other, Mr. Gramaud, had already declared his withdrawal from the party before the government dissolved the Communist Party, so he will still attend as usual today. Before the case was voted on, several senators delivered speeches, strongly condemning the activities of the Communist Party and saying that merely expelling Communist Party members from Parliament is not enough. It is necessary to sever all relations with the Soviet Union, including diplomatic relations, and strictly prohibit the Communist propaganda movement in the country before it is possible to succeed. Then, Cabinet Minister Ydan spoke on behalf of the government, using this to end the debate, stating, "Since the outbreak of the war, the domestic Communist propaganda movement has intensified, which is indeed the case, but the authorities have immediately taken various measures to ban it. As for the government's proposal to revoke the qualifications of Communist Party members, the reason is also very simple, because our country is fighting abroad, and anyone whose attitude is contrary to the sentiments of the people of the country should not be allowed to participate in Parliament. In short, our country's foreign policy will never be constrained by domestic political issues. All measures that the government deems beneficial to the country will be implemented. In addition, our country should give Finland 'the greatest assistance' to resist external forces." (The senators applauded.) "Although our country's diplomatic relations with 'a certain country' have caused some delicate issues, the government is still willing to take full responsibility under the supervision of Parliament."

### Goebbels Broadcasts Maledictions Against the British, Calling Them Wolves in Sheep's Clothing

London: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels issued a strong attack on Britain from Posen yesterday, saying, "There is only one opinion of the British, which is to destroy them. They are wolves in sheep's clothing. The British want us to sign a new Treaty of Versailles and divide Germany, and have colluded with the emperors they want to restore." (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### President Roosevelt: Radio Address Stresses the Need to Strengthen Democracy

Washington – President Roosevelt, today, delivered a radio address at the "Children of Democracy" conference held at the White House. He stated that the world events that have transpired since the first meeting of this conference at the White House last April have demonstrated that our democracy must be strengthened at every point of tension or weakness. All soldiers wish the country to become a place where their children can live in peace and, upon reaching adulthood, understand their responsibilities to the nation's future. It is essential to know that adequate national defense requires sufficient armaments and war equipment, but even more so, an educated, healthy, and happy populace. (Reuter, 19th)

### Yonai Placed on Reserve Duty; As Usual, Does Not Wear Military Uniform; Now Having New Clothes Made

Hong Kong – Tokyo Dispatch, according to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the newly appointed Prime Minister Yonai, on the day of his inauguration, because he had already been placed on reserve duty, should not, as a rule, wear army or navy uniforms. Therefore, he wore his old clothes made thirty years ago. Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishiwata and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Hirose carefully examined the Prime Minister's old clothes for a long time, and then urged the Prime Minister to have new clothes made. Now the Prime Minister has had new clothes made of artificial wool. (19th)

### Which Is Stronger: Airplanes or Warships?

American naval historian Rear Admiral Mahan once said that the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars, which are generally considered to have occurred on land, were not entirely devoid of naval battles. Furthermore, in many ways, the decisions of victory or defeat, the naval warfare component, was more important than land warfare.

The current European war is naturally no exception. However, in recent years, aviation has made rapid progress, which is completely different from the last European war. The question of which is superior, the air force or the navy, has therefore sparked fierce debate, not only shaking the military but also causing debate in parliament. Many enthusiastic supporters of airplanes insist that the era of warships is over, while supporters of warships equally vehemently refute this theory. The entire argument rests on whether airplanes, upon reaching a point sufficient to drop bombs and bomb targets, can avoid being shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and to what extent the bombs dropped can damage the target. Naturally, the lower the bomber flies, the greater the chance of hitting the target, but the greater the risk of being shot down. Bombing undefended targets at leisure is completely different from dropping bombs in the midst of dense anti-aircraft fire. The more accurate the anti-aircraft fire, the weaker the airplane's aiming ability for bomb dropping. When airplanes practice bombing in peacetime, they cannot hit targets at altitudes exceeding 14,000 feet, but it is heard that the new bombing sights equipped on modern bombers can increase the accuracy of bomb dropping to altitudes of 25,000 feet, a height beyond the reach of anti-aircraft guns.

Another major principle to consider is the extent of the bombing damage. The heavier the bomb, the greater the damage, but there are limits to the load that an airplane can carry. The heavier the load of bombs on an airplane, the smaller its range. It is also necessary to pay attention to what kind of warship is hit and which part of the warship is damaged. The extent to which airplanes can damage warships is still a matter of speculation, although there are exaggerated rumors from the outside world. In fact, no one can provide an answer, which may become clear in this European war. The leading powers in this war, Britain and France, boast of their naval superiority, while Germany prides itself on its invincible air force. Although German airplanes have repeatedly bombed British warships, the results, apart from conflicting messages from both sides, have not provided any reliable information sufficient to reach a satisfactory conclusion. At present, the German air force's offensive is limited to bombing several military targets on the east coast of England and attempting to break through the Anglo-French naval blockade in the North Sea and warships escorting merchant ships.

When an airplane bombs any kind of target, the point of impact of the bombs, regardless of the wind force, usually forms a circle around the target. Other things being equal, the direction of the airplane's attack is usually determined by the outline of the target. For example, when bombing a warship, it is easier to hit it when dropping bombs from the bow or stern. If a fleet is deployed in formation, although there are many targets to be bombed, it is not easy for airplanes to succeed in attacking. This is because while the main battleships in such fleets are easy targets, they are often surrounded by several cruisers and destroyers as satellites, and these warships are all equipped with anti-aircraft guns. The British Navy also has many cruisers, which, in addition to anti-aircraft guns, are not equipped with other armaments. Their mission is specifically to protect the fleet from enemy aircraft. The fleet also includes aircraft carriers, whose deck-mounted aircraft can take off at any time to intercept enemy aircraft. Well-defended naval ports also have anti-aircraft guns and airplanes protecting the fleet on shore. Battleships and cruisers are also equipped with anti-aircraft guns, which can fire four or five-inch shrapnel shells at a very high speed using precision instruments, and can also be assisted by heavy machine guns.

However, if there are dense clouds in the sky, airplanes can take full advantage of them, emerging from the clouds to attack. In this type of attack, by the time the anti-aircraft guns fire, the airplane has already reached above the target, and the bombing is often successful. Airplanes can attack a fleet from all directions, but it is best to attack with the wind, so that the airplane's speed is increased, or by using the sun's glare to confuse the anti-aircraft gunners' aim.

The larger the group of airplanes attacking, the greater the chance of success, because the number of bombs dropped is large, and the increased number of airplanes reduces the concentration of anti-aircraft fire. When bombing in large groups, nine or more airplanes often take turns dropping bombs in batches at different altitudes. Some can use parallel line bombing techniques, while others can attack using a dive-bombing method. A single airplane bombing a single warship is best done with a dive-bombing method. This bombing method is accurate and least likely to be hit by anti-aircraft guns. If the sailors on a warship encounter this situation, if they are quick and agile to maneuver, they can avoid being hit by sharply turning the ship's hull at the appropriate time. It is most difficult for a single warship to encounter two or more airplanes flying from different directions to bomb, because most warships are not very effective in simultaneously opening anti-aircraft fire in all directions. Another effective method for airplanes attacking a single warship is to use machine guns to strafe the sailors or anti-aircraft gunners on the deck.

### Today's Xikang: Beautiful Scenery, Abundant Products; Managing Tibet Should Start with Xikang

Chengdu Correspondence: Xikang is vast and shaped like a butterfly, being a transverse mountain range region. From north to south, it comprises six major mountain ranges: Shula Mountain, Nu Mountain, Ningjing Mountain, Yalong Mountain, Daxue Mountain, and Qionglai Mountain, forming six major river systems: Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nujiang River, Lancang River, Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, creating a naturally beautiful environment. However, due to the transverse nature of the mountain ranges, the entire Xikang is blocked in terms of transportation. Xikang is divided into three major scenic areas west of the Jinsha River: (1) The Zhuola River in Dege County, Jinsha River, winds and meanders, with curved canyons, resembling the Jialing River. Along the mountains, there are lakes that stretch for two miles, with clear blue water surrounded by green pines and cypresses, and snow-capped peaks like white hats. The lush trees on the mountainside are like green clothes. Its beauty can be compared to a Swiss park, with the only missing elements being carved yachts and tourists arm in arm. However, this deficiency can be left for Chinese youth to make up for. Nearby is a gorge, exceptionally magnificent, hence it can be called Snow Gorge. (2) West of Zhuola Mountain is a river gorge with water that seems contented and free, hence it can be named Yi Gorge. (3) Near Zhuola Mountain is another gorge, with walls standing tall at forty meters. The water flows rapidly, with rugged rocks and overhanging cliffs, covered with ancient trees, strange branches winding and twining, and lush forests forming a canopy. The narrowness of the gorge walls makes it difficult to breathe when looking at them, hence it can be called Jun Gorge. From Dege to Baiyu, there are also three mountains, the highest of which is over 1,500 meters. At 400 meters on the mountainside, there is a large lamasery. The entire mountain is covered in knee-deep snow. The secluded and pure scenery cannot be appreciated by ordinary people. Descending from the lamasery is like being surrounded by plants, with pine and cypress branches overlapping, and tree trunks overgrown with parasitic plants. Walking through the green shade, the accumulation of fallen leaves on the mountain path rustles, pleasing to the ear. Emerging from the forest is a vast grassland, as flat as if artificially trimmed. Looking at the towering mountains, white hats and green clothes, rows of trees, the scenery is magnificent. If you rest here, you can see Baiyu County at the foot of the mountain and the rivers surrounding the county seat, like a bird's-eye view from an airplane. If you ride a horse freely from the waist of the lamasery, it takes half a month to reach the foot of the mountain. Therefore, if it is developed into a park, it can be named Baiyu Park. Using it as a summer resort, Mount Lu and Mogan Mountain may not be able to match it.

Social Life

Most men in Xikang do not engage in production. The talented and intelligent all enter lamasery as monks. Ordinary people often carry weapons, which affects social order. The women of Xikang endure hardships in their work and service that far surpass those of women in other places. They are responsible for all tasks, including cultivation, transportation, animal husbandry, and operation. They are truly the most diligent and hardworking women in China. The health and beauty of Xikang women and their open and generous social interactions are also commendable.

The population in various parts of Xikang is abnormally distributed. For example, the Dege lamasery has over 900 lamas, while the people number only about 20 families. Lihua has a population of only over 1,000, while there are over 3,000 lamas. The people have absolute respect for the lamas. Their funerals are divided into four types: sky burial, cremation, water burial, and earth burial, with cremation being the most honorable. They do not like earth burial. As for the extravagance of religion and the degree to which it is deeply ingrained in the people's hearts, it can be seen from the stone tablets carved with Tibetan scriptures everywhere and the people silently chanting scriptures when passing by the stone tablets. The people of Xikang also possess artistic talent and a love for art. The grand murals and carvings in the lamaseries and the prevalence of folk songs and dances all show that the life of the Kang people is not entirely dry and tasteless. The Kang people's diet consists of tea, butter, tsampa, and salt as daily necessities. The Kang people's clothing is loose and long. During the day, they tie their waists with belts to prevent it from dragging on the ground, and at night, they use it as bedding. There are no pockets in the clothes, so all utensils and food can be placed around the waist.

Construction in Various Areas

Construction in Xikang is currently being promoted by the joint efforts of the central and local governments. When Ning and Ya prefectures were not incorporated into Xikang, due to the vast land and sparse population of Kang, all construction could not be planned. Since being incorporated into Xikang, the population has increased sharply, and products are abundant, so construction has begun to be planned and promoted. However, Ya prefecture has more technical personnel and is close to the central government's guidance, with abundant products and relatively better transportation, so promotion is easier. Kang prefecture, on the other hand, has vast land and a sparse population, with a lack of technical personnel. For example, Baiyu County has only two carpenters in the entire county, so it is difficult to keep pace with Ya prefecture in terms of work promotion. As for Ning prefecture, although it has abundant grain to assist Kang prefecture, it is plagued by opium addiction and has a weak physique, so construction is inevitably affected.

Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Minerals

Tea is the main product of Ya prefecture. Last year's output was 210,000 packages, each weighing 16 kilograms. The export of Tibetan medicinal materials and furs is mostly exchanged for the "border tea" produced in Ya prefecture. However, due to the popularity of Indian tea in recent years, the market is in danger of being seized. Therefore, in order to continue to maintain the existing sales market for border tea in Ya prefecture, to prevent Xikang's finances from losing a source of income, and to ensure that Tibetan native products continue to be exchanged, they are actively working on improving quality, reducing costs, facilitating transportation, and extensively planting. Iron ore is very abundant in Ya prefecture. The Kang people use indigenous methods to extract and refine it, but the results are very good. The output of sulfur, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, agate, and other minerals is also abundant, but the reserves of gold are relatively small.

The mineral resources of Ning prefecture are richest in iron ore, with reserves of 7 to 8 million tons per year, and it is the best magnetite ore. The output of copper, coal, and salt is also abundant. The gold reserves far exceed those of Ya prefecture. There are four large-scale gold mines, and the locals say they "measure gold by the bucket." Kang prefecture is most prosperous in gold production. The Yalong Tsangpo River basin in Ya prefecture is particularly rich in reserves. In addition, the reserves of copper, lead, and other minerals are also abundant. Animal husbandry is particularly prosperous in Kang prefecture. Each county has hundreds of cattle farms, with dozens of cattle on each farm, especially in Shiqu County. Except for the fixed houses of the county government, everything else belongs to livestock tents. Therefore, the output of milk, butter, and furs is extremely high. The forests of Kang prefecture are most lush in the Jinsha River basin. Trees that require two people to embrace are everywhere. However, because the forests obstruct animal husbandry, the locals have even burned them all down, which is truly regrettable. If they could be used for papermaking, the entire demand for paper in Xikang would not be a problem. It is deeply regrettable that the Kang people use the oldest methods for papermaking, and each family can only produce a few dozen sheets of paper a day. This precious natural resource needs to be developed and utilized. In addition, the oil in Ningjing Mountain also has large reserves.

Water conservancy is a natural source of profit for the entire Xikang. The difference in the steepness of the six major river systems is 2,000 meters. The 60-mile waterway near Kangding can generate 100,000 horsepower, and the electricity that can be generated is more than 70,000 kilowatts. If the water power of the entire Xikang is used to power factories, the benefits cannot be calculated by numbers. Moreover, because Kang has no coal production, it is particularly suitable to use water power to compensate for this deficiency.

Transportation Issues

It is generally believed that Xikang is mostly mountainous, but in reality, there are many plains. Therefore, the Sichuan-Kang Highway and the Kang-Xin Highway should be urgently constructed. However, the transportation in the Jinsha River basin should not be ignored. This is because Xikang's transportation relies entirely on "Ula" (a Tibetan term meaning duty, where local people take turns supplying horses and personnel for travel and transportation). However, from Kangding to Ba'an, the "Ula" system is extremely bad. Ba'an's fruit production is exceptionally abundant, and its grapes and apples are comparable to those of the United States. If this section of the waterway is developed, the water flow will be stable, and transportation will be rapid. All medicinal materials, furs, and fruit plants can flow downstream, greatly benefiting the Kang people's economy.

In addition, there are two other points that are sufficient to value Xikang: (1) Xikang is a bridge between Han and Tibet. If Xikang is not developed, there is no way to manage Tibet. (2) Tibet has an international role. Because sea transport is cut off, it is necessary to rely on land transport in the rear. Xikang can enter Yunnan via Zheng'an Yanjing and Deqin, and can also reach India and Singapore from Yanjing through Chayu to Ledo. The importance of Xikang is as described above, but we cannot be optimistic because of this, so it is urgent to develop it. Secondly, today's management of Xikang cannot expect immediate results. We must have the determination to fight hard in the long term and do things step by step in a down-to-earth manner. The large number of technical personnel needed depends on the youth's enthusiastic dedication.

### One Hundred Rice Shops Commissioned to Conduct Fair Price Sales Today; Fair Price Rice at $25 per Stone; Losing Over $6 Per Bag Compared to Purchase Price; Large Fair Price Donations Paid to the Association Within Two Days

After the Shanghai Fair Price Committee decided to commission the Rice Shops Association to designate 100 rice shops in the two concessions to carry out fair price sales starting today, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Committee, at the Committee's office. He was privileged to receive the following statement:

Yu stated:

The Original Intention of Fair Price Sales: Since the rice shortage in this city, various parties have devised relief measures. In addition to major factories, businesses, and guilds devising relief or subsidies for their employees, middle-class families can still manage to maintain themselves with effort. The most miserable are the poor who live day by day on small amounts of rice. This is the original intention of this Committee to actively conduct fair price sales in order to provide relief. The broken rice purchased by this Committee this time is produced in Saigon. Only the rice grains are slightly broken, and the quality is equal to other Saigon rice.

Fair Price Rice Price: The cost of the rice purchased by this Committee, calculated including handling charges, is $35.53 per bag, plus expenses, weighing approximately one hundred pounds, totaling about $37 per bag. Now, it is being sold at six and a half catties per dollar, which is about one and a half cents per catty (i.e., $25 per stone), earning $30.07. As such, this Committee will lose about $6.10 per bag. Yu also stated that for this fair price sale, members of the Rice Shops Association are still allowed to expand the scope and conduct it completely voluntarily, according to the fair price sale method entrusted by various groups for the first time, which is deeply appreciated. Various industries and individuals have enthusiastically donated and pledged donations, allowing the Committee to proceed unimpeded.

Automatic Donations: For example, yesterday, Zhao Faji personally donated $5,000 to Jin Cheng Bank. Today, Cun Xin Tang personally donated $10,000 to the Shanghai Bank. Other miscellaneous donations, such as from anonymous individuals, are also quite enthusiastic, showing great zeal, which is deeply admired. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to provide assistance, and deep gratitude is expressed to the police authorities of the two concessions for their willingness to provide their best efforts to maintain order. It is also hoped that the civilians who go to the various rice shops to buy rice will maintain order. Fortunately, the scope of this fair price sale has been expanded compared to before, and the time is also longer, making it easy to popularize.

Implementation Today: The Rice Shops Association accepted the commission and designated 100 member rice shops to conduct fair price sales, including 30 in the Public Concession and 20 in the French Concession. One shop in each location will issue rice, and another will sell tickets. Starting at 1:00 PM today, under the protection of the police detectives, fair price sales will be implemented. Each location will sell 50 bags per day, until 6:00 PM. Yesterday, the Fair Price Committee withdrew 2,500 bags of fair price rice from the warehouse and distributed them to the 50 rice shops issuing rice. The rice ticket style is "Shanghai Fair Price Committee Fair Price Rice Ticket," with the "Date" and "This ticket is good for one dollar's worth of broken rice" noted, along with "Not applicable elsewhere, invalid the next day" and "Location 〇" printed.

Change to Measuring Instruments

The Shanghai Fair Price Committee specially announced yesterday: "For the purpose of notification, the original method for this Committee's fair price sale of broken rice was to use specially made funnel-shaped lead cylinders with a one-dollar capacity, stipulated as one cylinder per dollar, suitable for six and a half catties per dollar. Now, after the lead cylinders were made, the capacity was found to be inconsistent." It was decided to change to using the steel standard measuring instruments made by the "Shanghai Rice Shops Trade Association," selling two liters per dollar, which is six and a half catties per dollar. This is specially announced again so that everyone knows.

Group Rice Purchases: After the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association handled the registration of group orders for foreign rice, the various groups, organizations, companies, and factories that entrusted the Association to order foreign rice have paid deposits for more than 14,000 bags. In addition to ordering the first batch of 600 tons of Saigon No. 2 foreign rice that has arrived in Shanghai, the Executive Directors approved yesterday that the Purchasing Committee will telegraph tomorrow to continue ordering a second batch of 800 tons from Saigon. It is also stipulated that only Saigon rice No. 2 will be purchased for group purchases. For the first batch of foreign rice, Jin Cheng Bank has advanced funds and is in the process of handling the shipment formalities.

### Kato to Fly to Japan; One Week Stay

Japanese Special Envoy Kato, after arriving in Shanghai last year, has been here for almost half a year. Kato flew to Peiping on December 15th last year to meet with the American Ambassador, but returned to Shanghai after Dr. Johnson's quiet departure. After the American Ambassador arrived from Qinhuangdao on the warship Henderson, Kato went to the Ambassador's office on the morning of the 18th to meet with him, and left after a conversation of about 20 minutes. Kato then flew back to Tokyo in the afternoon to report to the new cabinet. It is learned that Kato will stay in Tokyo for a week before returning to China.

### British Foreign Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty to Broadcast to Shanghai; Listening Time 9:15 AM

According to news from the British Consulate in this port, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to deliver a speech to overseas audiences at 2:35 PM on the 20th on the BBC. The listening time in Shanghai is 10:35 PM on the 21st. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill will also broadcast on the same day at 9:15 PM. The listening times in Shanghai are 1:15 AM, 8:15 AM, and 1:30 PM on the 21st. The listening times in Shanghai are 9:15 AM, 4:15 PM, and 9:03 PM on the 21st.

### Friends of Finland in Shanghai Donate Funds to Aid War Effort; Total Donations of $25,000

Since Finland resisted the Soviet Union's mighty army, the Friends of Finland in Shanghai have launched a fundraising campaign to express their sympathy. According to reliable sources, as of the evening of the 19th, the amount donated to Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is worth approximately $25,000 in national currency. Among them, $7,500 is specifically designated to be donated to the Finnish Red Cross for relief purposes, and another $17,500 is donated to Finland's defense war expenses.

### Dutch Ships Increase Sailings to Singapore

Sailings to the Nanyang Islands have been mostly operated by Dutch and British ships, especially to Singapore, where commerce is flourishing and the population is increasing rapidly. British ships traveling to and from the island have always been frequent. It has been learned that since the outbreak of war in Europe, British ships sailing to various parts of Nanyang have been affected by the difficulties in European navigation, and the number of sailings has been reduced at one point. In the past month, after British and French ships have been attacked by belligerent countries in various places, the British side, considering that sailings in the Far East are also dangerous, has suspended sailings one after another in order to avoid accidents. Therefore, there are few British ships currently sailing to the Nanyang Islands. Ships in Singapore have gradually been replaced by Dutch mail ships. It is heard that the Singapore authorities have an agreement with the Dutch shipping company regarding the operation of Dutch ships to the island. Before the outbreak of war, there were about 50 Dutch ships operating on the Nanyang routes. Since the outbreak of the European war and the suspension of British ships, the number of Dutch ships has increased frequently. According to recent statistics, there are now more than 100 ships, which is an unprecedented phenomenon.

### Three Japanese Airplanes Bomb Lishi; The Airport There Had Already Been Destroyed; Meaningless Bombing by Japanese Airplanes

According to a telegram received by the aviation community last night, three Japanese airplanes flew in formation to Lishi outside the South Gate of Ningbo on the afternoon of the 19th and bombed it, dropping a total of 24 bombs. One farmer was injured, but there was no other damage.

Airport Destroyed

It is investigated that Lishi outside the South Gate of Ningbo had an airport before the outbreak of the War of Resistance. After the outbreak of the war, Japanese airplanes constantly flew to bomb it. Later, in the winter of last year, the Ningbo authorities, on orders from higher authorities, thoroughly destroyed the airport, covered it with earth, and handed it over to farmers for cultivation. The residents of Lishi Town were also evacuated. Therefore, it is meaningless for Japanese airplanes to bomb it again this time.

Japanese Warships Bomb Zhenhai Again

According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, after four Japanese warships shelled Zhenhai in two shifts on the 16th, they did not shell it on the 17th. On the afternoon of the 18th, they were still in the Longshan and Xiepu areas. After shelling, the Japanese warships sailed away from the Zhenhai port, beyond the range of the beacon mouth. The garrison troops are still on high alert to prevent them from committing further offenses.

### Public Works Department Director-General Fessenden's Resignation Rumors Untrue, Scheduled to Leave Shanghai This Afternoon for Singapore on Vacation, Extraterritorial Road Negotiations Still Unresolved

The North-China Daily News reports that Public Works Department Director-General and President Fessenden is scheduled to leave Shanghai this afternoon for a short vacation. During his absence, the duties will be temporarily assumed by Deputy Director-General Mr. Gobbett. Mr. Fessenden yesterday refuted rumors broadcast by a Shanghai radio station stating that he would resign and not return to Shanghai, saying, "I have never intended to resign. I will leave Shanghai for Hong Kong and Singapore on Sunday (today) for a

Three-Week Vacation.

I have not had a vacation for over a year." Regarding the negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government" on the issue of extraterritorial road construction in western Shanghai, there has been no concrete new progress. Important issues such as police affairs and tax collection are still under discussion, and a specific plan has not yet been agreed upon. It is expected that no resolution can be reached before the Lunar New Year. The report in a certain morning newspaper yesterday that a joint police agency would be established in the extraterritorial road construction area is

Completely Groundless,

and likely to cause misunderstandings. Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Public Works Department stated yesterday that the public should not pay attention to unofficial information regarding the negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government." Unless the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government" have reached a complete agreement on this matter, neither party will

Disclose

any information. This is a policy that both parties have adopted since the beginning of the negotiations and will continue until a final agreement is reached. The negotiations are proceeding as usual, and although complete understanding has been reached on some issues, their content cannot be disclosed.

### US Ambassador Johnson to Travel to Hankou by Ship Tomorrow, Purpose of Inspection is to Investigate the Current Situation on the Yangtze River, Reason for Not Opening Beyond Hankou

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that US Ambassador Johnson, who arrived in Shanghai on Thursday, told reporters that his trip to Hankou was like a "temporary tourist" and had no significant meaning. However, according to information gathered this morning (20th), the Ambassador is scheduled to travel up the Yangtze River on the US gunboat Luzon on Monday morning with Rear Admiral Glassford and his staff. People in Shanghai believe that Ambassador Johnson's trip will be to inspect the current situation in the area and investigate why it should not be opened beyond Hankou. During the inspection, he will be assisted by his staff, including his personal secretary Mr. La Fong, Naval Attaché Commander Offley, Military Attaché Major Meyer, and Assistant Naval Attaché Major McHugh. He is expected to return to Shanghai in early January. The US gunboat Wake will also accompany him, replacing the current US gunboat Guam stationed in Hankou. The Guam is scheduled to return to Shanghai on February 6.

### Outside Yanglinkou, the New Jiangnan Ship Sinks, New Asia Ship Collides on the Side, Damaging the Starboard Side, Crew Members Killed and Injured, Engine Room Flooded

The New Jiangnan, a ship of German company Reis & Co., represented by Fu Hwa Steamship Company, which sails the Shanghai-Tianshenggang route, left Shanghai for Tianshenggang at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. At around 5:00 PM, when it arrived outside Yanglinkou, it was sunk by the New Asia, a ship of Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha. Two crew members died, and two were injured. The casualties of passengers are unknown. Rescued crew members and passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The details are as follows:

The New Asia Ship Collided from the Rear Side.

The New Jiangnan has a gross tonnage of 157 tons and a length of 106 feet. It belongs to German company Reis & Co., represented by Fu Hwa Steamship Company at 113 Jiujiang Road, specializing in the Shanghai-Tianshenggang route, mainly for cargo and passenger transport. It used to sail the Shanghai-Beisha route. The ship left Shanghai directly for Tianshenggang at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, without cargo, only carrying more than 40 passengers, preparing to load a large amount of cargo in Tianshenggang and return to Shanghai. At 5:00 PM, when the ship arrived outside Yanglinkou, the Dahua ship was sailing on its front side, and the New Asia, a ship of Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha, was loading cargo in Wuhu and heading to Shanghai, was on the rear side of the Dahua ship. After the New Jiangnan crossed the Dahua ship, the New Asia Ship collided fiercely with the New Jiangnan, and the New Jiangnan, being a small ship, was damaged on the starboard belly.

The Ship Sank, Passengers Rescued.

After the New Jiangnan was hit, the engine room inside the ship was flooded, and it sank completely in about an hour. The crew and passengers were rescued by the New Asia Ship, and a total of about 100 crew members and passengers were rescued and transferred to the New Asia Ship. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and berthed at the No. 31 buoy in Yangshupu. After receiving the news, Fu Hwa Company sent the Mito (transliteration) small ship, led by German manager Du Nasui, to Yangshupu to welcome them. They landed at around 11:00 AM. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from Fu Hwa Company yesterday that after the New Jiangnan was sunk, the company reported the collision and the report of the captain Lu Hexiang to the German company Reis & Co. It has now been confirmed that one crew member (cook) Zheng Afu has died, and (tea server) Wang Moufang and (engineer) Liu Aqing were injured and sent to Renji Hospital. After examination, the injuries are still minor and not life-threatening. The casualties of passengers are unknown, but there are probably no deaths or injuries.

The Company is Taking Measures to Deal with the Aftermath.

There were about 27 crew members on the New Jiangnan Ship, more than 20 staff members in the comprador room including tea servers, and about 20 workers, totaling about 60 people. There were about 40 passengers this time, totaling over 100 people. All the luggage and bedding of the rescued crew members have been lost. The company is taking measures to deal with the aftermath. The hull was insured with the North American Insurance Company, and Reis & Co. and the insurance company are taking measures to salvage it.

### Consular Court Judges for This Year

The Public Works Department recently received a notice stating that the judges for this year's Consular Court have been appointed: US Consul General Gauss (concurrently as Chief Judge), Japanese Consul General Miura, and British Consul General George. Mr. Qi will continue to serve as Secretary.

### County Government Agencies in Neighboring Counties are Becoming More Sound.

The eight counties bordering Shanghai's four suburbs are Shanghai, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jiading, Baoshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang. In January of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government selected and appointed legitimate county magistrates to each county one after another. The military salaries of the guerrilla army are also paid by the legitimate county governments one after another. Therefore, local national taxes can be collected separately by county government personnel, eliminating the practice of the guerrilla army collecting military salaries locally. The military and civilians are all rejoicing.

Restricted by the Environment, Taking on a Mobile Nature.

The Japanese and puppet sides regarded the county government agencies in the war zone as a thorn in their side and tried to send spies disguised as villagers to the countryside to investigate the location of the county government and then used military or other methods to carry out sabotage. Therefore, for a period of time, the county government agencies, restricted by the environment, changed to a mobile nature, with all shifts depending on military power. At the same time, they strictly arrested spies who secretly engaged in sabotage work. After repeatedly arresting spy-type criminals, after clear interrogation, they were executed to deter them.

County Government Agencies are Becoming More Sound.

At present, in the Jiangnan war zone, the Chinese mobile troops are actively recruiting and replenishing their forces, and the Japanese dare not use force to suppress them again. In places far from the Japanese-occupied areas, the county government has changed from a mobile to a fixed nature. Although the county government buildings do not adhere to formal aesthetic standards, the office agencies have gained a stable position and can no longer be destroyed by the Japanese and puppets. The Japanese know the location of several counties such as Fengxian and Songjiang, but they dare not easily invade. Therefore, the county government agencies in each county are becoming more sound.

### Silver Ear Fungus Transported to Shanghai, Certificate Exempts Remittance and Allows Release.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, stating that "the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, we have received your telegram, stating that the silver ear fungus transported to Shanghai has been detained, please transfer and instruct to release it according to regulations. After transferring the telegram for verification, the Ministry of Finance has approved this year's December Dianyu Zidai telegram, stating that this article has been telegraphed and instructed Kunming to verify the purchase order from the merchant in the destination of the transfer certificate, and the certificate from the trade association, exempting remittance and allowing release. This is hereby notified for your information.

### British-American Barter Trade, Carried by US President Lines, US Cotton Shipped to Britain, Britain Supplies Rubber to the US

The American President Lines (formerly reorganized as the Dollar Steamship Lines), after the August 13th Sino-Japanese Incident,

The Sino-US Route was Greatly Affected and Suspended. After the reorganization in early November 1938, the Sino-US route was restored (but is still only one-way). Recently, the world-class passenger ships have resumed calling at Shanghai and Taiwan. The first ship, President Garfield, will arrive in Shanghai on February 13. The company has made great efforts to expand its shipping business. Since the outbreak of the European war, some of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Europe have been shipped to Europe by the US. Therefore, Sino-US shipping has

Suddenly Prospered, and even European-American transportation is several times more profitable. It is also heard that the company has recently opened a new route from New York to Singapore, specializing in carrying British-American barter trade. The United States supplies cotton to Britain, shipping cotton from New York to Singapore for delivery. Britain supplies rubber to the United States, carrying rubber from Singapore back to New York. It has now been opened. Therefore, the company's original ships are insufficient for scheduling and operation. Recently, it has leased several large-sized "Maler" ships from Reis & Co. and is managing the ships of the American Pioneer Line, adding them to the operation.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Replies to Chamber of Commerce, No Prohibition on Sales of Shanghai Goods, But Certification Still Requires Careful Review

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received the list format of national goods certification issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Since then, domestic goods from national goods factories in the two special zones and safety zones in Shanghai have been transported internally, and the association fills out and issues certification forms. Customs offices in the interior release goods based on the forms. While careful processing was underway, it was later seen in the newspaper that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had said there was a prohibition on the domestic sale of Shanghai goods. An urgent telegram was sent to inquire, and yesterday a telegram was received in reply, stating, "The written telegram has been received. Regarding the section reported in the Shanghai newspaper, this ministry has no such regulation. Please notify the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing."

### Verification and Release Based on Chamber of Commerce Certification, Products of Shenxin and Wing On

The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, greetings. We have recently approved a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that although Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9 factories and Wing On No. 3 factory have not been designated for prohibition, the trademarks they use are the same as those used by the designated prohibited products of the factories of the two companies. We have previously instructed them to differentiate them. However, before the differentiation plan is submitted to the ministry for approval, all products of the three factories should be certified by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce as being products of the factories before verification and release." In addition to separate telegrams for compliance, please be informed and instruct compliance. Zhejiang Provincial Government Jia Mi Er Jian Yin.

### German Ship Chinese Crew Refuses to Return Home on Japanese Ship

The more than 350 unemployed crew members who returned home on the Italian postal company's ConteVerde on the 18th and arrived in Shanghai have now been staying at inns around the 16th pier of Xinkaihe. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, they were originally from Yongjia, Qingtian, Ruian, Zhoushan, and Yinxian in Zhejiang Province. They served on German merchant ships "Gula," "Harigalaland," and "Portland," working as firemen, sailors, servants, painters, and carpenters, for more than ten years. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the three ships were ordered to stop sailing and were anchored in the neutral port of Chile in South America. Since there was no prospect of resuming sailing, the company made arrangements to dismiss them, paying each person a severance payment equal to several months' salary (the average monthly salary per person was about ten US dollars).

### The Lunar New Year is Approaching, All Sectors are Promoting Military Appreciation and Disaster Relief, Uniformly Implemented Starting from the Lunar New Year

All sectors in Shanghai, led by the National Comfort Association, are initiating a campaign to save expenses during the Lunar New Year, shift the focus of gifts, and comfort the soldiers fighting in the war of resistance. It has been decided to uniformly implement this starting from February 10th (the first day of the Lunar New Year), sending the savings to the National Bank, which will then be transferred to the Comfort Association to provide comfort to the soldiers in various war zones. In addition, according to Shanghai customs, every year when the Lunar New Year approaches, middle and upper-class families prepare New Year's meals, invite relatives and friends, and visit each other, which costs a great deal. At this time of high prices and precarious livelihood for refugees, various charitable organizations hope that all sectors can save this expense and donate to help refugees to fulfill their duty of mutual assistance. Many charitable people in Shanghai will be able to promote this to benefit the disaster victims.

### National Goods Manufacturers to Discuss Today, Straits Settlements Prohibition, Shanghai Goods Sales to Southeast Asia Reach 2 Million Yuan Daily, Affecting Local Industry and Commerce Significantly

The British Straits Settlements government issued a ban on goods from non-sterling countries on November 17 of last year, while goods from sterling countries were not prohibited. Shanghai was included in the list of prohibited countries, restricting the import of 76 types of goods and prohibiting the import of as many as 236 types of goods. The products manufactured by Shanghai factories that are shipped to Southeast Asia reach 2 million yuan daily. This will inevitably suffer a serious blow in the future. In order to appeal to the Straits Settlements government to withdraw its order, the national goods factories have decided to convene a joint meeting of representatives of national goods factories today. At that time, coping measures will be discussed. A notice has already been issued, stating, "Greetings. Having read the newspaper report that the overseas national goods inspection representatives Gao and Wang sent a letter reporting that in order to strengthen foreign trade, the British Straits Settlements government has issued a ban on the import of goods from non-sterling countries. Once implemented, the national goods industry in this city will suffer a serious blow. For this reason, a joint meeting of representatives will be held at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month on Edward Road. At that time, please send representatives to attend the meeting on time and discuss matters." Negotiated with the company to take a Japanese ship via Japan from Santigoo port for dispersal, but they deeply understood the righteousness of the nation's vigorous resistance against Japan and were unwilling to take the ship. They pushed for representatives to negotiate with the responsible persons of various ships, and finally changed to take the Italian postal Olacchiwo to the port of Genoa in Italy, and returned home via ConteVerde. Now, they all plan to wait for the ship to return to their hometown, and some of them traveled to Ningbo via Haifu yesterday to stand guard over their homes, waiting for the end of the war, and then the leader will gather them to go abroad to serve.

### Shanghai Tramways Company, Expired Fare Vouchers, Cannot Be Used as Fares Anymore, Can Be Redeemed at Designated Locations

Due to the shortage of fractional currency, the Shanghai Tramways Company previously issued copper two-cent, nickel four-cent, aluminum two-cent, three-cent, and five-cent tokens. In December and January, two-cent and five-cent fare vouchers were issued. The December vouchers were originally scheduled to be used until January 10, but were then allowed to be used due to requests from all parties. The company now allows expired fare vouchers to be exchanged for cash. Its notice states, "The December fare vouchers issued by this company will be invalid from midnight on January 20. These December fare vouchers cannot be used as fares, but can be redeemed at the company's offices at 111 Sassoon House or at the main factory at 1171 Connaught Road. At a time when fractional currency is scarce, please refuse to accept the ten-month fare vouchers given by ticket sellers. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. The ticket sellers have sufficient January 1940 fare vouchers, so passengers must not accept used fare vouchers."

### The Xin Yi Fang Rent Increase Case Should Await Legal Resolution

The French businessman Picault & Cie wanted to increase the rent for the Xin Yi Fang on Rue Cardinal Mercier by 15% and 10% respectively on December 1, 1937. Now the same business wants to increase rent by another 20%. The 18 tenants unanimously refused the rent increase and reported to the Department of Political Affairs of the French Municipal Council, requesting the rent increase. Yesterday, the Department of Political Affairs summoned tenant representatives Liu Guang and others to persuade them to increase the rent. Liu Guang and others said that everything is expensive, the people cannot make a living, and they cannot afford it. They also entrusted lawyer Cheng Zhengping to send a letter to the Department of Political Affairs explaining the situation of repeated rent increases, and they have received a summons from the court to wait for a legal solution. This is a civil matter and should not be accepted.

### Stock Shortages to Defraud Goods, Proprietor of Sock Factory Flees, Shops Form United Prosecution

Zhu Gengru, the owner of the Huaxin Zhengji Sock Factory at 18 Route Tenant de Belleville, recently thought of a plan due to stock shortages. At the beginning of this month, he defrauded goods worth more than 1,800 yuan from Xin Taihao, Xie Feng National Goods Company, Modern Chemical Industry Company, and Central Chemical Industry Company, using term checks from the Kenyeh Bank as a perfunctory excuse. On the 6th, he closed the store and fled. After hearing the news, Xin Tai and other merchants jointly hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Court, accusing Zhu Gengru of issuing bad checks. Based on the complaint, Judge Zhu of the court opened the second criminal court yesterday to hear the case. Because the defendant's address was unknown, there was no way to issue a summons. The court ordered a postponement to the 25th of this month for retrial.

### The American Church in Longzhou Was Destroyed, The Japanese Army Evades Responsibility, Claiming that It Was Set on Fire by the Chinese Army, While the French Church in Qinzhou Was Safe

The China Press reports that the Japanese military spokesperson yesterday (19th), at a reception for journalists, denied the protests from the United States and France regarding the destruction of churches in South China last month. According to reports, the Japanese side received a protest on the 10th of this month, stating that on the 21st of last month, the Japanese army had plundered the American Christian Church in Longzhou, Guangxi, which flew the American flag, and burned it the following day. According to the Japanese military, the claim that the church was plundered by the Japanese army is not true. The church was set on fire by the Chinese army at the end of last month when the Japanese army approached Longzhou. The Japanese authorities have sent a reply to the American authorities. The Japanese side also received a similar protest from the French authorities regarding the burning of a French church near Qinzhou, Guangdong. In fact, the church buildings and the 300 refugees cared for by the church were all safe and protected by the Japanese army.

### 工部局一九三九年份　保障兒童工作

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Work for 1939

前年十二月間、本局工業科主任、曾以關於婢女問題之報告一件、呈由木局送請領袖領事轉遞國聯秘書長、以備國聯奴隸委員會之參考、上項報告、曾稱所謂婢女、僅係脫離近親而受他人家庭雇用之婦女之一種、其他如養女·童養媳·以及無數年幼女工等等、亦均受他人管束、爲其家庭服役、此外尚有大批女童、常經本生父母轉讓、以致受人束縛、但非在家庭中作工、若輩或經典鬻爲娼、或在介紹人管束之下、進入紗廠作工、所有工資收入、在一定年限內、統歸介紹人領受、至于男童亦有被父母轉讓面入工廠習藝之情事、此輩學徒、工作時間頗長、由雇主供給膳宿、但以無工資者居多、雇主所給膳食、至爲　敗、致使若輩因營養不足而患病、山此觀之、本埠有數千兒童、脫離本生家庭、雖其方”不一、但其生命無不在他人掌握之中、且常迺蹂躪、景况至慘、本局工業科主任、鑒於此項問題、性質複雜乃向局方建議、請用一切可能方法、使轉讓兒童之事件、向本局各主管人員報告並請設立「兒童保障科、」由工業科主任兼任該科主任、該主任又請局方與保護兒童之中外各團體密切合作、以上各項建議、均經接受、

In December of the year before last, the Director of the Industry Department of this Bureau submitted a report on the issue of female servants through the Bureau to the Consular Body, requesting it be forwarded to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for reference by the League of Nations Slavery Committee. This report stated that the so-called "female servants" were merely one type of women separated from close relatives and employed by other families. Other groups such as adopted daughters, child brides, and countless young female workers were also under the control of others, serving in their households. Furthermore, there were a large number of young girls often transferred by their own parents, leading to their bondage, though not necessarily working in homes. These girls might be sold into prostitution or enter cotton mills to work under the control of intermediaries, with all their wage income being received by the intermediaries for a certain period. As for male children, there were also instances of parents transferring them to factories to learn a trade. These apprentices worked long hours, with the employers providing room and board, but mostly without wages. The food provided by the employers was extremely poor, causing these children to suffer from illnesses due to malnutrition. From this, it can be seen that thousands of children in this port city were separated from their biological families. Although their circumstances differed, their lives were all in the hands of others, and they were often subjected to mistreatment, a truly miserable situation. In view of the complex nature of this issue, the Director of the Industry Department of this Bureau suggested to the Bureau to use all possible means to ensure that cases of child trafficking were reported to the relevant personnel of the Bureau and to establish a "Child Protection Section," with the Director of the Industry Department concurrently serving as the Director of the Section. The Director also requested the Bureau to cooperate closely with Chinese and foreign organizations dedicated to child protection. All of the above suggestions were accepted.

大批孤兒受人利用

Large Numbers of Orphans Being Exploited

自戰事發生以來、本埠有大批孤兒或已入他人掌握之中希受其利用、或有陷于此等地位之虞、最近兩年間、就捕房解送兒童保障科處理之案件而言、因父母死于戰事而被隣人鬻賣之兒童、爲數不少、此外幼年男女、受丐頭之指揮、行乞街頭、亦屬屢見不鮮、本局對於此輩兒童、誠欲一一設法予以保護、然人數旣如此衆多、能力恐有未逮、

Since the outbreak of the war, a large number of orphans in this port city have either fallen into the hands of others with the hope of exploiting them, or are in danger of falling into such a situation. In the past two years, judging from the cases handled by the police station's Child Protection Section, a significant number of children were sold by neighbors due to the death of their parents in the war. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for young boys and girls to beg on the streets under the command of beggar gang leaders. This Bureau sincerely wishes to find ways to protect each and every one of these children, but with such a large number of people, our capabilities may fall short.

地方敎會協助工作

Local Churches Assisting in the Work

本局承認兒童保障科所担任之工作、如欲使社會信任、非先使民衆了解不可、「上海地方敎會」鑒於兒童保障科所任工作之重要、曾聘用社會工作專員一人、襄理該科工作、該會之熱誠、至爲局方所感荷、

This Bureau recognizes that if the work undertaken by the Child Protection Section is to gain social trust, it is essential to first make it understood by the public. Recognizing the importance of the work undertaken by the Child Protection Section, the "Local Churches of Shanghai" have hired a social work specialist to assist the section in its work. The Bureau is extremely grateful for the enthusiasm of the churches.

遭難兒童可分四類

Children in Distress Can Be Divided into Four Categories

查受人剝削之兒童、可分爲下列四類、（一）在家庭環境下者、有婢女·養女•童養媳·及女傭等等、（二）經捕房注意之乞丐·及走失迷路·或無家可歸·或受人遺棄·或被拐離家之兒童等、（三）嚮導員舞女及娼妓等、（四）工廠中僱用之兒童、有在包工制度下之女工及無工資之學徒等、

Upon investigation, children who are exploited can be divided into the following four categories: (1) those in domestic settings, including female servants, adopted daughters, child brides, and female domestic helpers; (2) beggars who come to the attention of the police, children who are lost, homeless, abandoned, or abducted from home; (3) guides, dancing girls, and prostitutes; (4) children employed in factories, including female workers under the contract labor system and unpaid apprentices.

保障工作預定計畫

Planned Child Protection Work

上年初、兒童保陣科主任曾向局方陳稱、上述四類兒童、除第一類外、均可設法尋覓、惟在家庭環境之下者、因情形複維、尋覓不易、保護較難、是以該科先從其他三類着手、俾有成績可觀、並使民衆知悉該科之工作情形、至於婢女問題之處理、尚須從緩、

At the beginning of last year, the Director of the Child Protection Section stated to the Bureau that, apart from the first category, the other three categories of children mentioned above could be located through various means. However, those in domestic settings are difficult to locate and protect due to the complex nature of their circumstances. Therefore, the section would first focus on the other three categories in order to achieve noticeable results and make the public aware of the section's work. As for the handling of the issue of female servants, it would have to be dealt with at a later stage.

案件處理力求適當

Strive for Appropriate Case Handling

上年間、凡經捕房發現之兒童、屬於第二類者、均經該科安置、在該科未成立以前、此等案件、概山捕房送交法院分別發落、據法院之通常辦法、係將若輩分置於某某兩機關、此後若輩之幸福、爲當道所不問、自上年一月份起、該科與本局總裁·曁警務處長商定、嗣後此類事件、當改用社會之手續處理、所有此輩兒童、除須出庭作證者外、不再解送法院、倘有解送之必要、則該科應派代表到庭、陳述其關於處分方法之意見、現在各捕房均照該科所定辦法將男女分送兩臨時收容所、由該科職員每晨前往各該收容所調查案情、並設法安揷、凡來滬覓業而誤入迷途之靑年婦女、一經發現、即山該科辦理、一面竭力助其覓業、一面查訪其親屬、以便通知、經各機關收養之兒童、先受身體檢查、如有必要、即送醫院診視、已達法定結婚年齡之婢女、因不能如願出嫁而脫逃者、由該機關協助成婚其所持理山、爲主婦對於婢女之婚姻、無權干涉、綜觀上年各項工作成績良佳、所經受理案件之性質及其處理之方法、見本報告附錄、

During the past year, all children found by the police station belonging to the second category were placed by the section. Before the establishment of the section, these cases were generally sent by the police station to the court for separate disposition. According to the court's usual practice, these children would be placed in one of two institutions, and their subsequent well-being would be disregarded by the authorities. Since January of last year, the section, in consultation with the Director-General of this Bureau and the Chief of Police, agreed that such cases should be handled using social procedures from then on. All such children would no longer be sent to court, except for those who needed to testify. If it was necessary to send them, the section would send a representative to court to state its opinion on the method of disposition. Currently, all police stations are following the procedures set by the section, sending boys and girls separately to two temporary shelters, where the section's staff visit each shelter every morning to investigate the circumstances of the cases and find ways to place them. Any young women who come to Shanghai to seek employment and accidentally get lost are handled by the section, which makes every effort to help them find employment and locate their relatives in order to notify them. Children adopted by various institutions are first given a physical examination, and if necessary, sent to the hospital for examination. Female servants who have reached the legal marriage age but are unable to marry as desired and escape are assisted by the institution in getting married, on the grounds that the mistress has no right to interfere in the marriage of the female servant. Overall, the results of the past year's work have been excellent. The nature of the cases accepted and the methods of handling them can be found in the appendix to this report.

捕捉丐童免爲匪徒

Catch Beggar Children to Prevent Them from Becoming Bandits

自戰事爆發以後、本埠「兒童保育會」曾設法收容販報男女兒重、予以保護及讀書之機會、並收留大批丐童、兒童保障科有鑒於此、爰於上年八月間商請兩捕房捕捉流浪街頭之丐童、送交該科核辦、迄年終爲止、丐童案件經該科處理者共一二六起、此項工作、雖進行不甚迅速、但希望　後有大批丐童得送交該科處理、就已調查之案件而言、其中能代覓得親友者爲數不少、此類丐童、倘不給以較優之生活、則將來造成歹徒、常可斷言、

Since the outbreak of the war, the "Children's Welfare Association" in this port city has been trying to accommodate and protect boys and girls who sell newspapers, providing them with opportunities for education, and has also taken in a large number of beggar children. In view of this, in August of last year, the Child Protection Section consulted with the two police stations to capture beggar children wandering on the streets and send them to the section for verification. By the end of the year, the section had handled a total of 126 cases of beggar children. Although this work has not progressed very quickly, it is hoped that a large number of beggar children can be sent to the section for processing in the future. As far as the cases that have been investigated are concerned, a considerable number of them have been able to find relatives and friends. It can be confidently asserted that if these beggar children are not given a better life, they will become criminals in the future.

救濟機關均予津貼

Subsidies are Given to Relief Organizations

戰後難童收容所及救濟機關、先後成立、此外尚有專爲難童設立之醫院•肺病療養院、亦已開辦、本局對於下列各機關因其收養兒童保障科所轉送兒童、曾於上年間分別給予津貼、計（一）濟良所與難童收容所五千元、（二）婦孺救濟會一萬五千元、（三）全國中華慈幼協會五千元、此外有仁濟醫院•紅十字會醫院•同仁醫院•及普慈療養院等四家、因與該科合作、亦由木局發給補助金、婦孺救濟會又曾領受自緊急救濟費項下撥給之補助金五千元、該會與全國中華慈幼協會、各經上海難民救濟協會按照收容人數、給予津貼、本局對於難民救濟協會曾於上年前九個月間、補助國幣十萬元、

After the war, refugee children's shelters and relief organizations were established one after another. In addition, hospitals and sanatoriums specializing in refugee children have also been opened. This Bureau has given subsidies to the following organizations in the past year for adopting children transferred by the Child Protection Section: (1) the Jiliang Institute and the Refugee Children's Shelter, 5,000 yuan; (2) the Women and Children Relief Association, 15,000 yuan; (3) the National China Child Welfare Association, 5,000 yuan. In addition, the Renji Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Tongren Hospital, and the Puci Sanatorium, etc., have also been given subsidies by the Bureau for cooperating with the section. The Women and Children Relief Association also received a subsidy of 5,000 yuan from the emergency relief fund. The association and the National China Child Welfare Association were each given subsidies by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association according to the number of people they accommodated. This Bureau subsidized the Refugee Relief Association with 100,000 yuan in national currency for the first nine months of last year.

### 本埠氣温仍高　上海初見瑞雪　高氣壓仍向東西省進行中漢寗亦飛雪平津氣候溫和

### Local Temperature Remains High; Auspicious Snow Seen for the First Time in Shanghai; High Pressure Still Moving Towards the Eastern and Western Provinces; Hanning Also Has Snow; Climate in the Beijing-Tianjin Area is Mild

上海已於昨晨開始飛雪、唯氣候並未酷寒、除上海外、漢口·南京·亦飄揚雪花中、茲分述各情如次、

Shanghai started to have snow yesterday morning, but the climate was not severely cold. In addition to Shanghai, Hankou and Nanjing also had snow. The details are as follows:

首次見雪

First Snowfall

據大通社記者探悉、昨晨本埠雖開始見雪、惟當早晨五六時間之最低溫度、尚在攝氏零上一度八、華氏爲三十五度一、遠較去年冬至前後、受西伯利亞寒流、兩度襲擊時之氣候爲溫和、

According to reports from the Datong News Agency, although the city began to see snow yesterday morning, the lowest temperature at 5 or 6 in the morning was still 1.8 degrees Celsius above zero, or 35.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which is much milder than the climate during the two Siberian cold waves that hit around the winter solstice last year.

寒流所在

Location of the Cold Wave

查西伯利亞高氣壓、仍向東南東進行、故東西省已受寒流影響、查中蘇交界之滿洲里、昨晨氣溫尚在攝氏零下三十一度、吉林溫度亦落至攝氏零下二十八度、

It is noted that the Siberian high pressure is still moving towards the east-southeast, so the eastern and western provinces have been affected by the cold wave. The temperature in Manzhouli, on the Sino-Soviet border, was still minus 31 degrees Celsius yesterday morning, and the temperature in Jilin also dropped to minus 28 degrees Celsius.

平津晴和

Beijing-Tianjin Area Sunny and Mild

寒流如循東南東方向推進、中國北部及長江流域曁上海各地、均可免爲所襲、縱使間接感受影響、惟亦極微細、按昨晨平津天氣、反較上海爲晴暖、

If the cold wave continues to move in the east-southeast direction, northern China, the Yangtze River Basin, and Shanghai will all be spared from its impact. Even if indirectly affected, it would be minimal. According to yesterday morning's weather in Beijing and Tianjin, it was sunny and warmer than Shanghai.

降雪時間

Snowfall Time

本埠昨晨之雪、其始降時間在一時左右、當上午八時許、比較濃密、卒因地面氣候之溫和、未及墮地、即行溶化、故馬路始終未爲雪水所濕潤、午後雪降轉密、馬路爲雪水浸潤、

The snow in this city yesterday morning began to fall around 1 o'clock. Around 8 o'clock in the morning, it was relatively dense. However, due to the mild ground climate, it melted before it could fall to the ground, so the roads were never wet with snow. In the afternoon, the snowfall became denser, and the roads were wet with snow.

According to the English-language "Evening Star," a murder for money case occurred at the "New Government" bar at No. 26 Gongguan Road and Zhubaosan Road this morning (21st). The details are as follows: Greek national 柯索　蒂, 64 years old, has been living in China for almost 40 years and is the manager of the bar. He usually stayed alone upstairs in the bar. At 5:30 AM yesterday, the waiter went to the bar as usual, but there was no response after knocking on the door.

Realizing something was wrong, he immediately notified the owner of the bar, Mr. Hilton, who arrived from his residence at 6 AM. Upon opening the door and entering, he saw Mr. 柯索's body lying in a pool of blood. He reported it to the French Concession police. The police arrived at the scene and found many fingerprints on the cash register. 400-500 yuan from the cash register had been taken by the murderer. There were also fingerprints on the safe and the "slot machine," but no money was lost.

was wearing a bathrobe. He was likely murdered after midnight after opening the door. There was a small box behind the counter containing 700 US dollars and 1,000 Chinese yuan deposited by sailors, which was not robbed. This shows that the murderer was not familiar with the bar's situation. The French police are continuing their investigation into the case.

Father An, a French national and director of the vocational school at the main church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, was suddenly murdered by bandits on August 30 of last year, strangled to death with a rope. The French Concession police dispatched detectives to pursue the criminals. On the evening of September 9, a criminal, a Catholic named Ju Boxu, surrendered himself to the police. Subsequently, based on Ju's confession, Chinese and Western detectives successively arrested four accomplices: Shen Xingtang, Xu Gendi, Wang Rong, and Jiang Yongqing. However, the main culprit, Zhou Yuelou, fled to the guerrilla zone in Pudong and could not be apprehended. Therefore, the police sent Ju and the other four suspects to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As a result, they were prosecuted for crimes such as robbery and murder. After preliminary questioning by Court President Liao Yan, it was deemed that the location where the crime occurred was under Chinese administration before the war, and it was necessary to apply to a higher court for designation of jurisdiction. An order was issued to detain and await a decision to be made at a later date. It is now heard that this case has been designated by the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court, after being transferred from the Third Branch of the Higher Court of the Second Special District, to be accepted and tried by the Second Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Court President Liao of the First Criminal Division ordered Ju Boxu and the other four suspects to be brought in for further questioning. The defendants' statements remained the same as in previous interrogations. The court ruled that further investigation was required into the case and that defense lawyers should be appointed. The hearing was postponed to February 5, and the defendants remained in custody.

At the same time, wartime remedial education for the populace is being promoted in twelve provinces and cities. Guangxi Province has even designated this year as the Year of Adult Education, with full efforts to promote it. Regarding people's schools, regulations for people's schools will be revised within the year, and continuing education will be promoted. Recently, the Ministry of Education submitted to the Executive Yuan a method for mobilizing intellectuals across the country to run people's education. This work should be even more effective.

Yesterday, amid heavy snowfall, the second week of the Scorton Cup football match, Lido against the Survey Team, started at 3:00 PM in the snow at Jiaozhou Park. There were few spectators, greatly reducing the interest. As Lido was the champion of the previous tournament, and also with the might of nine consecutive wins in the A group, it was confident of victory in dealing with the Survey Team, which belonged to the B group. Survey team general Setele was absent due to injury, and Chen's line was even more weakened. Therefore, after contact, Lido controlled the overall situation. However, due to the wet ground and slippery ball, it could not exert its full strength. In the first half, Lido won by two goals. In the second half, after each side scored one goal, the Survey Team lost two more cities in a row. As a result, 5-1, Lido defeated the Survey Team and, like Xifosi, which eliminated St. Francis with 6-2, obtained the right to re-examination. The lineups of the two sides yesterday were as follows:

After twelve minutes, Xu Wenkui broke through alone, straight into the enemy's hinterland, passing to Sun Jinshun. Sun did not hesitate at all, and with a quick leg, the ball flew into the net, opening the record. At 30 minutes, Xu Wenkui made a strange shot from 30 yards away, and the ball was steep and rapid, and the Survey Team fell into another city. At the end of the first half, Lido won by two goals. As the battle resumed, Lido was familiar with the road, Cao Qiuting passed from the edge, Xu Wenkui rushed to the door, gently dialed, the enemy's door broke again, and three passes were made in a row. The Survey Team borrowed one city to get a corner kick opportunity. San Maigengs was the main opener, Lu Zhongen pushed out with both hands, the ball was held by Huiya, passed to Fei Misi Tuo, Fei lifted his foot and hit hard, saving a goal, becoming three to one. Lido continued to attack, and the Survey Team's gate area was in danger. Before long, Cao Qiuting sent a corner kick just right, Jinshun Kehou and others jumped up at the same time, but none of them were hit, and the ball fell beside Qixiang, Wu's side shot angrily, and both hit the target. Finally, Qixiang was assisted by Wenkui and made another contribution. As a result, Lido eliminated the Survey Team 5-1

Business News

### In the Panic of Grain, Flour and Wheat, American Flour and Wheat Will Be Shipped to China in Large Quantities. The US Government Will Subsidize the Sale of Flour and Wheat to China and the Philippines. Flour Mills Are Thinking of Speculation, Which Is Like a Bolt From the Blue

Yesterday, the market situation was still serious. Although the No. 2 flour mill maintained the original price of ten yuan, the restrictions were still strict. Even to the customers, it was still not approved for sale. Although the flour mills have abundant flour stocks, they are unwilling to sell easily to wait for a good price, which has caused the price of recycled flour to reach a new high. According to the current situation in Yantai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, the actual sales are not strong, but because of the relationship of flour for goods, and the deposit of a guarantee deposit in advance, even if the loss of transporting flour is huge, they have to drink poison to quench their thirst. This kind of environment is only seen in the history of the business world. Therefore, once the factory is closed, the high price of the stock orders is repeated endlessly. The transaction volume in the market was about 10,000 bags, excluding the factory's sales balance, and the transaction volume of car and ship recycled goods was less than 10,000 bags. The selling price of Pao Che brand has risen to 11.60 to 6.50 yuan, and the selling price of Bing Chuan brand has risen to 11.45 to 50 yuan. The floating stock of foreign flour has dried up, and the price has been repeatedly speculative. Those who have direct distribution have no formal market. Yesterday, 3,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong, and 500 bags were shipped to Xiamen.

The wheat market is still in a stalemate. The hoarding of goods by the cargo owners is becoming more and more serious, and the purchase of wheat by Japanese flour mills is still continuous, which has caused the market to be secretly hyped again and again. Since the public market price yesterday reached 18.56 yuan, the secret price has reached a new high of 19 yuan. It is found that the current wheat stock in Shanghai is less than 100,000 bags. Although there is wheat stock in the inland, it is all occupied by a certain party, and the source has been disappointed. Fortunately, a telegram came that the US Department of Agriculture will allow subsidies for wheat exports from Pacific ports to Hong Kong and China, and flour exports are also outside the subsidies, in order to eliminate the US surplus wheat of 15 million bushels. With this large amount of flour and wheat supply, and the subsidies from the US government, it can alleviate the hidden worries of China's flour and wheat panic, and can dispel the ambition of flour merchants to manipulate the market. Although far water is difficult to save near fire, if China's flour and wheat are higher, American flour and wheat will be able to give a serious blow. Moreover, China is still repaying the previous cotton and wheat loans on schedule to fulfill its credit.

### Rice Prices Remain Firm, Japanese Buy White Rice in Wuxi

The rice market is still weak due to the weak source of rice from the interior. Yesterday, there were only more than 500 bags of Qingjiao rice transferred from Hongkou. In addition, due to the continued rise in the prices of foreign rice producing areas, tight money, and other issues, the market continued to show a good face. In the morning, there were general inland helpers to buy. Then, the local shops were also interested. For the new arrivals of goods, the capital is heavy. Once someone inquires, the shouts are high. Except for the Chang Kun high-quality goods, which have not been sampled, the medium-quality Su Tong rice is also scarce in the market, with few transactions, and the market has increased by half a yuan. Tongli rice is priced at 40 yuan, and other Qingjiao special thin rice is priced at 39.20 to 39 yuan, which is 1/2 yuan to 6/7 jiao higher than the previous day. According to statistics, the total transaction volume of various goods in the city is about 14,500 bags.

High-end foreign rice is still difficult to transfer, while broken rice continues to become 500 tons, with a price of 33.30 yuan. Fuka also released 100 tons of Tokyo Indica rice, with a price of 32 yuan. Now that the new orders from Saigon are few, the shops and customers are also eating, and the stores are also absorbing. The price is 3/4 jiao higher. The broken rice is also followed by 2/3 jiao, but in addition to the orders that have not arrived, there are still 70,000 bags in stock in the city. There are also 150,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 and 2 rice and Vietnam rice. About 40/500,000 bags of high and sub-grades of foreign rice have arrived or are about to arrive, and broken rice is still being ordered continuously. Therefore, if there is no manipulation outside the orbit of the rice market, it may not be too expensive.

Since the opening of the city gates on the 18th in the Wuxi rice market, and the restoration of water and land transportation, the rice market situation, door sales firms, and companies have replenished japonica rice. The market price has soared. Japanese merchants have also been continuously ordering a large amount of white rice from the firms and factories to transport to Japan for relief, which has broken the price limit of 20.50 yuan per stone for the rice and rice market. 160 catties per city must be 22 yuan, and the source of rice boats is scarce. Some companies that have not made throw goods have to replenish. High-quality white rice is 21.30 yuan per stone, white Duzi Yangjian is 21.30 yuan, brown rice is about 20 yuan, and japonica rice is 10.20 yuan. However, because the distilleries' needs are met, Bai Yuan feels tired of going to waste, and is 22 yuan per stone. Now there are more than 500,000 shi of rice in stock, which can only be sold until the spring. However, the grain in the hands of farmers is quite large in number (Know).

### Finance Idle Foreign Exchange Market; US to Grant New Loans to China; Stabilizing Foreign Exchange

Amidst the quiet, a slight easing was observed, but the results were indistinguishable from the closing price of the day before yesterday. The morning opening was even.

It is generally expected that foreign exchange will tighten, but the British and American exchange rates still fluctuate around five pence and eight yuan. Not only has there been no tightening, but there is a possibility of further easing. This is likely influenced by the new US loan to China. According to financial sources, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, recently signed a US$10 million credit loan with the US government. It is said that part of the new loan will be used to offset previous purchases of American wheat, and the remainder will be used to purchase automobiles. It is also reported that the US government is still negotiating the planned US$100 million credit loan to China and has not changed its original intention due to the European war. Therefore, the shift from stable to loose foreign exchange is inevitable.

Children's Weekly

### How to Develop the Habit of Self-Study

— Wan Wen

It is difficult for children who cannot control themselves to study on their own. Taking the self-study class in school as an example, if there is no teacher monitoring, they will talk loudly and make a mess, disturbing the students who are studying and unable to read. Only when the teacher appears at the door will the sound suddenly quiet down. This bad habit not only wastes precious time but also hinders our future. May I ask if there will always be others to supervise and monitor us in our lives? If we do not have the habit of self-study, we will not know new knowledge and new culture. Only some dead knowledge from the past will be used to deal with the rapidly advancing era, and we will be eliminated as an outdated person. Therefore, starting from today, which is also the beginning of the vacation, it is a good opportunity for us to develop the habit of self-study. Let us make full use of it!

If we study the history of great inventors, great scholars, and great men, we can know that most of them were from poor families and could not afford to go to school. Their knowledge was entirely due to their tireless self-study. Therefore, in addition to enjoying their contributions, we must also imitate their attitude and spirit of self-study. The holiday has begun. According to our needs, we will automatically list the self-study curriculum, choose our favorite books and newspapers according to our interests, make up for the failed subjects, and review the old textbooks to make our knowledge more thorough and our vision wider. However, to form a habit, I think there are several points to pay attention to.

(1) Continue to do it: The most common problem that children have is that they are very happy to do it for the first few days, but after a few days, they become bored and lazy. Not only will they achieve nothing in the future, but all their previous efforts will be wasted.

(2) Do it with all your heart and soul: No matter what you do, you must concentrate to succeed. If you play for a while and talk for a while during (self-study), even if you spend a lot of time, you will not get any benefits.

(3) Do not do it hard: Difficulties are inevitable during self-study. As long as you are not ashamed to ask, ask our parents, sisters, brothers, and classmates. Whoever can solve my difficulties is our teacher. The only teacher who does not speak is the dictionary. We must always be close to it and make it our only friend.

Children, hurry up and do it, and do it practically!

### Heard Fifty Li

— Fei Han

Children! Often when you are talking in the school playground, standing very far apart from each other, you must shout loudly, otherwise you will not be able to hear clearly or even hear at all. If you are farther apart, a mile, several miles, dozens of miles or dozens of miles, then you have to use mail, telephone or telegram to send messages. You think, this is certainly certain.

But in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the air is cold and dry, the power of this air to transmit sound waves is extremely high, fast and far. So in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the sound of ordinary conversations can immediately be transmitted to very fast, very far and invisible places. Some sound waves can travel up to ten miles away; some fifteen miles; and some even up to seventeen miles away, which is more than fifty-four Chinese miles (1 mile = 3.219 Chinese miles). Even the sound of walking on the ground can be heard by people three miles away. If there is a loud bugle sound, it will be heard hundreds of miles away. Therefore, people in the Arctic and Antarctic regions can use very ordinary sounds to talk to each other within fifty miles, without the need for communication devices such as telephones, telegrams, and mail.

Children! Do you find it strange? This is all because the air in the Arctic and Antarctic regions is different from the air in our area!

### New Fables

— Gongchao

In a mountain area of Sichuan, there are many monkeys. How do people capture these monkeys?

A person rocks a boat, mooring it at the foot of the mountain. The boat is covered with things monkeys love to eat, like peaches. The person hides in the boat’s cabin. Before long, the boat deck is hopping with monkeys, big and small, eagerly grabbing the food. Then, the person hiding in the cabin stealthily uses a pole to push the boat away from the shore, further and further out. By the time the monkeys realize what’s happening, the boat is already in the middle of the water.

Knowing they’ve been tricked, the monkeys all desperately try to attack the person. But the person remains calm, holding a knife in one hand and a chicken in the other, with a cage nearby specifically for trapping monkeys. He cuts off the chicken's head with the knife, and fresh blood gushes out. The monkeys, seeing this sight, are terrified and tremble, stopping their attack all at once.

The person then raises the headless chicken high, using the knife tip to threaten the trembling monkeys, forcing them obediently, one by one, into the cage.

Because the monkeys are afraid of blood, they become slaves to humans.

### Erroneous Mentality

— Shushan

Playing mahjong is extremely popular in Shanghai. Whether rich or poor, families use it as a form of entertainment.

After finishing lunch, if there's no desire to go out and just sitting at home feels lonely, people invite Mrs. Zhang from next door, Sister Li... any idle person who has nothing to do after a meal, to make up a table of "mahjong". All the preparations before playing are meticulously arranged by the Ah Ma, and then the sounds of mahjong tiles begin to play. Round after round, people take turns, "playing" tirelessly. Time passes in the "crack, crack" of the mahjong tiles. In the blink of an eye, it's already past four o'clock, and Ah Mao has returned from school with his book bag. They've already played twelve rounds, but still don't want to stop. The losers want to win back their money, while the winners want to win even more. So the game continues, driven by the two parties' completely different desires. As soon as Ah Mao enters the house and hears the sound of the tiles, he quickly drops his book bag and walks to the room where they are playing mahjong. He finds playing mahjong very interesting.

His mother has some small errands to run, so she asks him to play a few rounds for her. He is extremely happy because the last time he played mahjong for his mother, he won a lot of money, and his mother bought him a lot of candy afterward. This time, hearing that he's been asked to play for his mother, he eagerly sits down, because he's been hoping his mother would ask him to play for a long time. While he can't be said to have a deep understanding of mahjong, he is at least very familiar with it. Plus, his luck with the tiles is quite good, and he "wins" several hands in a row, repeatedly being the "dealer". When his mother approaches, he "wins" another hand, a "spicy" three hundred points, and is very excited. Mrs. Zhang even praises him, saying, "Your Ah Mao is truly an experienced mahjong player. After you left, he 'won' several hands." A smile appears on his mother's face, and he is, of course, very proud of himself. He continues "playing" until it's time for dinner, at which point the game stops. This time, he has again won money for his mother. After dinner, he plays for a while, then goes to bed, completely forgetting about his schoolwork.

Children! What do you think of the facts listed above? I think there must be children like this among you. I truly worry about children like Ah Mao because they think playing mahjong is a normal thing. But you should know that even normal things can have extraordinary effects. Ah Mao can be said to be poisoned by mahjong without even knowing it, thinking that winning money for his mother and receiving praise from others is an honor. I can say even more definitively: all children who like to play mahjong definitely don't study hard. Playing mahjong can also cultivate a gambling habit, especially in your childhood. If you develop a gambling habit, it can hinder your career for life! Therefore, I sincerely hope that children who like to play mahjong quickly get rid of this bad habit!

### Black Brothers (2)

— Yimu

Grelle stayed at home, only doing odd jobs, such as when smoking meat in the mansion, he would hold the iron rack and turn it over and over on the fire, but eating smoked meat was also a rare thing, because his two brothers were naturally stingy, treated people very meanly, and were also very calculating with themselves. Most of Grelle's time was always busy polishing shoes, scrubbing floors, and sometimes scrubbing dishes, so what he did was equivalent to the work of a servant.

The situation in this valley and the surrounding area never changed much. Unexpectedly, there came a very rainy summer, and everything in the surrounding villages was ruined. The fodder had not yet been brought in, and was piled high on the threshing floor, when suddenly a flood came and completely washed away the haystacks, which drifted away to the sea. Then came hail, which ruined all the grapes. Not only that, but all the grains were ravaged by a kind of black pest. But strangely enough, only this Hundred Treasures Valley remained peaceful as usual. It rained here, but nowhere else. There was sunshine here, but nowhere else. Because the people in the surrounding villages had no harvest, they all came to the Black Brothers' manor to buy grain. But none of them went without hating them and cursing them, because the two brothers intentionally raised the price, asking for as much as they wanted, not worrying about whether people would buy it or not. The poor people, having no money to buy it, had to beg them for charity, but they refused everything. Even if someone starved to death in front of their door, they would not pay attention.

As winter approached, the weather was very cold. One day, the Black Brothers went out on business. As usual, they warned their younger brother, Little Grelle, not to let anyone into their house and not to take anything out. At that time, Little Grelle was sitting by the fire, busy smoking mutton. It was raining heavily outside, and the walls of the kitchen were damp. He turned the iron rack over and over, and the mutton on it was smoking nicely, turning brown. He thought to himself, "What a pity! Why don't my two brothers invite people to have a meal? They can eat such a big piece of fine mutton, while others don't even have a piece of dry bread to eat. If they came here to eat together, it would be good for their hearts."

As he was thinking this, he suddenly heard two knocks on the door. The sound was very heavy, as if the door knocker was wrapped in cloth. Grelle said to himself, "This must be a gust of wind blowing on the door. No one would dare to knock twice on our door." But listening carefully, it wasn't the wind. There really was someone knocking on the door. This time the knocking was heavier. Listening to the sound, the person was clearly very impatient. Little Grelle walked to the window, opened it, and stuck his head out to see who was knocking.

When he looked, it was a very short and strange-looking gentleman, whom he had never seen in his life. He had a very large nose, slightly bronze in color. His two cheeks were very round and red, as if they had been roasted by the fire for the past forty-eight hours. His two eyes sparkled beneath his fine eyelashes, full of joy. His mustache curled up on both sides of his mouth, round like two corkscrews. His hair was strangely a mixture of salt and pepper, and hung long over his shoulders on both sides. His body was four feet and six inches tall, and he wore a pointed hat, also three or four feet high, with a three-foot-long black feather inserted in it. He wore a tight-fitting coat, with the back protruding, like what is now called a swallowtail coat, and a black and shiny robe over it, which was blown by the wind, fully four times longer than his body.

Little Grelle was stunned when he saw this strange guest, and couldn't say a word. The old gentleman knocked heavily on the door twice more, and turned his head to look at the long robe being blown up by the wind. Just then, he caught sight of Little Grelle's blond head, sticking out of the window, his mouth and eyes wide open. The old gentleman changed his voice and said, "Hello! It's not very polite of you to answer the door like that. Let me in quickly, my clothes are soaked."

Indeed, the old gentleman was really wet from the rain. The black feather on his hat was so wet that it drooped down,夹在两腿之间，好像狗打急了，腿夹着尾巴垂头丧气的样子. The two corners of his mustache were also dripping water, spilling straight into his half-sleeve pocket, and then pouring out like waterwheels in a mill.

Little Grelle hurriedly said, "Sir, I beg your forgiveness, I really can't open the door, I'm very sorry." The old gentleman asked, "Why can't you?" Little Grelle said, "Sir, I can't let you in, really can't. If I do as you say, my two brothers will definitely beat me to death. Sir, what do you want?"

### The Peking Opera Theater in the Wartime Capital of Chongqing

— Zhang Changqiu

Yesterday, a friend sent a letter from Chongqing, detailing the recent situation of Peking Opera in the new capital. Here is an excerpt below to inform our readers. There are several theaters in Chongqing, including theaters for Han Opera, Peking Opera, and movie theaters. The only Peking Opera theater is the Shandong Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, run by Mr. Shan Wang Bosheng. It was originally founded in Shandong by Han Fuju, and moved to Chongqing after the start of the war. It is subsidized by the Shandong government to perform anti-Japanese propaganda plays. All the actors are Bosheng's students. They are usually very diligent, wearing long robes made of blue cloth, with no sign of extravagance. The actors' lives are also very disciplined. In the morning, they take classes, learning about military and political knowledge related to the war of resistance. In the afternoon, they perform from 6:30 to 9:30, only three hours, but the ticket price is as high as one yuan or one yuan and fifty cents, and it is still full every day. The audience is mostly from the upper and middle classes, and there are military police in the audience to maintain order. The actors' stage names are very unfamiliar, and few people in Shanghai know them. The leading female role, Zhao Rongchen, imitates Yu Shuang's vocal style. Her makeup is dignified, her voice is mellow, and her expressions excel at conveying tragic beauty. She is truly a rare talent for female roles in the interior. Yan Fuhua, another leading actress, specializes in Qingyi and Huashan roles. Her voice is very strong, and her makeup is beautiful, but her pronunciation is not accurate enough, and her skills are slightly shallow. Zhao Zhixiang excels at both Qingyi and Xiaosheng roles. His makeup is elegant, his demeanor is refined, and his voice is strong and solid. Cui [blank character] is a Tan school Laosheng, with a slight醇味, but he trembles his voice too much, which is a shortcoming. Tie Zheng specializes in painted face roles, and also Hei Tou roles. He is tall and burly, and his makeup is reminiscent of Shao Shan. His voice is still considered loud. Lin Guiyin specializes in Qingyi and Huashan roles. Her makeup resembles Wan Hua, and although her voice is not bright, it is still sweet and mellow. Her expressions are delicate, and she has some martial arts skills. As for martial arts talents, only Wang Guotian is barely passable. The rest are not worth mentioning. It is rare to see four leading female roles in the same theater.

### Xi Xiaobo Leads a Troupe South

— Wei

New Year Performance at the Golden Theater

Laosheng Xi Xiaobo and Kun Dan Hou Yulan and their troupe will arrive in Shanghai soon. They are here at the invitation of the Golden Theater. Here is a brief introduction to the troupe:

Xi Xiaobo is one of the best rising Laosheng actors in recent years. Xiaobo was originally a famous amateur actor in the old capital, learning from Yan San. However, his voice is far superior to Jupeng. He was soon appreciated by 梅大王, who invited him to collaborate. He has been Mei Lanfang's Laosheng partner in recent years, and has performed with Mei in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hanzhou, and other places, receiving great praise. In recent years, Lanfang has been living as a recluse in Hong Kong. Xi returned north and became a student of Li Hongchun, forming his own troupe. In recent years, Xiaobo has also privately studied Wen Ru, taking the best aspects of both Yan and Ma. In addition, his voice is far superior to Yan and Ma. Therefore, he has been able to attract a large audience in Beijing. It is expected that his return to Shanghai will be even more精彩.

Hou Yulan In the past two years, many northern Kun Dan actresses have come to perform in the south, but Yulan is the one who has received the most praise from the public. Yulan is a high-achieving student of the [blank character] Opera School. Her reputation and status at school were not as high as Zhao Jinrong, but after leaving school, Yulan's skills have surpassed Jinrong's. Last year, Yan Jupeng went south and chose Yulan instead of Jinrong to come with him. Sure enough, she became famous overnight. Yulan can be said to be one of the most successful students from the Opera School to come to the south. (She is also one of the first students from the Opera School to come to the south.) After Yulan returned north with honor from Shanghai, she was hired by Xi Xiaobo. Yulan is willing to live under someone else's roof, without pursuing vanity, and to build her own army. She is truly admirable.

Ru Fuhui is an outstanding talent in the clown role from Fu Liancheng. He is skilled at mimicking Xiao Changhua. His reading and performance resemble Old Xiao. He excels at Fangjin clown plays. His voice is loud, and his performance is proper. Compared to Ma Fulu, Ma excels at humorous clown plays, but his Fangjin clown plays are far inferior to Fuhui. Fuhui previously came to Shanghai with Tan Fuying, and his performance was excellent. Laosheng plays must have actors like Fuhui to配, in order to be just right. This time, with Xiaobo coming south and with Fuhui in the troupe, it will surely have the effect of green leaves setting off a peony.

Chen Shengtai This person has never been to Shanghai. He is the only Xiaosheng actor from the fourth class of Fu Liancheng besides Ye Shenglan. He once replaced Jin Zhongren and collaborated with Xun Huisheng. His skills are characterized by stability. In addition to the above-mentioned people, there are also Wang Shaoting, Qiu Shengrong, Gao Shenglin, and others. Wang is 梅蘭芳's old partner, and is a top-notch Lizilaosheng. Qiu and Gao have not performed in Shanghai for long, and people in Shanghai should remember them. I will not repeat them here.

### Art World News

(1) Amateur photographer Huang Ningmin has been studying black and white photography for many years, with no less than thousands of works, which have been published in various publications.

### Pot-bellied Stories

— Su Shaoqing

Red-Haired Devil Liu Tang for the Misunderstanding of the Eight-Foot Leg (Part 2)

Liu Tang was originally short in the legs, but was mistaken for being red-haired, and called a devil. It is an injustice. This mistake was a mistake in the "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" at the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (this book is a copy of a street story), and the "Water Margin" did not change it because of this. Now, storytellers and opera performers all follow the "Water Margin". Later, I hope that the image of Liu Tang on the opera stage will be changed to the shape of the eight-foot leg, but it is difficult to reverse a long-standing situation and it is difficult to change customs. I wrote this article, fearing it would be in vain. Also, White Streak in the Waves Zhang Shun, White Streak mistaken for White Leg; Boat Fireboy Zhang Heng, mistaken for Fireboat Worker Zhang Cen; Golden Spear Class Xu Ning, mistaken for Golden Spearhand; Jade Unicorn Lu Junyi's name mistaken for Li Jinyi; Dragon in the River Li Jun's name mistaken for Li Hai; Match Guan Suo Yang Xiong, mistaken for Wang Xiong. The "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" is later than the "癸辛雜識" ("Miscellaneous Records of Guixin") (the one I have is a Called Edition), so I believe in Zhou Mi's record. Moreover, Mr. Zhou was a well-known erudite scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty, while the author of "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" lost his name and was just a street storyteller. By comparison, it can be concluded. Also, according to "癸辛雜識", there are thirty-six people (that is, commonly known as Heavenly Stars), including Double-Headed Snake Xie Zhen, Double-Tailed Scorpion Xie Bao, Cloud Dragon Gongsun Sheng, and Cloud Touching Du Qian. In "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe", there are no Xie Zhen and Xie Bao in the names of the thirty-six generals, but there are Gongsun Sheng and Du Qian. This is another difference.

### A Cross-Section of Germany's Economic Warfare

— Duxing

The effect of the anti-blockade war is only so-so, and there is no guarantee of the support of neutral countries. It is also quite difficult to obtain supplies from the Soviet Union.

The strategy of the Western European democracies against Germany, in addition to the so-called war of nerves and propaganda war, is mainly economic warfare. Germany's method of dealing with this is the anti-blockade war.

Germany's Continental Policy

However, the so-called blockade and anti-blockade wars are only one aspect of economic warfare. Another important aspect is the efforts of both belligerent countries to win the sympathy of neutral countries. Looking at just the corner of the European continent, Germany seems to be copying Napoleon's "Continental Policy" this time in order to deal with Britain. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, Germany placed Baltic shipping under its control, and further attempted to cut off the exports of the Scandinavian countries to Britain. During the war, Hitler recklessly sank neutral ships in an attempt to force Sweden, Norway, and Finland to submit, so that the Baltic Sea's commerce would use the Kiel Canal as its port. However, because the Scandinavian countries were unwilling to abandon their Western European customers, and because Germany was unable to supply them with the goods and raw materials they needed, and because they had to export to Western Europe in order to obtain what they needed, Germany was unable to achieve its wishes. At the same time, even if Germany achieved cutting off Scandinavia's business relationship with Western Europe, their production would stagnate and they would be unable to supply Germany with the products and minerals it needed.

Attitudes of the Nordic Countries

While the Baltic Sea is being controlled by Germany for its exports, it is also being monitored by major countries for its imports. All incoming ships must be inspected by the British Navy. Although Britain's attempt to prevent neutral ships from transporting raw materials to Germany inevitably causes friction with the interests of neutral countries, neutral ships seem happy to accept Britain's inspection. This attitude has greatly angered Germany, which has repeatedly protested this "violation of neutrality" and regarded it as a hostile act. However, unless Germany risks invading the small Nordic countries, it will not be able to call on them to take the same action as it to resist the British blockade. It should be known that overseas trade is the economic lifeline of the small Nordic countries. If Britain controls maritime traffic, they cannot accept Germany's protection.

Competition in Southeastern Europe

As for the position of Southeastern Europe, it should be discussed separately. Germany occupies a position of economic leadership in this region, just as Britain does in Northwestern Europe. Although Britain does not have maritime fortifications to prevent this, it is not easy for Germany to have all the oil, minerals, and food of the Balkan Peninsula countries transported north in a steady stream. First, Germany owes these countries a large amount of money, which it has not yet been able to repay. Naturally, they demand that Germany repay its debts before they are willing to export raw materials and food to it. Second, Britain and France are now buying goods from the Balkan Peninsula countries with cash, making them more demanding towards Germany. Third, Germany can only use goods to represent cash, while the Balkan countries need industrial raw materials, which Germany lacks.

Soviet Support

What Germany is urgently striving for now is raw materials and food. It is working hard on the anti-blockade in order to solve the acquisition of these two factors. After years of preparation, there may not be a panic about food for the time being, but the shortage of military raw materials is an undeniable fact. Regarding obtaining supplies from the Soviet Union, there are also limitations. First, because the Soviet Union's main war resources, such as oil, the Soviet Union does not have a large amount of exports that can be supplied to other countries. Second, what the Soviet Union needs is heavy industrial machinery for its domestic production and construction, and Germany does not have the ability to supply a large amount of it in exchange for Soviet raw materials. Therefore, in fact, there is not much help. Furthermore, Germany feels panicked by the lack of locomotives, and the goods to be transported are piling up. This factor is enough to prove that it is quite difficult to obtain supplies from the Soviet Union.

Contemporary Biographical Sketches

### General Chen Yi, Active on the Jiangnan Battlefield

— Jiang Di

General Chen Yi, currently the commander of the First Detachment of the New Fourth Army, has directly shouldered the responsibility of commanding operations on the front lines of Jiangnan for over a year. He laid the foundation for guerrilla warfare for the New Fourth Army in arduous circumstances, causing the [Japanese] to suffer significant losses and preventing them from doing whatever they wanted in this beautiful land of Jiangnan. This is undoubtedly due to General Chen and the soldiers under his command.

General Chen is from Leshan, Sichuan, and is thirty-nine years old this year. His family was that of bankrupt landlords, so he received a higher education. After the European War, he went to France to study, working while studying and completing his studies. During these years, his thinking was gradually influenced by Marxism, leading him to embark on the path of revolution later on.

In 1923, General Chen returned to China after completing his studies, returning to the embrace of his motherland. In Beijing, he actively participated in the cultural movement. The following year, he officially joined the Communist Party and worked for the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang. Later, with the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, because General Chen was a Sichuanese, he carried an important mission back to Sichuan to contact senior Sichuanese generals such as Liu Xiang and Yang Sen, to respond to the Northern Expedition. It wasn't until the Chongqing Incident in March 1927, when Sichuanese warlords began to massacre revolutionaries, that he quietly escaped to Hankou and was reassigned as the party secretary of the Central Military Academy. After the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, he followed Generals Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Ye Ting, and others, fighting on the battlefields and participating in several perilous major battles. He was even wounded in the Xingguo campaign in June 1934, and the injury has not fully healed to this day. After the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out on July 7th, General Chen believed that the opportunity to serve the country had arrived. He went to various guerrilla areas to contact and concentrate troops in preparation for fighting for the country. Later, it was decided to establish the New Fourth Army, and he was ordered to concentrate the guerrilla forces scattered in seven provinces and reorganize them. At that time, he was appointed as the commander of the First Detachment, and the day before last year, he arrived on the Jiangnan battlefield.

General Chen has a very tall and sturdy physique, with sharply raised eyebrows and a very heroic appearance. His voice is not very loud when he speaks, but it is powerful and well-organized, able to grasp the core. Moreover, his speech is interspersed with some crisp phrases, making people not feel bored listening to him. He once persuaded a group of stubborn warlords and bureaucrats in a historical negotiation. Recently, he also persuaded a man who was about to defect, and who many people objectively said had already defected—a gentleman with several tens of thousands of fortunes. It can be seen that his eloquence is very good.

General Chen has a high level of knowledge, so his literary achievements are also multifaceted. He often writes novels, essays, and poems after battles, and especially likes to write ancient-style poems. Because his themes are all realistic and stimulating, they have won the love of most people. In a certain civil war, in an extremely dangerous situation, he wrote a "beheading poem" to express his feelings. The poem reads: "What is the intention of the neck being severed today? Founding a career is difficult with many battles. Going to the spring terrace to gather old troops, a hundred thousand heroic ghosts will behead Yama." After he led his troops to Jiangnan and fought with the [Japanese] for the first time, he also composed a poem as above, truly worthy of being a dashing Confucian general.

### Crabs and Floods

— Yao

"Crabs and floods" may seem irrelevant at first glance, and linking them together may seem almost comical, but in reality, it contains a profound truth. According to the research of Dutch hydraulic expert Von Enlermon, crabs and floods are closely related. The reason is that crabs often dig holes under river embankments to live in, causing the embankments to gradually collapse, resulting in floods and major disasters. He also said that the main cause of floods in various countries throughout history is this point. In other words, every time a flood occurs, the culprit is the "crab general" that moves sideways. According to textual research experts, with the progress of the times and the civilization of society, today's crabs are much smarter than before. No matter how solid the river embankments are, they can destroy and collapse them. The frequent occurrence of floods in recent years is solely due to this. This is truly a terrible phenomenon for our human society.

### Clever Couplet

— Zhou Jintao

I traveled in the Southwest for six months and recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to reports, the morale of the people in the rear is stable and their fighting spirit is strong, beyond what outsiders can imagine. Although enemy planes are rampant, people have become accustomed to it over time. There are many air raid shelters in Chongqing. When an air raid alarm sounds, residents calmly enter them. At the entrance of a large air raid shelter, someone, I don't know who, used a small knife to carve a clever couplet: "Act according to the situation; rest in peace after death." Both lines are idioms, readily available and forming a beautiful structure, which is enough to show composure.

### Schools for the Elderly

— Ju

Most schools are established for young people. Who would have known that there is a school in the world established for the elderly.

The school for the elderly is in Oklahoma, USA. There are nearly a thousand students, all of whom are over seventy years old—all old men with childlike hearts.

The principal is younger than the students, only seventy years old, but many of the students are over a hundred years old!

The school does not charge tuition fees. The only requirement is that students must be over seventy years old to enroll. The school's facilities are very complete. The principal often gives lectures to the students, and the students often give speeches, sing, tell stories, and play various games on their own. They often retell their past trivial matters to everyone, evoking everyone's cherished childhood memories.

Their common hobbies are growing flowers, reading novels, drawing pictures, and studying music. Each person has their own fun, and they live very comfortably.

### Notes on Minor Matters

More minerals have been mined in the 20th century than in all of history up to 1900.

The world's largest wool market is in Sydney, Australia.

Venice is a water city made up of 177 islands connected by 378 bridges.

The world's smallest public library is in Alabama. This library is only eight feet long and seven and a half feet wide, with a collection of 250 books. The librarian is a volunteer who rotates among some citizens.

London publishes a total of nine million morning newspapers every day, while New York only publishes three and a half million morning newspapers every day.

The giraffe has the longest neck among animals, but its vertebrae only number seven, which is half the number of vertebrae in ordinary birds.

It takes 60,000 gallons of water to make one ton of paper.

There is a huge amount of salt hidden in seawater. If all these salts were piled together, its volume would be at least 4.8 million cubic miles.

Male Lack of Sexual Desire Is Not Necessarily a Pathological Condition

It is often said that a male’s lack of sexual desire is a pathological condition. Some even say that a decrease in a man’s sexual desire can indicate the end of his life! These are shocking fallacies whose purpose is none other than to encourage people to indulge in excessive sexual activity, and their harm is greater than killing with knives and guns!

Our argument: A male's lack of sexual desire is not necessarily a pathological condition. This is because for talented men after marriage, the desire for career often outweighs that for love. Or, because their moral character is gradually cultivated, or because their spouse is not satisfied with them, they may gradually develop a sense of indifference towards sexual desire. However, this does not mean that they are weak or incompetent. This is because, on beautiful nights, when they are in high spirits; or when the couple is happy and playing around, they will surely show their vigor and magnificence, both to delight their own hearts and to comfort the deep and passionate affection hidden in the heart of the beauty. Therefore, this kind of man not only does not hinder love, but also helps love to live eternally!

However, some men who have committed self-abuse, nocturnal emission, early marriage, and rampant indulgence in their early years have greatly depleted their reproductive glands' secretions (i.e., semen). Then, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, thin semen and infertility, kidney deficiency and brain weakness, and neurasthenia will be endless. This kind of man often has two different manifestations: one is that they cannot find pleasure in sexual life, feel tired of life, and fall into a pessimistic plight, resulting in a lack of sexual desire, which is certainly a pathological condition; the other is that they become excessively lustful due to physical deficiencies. In the long nights of winter, they frequently try to arouse their wives' excitement, but in real sexual life, they are like a flash in the pan, or even completely incapable of performing. How can this not arouse their wives' hatred? Therefore, marital discord, the breakdown of love, and the emergence of elopement, divorce, and other family tragedies are often heard; or the symptoms worsen, leading to premature aging and death.

The above-mentioned symptoms should not be confused with a lack of sexual desire, and thorough treatment must be given as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences! The method of treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhishengsu" is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented the earliest, is supervised the most carefully, and contains precious ingredients, including cruciform crystals of gonadal hormones, pituitary gland crystals, deer antler essence, vitamins, and more. Therefore, its efficacy is real, and its restorative power is great, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking it, it can produce essence and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood within one day and night. Continuous use will further promote adolescence, nourish the nerves, and adjust metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms will surely be cured invisibly in a short period of time, and the energy can be increased and enriched. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate! However, those who suffer from nocturnal emission must also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian" (available at Wuzhou Taihe, Xihua, Yingdeng and other major pharmacies, priced at two yuan per box) to strengthen the essence gate and prevent leakage. Then, opening up sources and reducing expenditure will yield quick results.

Patient Li Jianfei, a native of Hunan, 30 years old, married for ten years, suffered from nocturnal emission, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, lack of children, neurasthenia and other symptoms. Although he repeatedly took over-the-counter drugs on the market, they had little effect. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and a friend urged him to go to Hong Kong to work, but he was prevented by illness and was extremely anxious! (The above is self-reported) Last month, he came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, we learned that they matched what he said. We ordered him to purchase two dozen "Shengzhishengsu" and one dozen "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian," so that he could take both concurrently, and administered electrotherapy every other day. In just one month, all his illnesses disappeared, his face turned rosy, his energy was abundant, and his love for his wife was even deeper. It is said that he will take his family to Hong Kong to take up his new position, so in the warm and beautiful southern country, there will be another sweet couple!

### Young People Suffering from Nocturnal Emission Cannot Enjoy a Happy Life

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Everyone knows that nocturnal emission is a symbol of physical weakness. If young people suffering from nocturnal emission continue to delay treatment, the degree of weakness will inevitably increase rapidly. The most terrible thing is the brain weakness and kidney deficiency caused by nocturnal emission!

The semen in a man's body is like the oil in a machine, which can lubricate various functions and make them active. The desire for sexual love, in particular, is caused by the activity of semen (i.e., gonadal secretion). Therefore, they choose their spouse enthusiastically, talk about love, get married, have children, and organize a family... opening the brilliant flowers of life and enjoying the infinite happiness of life! If a man suffers from kidney deficiency due to untreated nocturnal emission, then premature ejaculation and impotence will inevitably follow; or nocturnal emission weakens the developmental function. Although they are adults, their sexual organs are still as delicate as children; or their semen is thin, resulting in prolonged infertility. All these symptoms make it difficult to enjoy the joy of newlyweds, let alone the happiness of life. How many young people in the world have lost love and happiness due to this, falling into the tragic situation of the world? There are also many who suffer from weakness and insomnia due to nocturnal emission, affecting their studies and careers, and regretting it in their old age, or even dying young!

The only effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian." This medicine can indeed strengthen the essence gate and calm the nerves. After taking it, you can achieve the effect of sleep and stopping nocturnal emission on a regular night. However, when purchasing the medicine, patients must recognize the words "Ximituoshi..." to avoid being confused by miscellaneous medicines and delaying treatment. For those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission, they must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhishengsu" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves. Continuous use for one month can increase body weight, strengthen energy, and eliminate all diseases invisibly. In addition to taking the above-mentioned good medicines, if patients can come to our clinic to receive new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Remedial Measures for Imperfect Breasts

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Tram tracks engraved on the forehead,
Breasts like empty purses.
No matter how well these women dress up,
Men will still shake their heads.

You should not underestimate a woman's pair of breasts in front of her chest. They truly have infinite magic and precious value. Frankly speaking, the higher and more elastic a woman's breasts are, the more they can fully set off her plump hips and graceful waist, forming a beautiful curve that makes people intoxicated with admiration. At the same time, due to the health of their own ovarian function and the exuberance of metabolism, their temperament is invariably kind and gentle, their skin is invariably crystal clear and white, and their cheeks are invariably rosy and delicate. Such a girl, not only in her virgin era—it can also be said in her school days, because of her superhuman intelligence and character, can be at the top of her class, be the most outstanding student, and be loved by teachers, elders, relatives, and friends. Even once she is married, with these beautiful qualities, won't her husband obey her every word and treat her like a treasure?

However, facts tell us that such women are also the most difficult to find. The only main reason is that women have various physiological differences, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, many women of beautiful age have many tram tracks engraved on their foreheads, rough skin, and are skinny, and what is especially hard to learn is a pair of breasts, like two dry and瘪的 purses. Such women, even if they are covered in makeup and parade around the streets, are not sneered at by men. If you want to seek a remedy, the most practical and reliable way is to take the female gonadal ovarian preparation "Shengzhishengsu" as soon as possible. The main reason for breast atrophy and loss of beauty is that the ovarian function of the gonads is destroyed by irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, multiple births and weakness, malnutrition and other symptoms. After taking the female "Shengzhishengsu", the ovarian function can be cultivated and replenished overnight, metabolism can be stimulated, menstruation can be adjusted, and the palace can be warmed and the discharge can be stopped. If you continue to take it, not only can you cure various symptoms, but also make the breasts high, the hips plump, rosy, and stay young forever.
