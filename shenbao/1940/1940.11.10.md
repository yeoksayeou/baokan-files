Editorial: Further Discussion on the War in Greece

Italy launched its attack on Greece on the morning of October 28th. To this day, thirteen days have passed, and in military terms, there has been virtually no progress. The forces of both sides remain deadlocked along the border between Albania and Greece. If one were to measure this against Germany's speed in defeating Poland in eighteen days, it is hard not to feel that the Blackshirt army pales in comparison.

Greece is situated at the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, with a small territory, a small population, and limited military strength. Although it borders Turkey, the only connection between them is a narrow strip of land threatened by both Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Although Britain is determined to provide assistance, it is hindered by the great distance. Therefore, Greece is undoubtedly the weakest link in the Balkan Peninsula, and it was expected that it would be the first target of the Blackshirt Prime Minister's advance eastward. It is remembered that as far back as late September, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop went to Rome to talk with Italian authorities, preparing for the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass, Reuters issued a news item stating that Germany had decided to allow Italy to freely attack Greece while the war in Egypt continued. At that time, although the general public believed that this was possible, they still felt that the Soviet Union's "concern" and Turkey's "vigilance" were major obstacles. The fact that the Blackshirt army delayed its move for a month was probably due to its efforts to remove or neutralize these obstacles through means other than war. Observing the Soviet Union's silence and Turkey's neutrality after the outbreak of the Greek war, it seems that the goal of "neutralizing these obstacles" has been achieved. However, even without the hindrance of the Soviet Union and Turkey, this Italian offensive must achieve the condition of a swift and decisive victory to meet the current needs of the Axis powers. If it is prolonged, and even requires the help of other forces, it will not only backfire and damage Italy's prestige, but also be detrimental to the progress of the war against Britain. Because a lengthened front would disperse military strength, which would be a minor concern for Britain, but not for Germany and Italy. Moreover, as far as Italy is concerned, in the future, when dealing with the joint operations of Britain and Greece, not only will it have to occupy a significant portion of its naval, land, and air forces, affecting its operations in Egypt, but it will also have to constantly guard against the threats that the British Air Force and the British fleet could pose to mainland Italy or its island possessions! For example, British aircraft used to fly from Malta to bomb the port of Brindisi in southern Italy, a distance of 360 miles. If they were to take off from northern Greece in the future, it would be no more than 200 miles at most. If the British Navy were to use the Greek island of Crete as a base in the future, it would be able to unite the two strongholds of Cyprus and Alexandria to form a mutually supportive triangle in the eastern Mediterranean, which would not only further strike at Italy's and East Africa's lines of communication, but also directly attack the Italian-owned Dodecanese islands at the mouth of the Aegean Sea. In this way, I am afraid that the goal will not be achieved, but instead will be harmed by its own actions.

What is even more frightening is if the war against Greece drags on. The Soviet Union, which was originally silent, may no longer remain silent one day, and those who were originally neutral may be eager to try. Did not Kalinin, in his speech to the Supreme Soviet, already state that the Soviet Union "cannot continue to stand in an impartial and calm position with regard to all developments in the international situation"? Although there is no lack of ambiguity, it is at least a powerful warning. As for Turkey, it was originally only expressing sympathy and neutrality towards Greece, but didn't President Inonu, in his tough speech to the National Assembly the other day, explicitly state that he "recognizes Britain as an ally and Greece as a friendly nation"? Moreover, in reality, Turkey has been actively preparing for war, mobilizing twenty classes of reservists to prepare for the necessary.

Therefore, the focus of the problem has returned to the application of the Tripartite Pact: if this has not yet become a waste of paper, then at least Germany should send troops to assist Italy in order to quickly defeat Greece and implement the Axis powers' established policy of advancing towards the Near East or Africa. However, German assistance is not entirely simple: first, if Hitler directly sends troops to help Italy attack Greece, it would be tantamount to proving the incompetence of Italy's Blackshirt army. In the future, the so-called co-leadership of the new European order will be nothing more than a name, and it will become a one-sided German world, which may not be the reward that Mussolini is willing to accept by risking the notoriety of participating in the war. Second, if Italy agrees to German assistance, German troops must pass through Yugoslavia or Bulgaria to go south. At that time, it is a big question whether the Soviet Union and Turkey can turn a blind eye to this, because until now, the reserved attitude of the Soviet Union and Turkey, although tacit, was clearly obtained by Germany and Italy in exchange for some kind of guarantee. If Germany's actions go beyond this guarantee, the Soviet Union will naturally have to reconsider its future attitude. Some say that Germany may even sacrifice Turkey to gain the Soviet Union's non-intervention. For example, the rumors a few days ago that Germany was willing to give the Asian part of Turkey to the Soviet Union and the European part to Bulgaria in exchange for the Soviet Union's understanding is one example. However, regardless of whether the Soviet Union agrees, there is no doubt that Turkey will resist, which will only further promote the united front of Britain, Turkey, Greece, and even the Islamic countries? Third, of course, in addition to directly assisting Italy, Germany can also use other methods to contain Britain. For example, the recent resurgence of submarine warfare in the Atlantic and the rumors of Spain's participation in the war after annexing the neutral zone of Tangier somewhat imply that Germany is responding to Italy in the west. However, with Spain's attitude still unclear and the United States' aid to Britain becoming increasingly active, if this kind of containment by Germany does not achieve greater success, it may not be easy to immediately affect Britain's combat power in the eastern Mediterranean for a while.

In summary, Italy's plan to attack Greece has clearly fallen into a stalemate. Of course, Hitler's methods are swift and mysterious, and he may still have other cards to play in the future, but judging the matter as it stands, it can at least be said that the blitzkrieg to invade Greece has encountered an initial setback.

Roosevelt Announces Increased US Assistance to Britain; Military Supplies to Be Split Evenly Between the US, Britain, and Canada; Approval to Be Given to Britain to Purchase 12,000 Aircraft; US and Mexico to Conduct Joint Defense Talks; Washington

President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the United States and Mexico are currently conducting joint defense talks. From now on, Britain will obtain 50% of the aircraft and munitions produced in the United States. At the same time, the Supreme Commission also declared that the authorities will allow the British Purchasing Commission to conduct purchase negotiations for 12,000 American aircraft. This announcement by the President was made after a two-hour and fifteen-minute meeting with the National Defense Committee. It is expected that as a result of this decision, the United States' plan to increase assistance to Britain will be implemented immediately. The High Commission convened a general meeting to discuss how the United States can assist Britain without hindering its own national defense program. President Roosevelt stated that the aircraft sold by the United States will include the Army's giant "Flying Fortress" aircraft. The President also stated that this assistance to Britain has begun in the past four weeks, but he solemnly clarified that the plan can be changed at any time. It is reported that the United States previously sold 45% of its aircraft and munitions to Britain, so the current decision only increases that percentage by 5. Roosevelt also stated that the "Flying Fortress" aircraft will be quickly shipped to Britain. It is generally believed that this statement by the President actually indicates that the United States will sell other new military supplies to Britain from now on, and is not limited to the "Flying Fortress" aircraft alone.

They will suggest restoring the credit system of the First World War. The opinions of those who oppose loans to countries that have not paid their war debts are expected to change. Therefore, the European war is considered to be a continuation of the war that began in 1914. (Eighth Dispatch, International News Service)

Philippine Iron Ore to Be Incorporated into US Undertakings; Additional Naval Shipyards to Be Established on the Northwest Coast; At the Same Time, Philippine Iron Transport to Japan Can Be Prevented; Washington

Government economic circles predicted yesterday that the iron ore in the Philippines will inevitably be incorporated into the scope of the steel industry on the west coast of the United States, because President Roosevelt has issued a statement saying that the government will continue to encourage the establishment of a steel manufacturing industry on the west coast. President Roosevelt also told reporters that the government has taken all measures to encourage the development of the steel industry in the northwest coastal area, so that the authorities can establish several large-scale naval shipyards there. Roosevelt also plans to establish a shipyard on the Columbia River. According to him, the supply of lead for the aircraft factories in the western region has been discovered nearby. He also stated that there will be similar developments in the steel industry. Economic experts who have always predicted that Philippine vaccines are very likely to be incorporated into the United States recently admitted that this may be a solution. They said that high-quality iron seedlings in Surigao can be transported to the United States across the Pacific Ocean at a lower price than vaccines taken from the western inland areas. Officials also said that this action can also solve the problem of Philippine iron being transported to Japan, which the US government has always wanted to prevent. If the American market can absorb the Philippine output, whether it is for current needs or stored for future use, this absorption can offset exports to Japan. (Ninth Dispatch, United Press)

He said, "I personally strongly advocate increasing aircraft production, because this is the most important thing in national defense. I dare say that unless the British Air Force is defeated, Germany will never have the hope of invading the British Isles." He also said, "I firmly believe that the United States should stay out of the war, and it is unacceptable to enter the war through the front door, back door, or side door." He also denied his resignation, saying that unless the situation is urgent, he will return to England before Christmas. (Ninth Dispatch, Taiwan News Agency)

US and Japan Compete to Purchase Rubber in the Dutch East Indies; Batavia

The rubber market in the Dutch East Indies is experiencing booming business due to competition from the United States and Japan. According to official statistics, the United States purchased 245,319 tons of unrefined rubber from the Dutch East Indies between January and September of this year, compared to only 129,100 tons during the same period last year. By the end of this year, the United States will probably purchase another 150,000 tons, so the total amount purchased by the United States throughout the year will exceed 350,000 tons, more than double last year. Businessmen estimate that the total output of rubber in the Dutch East Indies this year will be approximately 530,000 tons, of which 64% will be exported to the United States.

On November 7, 5,000 Soviet warplanes of various types held inspections and demonstrations in Moscow, Riga, Lviv, Taimyr, Chernivtsi, Voronezh, Kiev, Odessa, Anqingir, Fanburg, and other cities. The pilots' skills were pure and orderly. The public greatly appreciated these new-style military aircraft. As for high-speed giant bombers, they also soared through the sky. The Soviet people expressed their highest respect to Stalin's Air Force and the glorious socialist aircraft manufacturers. In cities such as Leningrad, the inspections were not held due to inclement weather. However, the total number of demonstration aircraft could reach 8,000. (Ninth Dispatch, TASS)

To commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, military parades and powerful demonstrations were held throughout the country. The Soviet people unanimously expressed their loyalty to the government, the Communist Party, and national leader Stalin, as well as their spiritual and political unity. At the same time, they also reported to the government and the Communist Party on their economic and cultural victories. In addition to supporting the wise foreign policy of General Stalin (that is, the policy of peace and safeguarding national security), the working masses also vowed to strengthen national defense with greater efforts, provide the Red Army with new weapons, and be ready to rise up to defend the Soviet borders under the orders of the government and the party. A total of 6,455,000 people participated in the demonstrations, including 1,600,000 in Moscow, 1,300,000 in Leningrad, 500,000 in Baku, 500,000 in Kiev, 300,000 each in Tbilisi and Kharkov, 250,000 each in Gorky and Dnepropetrovsk, 200,000 in Tashkent, and 150,000 in Stalinini. As for the new republics, such as Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, and Northern Bukovina, the emotions were enthusiastic.

Talk of Opening the Pearl River Not Yet Confirmed; Hong Kong

Shipping circles here today did not comment on news from Guangzhou that the Japanese are preparing to reopen the Pearl River on a limited basis. As of last night, the news had not been officially confirmed. A few shipping circles said that the rumor of "opening" the Pearl River may also be an "empty gesture." One shipping company said, "Since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou in October 1938, the river has never really been opened. The Japanese 'open' the Pearl River from time to time, but they attach all sorts of restrictive conditions, making the action merely an illusion. Therefore, we will not believe it until the river is truly opened." On the other hand, it is believed that the Japanese decision may indeed be to open the Pearl River to appease Britain so that Britain will not form a joint defense line with the United States in the Pacific. People on this side said that Japan's preparations to reopen the Pearl River route are enough to show Japan's attitude towards Britain. It is said that this action by Japan may be an expression of gratitude for Britain's transport of lead to Japan from Hong Kong. People here even believe that Japan has become increasingly friendly with Britain, and the cancellation of the forced evacuation of Japanese women and children from Hong Kong is clear evidence of this. The Chinese side here believes that the river will be reopened, because the Japanese hope to use Hong Kong Indian merchants to transport raw silk from Guangzhou to India. (Ninth Dispatch, United Press)

Hong Kong

Regarding the Japanese authorities' reopening of the Pearl River, doubts have resurfaced today because of the restrictions placed on it. All ships sailing the river believe that under these circumstances, Pearl River navigation cannot actually be restored. According to the Japanese Consul General, the Pearl River will be "half-opened," and each ship will only be allowed to carry 100 passengers. Passengers must also carry a doctor's certificate of immunity, otherwise they will need to be immunized upon arrival in Guangzhou. Shipping companies stated today that, given this situation, they all have doubts about resuming navigation. (Ninth Dispatch, United Press)

Hitler Delivers Speech: Will Fight Britain to the End; Commemoration Ceremony Held on the Eve of the Nazi Party's Uprising; Munich Beer Hall; Munich

On November 9, the eve of the Nazi Party's 1923 uprising, Führer Hitler, as in previous years, gathered with the old guard of the party. This year, the commemoration order for the old party members of the Nazi Party in the Löwenbräu cellar was slightly different from the celebrations in previous years. The venue was simply decorated. The celebration began at 6:00 PM, but the venue was already full before the meeting began. Next to the podium, German leaders such as Rosenberg, Schwarz, Hühnlein, and Himmler all took their seats as usual. Everyone was dressed in "blood-red" attire. The Mayor of Munich, Fiehler, and several other veteran comrades also attended. The families of the martyrs who died on November 8, 1923, and the families of those who were killed in the cellar of the Burgerbräukeller Hotel on November 8, 1939, were seated in the center of the hall. At 6:00 PM, Führer Hitler entered the venue led by those carrying the "blood flag," and the Badenweiler March was played. Everyone responded with enthusiastic cheers. Following him were leaders such as Hess, Wagner, Dr. Dietrich, and Bormann. After a simple welcome speech by Weiber, a veteran comrade of the 1923 uprising, Führer Hitler took the stage and addressed the old party members. (Ninth Dispatch, Haitong)

Berlin

A dispatch from Munich from the official German news agency stated that the old comrades who launched the unsuccessful Nazi movement in 1923 held a memorial meeting last night to commemorate the first protest against the Treaty of Versailles in the new Germany. Hitler attended the meeting and spoke, but because many radio stations were attacked by British aircraft, they had already stopped working. Therefore, Hitler's speech will be broadcast to the outside world at 10:30 AM this morning. When Hitler stood up to speak, the entire venue was silent. Only swastika flags and other flags were hung in the venue. There was loud applause when Hitler entered the venue, and the old comrades shouted "Hail Hitler!" Top officials such as Deputy Führer Hess followed Hitler into the venue. Hitler spoke for more than an hour, referring to the internal strength and unity of Germany, the unparalleled striking power of the German army, and the German command's belief in absolute victory. He condemned the British aircraft's night raids on German civilians and declared that Germany would give Britain a severe retaliation. Hitler described the German people's determination to win and their strong trust in the leader. Hitler traced the events of the past thirty years, saying, "Britain has always been our enemy. When I speak of Britain, I know that its people and leaders are different. Those who control the British regime are a small number of international democrats and Jews and the bourgeoisie, and it is this group that has stirred up the war. They were like this in the past, and they are still like this today. Those who decide to win have never fulfilled a single one of their promises." Hitler also recounted the victory of the Nazi Party's struggle. (Ninth Dispatch, Reuters)

Munich

Hitler told his old comrades last night, "The war against Britain will continue until victory is achieved." These words swept away all speculation about a "German peace offensive." Yesterday, the Nazi Party held a famous Beer Hall Putsch commemoration, and Hitler received a grand welcome. In 1933, Hitler first decided to launch an attack in a Munich beer hall, but it was unsuccessful. This year, an explosion occurred in the beer hall, only a few minutes after Hitler left, killing several of his old comrades. The beer hall was severely damaged. A few days later, Hitler returned to the site to attend the state funeral of the victims. Germany accused Britain of plotting the attack, and one person was arrested. Last night, Hitler firmly stated that Germany will definitely win. Hitler warned Britain that as British aircraft bomb German cities, the German Air Force will continue to give Britain merciless retaliation. (Ninth Dispatch, International News Service)

British Air Force Expedition Flies Over Munich; Heavy Bombs Dropped Near Beer Hall; Northern Italian Industrial Area Bombed; London

The British bombers' air raid on Munich last night disrupted Hitler's beloved annual Beer Hall Putsch celebration, according to sources. The British News Association has issued an unconfirmed report stating that bombs dropped by British aircraft on a military target flew over the target and landed in the famous beer cellar, causing a major fire. Although the matter is not confirmed, it can be determined that the time scheduled to broadcast Hitler's speech has been disrupted. The Italian radio news report at 6:00 PM first stated that Hitler would broadcast his speech at the scheduled time of 6:20 PM, but suddenly reported that the broadcast had been canceled. The German radio station also announced at 6:00 PM this afternoon that all German radio stations would be shut down at 6:15 PM (believed to be due to the British air raid). Hitler's speech will be broadcast tomorrow morning. It is reported that the first British bomber arrived in Munich at 7:00 PM, one hour after Hitler's scheduled speech time. Hitler's speech was scheduled to last two hours. When the British aircraft arrived, it was during Hitler's speech. The British aircraft circled over the city for a long time, and the last aircraft left at 9:15 PM. The British aircraft dropped heavy bombs near the beer cellar. Hitler must have clearly heard the loud sound of the British bombs exploding. The Berlin German High Command communique admitted that British aircraft raided Munich, saying that British aircraft dropped more bombs in Germany. A few bombs landed in Munich, Stuttgart, and Wartburg, causing little damage. According to a communique from the British Ministry of Aviation, on Friday evening, the British Air Force raided military targets in 18 cities and seaports in Germany, Italy, and German-occupied areas. In addition, a powerful British bomber force bombed the Munich train station and freight yard. The targets bombed by the British aircraft in Italy included the Turin aircraft factory and the Pirelli factory in Milan. Aircraft from the British Coastal Command also concentrated their attacks on the U-boat base in Lorient, which was quite successful. All British aircraft returned to base safely.

Full Text of Hitler's Speech; Berlin

German Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the old guard in the Munich beer hall last night on the eve of the Nazi Party's 1923 Uprising Commemoration Day. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Recalling the Past

"Nazi Party Comrades, we are again celebrating the anniversary of November 9 on the eve. 1923 was the time when the power of our Nazi Party reached its peak in Germany. We must understand what Germany encountered at that time and the historical events that sparked the Nazi Party's uprising, so that we can know the great significance of celebrating this anniversary. When we first began our national political life, our names were unknown. Most comrades, including myself, did not belong to any political party. Most were soldiers returning from the Great War, all of whom were mentally devastated. At that time, our country's situation seemed to be in a state of despair. Although the Germany before 1914 was not our Germany, we still had contact with it, because it represented a group of citizens, the majority of Germany. At that time, Germany had already initiated social legislation, which was the first time Germany had discussed this issue. But today, social legislation is ignored by so-called democratic countries. It is true that due to the circumstances at the time, this social problem could not be thoroughly resolved by capitalist countries. What is noteworthy is that when discussing this issue, there was indeed an attempt to adapt to the realities of the time and solve it. But Germany at that time was still a democratic country. The democratic habits of the country were deeper than those of other countries. Immersed in freedom, everyone could do what they wanted. This kind of freedom even allowed people to enter and exit the German border at will at that time. Even the so-called "free and unrestricted countries" in South America do not have this situation. A strict inspection is required upon entry. Germany was not like that. Jews and Poles could freely enter Germany and immediately acquire equal status. The international races gathered in Germany raised the banner of revolution in 1918. But at that time, Germany was a peaceful country. The people lived and worked in peace and were well aware that war would inevitably lead to bad results. The people's desire for peace can be seen from this. But the outside world had already implemented armed forces against Germany. The war finally broke out when Germany was unprepared. I do not want to comment on the situation at that time, but I am willing to work hard to ensure that the German people do not repeat the mistakes of the past. Today's British Prime Minister Churchill was the most active person in inciting war at that time. At that time, the British war instigators managed to mobilize the whole world to fight against Germany. But they are now old. Although Germany at that time did not have sufficient military equipment, it still resisted for four years. I was a soldier at that time, and now I tell you as the supreme commander of Germany, I dare to say that if Britain had not had its allies break into our country, it would never have been able to defeat Germany. The war lasted for four years. They then had to create the miracle of the United States and eventually misled the German people with the honorable words of a foreign president. Germany at that time was exhausted and fooled by others. The "victors" at that time never fulfilled a single promise. The United States also always violated its promises. After that, the German people suffered hardships, and the people could not live. Twenty thousand people committed suicide every year because they could not make a living. So we began to struggle. At that time, I first decided to start my activities here. You also began to struggle together with me. It is truly incredible that this "irrational person" even had the idea of fighting against the reality of the world. This person had no money, no army as his support, no newspapers to promote him, and no political parties for him to use. Everyone opposed this person. This person had to fight in all directions. This person was determined to establish a new country and a new society. This was not something that could be achieved easily, but he finally gradually moved towards success, and the number of supporters increased day by day.

Difficult Struggle

In 1911, I and my comrades already had the idea of seizing German power. We recognized that the government at that time could not maintain the country and knew that it would collapse sooner or later. My comrades then continued to work hard. But at that time, we were not smart people. In fact, I was not "smart" when I was a child. However, I and my comrades still went to various places to carry out activities. The most difficult thing was to incite the people against the Jews. People who are alive today will not be able to understand the significance of this move in the future. This was a struggle against a force that had already occupied an important position in all aspects of our country's spirit, knowledge, politics, and economy. Because it could control the entire country, it had to be eliminated first. This omnipotent Jew then declared war on us. I have always believed that the Jews are the most stupid and inferior nation in the world and must be banished from the country and not be associated with Germany. Therefore, the goal of all our efforts was the Germanic nation. In 1923, there was the first uprising. Although it failed, several martyrs sacrificed their lives. But I believe that it was the starting point of our victory. In 1925, I was released from glorious detention. So I rebuilt the Nazi Party. Between 1925 and 1930, I worked hard for six years. At that time, the middle class was living in peace and did not know that the greatest revolution in the world was taking place. The Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party were also ignorant. But we fought day and night. After the two years of 1931 and 1932, we finally achieved victory in 1933. At that time, some people may have been fortunate, thinking that they could live in peace from now on and that the Nazi Party should end its efforts after seizing power. In fact, they did not understand that the Nazi Party cannot but continue to struggle until the Germanic nation has achieved complete liberation. My attitude towards the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party was to influence them and work together. If they questioned us with theory, I would deal with them with theory. But if they threatened us with force, I would never yield and would definitely destroy them. Because of the result of my combination of kindness and power, hundreds of thousands of party members from other political parties came to us one after another. This is the reason why I was able to come to power in 1933.

Seizing Power

The German nation and the Nazi Party movement unanimously supported me. We have established a country and revitalized the economy. We have given the Germanic nation a new belief and rescued countless compatriots from despair. We have made the country orderly, established a good financial foundation, and made the entire country move towards revival. But the likes of Britain's Churchill, Eden, and Chamberlain then rose up and challenged us. Some said "Germany is rearming" or "Why does Germany need stormtroopers?" Then Germany is rearming, which is indeed a fact. The stormtroopers are to prevent those who disrupt peace. Before I came to power, Germany was a democratic country. Today, it seems that everyone

After the Two Courts Were Seized, Internal Conditions Became Chaotic. Those Who Uphold Justice and Integrity Refused to Comply. Chinese Lawyers from the Police Department Stopped Appearing in Court. All Cases Scheduled for Summons Yesterday Could Not Be "Tried."

Following the illegal seizure of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Second Special District Court in the French Concession the day before yesterday, the Chinese government, in addition to issuing a strong statement of protest by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the French action, also issued a telegram from the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordering the two courts to temporarily cease operations within the French Concession. It further notified both domestic and foreign parties that all judgments and actions of the illegal organs thereafter would be invalid. This righteous and forceful stance garnered deep sympathy from people of justice both in China and abroad. On the part of the two courts, with the exception of a few prosecutors and staff who were lured, the majority were deeply aware of the greater good and refused to go to work, leading to extremely chaotic conditions.

Guardians of the Law Prosecutors Have All Left

Yesterday's report that Zhang Minsheng would be appointed as "Civil Court President" was indeed a misunderstanding. The position of "Civil Court President" is held by Yuan Xiaogen, while the "Criminal Court President" is Zhang Zi (formerly a prosecutor in the Nanshi District Court). It is also heard that because all incumbent prosecutors and procurators of the "two courts" have left, the chief clerks of each court, such as Gao Yanlin, Shi Zhonghe, Wang Yiwei, and others, also unanimously resigned and left the court yesterday. Those who took up new "positions," in addition to the two chief procurators being reassigned as "presidents," those who accepted new appointments were all distributed as prosecutors (more than half of those distributed as prosecutors were unwilling to take up the positions). As for alternate prosecutor Liao Yuan and distributed prosecutors Yuan Xiaogen "incumbent Civil Court President," Yu Jian, Shen Youqi, Huang Yan, Wu Kechou, and others, the original "Chief Procurator of the Second Special Court" was scheduled to be promoted from Chief Clerk Zhou Daren. It is now heard that Zhou has refused the appointment, and Sun Jinshao has appointed Sun Jintang (related as a nephew, from Jilin) to take the position.

Internal Situation is Extremely Chaotic

No more than one-tenth of the clerks and recorders accepted the new "positions," and all bailiffs have also left. Therefore, the "two courts" will not be able to officially handle cases in the near future. After being occupied the day before yesterday, the two courts did not hold court in the afternoon. Yesterday morning, the situation was still chaotic, and no civil or criminal court hearings were held. The scheduled hearings for yesterday were all indefinitely postponed.

Police Cases Hastily Concluded

Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, because public prosecution cases from the French Police Department could no longer be delayed, prosecutor Zhang Zi, who previously worked at the Nanshi District Court, began questioning in the first court (normally, public prosecution cases are heard in the first and eighth courts). On the Police Department's side, the head of the Criminal Division, Shen Duyang (French), appeared in court to represent the prosecution. After questioning the defendants' names, ages, and places of origin for half an hour, the cases were adjourned.

Police Department Lawyers Did Not Appear

It is also learned that the four lawyers who previously represented the administrative authorities of the French Concession did not appear in court. There are rumors that they have resigned, but this has not been confirmed. However, it is heard that they have a contract with the French authorities, so before the contract expires, they will work internally in the judicial advisory office and will not appear in court to represent the Police Department in public prosecutions.

Autopsies Conducted Without Familiarity with Procedures

Regarding the police department's report of corpses to be examined yesterday, the "Second Special Court's Procuratorate," due to sanitary reasons, could not delay. Sun Jintang, accompanied by the "forensic doctor," "clerk," and "bailiff," went to the Talas Road Small Hospital and the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to examine the corpses. However, Sun, being new to the job, was quite unfamiliar with the autopsy procedures and was guided by the "clerk" to complete the process.

Lawyers Cease Handling Invalid Cases

A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited a lawyer yesterday, who stated that lawyers are people who know and abide by the law, and the Lawyers Association is, in essence, a collective of personnel who know and abide by the law. Now that the two courts in the French Concession have been illegally invaded, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all judgments made by the "Chinese Court" in the French Concession hereafter are invalid. Members of the Lawyers Association should abide by this, and from now on, they will only cease handling cases in the two self-proclaimed "courts" until legality is restored, and then continue to handle them. Cases already in progress can also be regarded as temporarily suspended.

Fearing for Safety, Armored Cars to be Purchased

For the safety of all personnel in the entire "court," Sun Shaokang intends to purchase a new armored car for the use of all personnel in the "court." Yesterday morning, a car dealership drove a car to the front of the "court" for evaluation. The price was 37,000 gold, but the deal was not made due to the unsuitable price.

Sun Yat-sen's Birthday

Flags to be Hung in Celebration

The day after tomorrow (the 12th) is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Various sectors of the city, as it is a time of crisis, will not hold any celebratory ceremonies. However, to commemorate the supreme and noble personality of the Premier and his great achievements in devoting himself to revolution and creating China, it has been decided to hang flags uniformly for one day on that day. Various agencies, organizations, and schools in the city will follow the usual practice of having a holiday to celebrate the Premier's birthday. At the same time, citizens from all walks of life have decided to actively promote the frugal national construction savings campaign and continue to solicit winter clothing donations to fulfill their civic duties. The police authorities of the two concessions in the city, as the 12th is the Premier's birthday, are deeply concerned that unscrupulous elements may take the opportunity to operate within the concessions, affecting public security and causing disturbances. Therefore, it has been decided to implement temporary precautions for one day on that day. It has been ordered that all patrolmen secretly increase the number of detectives and patrol each road, and inspect pedestrians. As for road traffic, it will not be blocked unless necessary. In addition, the Public Works Department and all its affiliated departments will uniformly cease operations for one day on that day.

Unified Yuping Bonds

A Total of More Than Five Million Yuan in Principal to be Returned

The tenth redemption of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Public Bonds D, and the eleventh redemption of principal for the 23rd Year of the Republic Yuping Railway Bonds, were drawn yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The total principal to be redeemed for the Unified D Bonds is 4.1 million silver dollars, and the total principal to be redeemed for the Yuping Railway Bonds is 840,000 silver dollars. The principal and accrued interest for the Yuping Railway Bonds drawn will be paid starting November 30, 1940, through the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in various locations. The principal and accrued interest for the Unified Bonds drawn will be paid starting January 31, 1941, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, through the Central Bank of China and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications in various locations. The winning numbers are recorded below: (1) Unified D Bonds, eight bonds: No. 018, No. 180, No. 265, No. 456, No. 664, No. 762, No. 897, No. 999; (2) Yuping Railway Bonds, seven bonds: No. 01, No. 16, No. 49, No. 53, No. 65, No. 75, No. 81. The announcement was made by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on the same day, so that everyone knows.

Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Authorities Strictly Investigate

National Rice Transport to Shanghai is Not Very Difficult

Pingyao Plans to Hold Another Session in December

The Shanghai rice market, which had been stable for a long time, has recently begun to fluctuate frequently, with prices constantly rising, which is of great importance to the livelihoods of ordinary people and social security. The city's various agencies and relevant commercial organizations have been ordered to thoroughly investigate the hoarding of rice. If any illegal hoarding is found, severe penalties will be imposed, and those who refuse to comply will have their business licenses revoked. At the same time, the rice industry organizations will be seriously discussed to expedite the planning of unified rice trading.

Rice Market Prices Rise

The rice market tea party opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. At the beginning of the market, people's minds immediately turned upward, and the market price uniformly rose by half a yuan or one yuan. Soon, the market was crowded, and the market presented a chaotic state. Speculative rice weevils were active, spreading rumors, and people's minds became firmer. The market price shouted higher and higher, and the "grabbing hats" and "kicking the ball" were quite fierce. As a result, rice such as tea species and wild rice increased by two yuan compared to the previous market. New japonica, Duyang, and Jianyang rice also increased by about one yuan. Currently, the highest price (1) for domestic rice has been quoted at 89 yuan, and (2) for foreign rice has been quoted at 70 yuan. However, because the rice prices in each stall have repeatedly shouted higher, the demand from the guest numbers is obviously weak.

Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive

The "Heda" ship of Norwegian merchant Hualun Pinghang arrived in Shanghai from Siam yesterday, carrying 16,000 bags of foreign rice, and docked at the Bund Pier on Beijing Road. The unloading of goods is scheduled to begin today. The Peng Ge Ke and Song Tai ships of the French Navigation Company, which previously loaded huge amounts of foreign rice from Vietnam to Shanghai, have now completed unloading and set sail for Vietnam yesterday, so that the foreign rice ordered by the rice merchants in this port can be loaded and transported to Shanghai.

Transportation is Extremely Smooth

Regarding the transportation of rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, due to the sudden changes in the international situation, the Hong Kong authorities, for the sake of prudence, once prohibited the export of rice, but then lifted the ban. Today, the rice stored in Hong Kong is extremely abundant, enough to meet the needs of the entire city of Hong Kong for eight months. Moreover, the transportation of rice from Saigon and Siam is not inferior to the past, so the Hong Kong authorities have approved a large number of rice shipments to Shanghai for regulation. The number of export rice certificates issued daily is always about 10,000 bags or 7,000 to 8,000 bags, without restriction. Therefore, the arrival of rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai has increased many times. In addition, Shanghai-Hong Kong voyages are smooth, and there are daily arrivals in Shanghai. In addition to passengers and cargo, the rest are loaded with rice. As for domestic rice issued with "permits" to be transported to Shanghai, the daily amount is always about 10,000 bags. The so-called difficulty in transporting domestic rice is completely unfounded.

Foreign Rice Arrival Price

The current market cost of No. 2 foreign rice is about 77.3 yuan per bag. Most of the rice arriving these days was ordered the day before yesterday. Due to exchange rates and water feet and other reasons, the cost of this No. 1 rice is more than 79 yuan per bag. Designated households sell at a loss, and there are many losses. The goods arriving next month will be priced according to the current market price, and the cost will be 72 to 73 yuan per bag. The foreign rice leveling has been held for almost a year, and it is agreed to end after this period of sales. However, in order to cope with winter relief, efforts are being made to plan, or another session can be held in December to help civilians get through the rest of the winter.

Tomorrow is the Armistice Day

British, American, and French Nationals Decide to Hold Separate Ceremonies

Prayers for Peace at the American Church This Morning

As the powder keg smell pervades Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Balkan Peninsula, and aggressors use their claws to seize small nations, peace-loving people of the Third International in Shanghai will commemorate the First World War Armistice Day in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund on Edward Road at 8:30 AM tomorrow.

The funds donated to present flowers in previous years will be transferred to the Great British Victory Association this year to replenish the needs of the national wartime fund. It was originally scheduled to have a dinner and music and dance party on this day, but this year it will not be held. However, peace memorial prayers will be held in the American Church in advance today.

US Military Band to Hold Concert

The U.S. 4th Regiment, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of the Regiment's McKinley Band, and to take advantage of today's Sunday to pre-celebrate the First World War Armistice Day, will hold a grand concert with a special program at the Grand Theatre this morning, led by Reverend Crump. The McKinley Band Brass Band and the 4th Regiment Band will jointly perform various famous songs. Finally, it will be blessed with hymns and the American national anthem.

It is scheduled to lay wreaths in front of the Goddess of Peace at 11:00 AM tomorrow. The unit's chaplain, Mr. Chaplin, will also hold prayers in front of the Goddess of Peace on time, wishing the God of "Peace" to come to the world as soon as possible.

A Review of the First World War

The First World War began in June 1914 with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand and his wife. One side was the German-Austrian Alliance, and the other side was the Entente Powers, including Britain, the United States, Russia, and France. China also sent a large number of workers to take on war tasks. The United States joined the war in 1917, and the strength of the Entente forces increased sharply. In December of that year, Britain captured Turkey and took Jerusalem. The U.S. military crossed Belgium and penetrated deep into Germany. Turkey sued for peace, Germany was greatly isolated, and a domestic revolution broke out. German Emperor William II fled to the Netherlands, and Germany then ceased hostilities with the Entente Powers. November 11, 1918, was the end date of the war.

Airmail to Chongqing Destroyed

According to the "North China Daily News," when Japanese planes attacked Chongqing on October 26, a postal steel barge was hit by two bombs and destroyed. A number of postal items transported to Chongqing on board, including a batch of airmail from Shanghai via Hong Kong, were all destroyed along with the ship. It is believed that the batch of airmail was posted in Shanghai on October 14, 15, and 16.

Jewish Refugees

Encounter Hardships

According to the English-language "China Press," the economic assistance from American Jews received by the Jewish Refugee Relief Committee in this city has recently been greatly reduced, resulting in the exhaustion of funds. Therefore, starting today (the 9th), the meals distributed to Jewish immigrants will be reduced from three meals a day to one meal a day, and the supply of butter and bread will also be reduced. It is investigated that there are a total of 6,000 German and Austrian Jewish refugees in this city whose meals and clothing have been supported by the committee for more than a year. Most of these people live in shelters in the northern district, and there are also many who live outside the shelters. It is still unknown why the committee is unable to obtain economic assistance from American Jews. It is heard that the committee has issued a special appeal.

Japanese Troops Reinforce Punan

Traffic on the Huangpu River Cut Off

Hundreds of Japanese Motorboats Carry Japanese Troops South

Chinese Troops Attack Jinshanwei for the Second Time

From 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM yesterday, the Huangpu River suddenly presented a state of martial law. All large and small ships in the Huangpu River were prohibited from sailing by the "water police" and customs water patrol, cutting off traffic. At 12:20 PM yesterday, about 100 Japanese military motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese troops, sailed from the Huangpu River outside the Bund of the Concession towards the blockade line of the 16th Pier and went south on the Huangpu River. According to eyewitnesses on the Bund, the Japanese motorboats came from the Pujiang River surface of Hongkou. Before the Japanese motorboats passed, a Japanese Navy shallow-water warship sailed from the Pujiang River surface outside the Bund of the Concession to the South Huangpu River. According to inquiries from passengers traveling to Punan, they firmly believe that the Japanese motorboats mainly sailed west to the Jinshanwei area of Punan. It is heard that a large number of Chinese regular troops have arrived west of Jinshanwei, and have attacked the Japanese army and other miscellaneous troops in the Jinshanwei Jinss Niang Bridge area for the second time.

American Transport Ship to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

Evacuate Navy Dependents

Mariposa to Sail to Kobe

Washington Berths Fully Booked

According to reliable sources, the large American transport ship "Cape Horn" is scheduled to sail from Xiao Luzon tomorrow afternoon and arrive at this port, mooring at the U.S. Navy pontoon, to evacuate the families of U.S. Navy personnel from various parts of the Far East.

Mariposa to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

The second U.S. special ship for evacuating overseas Chinese, the "Mariposa," is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:30 AM tomorrow, and will leave Shanghai at 9:00 PM in the afternoon. It is estimated that 85 American nationals in Shanghai will be on board the ship to evacuate. They were busy packing their luggage yesterday. It is heard that the ship will take the route of Qinhuangdao and Busan, carrying American nationals from North China and Korea to evacuate, and via Kobe, Japan, and then directly to California in the United States. Currently, there are still vacancies in the first-class cabin.

Washington is Bound to be Crowded

It is heard that the "Mariposa" has too high a fare, and most of the cabins have been reserved by American nationals in Korea and North China, so not many American nationals in Shanghai will take the ship to evacuate. However, the third special ship, the "Washington," is scheduled to arrive in port on the 17th, because there are a large number of third-class cabins, and the fare is only 100 U.S. dollars, so American nationals who take this ship to return home are bound to be crowded. According to the Da Lai Steamship Company, people have been constantly booking tickets for the "Washington" from the company in recent days.

Newlyweds Ordered to Leave

The Chief of Navigation Affairs of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet flagship "Luzon," Qiao Ke, married Ms. Ke Ke at the home of an American consular officer here on Wednesday. Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford immediately ordered the Navy authorities to include Ms. Ke Ke's name on the list of naval officers' dependents to be evacuated and to evacuate immediately. However, due to passport issues, the issue has not yet been resolved. The two will stay here for a few weeks. Before taking up the shares on the "Luzon," Qiao Ke studied in Tokyo, specializing in Japanese.

The Public Works Department Cooperates with the Japanese Side
To Deal with Crimes in the Western District

Temporary Measures Agreed Upon to Remove Iron Nets
Public Buses Resume Service on All Lines

According to the English-language "China Press," it was learned this morning (9th) that the police of the Public Concession and the Japanese military authorities have agreed on temporary measures for future cooperation in dealing with criminal activities in the Western District. The barbed wire obstructions in the western part of the Public Concession were completely removed this morning.

Full Cooperation to Suppress Crime

According to Commissioner Bowen of the Public Works Department, after the Japanese authorities removed the obstacles in the Western District yesterday (8th) afternoon, the Public Works Department also removed the barbed wire it erected in the area this morning. It is expected that the situation in the Western District will improve, which will help the police suppress crime. It is heard that the Public Concession and the Japanese authorities will fully cooperate on police affairs in the area. Three weeks ago, Japanese military police sergeant Saito Seiichi was assassinated on Yu Garden Road. The Japanese side immediately erected several barbed wire fences along the road, hindering the normal progress of traffic. This traffic difficulty ended today with the removal of the barbed wire.

Public Buses Resume Full Service

According to the "North China Daily News," the barbed wire obstacles erected by the Japanese side near Datong Road and Difeng Road on Daxiy Road several weeks ago were ordered to be dismantled at 3:00 PM yesterday (8th). It is hoped that the public bus service in the Western District, which was hindered by these obstacles, will be fully restored soon. The public bus company has sent several buses yesterday to pass through the area where the obstacles were previously erected and reach Dunxin Road without encountering any obstacles. However, the barbed wire frame on Yu Garden Road has not yet been removed, and public buses passing through this area are still being stopped and searched.

North Jiangxi Road Still Blocked

Since Friday (8th) afternoon, barbed wire obstructions have been erected along Jiangxi Road by the Japanese Naval Landing Force, so that guests in the Riverside Building of the Suzhou Creek in the north who want to send letters to the nearby post office must cross the bridge, detour around the Suzhou Creek, and then pass the Sichuan Road Bridge to reach their destination. At present, the only two places for traffic to Hongkou are Bazilu Road and Hai Ning Road, so it is extremely inconvenient for citizens to travel. It is said that the decision to re-set up the barbed wire is due to the fact that Japanese Navy Lieutenant Nakamura was shot in North Jiangxi Road. However, it is heard that this measure is of a temporary nature.

Nakamura Shangxiong Died of Serious Injuries

According to the Shanghai Times, Japanese Army Lieutenant Nakamura Shangxiong was attacked at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road on the afternoon of the 5th of this month, and was shot five times, one of which entered from the back of the neck. After being sent to the hospital, he never regained consciousness and died of serious injuries at 12:30 AM yesterday. Since August 29th, Nakamura is the sixth Japanese soldier who has been attacked in Shanghai. The Japanese military authorities attach great importance to this.

U.S. Marine Corps
Celebrates 165th Anniversary

Officers to Host Cocktail Party Tonight

According to the English-language "China Press," the 10th of this month is the 165th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. All officers and soldiers of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will hold a banquet at the Wanguo Shangtuan Training Ground on Fuzhou Road starting at 7:00 PM tonight to celebrate the anniversary, and there will be boxing performances and other entertainment. Important members of the Wanguo Shangtuan and the police department, as well as many major American nationals in the city, have also been invited to attend. In addition, the officers of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment will hold a cocktail party at the American Chamber of Commerce tomorrow (10th) from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM to show their celebration. However, this year's military parade ceremony will not be held as usual.

The Old Site of the Central Bank on the Bund
Rumored to Be Occupied Again

Schools and Barracks Have All Been Vacated One After Another
The Public Works Department Has Actually Agreed with the Japanese Side

The Central Bank at No. 15 The Bund moved to the French Concession Yierbei Road after the outbreak of the war. The old site it left behind was borrowed by the Public Works Department to establish the Gezhi Public School and the Nie Zhongcheng Middle School, and a part of it was expanded into the barracks of the Wanguo Shangtuan Headquarters. It was then taken over by a certain party, suspected of being occupied. Unexpectedly, since yesterday, the Public Works Department School and the White Russian Team in the house suddenly moved out (the White Russian Team moved into the barracks of the former British Xifu Zi Team in the racecourse), which is confirmed by the English-language "China Press" records, and seems to have become a reality.

Negotiated and Decided to Allow Handover

According to the English-language "China Press," the old site of the Central Bank at No. 15 The Bund was taken over by the Public Works Department since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the 26th year of the Republic, and a primary school of the bureau was established, and a part of the houses was handed over to the Wanguo Shangtuan White Russian Team for use. It is reported that a certain party intends to set up a "Central Bank," and its Shanghai branch will be located at the original site of the Central Bank on the Bund, which will be opened soon. The transfer of the building to a certain party has been negotiated and decided by the Japanese side and the Public Works Department. In Nanjing, the Bank of Communications Building occupied by the Japanese Army Special Service Department has also been handed over for use as the headquarters of the "Central Bank."

White Russian Shangtuan Barracks Relocated

According to the "North China Daily News," the two barracks of the Wanguo Shangtuan White Russian Team on the Bund and Jiujiang Road have been relocated one after another in the past three days. Yesterday (8th) it was announced that they were completed. The two houses are empty. Rumor has it that the Japanese side will take over the empty house, because it belongs to the bank of the central government. The White Russian Shangtuan is now temporarily residing in the former barracks of the British Xifu Zi Highland Team in the racecourse. It is heard that although this barracks is not as comfortable as the old site on the Bund, it is very spacious and has complete sports equipment. During the Shanghai war in the 26th year of the Republic, the accommodation facilities of the White Russian Shangtuan were not prepared at all. At the end of the year, the British army continued to arrive in Shanghai to take over the defense of Zone B.

Three Squads Living Together

After the White Russian Shangtuan was relieved of its responsibility for guarding Zone B, it temporarily resided in the Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road, and then moved to the Jialing Harding Building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road (at that time, the building had not yet been completed). The three squadrons of the White Russian Shangtuan first decided to live together in one place here. Soon, one of the squadrons was transferred to the Public Works Department Building, and the remaining two teams moved into the Bund houses in February of the 27th year of the Republic. Now that it has been decided to move to the racecourse barracks, it is the second time in many years that the three squadrons have lived together.

Continue to Guard the Bund

It is also heard that the White Russian Shangtuan will continue to be responsible for guarding the Bund Wharf since last year. Special preparations have been made for the White Russian Shangtuan to travel to and from the Bund. However, the White Russian Shangtuan will soon be merged into the Public Works Department Police Department as a reserve team in accordance with the order of the Public Works Department. Their new barracks are being repaired at the old site of the Salvation Army Shelter on Xiamen Road.

The Situation in Shaoxing After the Robbery

After Shaoxing was recovered on the 28th of last month, the government agencies have been working as usual, and the police have also returned to their posts. However, the disaster was severe, and very few residents who were displaced have returned to the city, so the banks have not yet resumed business. Apart from rice shops and pawnshops, very few shops have opened, and the city is full of desolation and gloom. The Zhejiang Provincial Government learned that the victims in Shaoxing urgently need to be comforted, so it has already been decided at the provincial government meeting to allocate 50,000 yuan to handle relief. On the war front, Keqiao, Ruan She, and Qian Qing have been recovered one after another, and the entire Japanese army has retreated to the Xiaoshan Xixing area and has returned to its original position. In terms of transportation, the long-distance telephone from Ningbo to Shaoxing has been connected, and the telegrams from Shanghai and Shaoxing are smooth and extremely congested.

Widow Sues Younger Uncle
Requests Handover of Shop Accounts

Defendant Claims Plaintiff is Deceased Brother's Concubine
Unwilling to Hand Over Shop; Court Hearing Postponed for Re-verification

Tang Xue, a widow from Suzhou, and her late husband, Tang Bingxin, also known as Weiting, jointly opened the Yongxing Store at No. 635 Niuzhuang Road with Gongxing Xieji for many years. Later, Gongxing Xieji withdrew its shares, and Tang personally operated the store, which had considerable profits. When Tang died of illness on January 8 of this year, the Yongxing Bingji Store was managed by Tang's younger brother, Youguang, but he did not report the accounts to Tang Xue. Recently, Tang Xue, believing that her younger uncle Tang Youguang was attempting to seize the shop property, hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting the court to order Tang Youguang to hand over all the account books of the Yongxing Bingji Store and completely hand over the shop property. The court accepted the case and summoned both parties to the third civil court for questioning by Judge Xu yesterday. Both parties appeared in court represented by lawyers. The defendant's side stated that the plaintiff was not Tang Bingxin's legitimate wife, but a concubine, so they were unwilling to return the shop property. The plaintiff insisted that she and Tang Bingxin were legally married, accusing the defendant of intending to forcibly take the shop property. The court adjourned the hearing for re-verification, as both parties had different statements.

Robbery Cases Recorded

Xin Zha Road: At around 7:00 PM yesterday, a certain leather shop at No. 233 Xinzha Road, Public Concession, was visited by three robbers. One of them was armed and robbed two large bundles of leather, worth 400 yuan.

Wuchang Road: At 6:10 PM yesterday, seven robbers invaded a certain money house at No. 4, Lane 178, Wuchang Road, Hongkou. Five of them had pistols and forbade any outcry. They ransacked the boxes and cabinets, and robbed 6,200 yuan in national currency, 800 yuan in Japanese currency, and 4,000 yuan in Korean currency, and fled away.

Xinzha Road: At around 10:10 PM yesterday, three robbers broke into a certain watch shop on Xinzha Road. One of them had a pistol and robbed many wristwatches and pocket watches, estimated to be worth 500 yuan, and fled without a trace.

Tailor Gambles and Loses, Attempts Suicide by Drowning

Cai Genyou, from Ningbo, is 33 years old and lives in Nanshi. Cai is a foreman in a certain clothing store next door to Yong'an Company on Jiujiang Road, and his monthly income is good. However, Cai has recently been wandering around the gambling dens of the Liuguo Hotel in the Shanghai West, but he has had bad luck and lost more than 400 yuan, incurring heavy debts and feeling ashamed. At around 6:45 PM yesterday, he went alone to the Xin Guan Wharf on the Bund and jumped into the river to commit suicide. He was rescued by Chinese patrolman No. 478, who escorted him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is heard that he drank too much water and his life is in danger.

Number of Cases Appealed by the Public Works Department

Murder Case Occurs on Hart Road

Yuan Xiangong is Chopped to Death

Six Axe Wounds to the Head, Face, and Neck

Family Rushes to See, Already Dead

A sudden assassination case occurred on Hart Road, Public Concession, yesterday morning. The deceased was Yuan Xiangong from Sichuan, a senior liaison officer in a certain party. He was broken into by three people in his residence, and his head, face, neck, and other parts were chopped six times with an axe, and he died on the spot due to serious injuries. The three assassins fled together. The details learned are recorded below:

Asleep in Bed, Suddenly Murdered

Yuan Xiangong, courtesy name Ji'an, was over thirty years old. His family lived at No. 14 Fude Fang, Lane 23, Hart Road, Shanghai West, which is a single-family house opposite the tram company, with elegant furnishings. At about 10:43 AM yesterday, he was still asleep in his bedroom on the second floor. His wife and maid were in the downstairs living room. Suddenly, three assassins, one wearing a Zhongshan suit and two wearing Western suits, broke in from the back door of the house and went straight into Yuan's bedroom on the second floor. Two people showed pistols, and one person pulled out a sharp axe.

Six Axe Wounds in a Row, Dies on the Spot

Without asking any questions, they raised their axes and chopped wildly at Yuan Xiangong, who was sleeping soundly in bed, inflicting four axe wounds to the head and two axe wounds to the neck. Blood splattered everywhere, and he died on the spot. The three assassins, seeing that their goal had been achieved, went downstairs and fled through the back door. The family did not go upstairs to see him until after they left. At that time, Yuan had already died. They immediately reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who ordered police officers to rush to investigate. They summoned his wife and maid to the police station for questioning and transported the body to the coroner's office for examination at 2:00 PM. It is believed that this case is related to politics.

They were arrested by the Xin Zha Police Station. During the trial in the First Special Court, the defendant voluntarily confessed that on October 16, he and two fugitives broke into the home of Hu Daoxi at No. 378 Binjiang Road and robbed 5,500 yuan in national currency with weapons. After a court hearing, Judge Liu sentenced Yang Jinbiao to seven years in prison as a repeat offender of armed robbery, and confiscated one pistol and six bullets.

### Japan Negotiating Troop Deployment with Thailand, Threatening Singapore and Burma; Rumors of U.S. Preparing to Send Fleet to Aid Singapore; Roosevelt Doesn't Deny U.S.-British-Australian Joint Defense Plan

Chongqing - According to Kunming's Chinese Telegraph, Japanese troops in Vietnam are currently negotiating with Thailand for the right to station troops in or transit through Thai territory, in order to threaten Singapore and Burma. (Reuters, 9th)

Haiphong - According to semi-official Japanese sources, in light of the serious situation on the Vietnamese-Thai border, Haiphong authorities have conscripted French citizens between the ages of forty and fifty into the army in the past few days. At the same time, large numbers of Vietnamese troops from the Tokyo area are moving south. It is estimated that half of the Vietnamese air force has been transferred to southern bases. (Reuters, 9th)

Washington - Yesterday, diplomatic and journalistic circles concerned with the Far East situation have shown increasing interest in the Japanese withdrawal from South China and the extent to which the U.S., Britain, and Australia will form a joint Pacific defense. It is generally believed that these two events are related, as the cooperation between Britain and the U.S. is greatly related to the strength or weakness of Japan's position in China. Many in foreign diplomatic circles here believe that Japan's withdrawal of troops from the Nanning area may be to concentrate forces in Vietnam to advance towards Thailand. Observers generally believe that Japanese troops in Thailand can more easily launch an attack on Singapore. It is generally believed here that Japan's recent accusations that Vietnam is not cooperating closely with Japanese troops are merely creating a pretext for Japan to take military action in that area. Yesterday, someone asked Secretary of State Hull whether the government had received any official reports about the Japanese withdrawal from South China and the concentration in Hainan Island. Hull replied that the government had received official reports similar to the Far East news recently published in the newspapers. He said that he understood that the recent news reports on this matter were merely "inquiries" and not real conclusions. At the same time, the news from London about the establishment of a joint Pacific defense agreement between Britain, the U.S., and Australia was only met with mild words from officials here, saying it was unbelievable, but not formally denied. When President Roosevelt was specifically asked about this matter, he also refused to deny it. Regarding the matter of whether the U.S. would send warships to aid Singapore if it were attacked, here one can only speculate, but many neutral observers believe that this is very likely. The State Department responded to inquiries yesterday, saying that Americans employed by foreigners only need to register with the State Department if they are "engaged in propaganda activities in the United States." The State Department said that the U.S. government also hires a large number of foreigners overseas to work together, so it is not prepared to object to Japanese-Americans working for the Japanese government in China. (United Press, 9th)

London - British authorities admitted yesterday that Britain and the U.S. have "reached an agreement in principle" on a joint Pacific defense, but regarding outside rumors of formal talks, the authorities have repeatedly pointed out that it is a great mistake to think of this as a formal negotiation. The scope of the talks was indeed quite broad, but we cannot hastily conclude that an agreement has been reached. (United Press, 9th)

Tokyo - The Chugai Commercial News stated last night that after President Roosevelt's election, the strengthening of U.S. aid to China will inevitably cause friction with Japan. Although we cannot speculate on the U.S.'s determination, judging from the evacuation of American expatriates in the Far East, we can say that the U.S. has made a major decision. However, we believe that the U.S. still has room for careful consideration. The Kokumin Shimbun said that President Roosevelt's re-election indicates the strength of future U.S. policy towards Japan. If Japan makes a mistake in its policies towards the U.S., Japan will encounter a crisis unprecedented in its history. To cope with this situation, Japan should use the establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance as an unshakable diplomatic policy. (Reuters, 9th)

### Chinese Troops Attacking Yichang Capture a Stronghold

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman told reporters that Chinese troops have successively captured Datang, Xiaodong, and other places. There are no longer any Japanese traces in Guangxi Province. Chinese troops on Huzhou Island are also driving Japanese troops out of the island. On the Central China front, Chinese troops have occupied Tianzipu (southwest of Yichang). It is estimated that there is a Japanese division in the Yichang area. In response to rumors that Japanese troops are withdrawing from Yichang, the spokesman said that the fire in Yichang city seems to indicate that Japanese troops are preparing to retreat, but the Japanese troops are still using Yichang as a base and attacking in the suburbs, indicating that the Japanese troops intend to hold Yichang. As for the North China front, it has been quite quiet for many months, with no battles worth mentioning except in Shandong and southwestern Shanxi. (Reuters, 9th)

Gui - More than two thousand Japanese troops from Yichang launched a fierce attack on Nanjin Pass, supported by more than thirty aircraft. The Chinese troops calmly resisted and repelled the Japanese. Another group of Japanese troops attacked Ertapo, Caojingchong, and other places, but all failed. In the Baojiatou area, on the same day, there were also two thousand Japanese troops, accompanied by more than ten artillery pieces, attacking the Chinese troops, but they were all defeated by the Chinese.
