### Foreign Minister Wang Discusses the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy: It Cannot Affect China's Policy; China Works Hard to Fight for the Legitimate World Order; Absolutely Does Not Recognize the So-Called Greater East Asia New Order

Chongqing – Foreign and domestic reporters asked Minister Wang about the attitude China would take regarding the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Minister Wang's response was as follows: The three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan signed an alliance in Berlin on September 27th. In it, Japan recognized the leadership of Germany and Italy in establishing the (European New Order), while Germany and Italy recognized Japan's leadership in establishing the so-called (Greater East Asia New Order). It is very clear that this provision completely disregards the legitimate status, rights, and interests of other countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the legitimate status, rights, and interests of countries outside of Europe and Asia in Europe and Asia, and attempts to destroy them. The Chinese government's long-standing goal has been to uphold the legitimate international order, so that all countries in the world can get along with each other on an equal and friendly footing. Regarding all (new orders) that are used as excuses to carry out aggression and undermine the legitimate world order, the Chinese government will, in accordance with its consistent policy in the past, resolutely oppose them. The Chinese government and people are determined to continue working hard to fight for the legitimate world order. The Chinese government absolutely does not recognize the so-called (Greater East Asia New Order), and even more so cannot recognize Japan's leadership in the so-called Greater East Asia. The agreements signed between other countries not only cannot affect China's legal status, rights, and interests, but also cannot in the slightest affect the attitude and policy of the Chinese government.

Chongqing – The Central Daily News' editorial today discussed the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, stating that the alliance is particularly aggressive towards the Soviet Union. Germany and Italy have openly recognized Japan's leadership in Asia, completely disregarding the fact that the Soviet Union also has vast territories and interests in Asia. The motive behind Japan's signing of this pact is to use Germany and Italy to intimidate Britain and the United States, so that they will hesitate to put strong pressure on Japan. This would allow Japan to devote all its efforts to ending the war against China. However, Germany and Italy are now preoccupied with matters in Europe and are unable to assist Japan in the Pacific. Therefore, this alliance is nothing more than empty talk on paper. It is expected that Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the various Asian nations will soon unite to jointly overthrow Japan's hegemony. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – The National Government will issue a statement today announcing China's attitude towards the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – Ta Kung Pao published an article advocating that China immediately recall its ambassador to Germany. The newspaper stated that "Hitler and Ribbentrop have never respected the friendly relations between China and the German business and military communities. Two years ago, Hitler recognized [Manchukuo] and recalled Trautmann (the German ambassador to China) and the German military advisors, and stopped selling arms to China. The National Government not only tolerated these actions by Germany, but also sent an envoy to Germany to consolidate Sino-German friendship. China asks itself, has it done anything to offend Germany? Today, Germany has recognized the Greater East Asia Order through the [Tripartite Military Alliance]. Although it may be impossible for Germany to provide material assistance to Japan as a result, the alliance has demonstrated Germany's hostility towards China. How the National Government will adjust Sino-German relations, we do not yet know. However, at the very least, we believe that recalling the ambassador to Germany as a sign of protest is necessary."

### Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao Discusses: Britain Should Aid China; Open the Burma Road as Soon as Possible; The Blockade Policy Cannot Change Japan's Attitude Towards Britain; The Sino-British-Burmese Cultural Associations Will Express Their Views

Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao stated to visitors that he believed Britain would reopen the Burma Road soon. He said that Britain must recognize that this blockade of the road will not affect Japan's hostile attitude towards Britain. Therefore, Britain should aid its friend China, rather than helping Japan, which is not joining the British defense line. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao stated yesterday that he believed Britain would quickly reopen the Burma Road to allow the passage of weapons for the Chinese army. It is said that Britain must now understand that compromise cannot change Japan's hostile attitude, which has been proven by the new alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. Ta Kung Pao stated that Japan's recent actions have released Britain from its treaty obligations to Japan. Whether for moral or legal reasons, Britain must immediately reopen the Burma Road. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – It was previously reported that various British aid-to-China groups had sent representatives to petition the Foreign Office to unconditionally open the Burma Road. Recently, the aid-to-China committee also mobilized the general public to send letters to the British government requesting this, which has deeply moved the Chinese people. Hang Liwu and Chen Xiying of the Sino-British Cultural Association recently sent a telegram in their personal capacity to Ms. 作萊, the former president of Oxford Women's College and leader of the aid-to-China groups, to express their gratitude and ask her to convey it to the various groups. It is also rumored that the Sino-British and Sino-Burmese cultural associations will jointly send a telegram to the aid-to-China committee with the anti-aggression association, the National Diplomacy Association, the League of Nations Association, etc. to express their views.

### Burmese Senate Debates National Defense

Rangoon – Burmese Senator U Kyaw Din of the opposition party moved that while the Burmese National Defense Bill was extremely welcome, its mismanagement had caused dissatisfaction among the people. U Kyaw Din detailed the mismanagement and said that the accusation against former Prime Minister Ba Maw was the result of political rivalry. Prime Minister U Pu spoke against the motion and compared the situation in 1939 with the situation this year, saying that the peace and tranquility seen in the country was the result of the government's efforts to maintain law and order. Burma's wartime relations were now in a very critical state. The Burmese National Defense Ordinance was designed to deal with emergencies, and the government never intended to restrict freedom of speech or oppress the people. However, if anyone conspired to rebel, the government would have to deal with them according to the law. Maintaining law and order was the government's responsibility. The government's handling of Ba Maw was not because he was a political enemy, but because he was obstructing the war effort. After the Prime Minister's speech, the opposition's motion was defeated by a vote of 12 to 8. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### War Breaks Out Between Chinese and Japanese Troops on the Vietnamese Border; Japanese Troops in Southern China Plan to Continue to Hanoi; Rumors of Vietnam Preparing to Move Capital to Seek Strong Resistance; Sumita Appointed Chief of the Japanese Supervisory Group in Vietnam

Chongqing – On September 27th, a reconnaissance plane flew into Yunnan territory along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. This was the first time that Japanese planes had used Vietnamese territory. Two teams of Japanese troops entered Vietnam from Dong Dang. Japanese troops are now landing at Lang Son (transliteration) and two locations north and south of Hai Phong. Chinese and Japanese troops are now fighting at Ya Dian (transliteration) near the Vietnamese border. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – According to information received here, Chinese troops are still stationed on the Yunnan border and the government has not yet issued orders to enter Vietnamese territory. When a government spokesman was asked if Chinese troops would enter Vietnam, he replied that Chinese troops intended to wait for an opportunity to enter Vietnam, but that Chinese troops were currently stationed on the Yunnan border to await clarification of the situation in Vietnam. The situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic. According to informed sources, the Vietnamese authorities have changed their attitude no fewer than four times, and the Japanese have also changed twice. Therefore, it is almost impossible for outsiders to obtain an accurate understanding of the situation in Vietnam. Even the French ambassador to China has not been informed of the latest developments. The French ambassador is even considering suggesting that he personally go to Chongqing to discuss the matter with the National Government. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo – According to information obtained here, Japanese Army Colonel 青村 has been killed in action in Vietnam. After being wounded on the 25th, he was hospitalized for treatment, but immediately went to the front line and suffered another head injury, which proved fatal. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Tokyo – The Army Command announced today that Lieutenant General Sumita has been appointed as the Chief of the Japanese Supervisory Group in Vietnam, succeeding Lieutenant General 四原. 四原 was the Japanese representative who signed the Franco-Japanese Agreement on September 22nd. After the Franco-Japanese conflict in Lang Son, he went to request 安騰, the commander of the Japanese army in Southern China, to withdraw troops, but to no avail. He then went to Tokyo to report and returned to Hanoi. Today, he visited the Governor of Vietnam, de Coo. (30th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo – According to a special correspondent for Chugai Shimbun in Hong Kong, it is reported that Thai troops have advanced 40 miles into Vietnam. (30th United Press dispatch)

Hanoi – News today is that the evacuation of wounded French soldiers from Lang Son is underway, and efforts will also be made to seek the release of French prisoners of war in Lang Son. Franco-Japanese representatives went to Lang Son today to discuss the evacuation of wounded French officers and soldiers. It is estimated that there are about 1,000-2,000 Vietnamese soldiers captured by the Japanese army in Lang Son. Negotiations for the release of these prisoners are expected to be held soon. (30th United Press dispatch)

Hanoi – The leader of the Japanese delegation to Annam, 西原, and his team returned to Hanoi yesterday afternoon. They may visit the Governor of Annam, de Coo, today. The Japanese side seems to be planning to negotiate with the French authorities again, in order to have a basis for allowing the Japanese troops who invaded Southern Hanoi from the north last week to continue to Hanoi without resistance. It is believed that if the French authorities are forced to grant this request by the Japanese, the capital may be moved to the south, outside the Japanese-occupied area, to seek strong resistance and deal with further Japanese aggression. It is heard that European and American people residing in Haiphong must obtain supplementary certificates from the Japanese in order to travel. (30th United Press dispatch)

Hanoi – Yesterday, the Haiphong transportation department took down and tore up the American flag hanging on the roof of the American Far East Transportation Company and occupied the company's wharves. This company was engaged in shipping American goods to China through the Annam border before the blockade, without being suppressed by the Japanese. It is heard that this unexpected incident between the United States and Japan in Haiphong was resolved within hours of the Japanese army's invasion of the wharves. The Japanese army apologized to the United States for insulting the American flag and promised to evacuate the wharves. (30th United Press dispatch)

Vichy – French government officials denied yesterday the British news of the Chinese army entering Vietnam, believing that this rumor was a strategy by British enterprises to divert the attention of various countries after the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, so that various countries would no longer pay attention to the wavering of Britain's position in Asia. (30th Huitong dispatch)

Annam Front – French troops along the line 75 miles northeast of Hanoi, south of Lang Son, are very active today, preparing to cope with the renewed aggression of Japanese troops from Southern China. However, the front line is quite quiet. French officers said that no shots had been fired in three days, but pro-Japanese guerilla squads often harassed the "no man's land" between the two armies. These guerilla squads are said to include Japanese, Chinese, and Annamese. French troops have received instructions not to open fire easily unless attacked, so they are still strictly following the instructions. However, according to my impression from the French headquarters, the French army is unlikely to repeat the evacuation from Lang Son, and must be fully prepared before moving. The Japanese army occupied Lang Son without attacking in advance, waiting until a large army had surrounded the city before giving the French army an unexpected attack, making it impossible for the French army to resist, and ultimately giving the Japanese army the opportunity to invade. Japanese reconnaissance planes are still constantly appearing over the French army's positions, constantly scouting, and occasionally Japanese search teams, with Annamese as guides, have repeatedly approached the front line. French officers said that they had no search personnel out, so they hoped that conflict could be avoided. However, local troops and French foreign legions have formed strong fortresses at the entrance of the valley here, with two wings forming along the high mountains. Because this small valley is the hub of the railway and highway connecting Lang Son and Hanoi, before the number, when Japanese tank units fired in succession, the French army would blow up the Yuehe railway bridge, causing the Japanese army to make no progress. I visited the French headquarters, which is only a few miles from the front line. French officers were very welcoming to me and provided French bread and red wine to the guests. They lamented the fact that the United States failed to sell airplanes to Annam last June, and recognized that the reason why Lang Son fell into enemy hands was the result of implementing the policy of "I will not attack unless attacked." Because they had always adopted a tolerant attitude, although they were ready for battle, they still hoped until the last minute that the Japanese army in Southern China would change its attitude and stop its attacks on France. The most regrettable thing is that beforehand, the French army in the Lang Son stronghold firmly believed that Major General 西原 could mediate and prevent the actions of the Japanese army in Southern China, but unexpectedly the Japanese army had crossed the border and surrounded Lang Son without anyone knowing. As a result, the city wall fell without a fight. Moreover, the majority of the soldiers in the French foreign legion in Lang Son were captured by the Japanese army when Lang Son fell. About 140 French officers escaped the trap, but eventually escaped. Therefore, all kinds of stories about escaping are told everywhere and are very interesting. According to a report received by the French headquarters, eight French officers were arrested by the Japanese army and attempted to escape, but were discovered by the Japanese army, who then slowly stabbed them with bayonets, stopping after each stab. The eight officers died miserably in succession. Refugees who fled saw the eight corpses lying on the road to Lang Son, covered in wounds, which was heartbreaking. French officials continued, generally speaking, the Japanese army's treatment of French prisoners was not bad. Most stories inevitably have exaggerations. When I was staying at the French headquarters, a local cook came to report that the body of a dead French officer, who was found near Lang Son, had been buried by him out of pity for his exposed corpse. Another officer suddenly came in from outside, looking terrified, saying that he had just escaped from the Japanese. The Japanese were clearly trying to carry out a pan-movement to exclude all "white people" in Annam. French officers said that they had many solid pieces of evidence for the Japanese's intentions. The Japanese are now distributing leaflets there, explaining the meaning of the "New Order in East Asia" and calling on the natives to overthrow the French. But the most important call is to warn the Annamese not to oppose Japan, otherwise there will be unfavorable consequences. The hero of France in this battle should be 勞維梯氏, who intended to negotiate with the Japanese army in Southern China in a friendly manner, but was unexpectedly shot and killed by the Japanese army, failing to achieve his ambition and dying for his country. It is said to be tragic. (29th Special Forces Reporter Jack Jacob dispatch)

### National Government Will Allocate Huge Sums of Money to Aid Students

Educational circles in Chongqing recently stated that students in Free China are now living on the line of food shortage. It is heard that the National Government will maintain the food supply of university students and youths with 5 million yuan of national currency per year. However, food prices are extremely expensive, so professors are encouraging schools to raise livestock and grow vegetables. Most of the students from the occupied areas have no relatives or families in Free China. If there is no government assistance, they will really have no way to make a living.

Editorial

### International Divide and Conquer vs. Total Liquidation

After Germany, Italy, and Japan signed their alliance, this newspaper analyzed the essence of the alliance and its relationship with the Far East in the previous two days. Today, we will further examine the international future after the three countries formed the alliance.

The signing of the Tripartite Pact took place on September 27th. In these four days, the three countries have not taken any new actions based on the alliance, and other countries have not shown any concrete reactions to the alliance. However, several points related to the alliance are worth noting: (1) The US authorities have stated that their unlimited assistance to Britain will be extended to Australia and New Zealand. They insist on their original policy in the Far East, which is that all countries must fully respect the legitimate rights of Americans, respect all international treaties and agreements that the US has participated in, and maintain equal opportunities in trade. Furthermore, many members of Congress and public opinion leaders advocate for providing as much assistance as possible to China and Britain against Japan. The change in the Navy's planned phased return to the Pacific coast, namely moving the base from Hawaii to the Philippines, has not been denied by the US authorities. (2) The British authorities publicly warned Japan to abandon its policy of compromise, stating that Britain's attitude is different now than before, and "Japan will soon discover" this. (3) The Chinese authorities have expressed their unwavering determination to continue resisting Japan and strive for final victory. (4) The Japanese authorities have admitted to widespread hunger and poverty within the country, and see the alliance as a gamble on the nation's fate. (5) The German authorities have stated that the issue of the Dutch East Indies' sphere of influence was not mentioned in the alliance. As for the Soviet Union's arms assistance to China, Germany does not believe it contradicts the Tripartite Pact and therefore will not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing its assistance. (6) The Soviet authorities and press have made no comments on the alliance, displaying an attitude of quiet observation. Since the reconciliation between Germany and the Soviet Union and the war between Britain and Germany, the Soviet Union has supported Germany in various ways for over a year. This time, their lack of comment can at least be seen as encouragement for the three countries' alliance.

The above six points are the most noteworthy expressions from various parties in these four days. As for the international future after the three countries formed the alliance, whether the treaty will be gradually developed in multiple directions based on these six points remains to be seen. It is not necessary to make any optimistic conclusions prematurely. It is by no means necessarily pessimistic; at least for now, the three countries have not sown new factors that will change the international situation. If the international situation is indeed pessimistic, it is not solely due to the Tripartite Pact. The roots of the Tripartite Pact run deep, even before the Anti-Comintern Pact. The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact also had its origins and was by no means a sudden coincidence. Starting with the Anti-Comintern Pact, the key lies in the fact that Germany, Italy, and Japan needed to exploit and collude with each other, and then establish a treaty. At that time, they expediently put an anti-communist label on the treaty. Before August of last year, the anti-communist facade was embellished with various postures, both real and fake. Some countries joined the treaty later, and some implicitly sympathized with it. It was all about anti-communism and anti-Soviet Union. In reality, it was only the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries. It had nothing to do with the participants or sympathizers, nor did it have anything to do with the communism or the Soviet Union that they were opposing. Then, in August of last year, the Soviet Union and Germany suddenly announced their reconciliation, seemingly contradicting the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Soviet Union seemed to have gained something, while Britain and France seemed to have lost something. In reality, the existence or abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact was never the issue; the proximity or estrangement from communism or the Soviet Union was merely expedient. The key was still the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries. Adapting to the environment based on this key, they eventually merged into this alliance. Therefore, the entire international community's interests, fortunes, and misfortunes have long been affected by the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries, and the Tripartite Pact has neither increased nor decreased this influence.

Analyzing the current predicament of the entire international community from this perspective, will it be resolved separately through divide and conquer, or will it promote cooperation and total liquidation? This is what every country is hesitating about in the midst of the turmoil. The three countries are like this, and so are all countries outside the three. Although the Tripartite Pact has no new content, it has brought other countries, and indeed the entire international community, closer to a crossroads, urging them to quickly choose a path. In general, the nature of an alliance is to cooperate, but the intention of the three countries is to divide and conquer the entire international community and resolve issues separately. This is their fundamental principle. Not only that, but this principle will be used by the three countries to deal with all other countries, and will eventually be applied to the three countries themselves. The purpose of this alliance is not active cooperation, but only to passively prevent other countries from cooperating, in order to cover up their aggression through divide and conquer. In the past, they prevented other countries from cooperating, and thus succeeded in Abyssinia in Africa, Czechoslovakia and Poland in Europe, and so on. Now, they are targeting China and Britain, hoping to achieve divide and conquer, but they fear cooperation from other countries, so they have formed an alliance. If the alliance proves effective in the future and they succeed in their goals, they will naturally each choose their next target. Because when they can no longer prevent other countries from cooperating, the alliance's expiration date will arrive, and they will engage in a global struggle, accepting a total liquidation. This is something that the three countries cannot avoid, but it is definitely not their intention in forming the alliance at present.

As for the countries outside the three, such as China and Britain, who do not want to be defeated and are unwilling to be resolved, they naturally welcome more assistance and are happy to cooperate with other countries. But they have already started resisting Japan and are determined to fight to the end independently, so they have no dilemma. Other countries, such as the United States, should not be blind to the overall situation and hope to escape being targeted in the future. If they are facing a dilemma, will they assist China and Britain and wait for them to restrain the other party on their own, or will they directly step forward? Both of these paths fall within the scope of cooperation, but differ in degree. Within this same scope, will they take effective action in the near future, or will they wait for their large-scale military expansion plan to be completed? These two paths differ in timing. The Soviet Union must also not be blind to the overall situation and hope to escape being targeted, but they have an additional layer of awareness compared to the United States: how will the boundaries of nation and the realm of ideology be combined? Can they be truly understood? This is a dilemma. If they cannot obtain absolutely reliable guarantees that ideology can penetrate the nation, they will gladly cooperate to curb aggression and will never sit idly by and wait for being divided and conquered. This is something that can be inferred and known.

### Washington Experts Predict Economic War Between US and Japan: Roosevelt Claims Industrial and Defense Cooperation, Japanese Worried War with US Is Inevitable

Washington - Washington's diplomatic experts predict a prolonged and intense economic war will occur between the United States and Japan, but a military conflict is not immediately likely. For the sake of both countries' interests, avoiding war for as long as possible is best. This is the opinion of foreign diplomats and military observers generally. The reporter saw this in today's interviews in various newspapers. Experts said a war in the Pacific would shift America's important war industry strength to the Far East, but this strength is needed now to assist Britain against Germany. Authorities told reporters the US government considers the Sino-Japanese war a subsidiary, the ultimate reality being the outcome of the European war. If Britain loses, the US must abandon its interests in the Far East Pacific. Whether Japan should preserve its spoils of war will follow Hitler's orders. Hitler may let Japan keep its spoils to contain the Soviet Union. However, he may reaffirm his "Aryan superiority" and force Japan to disgorge what it has gained. Officials here pointed out Hitler has not treated Japan well in the past. When the Soviet Union threatened Japan, Hitler signed an agreement with the Soviet Union. But soon Hitler lured Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. (International News Agency dispatch, 30th)

Washington - President Roosevelt said last night that the result of Germany, Italy and Japan signing an alliance will cause the United States to immediately intensify its military preparedness to cope with the threats on both the eastern and western fronts. The President also wrote to Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox, expressing confidence that America's industries will continue to cooperate with the administration's defense programs indefinitely, and expressing his hope that the industrial sector would automatically supply defense materials on an unlimited basis. He also said that when the Army and Navy feel the need to establish commission contracts, they should first submit them to the National Defense Commission for review. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

Tokyo - Mr. Yamamoto, editor of the "Improvement Magazine", recently returned from a world tour and said that German and Italian people believe that war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. Mr. Yamamoto wrote in the latest issue of the magazine: "The military strength of both countries has been studied by Germany and Italy using the false image of a Japanese-American war. Judging from the current state of military equipment, German and Italian people believe that if a war occurs in the Pacific, Japan will win, because Japanese naval officers and soldiers are better trained than those in the United States. German and Italian people said that if the war takes place near the Philippines or the China Sea, the US fleet has no chance of victory. I was very interested to hear the same view in Moscow." Mr. Yamamoto continued, "I am not a naval expert and cannot publish statistics on warships, but in terms of technical personnel, I believe that Japan can gain the upper hand over the United States in a war. Some Japanese people estimate that the United States' strength is above Japan's, which I find incomprehensible." Mr. Yamamoto said that the United States does not intend to fight Japan, and if it were not for the troubles from Washington, they would invest in "Manchuria." Mr. Yamamoto hinted that Japan also does not want to go to war with the United States. He said, "Japan has no territorial ambitions in the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. Japan needs the trade of the Dutch East Indies because the United States is unwilling to sell gasoline to Japan." Yamamoto criticized China for not cooperating with Japan to "liberate the nations of East Asia from Western oppression." He said, "China still dreams that it can rely on European powers, the United States and the Soviet Union to resist Japan. If so, Japan will have to fight alone. I do not mean that Japan should make enemies of the world. I am advocating for increasing friendly ties with Germany and Italy, and we still have some issues to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union." Although Mr. Yamamoto advocates for close ties with Germany and Italy, he said that Japan "should be wary of Germany's global plans and ambitions." He said that once Germany establishes hegemony in Europe, it will seek markets in South America and will compete with Japan in some parts of the Far East. Japan should also carefully consider Germany's territorial intentions in the Far East. Yamamoto said that no matter what changes occur in Europe, Japan should maintain its leadership position in the Far East. "In terms of Asia, Japan will not be subject to pressure from any side." (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

Tokyo - A Tokyo newspaper said today that Japan has reorganized its industrial and economic structures to cope with possible economic retaliation from Britain and the United States. The newspaper said that the National Design Committee has reconfigured Japan's economic needs to cope with the American embargo on scrap iron and steel. The newspaper also said that the United States refused to buy Japanese silk, and Japan will retaliate by refusing to buy American cotton. (International News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### Soviet Union Closely Monitors Developments in the Far East: Germany, Italy, and Japan Military Alliance Concluded, Will Prompt US, Soviet Union, and Britain to Cooperate

Moscow - Soviet newspapers yesterday remained silent on the matter of the military alliance formed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. However, Moscow newspapers all prominently published the statement issued by US Secretary of State Hull regarding the agreement. Soviet newspapers also reprinted opinions from American newspapers, believing that the new Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis will lead the United States to cooperate more closely with Britain and promote Britain's ultimate victory. Yesterday, the Pravda published a lengthy analytical special article examining the economic recovery of the United States due to its expansion of military preparedness and increased US exports to Britain. (TASS dispatch, 30th)

Moscow - Soviet newspapers mostly published in prominent positions US Secretary of State Hull's revelation of the existence of a long-standing relationship revealed by the alliance agreement among Germany, Italy, and Japan. They also revealed a long dispatch from the TASS news agency in New York regarding the increasing output of the US arms industry. Trud reprinted a study from Izvestia that the US Navy in the Pacific is superior to the Japanese Navy. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Moscow - Political circles here are paying close attention to the developments in the Far East. The issues of Southeast Asia have overshadowed other issues, which is quite satisfying. Izvestia reported that TASS's New York report said that US economic circles are expected to continue to expand the disputes in the Far East and that the possibility of US involvement in the war has greatly increased. Another report from New York discussed the increase in cooperation between Britain and the United States, paying particular attention to the recent negotiations between the British ambassador and the US State Department regarding the United States increasing its arms aid to Britain. (Haitong Telegraph dispatch, 30th)

European and Asian Wars Will Further Expand

Moscow - Pravda today published a commentary titled "The Tripartite Alliance in Berlin," stating, "The military alliance among Germany, Italy, and Japan has been signed in Berlin. From the Soviet Union's perspective, this agreement is not unexpected, because the relationship among the three countries has existed in practice for a long time. At the same time, before the agreement was announced, the German government had notified the Soviet government in advance." Regarding the significance of this agreement, we should first note that the agreement foreshadows a new stage of the war. In this new stage, the intensity of the war will be even greater than before the agreement was signed. The European and Asian wars were originally divided into the European, African, and Chinese theaters, but now that Japan has abandoned its policy of non-intervention in European affairs, the two theaters have merged into one. This shows that the war will further expand. In the last session of the Supreme Soviet, Molotov said, "There is currently a crisis of war expanding and forming a world imperialist war." These words are true. So, what are the motives and reasons for the signing of this agreement? Undoubtedly, the main motivation for the conclusion of the agreement is the expansion of British and American military cooperation. For example, the United States has recently stepped up its military assistance to Britain, Britain has transferred its naval base in the Western Hemisphere to the United States, British-Canadian military forces are uniting with the United States, South American countries are joining the US sphere of influence, and Britain has agreed to transfer its bases in the Far East and Australia to the United States. Undoubtedly, the United States has not yet joined the fighting to aid Britain, but this is not important. The fact is that Germany, Italy and Japan are an opposing military front.

Soviet Union's Policy of Peace Will Not Change

The agreement is an open recognition of the spheres of influence of each of the signatory countries and an agreement on joint defense against any infringement by other countries (primarily Britain and the United States) on their spheres of influence. According to this agreement, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is assigned to Japan, and the "European Sphere" belongs to Germany and Italy. As to whether the signatory countries will be able to realize the division of their spheres of influence is another question. The realization of this plan will depend on the true strength of the relationship between the belligerent countries, as well as the progress and outcome of the current war. The current war has become increasingly sharp. Another key point of the agreement is the reserved attitude towards the Soviet Union. The agreement states, "Germany, Italy and Japan declare that this agreement does not affect the existing political relations between the signatory countries and the Soviet Union." This reserved attitude should first be regarded as a reaffirmation of the signatory countries' attitude of neutrality towards the Soviet Union (since the first day of the outbreak of the war, the Soviet Union has maintained this attitude of neutrality). Secondly, this agreement confirms the strength and importance of the non-aggression pacts between the Soviet Union and Germany and between the Soviet Union and Italy. The Soviet Union is determined to pursue its neutral and peaceful policy. We hereby solemnly confirm that this neutral and peaceful policy will continue to remain unchanged in the future.

### Tokyo Foreign Ministry Announces Withdrawal of Japanese Nationals from Britain: Spokesman Talks About the Characteristics of the Tripartite Pact, Technical Committee Members to be Appointed Soon

Tokyo - Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced that the Japanese Embassy in London has ordered 750 Japanese nationals in Britain to evacuate as soon as possible. It is said that this measure is not related to the possible deterioration of British-Japanese relations after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact among Germany, Italy, and Japan. The difficulties encountered by Japanese nationals are increasing, especially in the London area. As a result of German air raids, the business of Japanese-owned hotels, apartments, and shops has been suspended. Only the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui & Co., and a few other commercial firms continue to operate. The Japanese Embassy has instructed Nippon Yusen Kaisha to send the Hi-Mishima Maru, currently in Lisbon, to London to evacuate the first batch of 150 to 200 Japanese nationals.

Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters today that although Japan has concluded the Tripartite Pact, it still maintains neutrality in the European war. This pact is not an alliance, nor is it merely a mutual assistance agreement. Its scope exceeds a military alliance. The salient feature is that the first and second clauses stipulate that the signatory countries jointly strive for the establishment of a new order in East Asia and Europe. This agreement is constructive and defensive in nature, and its various characteristics should not be underestimated. The three signatory countries are now working together to establish a new order in order to save the world from turmoil and the horrors of war. Japan has no intention of invoking the Tripartite Pact to challenge or attack any other country. The English translation of the outline of the agreement includes all the important points of the original text and does not omit anything. The spokesman also declared in response to a question on whether this agreement will complicate Japan's relationship with other countries that the agreement simplifies the relationship between Britain and Japan, because Britain now has only one path to follow for Japan, which is to recognize the new order in this part of the world, and any country that opposes the new order will be deemed to refuse to cooperate with Japan. At this point, the spokesman reiterated that Japan has never given up hope of adjusting its relations with Britain and the United States. Asked whether the Tripartite Pact will delay Japan's appointment of a diplomatic representative to Australia, he replied that the two matters are not related. The spokesman indicated that Japan's newly appointed ambassador to Canada, Yoshizawa, has now departed to take office, and the government will appoint an ambassador to Australia in the near future. A reporter asked whether the joint technical committee stipulated in the Tripartite Pact has been appointed. The spokesman replied that the members of the joint committee will be appointed soon. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Hong Kong - Tokyo News, A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, regarding how the "attack" situation in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact among Germany, Italy, and Japan is constituted, should be jointly explained by the three signatory countries. The term "attack" does not need to refer specifically to an actual war or a declaration of war. (Dispatch, 30th)

### Tungsten Ore Industry Transported to US via Vietnam

Chongqing - Since the US Export-Import Bank lent China a new loan of US$25 million to meet China's foreign exchange needs, tungsten ore has taken on a new and important position. According to reports, China recently exported 6,000 tons of tungsten ore from Haiphong, divided into two ships and transported to the United States, and has reportedly reached its destination. China exported a total of 7,300 tons of tungsten ore in the first seven months of this year. The China Resources Commission is now working to solve transportation difficulties. It is estimated that China's total annual output of tungsten ore is 16,000 tons, including 8,000 tons from Jiangxi Province, 4,000 tons from Guangdong Province, 2,500 tons from Guangxi Province, 1,200 tons from Henan Province, and 1,000 tons from Yunnan Province.

### Japanese Newspapers Launch Major Intimidation, Threatening Dutch East Indies, Advocate Withdrawing Envoys and Ceasing Negotiations, Forcing Them to Break Away from the US and Cooperate with Japan

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today unanimously appealed that unless the Dutch East Indies government can guarantee that all anti-Japanese elements have been completely eliminated, Japan should immediately disrupt the ongoing negotiations. The Hochi Shimbun stated that after Japan and Germany and Italy signed the strong military alliance of the three, the situation in the Pacific has greatly changed. It believes that Japan should immediately recall its special envoy to the Dutch East Indies and order him to quickly return to Tokyo. The newspaper stated, "Negotiating with the East Indies government now is tantamount to 'putting the cart before the horse'. Moreover, the prerequisite for conducting negotiations must be to eliminate all anti-Japanese attitudes before it can be done." Dutch officials should express their willingness to cooperate with Japan to build a "Greater East Asia" before there is room for peaceful negotiations. Because the East Indies has always relied on the United States in military and economic aspects, if the East Indies does not break away from its dependence on the United States, then Japan's continued negotiations with it will be fundamentally useless. At the same time, the Kokumin Shimbun stated that Japan's older politicians are advising Prime Minister Konoe to convene an extraordinary Diet to show Japan's 100% unified support after the alliance of the three powers. The newspaper also stated that the government will soon launch a large-scale campaign to complete Japan's national defense. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

### US Foreign Policy Association Asks For Expanding Aid to China, Because China Is the First Line of Defense in Asia for Western Countries

Washington - The Foreign Policy Association today issued an article discussing Japan's advance into Southeast Asia, and stated that China is actually the first line of defense in Asia for Western countries. The Association's interviewer, expert Bisson, studied the pressure that Japan is exerting on European countries, and stated that its gains are actually being given by Britain and France. As a result of the most recent developments, the United States has become the primary enemy. From now on, it is not impossible to find effective methods to suppress Japan. Bisson stated in brief, "China's four years of resistance war, the current standing is more obvious, foreign aid can be greatly expanded". It is also said, "If the countries do not supply China with heavy weapons and large quantities of arms again, the country's resistance war strength will be reduced. Japan has not made major progress in China last year, and it has gained quite a lot from European countries." Bisson concluded that Japan can clearly pay attention to and sense world developments.

### Nazi Party's Overseas Activities Cost 200 Million US Dollars Annually: US Navy Zhang Publishes Report

Washington - US Navy Captain Theodore Dra and well-known reporter Morey recently collaborated on an article that describes in detail the organization and activities of the Nazi Party abroad. The article is over two thousand words long and has now been disclosed by US Navy Secretary Knox, and is listed as one of the Nazi activity investigation reports. The words say: Hitler's great military achievements are certainly the effect of using Germans and the "Fifth Column" to engage in work in the victimized countries, but we then have the following question: how did this great achievement become possible? How did the Germans abroad sacrifice themselves for the Nazi government? How did foreigners living under more moderate and civilized governments voluntarily betray their home countries and pledge allegiance to Hitler's Germany? In our view, it is extremely mysterious. It must be known that the Nazi Party spends US$200 million annually on overseas organizations and propaganda, which is the answer to this question. The amount of this summary is huge, which is a secret. Nazi Germany is not a government, and is not even like what Nazi orators call a "national state," but is actually a secret, conspiratorial gang. Its scope of action is universal, and its goal is to dominate the world. Its important overseas envoys, like the millions of Germans within Germany and residing abroad, can be used or forced to serve Germany. The first step in its activities is to make foreign German expatriates follow its doctrine. The second step is to deal with its real enemies or those it deems to be enemies through assassination and kidnapping. The last step is to use armed unrest to deal with foreign countries that Hitler wants to conquer or annex. This kind of German unrest has already been applied to Czechoslovakia, Austria and the Netherlands. If it were not for the firm attitude of the United States, many researchers believe that this kind of unrest would have already occurred in Brazil. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

### Stirling's Loud Appeal: Japan is America's Enemy; America Should Strive to Defend Itself and Aid Britain

New York – U.S. Admiral Stirling recently issued a statement saying that Japan is America's enemy. He stated, "Japan's alliance with the Axis powers clearly shows that it is an enemy of the United States. Japan is constantly afraid that the United States might change its verbal protests into actual actions, or even resort to war for a fundamental solution. Japan should at least know that the U.S. fleet can launch fierce warfare from the large naval base using Singapore and by taking an offensive from British territories or the Philippines on Japan's main sea lanes, to undermine Japan's economic security in the East and defeat Japan's troops in China. If Japan continues its hostile aims in the Far East and expands its aggression southward, its obvious action would be to seek a military alliance to resist the United States. Now that Japan has allied with Germany and Italy, the United States should consider this alliance as a warning and threat to our country's sovereignty in the Philippines. Japan has, through this alliance, informed our country that it will not hesitate to realize its ambition to build a new order in Asia. We must now recognize that Japan is prepared to control the entire Vietnam, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. If the United States interferes, Japan will receive assistance from Germany and Italy. Our current policy should be to carefully await a policy of fighting in the Pacific. We must defend Hawaii and the Pacific coast. An almighty nation should recognize that America's policy is for self-defense, to continue to maintain the American way of life, and to save Britain from failure, which is also America's main goal."

### British Navy Vigilant Against Germany: Hitler's Invasion Crisis Still Exists in Autumn and Winter

British Naval Port – A Reuters naval correspondent reports that the Navy warns the people not to have the illusion that the coming of autumn and winter will eliminate the invasion crisis, that coastal climate has a great impact on Hitler's England plan. It is about to turn from sunny to cloudy. The general public may inevitably believe that the opportunity to invade England has passed with the arrival of autumn and winter, thinking that the flat-bottomed boats needed to transport troops across the sea cannot be used in the future stormy waves. It must be known that climate change is not constant, and there may occasionally be calm seas in autumn and winter, allowing flat-bottomed boats to safely cross the sea. Moreover, in the next few weeks, the tranquil time at sea, the so-called second summer, may come. If the Germans hope to wait for an opportunity and attack the unprepared English, they will definitely be greatly disappointed. The Blue British Navy is always vigilant. Preparations at the French Channel ports are still underway. This can be seen as further evidence that the invasion of England is still possible, because the German side's continued preparations on the French coast are not only intended to contain the British bomber squadrons, making them unable to concentrate on attacking more important military targets.

### Intensified Struggle Between British and German Air Forces: Air Raid Scope Increasingly Expands; British Aircraft Groups Bomb Western German Cities; Edinburgh and Other Places Suffer from German Night Raids

London – Britain and Germany have now increased the speed of their mutual air raids and expanded their bombing ranges. This can be seen from the German aircraft's bombing of many cities in the British interior and the British aircraft's retaliatory attacks on the German bases for invading England and various industrial areas in Germany. Yesterday, German aircraft adopted evasive and sudden advance tactics over London, attempting to break through the London air defense circle separately all day without success. When night fell, German aircraft changed to using group charge tactics and finally broke into the airspace above this British capital. London then entered its twenty-third night under aerial siege amidst the incessant roar of anti-aircraft guns. Several German aircraft resolutely attempted to break in but were repelled. However, they finally crossed the London air defense line and bombed heavily, causing many deaths. German aircraft also flew northwest and east of London to bomb and made their first attack on Dover in several days. A large gas plant in London was destroyed by bombs falling like hail. Residents in several areas of the city had no gas for cooking and lighting. A hospital in the central area was also heavily damaged. During the German air raid on Dover, several bombs happened to hit a garden where the first German bomb fell during the Great European War. (30th International News Agency Dispatch)

London – The British aircraft that raided Berlin were hampered by bad weather, completing the 600-mile flight to the German capital at the scheduled midnight hour. They located the Frederickville power station and the main power transformer station in the western district and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The British aircraft also succeeded in bombing the railway junction 65 miles west of Berlin. Other British aircraft concentrated on bombing railway traffic, hitting the railway junction of Hamburg and the main station of Hanover. The woods next to the railway line near Bremen were also set on fire. Continuous explosions occurred in the target area of Wroclaw for ten minutes. Hanover was attacked by British aircraft for two hours. In addition to damage to the docks, merchant ships in the port were likely hit by two bombs. A pilot described the bombing of the Hanover arsenal, saying, "When we arrived at Hanover, one of the two rectangular buildings of the arsenal was already on fire, so we repeatedly swooped down to bomb the other building. The building and the surrounding houses also caught fire, and thick smoke rose to a thousand feet." (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### European War Musings (10) (5) Germany's New Military Science

The original author of this article, Hoffman Nickerson, is an American military strategist who served in the US Army General Staff during the last World War. He has written many books on military science. The original article appeared in the August issue of Harpers' Magazine. It is translated as follows:

The new tactics and strategies of Germany, which have astonished the world, are not really mysterious. On the contrary, their general principles are familiar to all educated military personnel and those who pay attention to warfare. As for the deployment and application of paratrooper units and new weapons rumored but not yet confirmed, details still await future exploration. Generally speaking, however, Germany's recent military operations in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands completely followed the pattern of the Polish and Norwegian campaigns. In these campaigns, the German army did not try to produce any miracles but instead completed their achievements with two special characteristics: rapid use of troops and flexible coordination.

The progress of new military technology is an inevitable result of the experience of the last World War. Since November 1918, such military theories have been studied and discussed in various aspects.

Most of the decisive battles between 1914 and 1918 can serve as a marker of what should be improved and what should be avoided in future wars. The last war was won through attrition. After the deaths of over ten million soldiers and even more civilians, the bankruptcy of various industries, and the collapse of the vast society of the Russian Empire, Germany finally disintegrated. The price of this strategy was very high, and the outcome was equally miserable for the victors and the vanquished, making it a truly unprofitable undertaking. Before the Western Front became stalemated and trench warfare developed in 1914, the German army had an opportunity to win in the Battle of the Marne. Four years later, in the spring of 1918, the German counter-offensive tactics again gave them a chance to win. Unfortunately, the German army did not seize these two opportunities firmly. In between, the heavily armed infantry and artillery of both sides were merely engaged in ineffective mutual bombardment, and everything else was powerless.

Military scholars from various countries, like ordinary people, have all drawn the same conclusion from this kind of situation, believing that such a phenomenon should not happen again in the future. General von Seeckt, a great figure in the German military and the founder of the new German army, summarized the lessons learned from the last World War in his book "Thoughts of a Soldier" as follows:

"What kind of results did such a national conscription produce? Even though all efforts were exhausted, the war did not end because the enemy army was finally annihilated on the battlefield; instead, this kind of war largely turned into a war of attrition for the possession of fortified positions, until one of the belligerent countries had its resources for resistance, replenishment of manpower, supply of raw materials, and morale for combat completely exhausted under the superior strength of the other side. But did the victorious countries enjoy their victory? Did the results of the war, with such a waste of national strength, make it worthwhile? … Military personnel cannot help but ask themselves whether they can come up with other strategies for decisive victory while avoiding indecisive wars of attrition. National conscription with universal conscription may no longer be applicable. … The people of the whole country are practically inflexible in their operation and inflexible in their command. … They cannot achieve victory and can only use pure force to defeat everything."

From all perspectives, new tactics were germinating in the latter half of the war from 1914 to 1918. This development was due to the application of internal combustion engines to mechanized units, which gave rise to tanks and aircraft. Aircraft certainly had practical utility in trench warfare, but this utility had its limits. As for the achievements of tanks, they were truly remarkable. In the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, the Allied forces initially used them to attack and unleash the power to break through the German lines. This attack, if assisted by appropriate forces, could have ended the war.

Military scholars who emphasize avoiding excessive bloodshed, excessive destruction, and excessive expenditure of money are divided into two factions. One faction, a minority, advocates the "air terror theory," whose famous representative is the Italian General Douhet. They believe in the power of bombers. According to this faction, a sudden large-scale attack by bombers, first destroying the enemy's air force and then using indiscriminate methods to bomb cities and create terror among civilians, could achieve victory overnight.

Although this proposition has gained the belief of some people, most military scholars do not pay attention to it. This majority faction can be represented by the late professor of Harvard University, the American military historian,械　庄师敦. In his famous book "Impressions of the 1918 Campaign," he said: "We have heard a lot from laymen and half-baked military scholars about theories that future wars can be decided with special weapons, such as bombers. The results obtained in the 1918 campaigns were the opposite... Never in the history of warfare has the coordination of various weapons been so important, and never has it been so difficult." In other words, thoughtful military and naval officers in various countries all understand that the more powerful aircraft become, the more important their cooperation with other military departments becomes, and the so-called other important military departments are the army and the navy.

As for the situation in Germany, on the one hand, it was deeply resentful of the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles. On the other hand, it was due to the benefits of that treaty that German military scholars were able to adjust various novel weapons created by modern industry.

In order to accomplish this arduous task, General von Seeckt formulated an operational plan for future land warfare, the content of which is divided into three actions. According to his theory, the current air force, since it is staffed by specialists serving for life, should be able to be dispatched at any time. Therefore, the air force should be the first force to act, and its task is first to destroy the enemy's air force, disperse the enemy's large army concentrations, hinder the enemy's mobilization of manpower and resources, and決者擊the enemy's cities, factories, and supply centers.

The second step stipulates that after the air force launches an attack, it should be followed as soon as possible by a full-scale attack by the regular army. The higher the efficiency of the army, the faster the mobilization, and the more flexible the command, the greater the chance of defeating the enemy, so that they can immediately sue for peace. The third step states that when the regular armies of the two belligerent parties are engaged on the front lines to seek a preliminary victory, the rear must quickly form a defensive force. After the front-line troops have achieved a preliminary victory, they can increase their attacking power through the supply of this kind of reserve army and supplies, while also preventing the enemy from reinforcing them in time.

In summary, General von Seeckt believes that future wars will be won by utilizing highly mobile troops. Such troops emphasize quality over quantity and are even more effective with the assistance of aircraft. According to him, once this kind of mobile combat unit is dispatched, it should preferably not be reinforced again, or if reinforcements are needed, the number should be very small.

General von Seeckt, the Builder of the New German Army

In this way, we can think of the situation in the Polish campaign last year. The new weapons mentioned in the three-part drama of General von Seeckt's combat are only the aircraft. Perhaps various new weapons were prohibited from being used by Germany at that time, or perhaps the smooth Prussian military deliberately avoided the word "tank." This point can be deduced from his writings. He said that although trench warfare is sufficient to gradually disintegrate a country with weaker material resources, the military objective is to achieve a final victory of annihilation. Therefore, future victory should be sought in mobile warfare. In this sense, that kind of army "cavalry" that excels in mobility should not be abandoned. What he calls "cavalry" actually refers to aircraft, motorcycles, armored vehicles, and tanks.

From the above, we can see how General von Seeckt emphasizes offensive warfare, which can truly represent the current German military ideal. Although the Germans also believe in the great power of modern defensive warfare, they know that only offensive warfare can achieve real results. The German authorities know that this is a difficult problem to solve, but they are still doing their best to solve it, which is the secret of the German army's success.

In war, as in other human activities, all ideas must be put into practice by people. With time, good officers can train good soldiers, but the time factor is very important. Today's German army has officers and soldiers who have received rigorous training. This is because of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. The number of German troops is small, and the result is naturally an emphasis on quality over quantity.

When the National Socialist government restored conscription and intensified the training of new soldiers, it was naturally more important than everything else. Military experts from various countries at the time were skeptical of how General von Seeckt's 100,000 elite soldiers could become the foundation of a million-strong army without impairing their combat capabilities. Such a sudden expansion and extremely large organization, with thousands of threads, would naturally be very difficult to complete the task.

The essence of the new tactics is not only limited to the use of new weapons but also requires elite soldiers to apply these new weapons. The astonishing speed of the German army's operations is entirely due to this.

The reason why the training of new German soldiers can save time is that the National Socialist Labor Service Corps has already provided preliminary training. Those new soldiers are already physically strong and well-trained. Once they enter the army, they can spend all their time training in the use of weapons. Air force personnel receive preliminary training through civil aviation.

The entire organization of the army and air force is entirely aimed at achieving maximum mobility and the most courageous attacks. Of the problems studied by the German Staff College, nine belong to the offensive and only one belongs to the defensive. In order to enable the artillery to quickly assist the infantry, the so-called "combat teams" responsible for mobile warfare are organized so that a regiment of infantry must have a battalion of field light artillery always following them.

In peacetime, in addition to the forty-two infantry divisions, there must be nine mechanized armored divisions. Each armored division has 14,000 officers and soldiers and 3,000 motorcycles. Each division is divided into three groups: (1) reconnaissance group, with 50 armored vehicles and a company of motorcycle infantry; (2) attack group, with 450 tanks; (3) position occupation group, with a motorized infantry brigade and a field artillery regiment. Armored divisions require more technicians, more mechanical repair personnel, signal personnel, and engineers who can quickly repair roads and bridges, as well as highly skilled combatants.

This kind of German armored force is like the armored cavalry of a hundred years ago. These armored divisions do not easily attack the enemy's positions with sufficient artillery because, at least before May of this year, no German tank could withstand artillery fire. Instead, they are used to break through the weakest point in the enemy's lines or to encircle both flanks, and then, in the enemy's rear, disrupt their lines and attack their headquarters. Therefore, their important role lies in disrupting the enemy's morale. The operational experience from 1914 to 1918 has made the German army realize that this kind of tactic is easier to carry out and more effective than artillery bombardment.

But the German army will never neglect the importance of infantry and artillery. Their tactics are to make the new and old weapons each get their place, and whether to focus on using new weapons or old weapons depends on the current situation.

In addition to technical preparations, Germany also conducts political preparations. In fact, war is nothing more than a political action because all wars are hostile actions of two large organized forces of people, and each group of people wants to force a policy on another group of people. Even a completely defensive policy is the same.

Germany's policy has always been aggressive. Whenever a country is attacked by Germany, Germany always uses people who sympathize with Germany to launch an internal attack and systematically disintegrate that country. At the same time, while studying how to attack the enemy with actual warfare, Germany also makes political attacks with sudden means, that is, fighting without declaring war.

Now it is time to talk about the experimental situation of Germany's new military science. After occupying Austria and Czechoslovakia without firing a shot or losing a soldier, Germany's first target was Poland.

### After the Alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Shanghai Circles Strengthen Their Belief That British-American Cooperation Is Beneficial to China; The Early Opening of the Burma Road Will Be Realized

Since the signing of the alliance by Germany, Italy, and Japan, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly turbulent. According to inquiries made by the Pingming News Agency reporters to relevant aspects of the diplomatic circles and concession authorities in Shanghai, authoritative opinions from all parties believe that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is beneficial and harmless to China's prospects for resisting Japan. The people of Shanghai are even more excited. However, all parties have expressed concern about the situation in Shanghai. Yesterday, various rumors spread in the Shanghai market, and the financial situation also underwent slight changes. Cash transactions were red,惨　$175, and the US exchange rate also showed a significant increase. However, the rumors in the market were all unfounded and untrustworthy.

American Defense Forces Send Troops to Defend

Starting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the American defense forces stationed in Shanghai sent troops to defend the American defense zone in the western district of the Public Concession. As a result, armed American soldiers were found patrolling in areas such as Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Road, Weihaiwei Road, and Hart Road. It is reported that the reason for the sudden dispatch of American soldiers yesterday was to assist in maintaining security within their defense zone.

Merchant Corps American Team Took Over Defense Last Night

In addition, the northern part of the central district of the Public Concession, that is, the western district of Hongkou, has been temporarily defended by the British teams of the International Merchant Corps, such as A-Yu Battalion, Light Cavalry Team, and Armored Vehicle Team, since the 4th of last month. However, at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, the American team of the Merchant Corps, that is, B Team, replaced the British teams and took over the defense of the district. This American team will defend the district from last night until the evening of the 4th. After that, the American and British Merchant Corps will take turns taking over in proportion to the number of people.

Hope for the Burma Road to Open Soon

Since the implementation of the closure of the Burma Road, it will expire on the 18th of this month. Foreigners in Shanghai are eagerly hoping to restore traffic on the road to promote commerce. Yesterday, according to well-informed sources from British merchants, the British government, in order to retaliate against the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to meet the needs of American freight, and to promote closer cooperation between the two countries, may open the road earlier. Currently, due to the chaotic situation in Vietnam and the obstruction of traffic, the transportation value of the Burma Road has increased even more. Now that Britain has no obligation to abide by the條的due to the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, implementing the opening earlier is the current key task for the British government to benefit both people and itself.

British-American Cooperation Is Beneficial to China

Yesterday, the Mainland News commented on the alliance of the three countries and the change in the attitude of Britain and the United States, mainly stating that Britain and the United States can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs and must take a firm and resolute path. In view of the recent statement by the British government spokesman that Japan will fight alongside Germany and Italy, the British government has probably decided to abandon its appeasement policy. Britain has become stronger after a year of war and will no longer compromise with Japan. Britain is very different from what it was a year ago. As for the United States, because the alliance of the three countries is entirely based on anti-Americanism, it has retaliated by granting China new loans and has reached mutual understanding with Britain on Far East policies and will take concerted action. Judging from the recent sharp comments of British officials, Britain will reopen the Burma Road, and the United States can also transport China's exported tungsten ore through this road. Britain is ready to cooperate with the United States to oppose Japan. To what extent Britain's new policy will affect the Far East cannot be estimated at present, but the reaction from Chongqing is already very obvious. The Chinese government has received the material and spiritual support of Britain and the United States. Judging from the closure of the Burma Road and Japan's invasion of Vietnam, Britain and the United States' attitude toward China is very ambiguous, but the conclusion of the three-nation恊定 has made their attitude stronger. In short, democratic countries will unite because of this and oppose appeasement. The voices of people in the United States who advocate war with Japan to seek national security are quite high. China and Britain are fighting for survival today, and the United States should provide as much material assistance as possible. Although the United States' geographical environment makes it far from actual conflict, it is impossible to avoid being involved in this漩渦, it is only a matter of time.

### Garbage Truck and Night Soil Cart Coolies All Resumed Work; Rice Subsidy Slightly Increased

The English Big Evening News reported that the coolies of the garbage trucks and night soil carts of the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau went on strike four days ago. By Saturday and Sunday, about 900 of them had announced their resumption of work. The remaining 600 people held a final demonstration on Sunde Road at 5:30 this morning (30th), dumping garbage and night soil on the road. However, by 6:00 a.m., these coolies had all resumed work. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has agreed to slightly increase the rice subsidy for the coolies, and the dispute has ended.

### Japanese Army Insults American Sailor; American Side Will Protest; Suffered Serious Injuries on Face and Body; Detailed Circumstances Are Being Closely Investigated; Admiral Hart Held an Important Meeting the Day Before Yesterday

On Saturday (28th) evening, a sailor from the flagship USS Augusta of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet had a conflict with Japanese plainclothes military police. It is said that at that time, the Japanese military police took the American sailor to the Bank of Communications building on the Bund and then insulted him. An official of the US Navy here confirmed the occurrence of this incident yesterday morning and said that the matter is currently under investigation by the US authorities, but he refused to disclose the name of the American sailor and the circumstances of the incident. He said that the matter must be fully investigated before a serious protest is lodged with the Japanese authorities.

Slightly Intoxicated; Suddenly Arrested and Beaten

Regarding this incident between the American sailor and the Japanese military police, it is said that at the time, the sailor was walking along the Bund, slightly intoxicated. When he reached the corner of Hankou Road, he was stopped by several Japanese military police and forced into the Bank of Communications building. The message also said that the Japanese military police beat the American sailor until he suffered serious injuries on his face and body. Finally, the Public Concession Police Department received a report and tried to rescue the American sailor, but the result was ineffective.

Repeated Negotiations; Finally Released

After the US Navy Shore Patrol received the report, it worked hard to get the American sailor released, but the result was also ineffective. However, late on that Saturday night, senior officials of the Asiatic Fleet contacted the Japanese authorities, and finally the sailor was released. At that time, the sailor was obviously injured and in urgent need of treatment. It was found that the Bank of Communications building where the American sailor was detained was seized by the Japanese authorities eleven months ago. At that time, the Japanese authorities forced the expulsion of the bank's employees and took over its building.

Important Meeting on US Flagship

Admiral Hart, commander of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, held a meeting with US Representative Consul General Buttrick and Fourth Regiment Commander Colonel Baker on the flagship USS Augusta the day before yesterday (29th) morning. Although the details of the meeting cannot be known, it is generally believed that, in addition to the current problems related to Shanghai, these American officials also discussed the dispute between the American sailor and the Japanese military police. At the same time, it is learned that American officials also discussed the current situation in the Bund area. The Japanese plainclothes military police are now carrying out their so-called special police work there and supervising all activities along the Huangpu River, with the "tacit approval" of the Public Concession Police Department.

### Hong Kong's Restriction on Chinese Entry; Difficult to Achieve for the Time Being; British Ships Sailing to Vietnam; British Authorities Decided to Communicate

In view of the dangerous nature of ships sailing to various ports in Vietnam, and the fact that France and Japan have signed an agreement on passage, the British Far East Naval Authorities have temporarily suspended the entry and exit of British ships to ensure the safety of navigation before the situation becomes completely clear. The Shanghai-Hubu Bay lines have also had to be temporarily suspended. However, this is only a short-term temporary measure, as this move hinders British interests in the Far East. The authorities have decided to do their best to communicate and not allow it to be delayed for a long time. Although freight transportation has been greatly affected, it is still no problem to transport food to Shanghai from places in Southeast Asia such as Siam. British and American ships sailing to various parts of Australia also stop at ports such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Yangon, Penang, and Colombo. As for the ships of the British Swire & Butterfield Company, they are now rerouted to Hong Kong, awaiting further orders. According to inquiries made by reporters from the New Voice News Agency, regarding the issue of Hong Kong's restriction on Chinese entry, it is reported that the Hong Kong government has been planning this for a long time. A plan was drawn up by immigration expert Mr. Meadowsborough in Hong Kong, and important reference materials were sent to relevant parties for research. However, this restriction plan will not be realized for the time being. It may be possible to complete the formalities within the year. All Chinese people who travel to and from the Hong Kong-Shanghai area are paying attention. Once this matter is realized, the freedom of movement of Chinese people will be lost. It is reported that other nationals also have similar restrictions. The Hong Kong government's excuse is that Hong Kong's population is too dense, which has a significant impact on the economy, security, and health. Therefore, a solution is being sought.

### Labor Strike at French Tram Company: Negotiations Haven't Started; Yu Qiaqing Agrees to Mediate Anytime; British Tram Conditions Signed

After the resolution of the labor strike at the British Shanghai Tram Company and the Chinese Public Bus Company in the International Settlement, tram and bus services have fully resumed. Yesterday morning, the British Tram Company and the workers formally signed the settlement agreement. Public bus workers sent a letter thanking Yu Qiaqing and others. The labor strike at the French Tram Company remains unresolved, and workers petitioned Yu Qiaqing yesterday, requesting him to mediate. To maintain transportation, the company has increased the number of trams on routes 2, 7, and 10. It is also making every effort to restore services on bus routes 21 and 22 and trolley routes 17, 18, and 24 in the short term.

British Tram Company: Formal Signing

The temporary settlement conditions proposed by the workers of the British Shanghai Tram Company were resolved on the 28th through the mediation of the company's compradore, Hu Ziyu. Due to insufficient time to notify the workers' representatives to sign, four representatives were appointed to go to the company and sign the agreement with acting General Manager Apelach yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to complete the procedures. The conditions consist of four items, which were previously reported. It is said that the union has sent letters thanking the mediators Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and others, expressing their sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused to passengers due to the labor strike.

Public Bus Company: Letter of Thanks to Mediators

After the labor strike at the British Public Bus Company was resolved through mediation by Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council, the labor representatives, including Ma Gongliang, sent a letter of thanks to Yu Qiaqing and others. However, regarding the new regulations that workers would only be allowed to ride Route 50 vehicles for free starting in 1940, the workers requested Yu Qiaqing to negotiate with the company to maintain the status quo and alleviate the workers' difficulties, as all workers currently have passes and can ride all routes.

French Tram Company: Negotiations Pending

After the workers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th, they put forward 16 demands for improved treatment. Although the British tram and bus disputes have been resolved, the French tram dispute remains unresolved. The strike committee sent representatives to Yu Qiaqing yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, requesting him to uphold justice and act as a mediator. It is said that Mr. Yu has accepted the workers' request and instructed them to first negotiate directly with the company.

Management Claims: Resolution Imminent

According to Mr. Fariloff, Secretary of the French Concession Tram Company, the majority of French Concession tram workers have resumed work, and four-fifths of the vehicles will resume operations today. The entire labor strike is likely to be fully resolved within the next few days. He stated that half of those forced to strike, 450 people, had returned to work yesterday. Therefore, a small number of French Concession buses will also resume operations. He hopes that more people will return to work soon, and the number of buses in service will increase accordingly.

Labor Side Agrees: Six Preconditions

According to the Dazhong News Agency, the preconditions put forward by the labor side are: (1) The company recognizes the union and provides an office allowance of 400 yuan in national currency per month; (2) The 28 workers and other workers arrested during the strike, who were wrongly detained in the Chen Tongzhang case, must be released unconditionally; (3) Increase wages by 60%; each worker should be able to purchase five sheng of rice per day, with the rice price capped at 30 yuan; (4) Additional conductors should be added to trams and buses; (5) Workers should not be dismissed without cause; (6) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike period. Workers who retire due to old age or illness should be given retirement pay by the company.

Two More Workers Arrested Yesterday

According to the labor side, two more workers were arrested yesterday morning: Wang Yougen, driver of vehicle 226, and Lu Yunsong, ticket seller of vehicle 156, were arrested near the Great World entertainment center. Zhang Yongkang, the ticket seller who was shot and killed at Guangci Hospital, is scheduled to be embalmed at the Dazhong Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM today. The workers have formed a funeral committee and elected six members as funeral committee members.

### Rotary Club: Weekly Meeting; Luncheon Gathering on the 5th; Lecture on Philippine Natives

Members are invited to bring their friends. To avoid overcrowding, please notify the club secretary by telephone (16450) before Wednesday noon to reserve seats. Out-of-town members are also welcome to participate.

Slow-Motion Films Shown Last Week

During the Shanghai Rotary Club's weekly meeting last week, various slow-motion films taken by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States were shown. The program was divided into two categories. The program is recorded as follows for reference by film enthusiasts: "Volume 1: Power Action," including (1) smoke passing through fan blades, (2) soap bubbles bursting, (3) hibiscus flying, (4) pigeons dancing, (5) cat landing and turning over, (6) flies (6,000 frames can be taken per second), (7) snake's tongue, (8) kicking a football, (9) rubber ball bouncing, (10) milk splashing. "Volume 2: Seeing What Cannot Be Seen," (1) about daily actions, (2) its strangeness and beauty, (3) cannot be seen by dull eyes. This photographic method was developed by the Electrical Engineering Department Laboratory of the school in October 1936 using electric light photography. Its titles are (1) the production and splashing of milk, including the production of large bubbles, (2) engraving metal objects, (3) hot iron splashing in water, (4) water activity in a bottle, (5) sewing machine, (6) cup falling to the ground and breaking, (7) human muscle movement, (8) hummingbird flying, etc. It is said that the interesting films were selected and shown by Mr. Wei Zengfu, a member of the club.

### American in Berlin: Applies to Change Surname; Fears Being Mistaken for German; Adds Two Characters to Original Surname

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that Arthur Berlin, an American residing in Shanghai, applied to the U.S. Consular Court in China to change his surname. This morning (30th), he received approval from U.S. Consul General Helmick. The applicant's reason for changing his surname is that both he and his wife are American citizens, but because their surname is "Berlin," they are often mistaken for Germans. The applicant strongly opposes German ideas, so he is changing his surname from Berlin to Burling to distinguish himself from Berlin, the capital of Germany. The applicant's lawyer, Mr. Rogers, stated that Mr. Berlin was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, studied there, and then came to China. Since 1923, he has held important positions in the customs service and is now a deputy tax commissioner. Mrs. Berlin was born in England and became a naturalized American citizen in 1933. They not only do not want to be mistaken for Germans, but also firmly oppose the Nazi regime.

### Shooting on Wuchang Road Last Night: Japanese Officer Dies; Japanese Side Conducts Extensive Searches Without Results; Police Department Issues Only Brief Announcement

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that a high-ranking Japanese army officer was ambushed and wounded last night (29th) in Hongkou. He was sent to the Japanese Military Hospital in Jiangwan, where he died of his injuries at 10:50 PM last night. The name of the officer is not known because the Japanese side refused to disclose it. It is also reported that the Japanese authorities strictly prohibited local Japanese newspapers from publishing news of the officer's assassination, so details remain unclear. However, the Public Concession police released a brief announcement about the case last night: Shortly after 10:15 PM last night, a Japanese army officer was suddenly shot several times at the intersection of Wuchang Road and North Sichuan Road by an unknown assassin. It is believed that the assassin was Chinese. It is reported that the Japanese officer was shot three times, and another bullet wounded a nearby rickshaw puller. After the incident, the entire area north of the Suzhou River became tense. Japanese troops patrolled and sealed off all bridge crossings, prohibiting Chinese from entering Hongkou, and conducted extensive searches in the area north of the river, but the assassin has disappeared without a trace. It is reported that the Japanese authorities are still investigating the case and no one has been arrested. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities announced that they will release information about the shooting this afternoon, and that the officer died in a private hospital, not a military hospital.

### Daylight Saving Time: Schedule to End; Scheduled for Midnight Next Saturday; Clocks Will Be Turned Back One Hour

The Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating that Daylight Saving Time will end at midnight on October 12th. At that time, all clocks in the Bureau will be moved back one hour.

### Municipal Council Statement: Attitude Toward Labor Strikes; Only Acting as an Intermediary; No Power to Enforce a Solution; But Willing to Mediate Any Labor Dispute

Following the recent tram and bus strikes in the Public Concession, the public has repeatedly inquired as to why the Municipal Council has not taken action or issued a statement. Now that the above-mentioned labor strikes have been resolved, this statement is being issued to explain the situation.

Public agencies can only mediate any labor dispute, and have no power to enforce a solution. Implementing mediation too early often proves ineffective, so the utmost caution must be exercised to avoid failed mediation. Moreover, once a labor strike occurs, the situation can change unpredictably. Issuing a formal announcement at this time would not only be unhelpful but also harmful, and could even prolong the dispute. In practice, the Municipal Council pays close attention to the changing circumstances of any major labor strike that affects the public. Once the time is right, the Municipal Council or the Industrial Section will be happy to mediate. This should reassure the citizens of our settlement.

Furthermore, the Municipal Council's power to facilitate the resolution of disputes is often most effective when it is not noticed by the public or the parties involved in the labor strike. The most effective method the Municipal Council can take to deal with labor strikes is to invite detached social leaders to mediate, without publicly involving the Municipal Council.

### Evaluation Committee Assembles Authorities; To Coordinate on Suppressing Rice Prices; Order for 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Already Completed; Rice Merchant's Speculation Fails, Announces Closure

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has been suspended for more than ten days. However, the committee, recognizing that the frequent rise in rice prices is related to the security of the settlement, and in order to carry out the wishes of the two concessions and coordinate concrete measures to stabilize the rice market, has scheduled a full committee meeting for 3:00 PM today at its meeting place at 15 Edward Road. The committee issued a notice yesterday. It is reported that the meeting will discuss (1) how to re-evaluate rice prices to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai; (2) appealing to the authorities of the two concessions to take effective measures as soon as possible to provide practical assistance. Representatives of the two concession authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will also be invited to attend today to provide instructions. However, all sectors hope that the committee will re-evaluate rice prices based on the arrival and sales of rice, production costs, and inventory, and announce them to the public and implement them effectively.

Yesterday, the Yih Ho Foreign Company's "Mingsheng" ship brought 11,217 bags of foreign rice directly from Haimen, and 7,026 bags from Hong Kong. In addition, the company's "Xinsheng" ship brought 1,410 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The source of foreign rice is constant.

Order for 3,000 Tons of Rice Completed

The rice inventory in Shanghai is extremely abundant. According to surveys, there are more than 600,000 bags. This does not include rice retailers or rice purchased and hoarded by citizens. It is estimated that there are tens of thousands of bags of such rice. To prepare for rainy days, various rice merchants in the city have taken advantage of the low production costs of foreign rice and telegraphed Saigon to order 3,000 tons of foreign rice (i.e., 30,000 bags). The order was officially completed yesterday morning after receiving a reply telegram. The rice will be shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream in half a month. According to sources, the 3,000 tons of foreign rice were ordered by Shenji Foreign Company. The price is said to be 79.5 yuan per bag for No. 2 Saigon rice.

Rice Merchant Closes Due to Speculation

In recent days, the rice market has seen a proliferation of unofficial transactions, and the price increase has intensified. Yesterday, the highest market price for domestic rice even exceeded 90 yuan per dan. However, these transactions are purely illegal, buying and selling empty. Thus, general speculative rice weevils are making huge profits. However, some rice merchants, regardless of the amount of rice that has arrived at the port, have issued a large number of transaction orders at high prices, falsely claiming that the foreign rice will arrive or has already entered the warehouse in order to obtain huge profits. Today, Tonghexie Rice Shop at 339 Pike Road has closed down due to losses of more than 100,000 yuan from these illegal transactions, making it difficult to maintain operations. According to rice market sources, the shop has been selling large quantities of rice at high prices in the market every day, but these transactions are all buying and selling empty, resulting in this outcome. General speculative rice pests should be warned and avoid repeating this mistake.

Demands for Special Regulations

Yesterday, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation appealed to the authorities to quickly plan measures to stabilize the rice market, and advised all sectors to actively participate in group rice purchases, stating that "Food is the most important thing for the people. Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed, causing not only the poor to be in dire straits, but also the middle class to struggle to make a living. If this continues, what future will there be for society?" In addition to petitioning the relevant authorities to quickly plan effective stabilization and suppression measures, and requesting the promulgation of special regulations to severely punish those who manipulate the people's food supply for profit, the federation hopes that all sectors will actively participate in group orders of foreign rice. The purpose of group rice purchases is to increase the source of rice and enrich the inventory. With sufficient rice, prices will gradually return to normal. At this time, factories, companies, and firms should provide advances for their employees to order rice, so that employees can work with peace of mind. This is the best opportunity for labor-management cooperation. Today, those with some financial means should participate in group rice purchases to leave the market rice for the poor. The method of group ordering foreign rice is quite simple. Please contact the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association on the third floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao.

### American Chamber of Commerce Opens Mandarin Class

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that the American Mandarin class sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai will begin this semester on October 14th in the American Chamber of Commerce office in the American Consulate on Fuzhou Road, so that American men and women doing business in Shanghai can have the opportunity to learn Chinese. The class will use a new teaching method that has proven effective for four years, enabling learners to speak Mandarin and write Chinese in the shortest possible time. Each semester is three months long and costs 50 yuan in legal tender. The whole class is divided into four levels, teaching 120 lessons, for a total of 1,200 characters. Mr. Lu will be the teacher. Students who pass the examination after completing the course will be issued a certificate by the American Chamber of Commerce.

### Catholic Jesuit Society: 400th Anniversary; Approximately 30,000 Members Worldwide; Matteo Ricci, Who Came to China During the Ming Dynasty, Belonged to This Society

The 400th anniversary of the founding of the Catholic Jesuit Society was on the 27th of this month. Due to the Sino-Western war, the commemoration was very simple. The St. Ignatius Room, founded by the founder of the Xujiahui Jesuit Society, held only three days of prayer, with the Holy Eucharist displayed from morning to night. The 29th (the last day) was a Mass of Thanksgiving in the morning, during which Father Cai Zhongxian described the history and work of the Jesuit Society. The Great Eucharist Blessing was held in the afternoon. The Jesuit Society was founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola, a Spaniard. The Society was dissolved once from 1773 to 1814.

### Nanyang Model Middle School Student Tao Zhengcong Kidnapped Yesterday; Brother and Sister Go to School Together in the Morning; Kidnapped When Car Arrives at Peicheng Girls' School

At the entrance of Peicheng Girls' School at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, another kidnapping case involving a middle school student occurred at around 7:39 yesterday morning. The kidnapped person was Tao Zhengcong from Zhenjiang. Three kidnappers dragged him out of the chartered car and forcibly took him into a car (number unknown) that had been placed beside the road, and sped away westward. The details of the incident are recorded below:

Brother and Sister Go to School Together

The child Tao Zhengcong is from Zhenjiang, is 14 years old, and resides at No. 35, Lane 274, South Chengdu Road. He previously studied at Weifeng Elementary School on Datong Road, and graduated this summer. He just transferred to the first grade of Nanyang Model Middle School on Nanyang Road. His sister, named Peiling, is 16 years old and is a junior in Peicheng Girls' School on Xiaoshadu Road. They leave early and return late, traveling together. At 7:39 yesterday morning, Tao and his sister followed the usual routine of taking a chartered car to school.

Sister Just Gets Out of the Car, Brother Suddenly Kidnapped

When the car arrived in front of Peicheng Girls' School at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xiaoshadu Road, Peiling got out of the car and entered the school. The chartered car driver was about to start driving towards Nanyang Road when, unexpectedly, three men jumped out of a car that had been parked nearby. Two were wearing suits and one was wearing a long gown. They surrounded the car, threatening with guns, and forcibly dragged Zhengcong out of the chartered car. During this time, the child shouted for help and grabbed the driver's trouser legs, struggling to resist. However, the number of kidnappers was much greater, and they eventually dragged him into their car and sped away westward.

Father Passed Away, Lodging With Uncle

Because it was early in the morning, there were many pedestrians on the road, and the onlookers blocked the road. The Peicheng Girls' School authorities heard the news and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. When the detectives arrived, the kidnappers had disappeared without a trace. The chartered car driver was detained at the police station for investigation. Afterwards, it was learned that Tao's uncle was named Yanghong, was nearly ancient, and was a warehouse director at the Yanye Bank on Beijing Road. According to his family, Tao's father had passed away. After the war, they came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lodged with his uncle. He and his sister remained in Shanghai to study, but were coveted by bandits. Some say that the chartered car they were riding in was a unlicensed car from the lane entrance.

### Escorting Huge Sum of Money to Shanghai; Two Conspire to Embezzle; Nanjing Tongcheng Qianzhuang Remits 45,000; Reported Theft to Small Inn Exposes Conspiracy

Chen Zemin, an employee of Tongcheng Qianzhuang in Nanjing, was entrusted by Jin Zhongheng, the manager of the qianzhuang, at around 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month to carry 45,000 yuan in legal tender by car to Shanghai to be deposited at Longchang Qianzhuang at No. 453 Sichuan Road. Unexpectedly, Chen had evil intentions after arriving in Shanghai. He hired a rickshaw to take the money, along with a rattan box containing the legal tender, to No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road, to the

China Merchants Hotel

Opened Room 12, put the legal tender in a small yellow leather box, and handed it over to Cheng Yunpeng, the accountant of the hotel, from Changshu, for safekeeping. He and Gao Yuren, the tea servant (a relative of Chen) from Zhenjiang, conspired to embezzle this large amount of money. He then reported to the Si Patrol Station, falsely claiming that he had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and was surrounded by six thugs near Henan Road and Laobazi Road. Two thieves pointed guns at his chest and stole a black rattan suitcase containing

45,000

Yuan in legal tender. Afterwards, Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Inspector Wang Jinshou, and Detective Guo Xiangyao rushed to the scene of the incident to investigate, but there was no such thing. Chen was detained and the yellow leather box he had deposited was copied at the China Merchants Hotel. Upon opening it, it was discovered that only 100 yuan in legal tender was missing. Therefore, the instigators Lu Zhenquan, tea servant Gao Yuren, and accountant Cheng Yunpeng, along with the stolen goods, were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station described the case in detail and requested a postponement.

### Ministry of Education Intensifies Training: Overview of Intermediate Technical Personnel, Divided into Long-Term and Short-Term Training, Cultivating Thousands of Technical Personnel

(Chongqing Airlines News) Since the Ministry of Education's Department of General Education established a vocational section, with Supervisor Zhong Daozan concurrently serving as the section chief, vocational education has been handled professionally. Over the years, the undertaking has been exceptionally vigorous. In September of the 26th year [1937], all provincial vocational schools with a basic foundation of equipment were ordered to promptly establish various technical training classes or supplementary schools. In the summer of the 27th year [1938], Central, Chongqing Zhonghua, Dagong, and other public and private vocational schools were designated to train driving, telecommunications, and mechanical training classes, with preferential treatment, to encourage the concept of youth respecting technology. In the summer of the 28th year [1939], all classes of students graduated, and were very welcomed by the production sector, with salaries ranging from sixty to one hundred and twenty yuan per month. The government, recognizing the effectiveness of this short-term training and the needs of society, raised significant funds to expand the scope of training, designating Central Industrial, Tongji Advanced Technical, Sichuan Diezhi, Zhonghua Vocational, Dagong Vocational, Chongqing Advanced Technical, Chengdu Advanced Technical, Nanchong Sericulture, Yulin Industrial, Sanyuan Gonghua, Kunhua Advanced Technical, Jiangxi Industrial College, Nanchang Industrial Vocational, Changsha Advanced Technical, Fujian Advanced Technical, Pingle Junior Vocational, Central Midwifery, Jiangsu Medical College, National Pharmaceutical College, and Neijiang, Mianyang, Tongzi, and relocation area health stations, and other public and private schools and institutions to run fourteen or five kinds of training classes in machinery, electrical engineering, telecommunications, civil engineering, surveying, applied chemistry, wool weaving, printing, sericulture, agricultural product manufacturing, accounting, dispensing, midwifery, and nursing. A total of one thousand plus students, all junior high school graduates, some from the war zone, and some recruited locally, with all expenses fully covered by the government. The training period is one year. According to reports from various schools, many parties urgently need students, and before the training period is complete, they are asking the schools to send them to work. Among them, machinery, telecommunications, surveying, accounting, midwifery, and nursing are the most in demand. In the second half of the 29th year [1940], the government, considering the circumstances of each subject, plans to continue to hold training classes to meet the needs of youth and society. The training classes are divided into ten subjects: (1) Machinery (lathe work, fitter, foundry, forging, model making, auto repair), (2) Electrical Engineering (electrical machinery, telecommunications), (3) Civil Engineering (architecture, surveying, roads), (4) Applied Chemistry (leather making, paper making, paint, ink, waxed paper), (5) Dyeing and Weaving (printing and dyeing, cotton weaving, wool weaving), (6) Printing (plate making, typesetting), (7) Small Crafts (stationery, daily necessities), (8) Agriculture (agricultural product manufacturing, sericulture, aquaculture), (9) Commerce (accounting, clerical), (10) Medical Affairs (midwifery, nursing, dispensing). Eligibility requires junior high school graduation or equivalent and aged seventeen to twenty-two. This is a short-term training method to solve the urgent need for technical personnel. The fundamental solution still relies on long-term training. Central Industrial, Tongji Advanced Technical, Chengdu Advanced Technical, Changsha Advanced Technical, Zhonghua Vocational, Dagong Vocational, Fujian Advanced Technical, Jiangxi Industrial College, Anshun Practical, and other schools have been designated to establish intermediate mechanical and electrical technology departments from the 30th year [1941], recruiting junior high school graduates for three years of on-campus training and one year of off-campus factory internships. This year, a total of twenty classes will be recruited, totaling one thousand people. In the future, recruitment will continue every year. All tuition, fees, uniforms, work clothes, books, medical expenses, etc., will be waived, and subsidies and production bonuses will be appropriately given. The treatment is more favorable than the short-term training classes. The goal is to cultivate two thousand people within five years, and then graduate one thousand people each year, to be assigned work by the government, with a service period of three years, during which they may not engage in other occupations, to emphasize the government's intention to cultivate specialized talents. In recent years, the areas where short-term training classes and intermediate technical departments have been held have been centered in Sichuan. First, there are more students from the war zone, and second, educational opportunities are also sufficient. Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi and Fujian are next. The northwestern provinces have not been able to give much consideration due to the lack of appropriate schools. Adjustments should be considered later.

In addition, for the technical training of senior high school graduates, the government recently ordered the engineering colleges of national universities and a few private universities to add mechanical and electrical engineering classes, totaling one thousand people. In the future, recruitment can continue. This training, after four years, will be followed by a one-year internship in a factory. All expenses are provided by the government. Future work will be assigned by the government, and there is also a service period. The designated schools are Central University, Jiaotong University, Southwest Associated University, Wuhan University, Tongji University, Zhongshan University, Guangxi University, Hunan University, Northwest Institute of Technology, Jinling University, Chongqing University, Yingshi University, Zhejiang University, and others.

### Opium and Life

How should children be filial to their parents? How should wives encourage their husbands? What kind of faithful advice should relatives give? What kind of encouragement should friends offer?

In this era, in this environment, opium can no longer be smoked, and it is absolutely unacceptable to continue in this way. However, in general, opium smokers all know that they must quit, and everyone feels the danger and pain. When a gun is in their hand, it is not carefree and happy, but full of sorrow, resentment, and hate. However, why don't they quit and escape from this life of misery? To most people, it is because smokers lack determination, but there are also other reasons. It must be known that most smokers have clever minds, and they know that if they don't quit, they will be finished, with no happiness, no hope, and no future. As for those who think very clearly but still refuse to quit, their children, wives, relatives, and friends should also bear some responsibility in addition to themselves.

Some children, because they are filial to their parents, are unwilling to persuade them to quit their habits. Even if their parents want to quit, the children will not allow them because they are old and weak. Some wives, for husbands with habits, are afraid that their husbands will suffer pain when they quit, so they do not encourage their husbands to quit smoking. At the same time, relatives and friends often say ambiguous words, which make people's will waver. In fact, the more you smoke today's inferior opium, the worse your body becomes. The pain of quitting, the rebound after quitting, and getting sick after quitting are all problems for the doctor. If the doctor you hire is knowledgeable and experienced, and uses the most reasonable method, there will naturally be no such problems. It must be known that quitting smoking is not a child's play. If you blindly delay hiring people to quit, or randomly purchase various medicines, the smoking addiction will still exist, and diseases will only multiply.

Recently, because of the problem of quitting smoking, this reporter interviewed Dr. Lai Gongliang, an expert in quitting smoking, and now writes down Dr. Lai's conversation so that people can know the reasons why quitting smoking is ineffective. Dr. Lai said: Quitting smoking is much more difficult than curing diseases. Because everyone has their own physique, everyone has their own temperament, as well as the amount of smoking, the depth of addiction, and the environment, etc., are all different. Therefore, if you do not have rich experience and use methods that are comprehensive, it will be difficult to achieve considerable results, which is what is meant by "a hair's breadth of difference leads to a thousand miles of error." Therefore, I (Dr. Lai's self-proclaimed) have been quitting smoking for more than ten years, and I have almost never used the same method for those who quit smoking. Those stacks of thank-you letters are the result of my hard work. One more thing, my quitting smoking does not seek speed and does not use injections, which also shows my hard work, because haste makes waste, and injections often have many drawbacks, and are not as stable as using the kingly way to quit. According to Dr. Lai's treatment for quitting smoking, there are four major characteristics: (1) increased diet, (2) stable sleep, (3) smooth bowel movements, (4) refreshed spirit. During the period of quitting, Dr. Lai guarantees safety, health, and normal work. And be responsible for completely removing the remaining toxins and never relapsing. Now, in order to gain the trust of those who quit smoking, a method of dispensing medicine for trial is stipulated. Those who aspire to escape from the sea of misery should no longer be delayed and blindly followed under the correct consciousness. Dr. Lai Gongliang's address is No. 208, Baker Road, Public Concession, telephone number 95111, inside the Public Health Hospital.

### Finance: Possibility of Further Appreciation of the US Dollar, Hong Kong China Bank and Commercial Bank Quote 7.5 Yuan, It is Heard that Britain Will Ban the Free Pound Price in Shanghai

After the United States established a $25 million loan to China, the black market in Shanghai immediately saw its exchange rate rise. Although the establishment of a military-economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan gave the exchange market a considerable blow, the United States immediately contacted the Soviet Union on the one hand, and further expanded the scope of the embargo against Japan on the other, so the exchange market still tended to appreciate.

Sure enough, yesterday the exchange market closed with the British gold at 3.53125 and the US dollar at 5.625. The US dollar fell sharply, appreciating sharply by 21875 compared to the previous weekend, and at the close, banks were unwilling to purchase it even when sold at 5.65625. The fundamental reason for the sudden rise in the US dollar yesterday was the US $25 million loan to China to maintain its foreign exchange needs. However, from China's own perspective, the commercial exchange rate of the US dollar in the China and Communications Banks has been quoted at 7.5 yuan. Its calculation method:

The current exchange rate of the US dollar in Shanghai is suppressed a lot by speculators due to the free pound price of more than 3.7 yuan. If calculated according to the Shanghai pound exchange rate of 3.5 pence, the US dollar should also be 5.86 US dollars.

It can be seen that the appreciation of the US dollar has its inevitability. And since the United States has given China help in foreign exchange, Britain intends to ban the Shanghai free pound exchange rate so that it can be made according to the statutory pound price in New York so that speculators cannot use the exchange rate. Based on the above, it can be seen that the legal tender against the US dollar has a greater possibility of appreciation in the future. (Central)

### Rapid Changes in the Pacific Situation: A Surge in Foreign Exchange Selling

Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Market: HSBC's Listed Rates Remain Unchanged, the Undermarket Shows a Weakening Trend for British and American Currencies, Due to Investors Being Dominated by Various Negative News. China Bank Took the Lead in Selling. Around 11 AM, Tense News from Britain and Japan Emerged, and Speculators Showed Buying Interest. However, Foreign Firms (British and American) Continued to Transfer Funds into American and British Exchange, Raising the Price Further to $3.75. They All Hired Shillings to Sell US Dollars, While Prospective Importers Strongly Sought $300,000. After Offsetting Positions, the Market Briefly Stabilized. Upon Hearing Rumors of Favorable Sales, Speculators Resumed Dumping. In the First Half of the Day, a Total of $600,000 to $700,000 Was Sold, Causing a Sharper Decline Than in British Gold. In the Early Afternoon, the Market Continued to Show Some Strength, with Good Absorption. Sassoon Came to Aggressively Buy US Dollars, Briefly Rebounding from $5.59375 to $5.50. Soon After, Speculators Dumped Another $300,000 to $400,000 in US Dollars, Overwhelming the Banks. The Market Weakened Again.

### Editor's Note

Where women should ultimately go is a major social issue of the present day, and also a pressing issue for women today. After selecting and publishing "The Wife's Sacrifice" and "Not a Sacrifice," this publication has received feedback from some readers. We are now specially publishing "Facing the Women's Question," "Is it a Sacrifice?", "Cannot Agree," (this article will be published later), and Mr. Yan Zheng's "Not Just 'Sighing' Alone," among other articles. We feel that the motives and attitudes of all the authors are very good, which is gratifying. If other readers (especially female readers) can contribute meaningful opinions on this issue, we are happy to publish them as well. - Editor

Women

### Facing the Women's Question

— Sha Yuan

This publication successively published "The Wife's Sacrifice" and "Not a Sacrifice" on August 17th and 26th, and the authors were both "married men." Naturally, what they talked about was more personal and real. I, on the other hand, am a "bachelor," and the subtleties of this are something I have not yet appreciated. But that doesn't mean I'm not qualified to participate in this discussion. On the contrary, every Chinese son and daughter has the right and obligation to speak, and what's even more important here is that women, who make up half of our total population, should stand up and discuss this personal issue themselves. I think the editor of this publication would be willing to publish it within a possible scope, right? At the same time, I hope that this issue can arouse widespread attention and debate, because this issue is realistic and important.

Indeed, as these two original authors said, the former's wife's "sacrifice" and the latter's belief that his wife is living a meaningful family life are both undeniable. In reality, these situations exist in society, and there is a large number of women living under these circumstances. Therefore, we should face this problem squarely, rather than ignoring or denying it, let alone deliberately disregarding and obliterating it. Denying this reality easily becomes fantasy, and obliterating what exists will turn into "Ah Q-style" passivity and retreat!

At the same time, the shortcomings of the two authors are that the former is controlled by "emotion" and "sadness," unable to find a way out in the dark road of present society; while the latter's mistake is that he believes that in addition to managing household affairs and educating children, a woman's only "sacred" mission in the family is to "comfort her husband" (to prevent the husband from becoming passive), and the reverse shows an air of "egotism" with "men as the center." This kind of thinking is unacceptable and simply sinful—writing off the power of half of our total population of women with one stroke!

If Hitler's slogan "Women should go back to the kitchen" were to be applied, then in China, at least, a different society would have to be put in place, because Chinese women have not yet reached the point of competing with men for jobs. On the contrary, we still have to promote women going out into society. In particular, we must see clearly what kind of society the future society will be. Will it still return to the economic panic of capitalism and imperialism, fearing that women will "invade" men's positions? Or will the construction of a new China require the strength of 250 million female compatriots? If the answer is the latter and the strength of female compatriots is needed, then even if we take a step back—to put it more pessimistically—now should also be a period of burying our heads in preparation—preparing how to welcome the new China growing out of the rubble. Some people say that educating one's children is not a preparation for the future? That's right, that's one way, but that's just preparing for your children, and you yourself are unable to meet the new needs. Or, in other words, I have already found a substitute—my children—and I am old and can ignore it. This view is not correct. Let the readers distinguish it for themselves! Besides, the training of children has a larger place for collective training—the school, which is always much larger than the family circle, and will not be bad for the children.

As for saying that it is to comfort her husband, then this husband's outlook on life today is problematic in itself, let alone other things.

Therefore, the works of the two of you are realistic, but they are not the content of the new reality—they only see the surface phenomena of the problem, and do not see the essence of the problem and its development. Therefore, one feels sentimental, and the other has to imagine based on his own subjective view!

However, we feel that the solution to the problem is painful in this transitional period. However, things will not be sent up to us. Doing it still requires our own efforts to fight for it, and the rational solution to the women's problem will undoubtedly be achieved when the entire nation is liberated. Therefore, the current preparation should also be suitable for future needs, otherwise, if we want the ideal to be realized, and we "sit and wait for a good harvest," then the days will be even longer! And it will not be the turn of those who do nothing. At the same time, if we do not work hard for the overall situation, then women will never be able to turn over.

The wheels of history are cruel. If you don't keep up, you will fall behind and be eliminated!

Essay

### Is it a Sacrifice?

— Xiao Yun

In the Free Talk a few days ago, Mr. Yan Zheng said that his wife, after marriage, "began to bury herself in trivial family matters... tossing and turning in the vegetable market, the kitchen, and the bedroom," believing that this was a "sacrifice," while Mr. and Mrs. Chen Ming "believe that a woman managing household affairs and taking care of children at home is also a career" and "not a sacrifice."

Is it really a sacrifice?

I believe that the key to the problem lies entirely in the different views on the current social system.

A person who has no dissatisfaction with the current social system (that is, the past social system), and believes that the status quo can continue to be maintained, will inevitably feel that it is a matter of course for women to manage the home and not a sacrifice. On the contrary, if you feel dissatisfied with the current social system, and believe that it needs to be reformed so that women can also make direct contributions to society, then you will think that restricting women to the family circle is an unreasonable and significant sacrifice.

Therefore, the problem is very simple: is this social system reasonable? Should a capitalist, male-centered society exist forever? Can women make contributions to society just like men? If women are given equal education and opportunities to come to society, will their contributions to society be greater than simply managing the home?

Is it a sacrifice? The standard is here, please see for yourself.

Although it is a matter for the future, shouldn't short-sighted people be able to see it?

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Hawthorne frowned and shook his head, saying, "You misunderstood. His sneer is only the trigger for my worries, the main cause is still the case itself... Alas, this case is really complicated."

"Although, isn't this case almost over now?"

"Over? It's not even close, it's still far away!"

"I really don't understand. Now that the three suspects have been caught, the immediate task is just to think of a way to get them to confess one by one——"

Hawthorne suddenly shook his right hand holding the cigarette. "Is it that easy? Paul, don't be impatient. This case is by no means as simple as you estimate. At most, you can only say that half of it is completed. You must know that the three suspects you mentioned may eventually 'only be suspects.' Then how can you end it immediately?"

I let go of the cigarette and said in surprise, "What? Could it be that none of the three could have committed the murder—not even Zhao Boxiong?"

Hawthorne threw away the cigarette butt and replied, "What we need to study now is no longer a matter of possibility, but a matter of fact. To be honest, I don't have confidence in the facts. What's the use?"

I felt that Hawthorne's words were too vague and too abrupt, which made it impossible for me to imagine. But at this time, my opportunity to ask questions was interrupted again. The phone rang. Hawthorne hurriedly stood up to answer the call. The result of this call did not seem to increase his depression. Because when he returned to the sofa, the muscles on his face seemed to be more relaxed than before. He automatically told me, "This is Qin Mozhai calling. He said that Dr. Bai has returned from Zhenru, and within an hour or two, he can report the results of the autopsy."

Just as he finished speaking, the doorbell rang again. Before long, Shi Gui had led Jiang Anna in.

She had changed into a pure blue Indian silk cheongsam, and the clutch bag she was holding in her hand was also blue. The red on her lips and cheeks had also been reduced a lot. (123)

### Not Just "Sighing" Alone

Dear Editor:

I read Mr. Chen Ming's great work "Not a Sacrifice" in today's "Free Talk," and I admire it very much.

I remember that my writing "The Wife's Sacrifice" was entirely inspired by emotion. At that time, I was motivated by emotion and had no time to carefully consider it, so I wrote it down frankly. It is inevitable that there are shortcomings.

Unexpectedly, it caused Mr. Chen Ming's antipathy, or rather, reaction. After reading "Not a Sacrifice," I felt that his words were much better than mine. After observing its implication, it seems to be similar to mine. However, at that time, I used "I don't know how many people have sacrificed like my wife!" as the conclusion, which was not just "sighing" alone. Because what is now placed in front of the Western clothes men are two distinct paths: go to society or go to the family! I always thought that women still have to return to the family, which is the defect of the current social system. What my conclusion implies is an attack on this social system, even if it is weak! And Mr. Chen Ming only saw the word "sacrifice," thinking that this issue should not be understood in this way, and also said, "Handling household affairs and educating children are a woman's career." He lightly covered up that defect!

I do not agree with Hitler's driving women back into the family. The so-called "saving the country from one's own position" is only a temporary solution in my opinion. I belong to the "faction that opposes maintaining the status quo."

My humble opinion is like this. Perhaps due to different environments, the views are different. In my case, if my children have good places to entrust them, I will try my best to urge my wife to do some social work. Suddenly, I announce this, and respectfully ask for your guidance!

Entertainment World

### October Drama Movement

— Sent by Sen from Chongqing

Vitality of Free China

The October drama movement in free China is vigorously unfolding, according to reports from various sources:

Chongqing (Wartime Capital)

This year, the Chongqing drama circles are commemorating the Drama Festival. In addition to the decision by the Third Drama Festival Performance Committee that the "Long Live China" and "Roar!" troupes, along with the Central Propaganda Department's Experimental Troupe, will each present a multi-act play, the "Long Live China Troupe" will also rehearse ten major plays, including Chen Baichen's "Autumn Harvest," Xia Yan's "Mind Defense," Ma Yanxiang's "A National Traitor," Song Zhi's "Whip," Lao She's "Zhang Zizhong," Cao Yu's "Peking Man," Guo Moruo's "Qi Jiguang," and Yang Hansheng's "New Twin Cities," "Heroes of the Wilds," and "Spring in Jiangnan," in preparation for launching a broader and more enthusiastic drama movement in Chongqing.

Shaoguan

The wartime art gallery established by the Guangdong Provincial Government in August has undergone many planning improvements since Shu Yan took over as lecturer. As a result, the drama movement has become unusually widespread. At the same time, the Guangdong Drama Monthly Association, in response to the "Dramatists' Aircraft Donation" campaign, has decided to jointly perform spoken dramas during the October Drama Festival, and local artists have also agreed to participate in the performances.

Kunming

After the war, the Kunming drama movement has not declined. More than a dozen large and small theater troupes have been established. In addition to the most famous "Associated Universities Drama Troupe" organized by students from Nankai, Tsinghua, and Peking Universities, there are also the "Tongji Drama Troupe," "Yunda Drama Troupe," "Art Teachers Drama Troupe," "Jinma Drama Troupe," "Hailing Drama Troupe," "Yelian Drama Troupe," "National Defense Drama Society," and the "Yishi Drama Troupe" presided over by Bishop Yu Bin. Each troupe has a rural performance team attached to it. Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, the October drama movement will focus on rural touring performances in order to deeply penetrate the people.

Guiyang

Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, the situation in Kunming is quite tense, and government agencies are evacuating one after another. As a result, Guiyang has suddenly become more lively. All sectors of Guiyang originally planned to have the Postal Workers' Union perform a spoken drama during the October Drama Festival in response to the fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft. Now, due to this, the plan has been changed, and it is planned to select scripts from the drama circles and cooperate in turn to perform in various parts of Guizhou Province.

Ji'an

Since the fall of Nanchang, Ji'an has become the administrative center of Jiangxi Province. Following the "Warm Clothing Donation Movement" of the press, the "Dramatists' Aircraft Donation Movement" was launched. The Ji'an drama circles naturally did not want to lag behind and immediately began to mobilize. There, spoken drama, Peking opera, and local opera have achieved a unified pace, moving towards the October drama movement.

In addition, in Guilin, Yong'an, Jinhua, Chengdu, Yan'an, and other places, the drama circles are also preparing separately to engage in the October drama movement. This will undoubtedly leave a bright miracle in the history of Chinese drama and is worth writing about in detail.

### Hedy Lamarr's Divorce

— Lu Li

Hollywood's most beautiful foreign actress, Hedy Lamarr, divorced her new husband, Gene Markey, yesterday. The reason was that her husband was always away from home, and he only spent four days at home with her in the fourteen months after their marriage. She could not bear sleeping alone and decided to divorce.

### Hollywood Film People Arrive in Shanghai

— Yong

Al Doff is the representative of Universal Pictures and recently arrived in Shanghai via New York and Hollywood. He recently gave a speech to foreign reporters in the city, saying: "Since Britain and Germany started fighting, the American film market in Europe has inevitably been affected to a considerable extent. However, sales in London have increased compared to the past; in addition, the Far East is also quite satisfied."

Then, he added: "All companies are now working tirelessly on film production, which is an excellent phenomenon. Taking Universal as an example, twelve films are being shot simultaneously in the studio this month, breaking the company's historical record. Six more are being prepared for shooting later, each of which is expected to use one million yuan of capital. However, one point must be stated to all sectors: although the production of war films has recently been very popular in the film industry, producers are not very excited about it. Therefore, such products will gradually disappear in the future. If there are any, they will mostly be filmed with the capital of private institutions."

Doff also raised two important issues: "This autumn is the time for the US presidential election, and Hollywood will, as usual, issue extra newsreels for this event; this year, a few reels will be specially filmed for each candidate. The second is the issue of Hollywood talent. There are indeed many newcomers, but there is still a shortage of talent to deploy."

Finally, regarding Deanna Durbin's new work "Spring Parade," Doff introduced it with extraordinary enthusiasm. He hopes that movie fans will not miss it when it is released.

### Shanghai Teaching Drama Fellows, Guofeng Drama Society, Approved to Open on October 6th

The Shanghai Teaching Drama Fellows' Guofeng Drama Society has been organized internally. After being approved by the general meeting a few days ago, it was decided to open on October 6th at No. 7 Hexingfang, Foch Road. It is planned to invite Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng to deliver the opening speech on that day, and to invite more than ten famous female Peking opera singers from the north and south, including Wu Suqiu, Tong Zhiling, Wang Xichun, Yun Yanxia, and Xiao Linghong, to cut the ribbon. The Shanghai Actors' Association has already made a wooden plaque and presented it to the society. Many other celebrities, ticket offices, famous amateur performers, and colleagues from the north and south have donated silver shields, silk banners, calligraphy, and other items. It is said that invitations to the ceremony have already been sent out, and it is expected to be a grand occasion at that time.

### Wang Xichun Stars in "Song of the Separated Luan"

The female lead in Golden Star's third production, "Song of the Separated Luan," is a pitiful woman. After discussions between director Wu Yonggang and Golden Star officials, it was believed that Wang Xichun was the most suitable personality. Wang was very interested in working on the screen, so she agreed as soon as it was mentioned. The male lead has been set as Shu Shi. Shu originally intended to withdraw from the film industry, but after Zhou Jianyun explained it to him, he agreed to cooperate. According to Zhou Jianyun, "Family of the Qinhuai River" was test-screened yesterday. The whole play is quite tense, and several newcomers from the stage, such as Sun Jinglu, have also had unexpected gains. However, the whole film is very long, and the cost will be relatively large when printing copies later, but it is not planned to cut it in order to make the whole play full from beginning to end. (Haixing)

Brief News (1) Miss Ma Zhanghua, a Yue opera performer, will be engaged to Mr. Bao Xin'chu from Fenghua on October 5th. It is said that the engagement ceremony will be quite grand, and the Mandarin Duck certificate and silk invitation cards issued by Xie Wenyi of Wangping Street will be used, which are exquisite. (2) The special issue of "Sea Hero Zheng Chenggong" was published the day before yesterday, with abundant illustrations and texts. Wei Ruhui, Wu Yonggang, Liu Qiong, Gu Lanjun, and others all personally wrote articles for it. It is sold for 3 cents at all newsstands and the Swire Theatre. (3) The second volume, twelfth issue of "Bi-Monthly Drama," edited by the Plum Blossom House Master, was published a few days ago, with increasingly substantial content. All news vendors are selling it on consignment.

### Movie Fans Don't Recognize the Great Lover

— Guest

Once, the movie fan's great lover, Xiche Luomiou, was wandering alone in San Francisco. He stepped into a magnificent hotel. At this time, a beautiful girl approached his table and began to accuse him of not dressing up like Romeo, so as not to tarnish the personality of that famous star. Just as he was about to argue that he was Romeo, the stubborn girl asked him to produce some evidence. So Romeo unbuttoned his clothes and showed her the name specially made for him by the tailor on his shirt. Unexpectedly, the girl pointed at his eyes more angrily and scolded, "Humph! Humph! You're wearing an old shirt!" After saying that, she left coldly, making Romeo, who was good at teasing others, blush. Because since he was the darling in the eyes of women, he had suffered the disdain of a woman who admired him. It was really "Unable to tell the suffering, a mute eating coptis!"
