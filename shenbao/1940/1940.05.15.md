### The Relief Association Sends Personnel to Guangxi to Discuss Funds

Chongqing:  Following the victories in northern Guangdong and southern Guangxi this spring, the Relief Committee allocated over 300,000 yuan each for emergency relief.

### China is Determined to Fight to the End; Peace Talks are Absolutely Impossible

Chongqing: Today, there were again rumors of peace talks between China and Japan in Shanghai. A Havas news agency correspondent asked a Chinese government spokesman about the matter. The spokesman replied that such rumors are "utterly absurd." China is still determined to fight "until the Japanese army completely withdraws from China." Well-informed sources also stated that the Chinese army recently inflicted a major defeat on the Japanese army in the Xiangfan area, and Japanese attacks in other areas have also been repelled. In this situation, a free China has no need to negotiate peace with Japan. Japan always claims that China is preparing for peace talks whenever it suffers a defeat. This tactic is ridiculous.

Editorial

### On Chamberlain and Churchill

Yesterday's London dispatch reported that the British Churchill Cabinet passed a vote of confidence in the House of Commons on the 12th. Churchill was ordered by the King on the 13th to form a cabinet. Although the selection of some less important cabinet members is still pending, it is legally completed after passing the House of Commons. Moreover, the leaders of all parties have promised to cooperate from the beginning, and the members of all parties have unanimously supported it, achieving complete success politically. Britain is in a time of trouble: the expeditionary force was defeated in Norway, and the small neighboring countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were invaded by a powerful enemy. The overall situation is shocking. The ruling party has an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons, but public opinion is noisy outside, and cracks are visible inside. At this juncture, the central government has been reorganized, not only with a new look, but also with fuller strength, commanding with ease and lifting heavy weights lightly. This is truly due to the superiority of the British people's political knowledge and ability, and also because Churchill is supported by the people. All friends of Britain are pleased.

Churchill and former Prime Minister Chamberlain both belong to the Conservative Party. Churchill was originally the First Lord of the Admiralty in Chamberlain's cabinet and is now Prime Minister, while Chamberlain, as Prime Minister, is now a Privy Councillor in Churchill's cabinet. Others, such as Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary and Minister of Public Security Anderson, and President of the Board of Trade Duncan, are all Conservatives and retain their original positions in Churchill's cabinet. Others, such as the current Secretary of State for War Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood, are also Conservative members. The Lord Chancellor, Simon, is a member of the National Liberal Party. All are cabinet members of Chamberlain's cabinet, and now all retain their positions or transfer departments in Churchill's cabinet. In addition, there are still many who are said to be Conservative members of the new cabinet. However, the significance of this cabinet reshuffle in Britain cannot be regarded as merely a replacement of personnel within a party because the Prime Minister still belongs to the Conservative Party and some cabinet members have either retained or transferred their posts. Nor can it be regarded as merely an opening up of the Conservative Party regime because the leaders of all parties participated in the cabinet under the Conservative Prime Minister. Chamberlain's cabinet was a party cabinet, while Churchill's cabinet is a national cabinet, and their nature is very different. Moreover, the reorganization of the British government from a party cabinet to a national cabinet is not only an important evolution in British politics, but will also have a significant impact on the international community. Why do I say that? Britain's declaration of war on Germany, its alliance with France, its promise to Poland, its efforts to assist Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, its agreement with Turkey, and its guarantee to Greece and Romania are all major factors in the recent and future development of the international situation. They were established during the Conservative Party's Chamberlain cabinet era and are the main part of Britain's international policy in the future and will never be shaken. It is inevitable that the situation is the same, regardless of whether the government is a national cabinet or a cabinet of another party that is not the Conservative Party. Even in terms of friendship with the United States and sympathy for China, and the combination of alarm and attraction to Italy and the Soviet Union, remaining close or apart, making friends or enemies, there are also their own basic conditions. The matter concerns British interests and will not change drastically because the Prime Minister changes. However, the use of power will definitely be different in Churchill's cabinet than in Chamberlain's. As for the international impression given by Churchill and Chamberlain, as well as the possible reaction caused by the impression, we can already see the difference at the beginning of Churchill's administration, when everything has not yet begun.

Chamberlain is a traditional British gentleman. In international affairs, his way of being close or distant, his sense of taking or giving, and his way of handling affairs, making decisions, advancing or retreating, all fit the British rules. However, he was in power for five years and encountered unprecedented changes in the world. His opponents were Stalin of the Soviet Union, Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and the cliques of Japan. None of them can be constrained by normal international norms, nor can they be compared to the sentiments of collective habits, nor can they be dealt with by those who hold British traditional rules. Therefore, Chamberlain always went wrong, his plans always failed, and the answers he got always went against the trend he expected. He once declared generously that he would never want to see Britain engaged in cruel and brutal killings again in his lifetime, but he still had to declare war on Germany himself. This alone can summarize the rest. However, he was able to lead his military and civilians to the battlefield with painstaking efforts and by compromising, which ordinary people could not achieve, and he did not lose his status as a British statesman. By the end of his cabinet, not only did other parties feel ashamed to cooperate, but even his own party members abandoned him. The close cabinet members, such as Simon and Hoare, should share the blame. It is also because of five years of mistakes and constant patching up that his objective political achievements had to be abandoned. Moreover, in wartime and post-war, neither domestically nor internationally, Chamberlain's credibility and courage could not command appeal.

As for Churchill, how he will cope with the current difficulties after he takes office as Prime Minister is something that cannot be discussed today. However, there are things that can be predicted: Churchill has a strong and resolute character, and his style is bold and decisive. He is reasonable, decisive, trustworthy, and resolute. Therefore, he can gain the trust of the entire nation regardless of party affiliation. His impression on the international community is also the same. Moreover, it is not only Churchill himself. Foreign Secretary Halifax, the most prestigious cabinet member of the Chamberlain cabinet at home and abroad, sees the Prime Minister as someone who surpasses his predecessors, and Churchill trusts him with his original position. The former Secretary of State for the Colonies, Eden, was transferred to Secretary of State for War. Eden has also served as Foreign Secretary and is famous in the world. He is a new force of the Conservative Party. The Labour Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood not only joined the cabinet, but also held two of the five seats in the cabinet's wartime conference. The Liberal Party leader Sinclair served as Secretary of State for Air. These three represent the two parties, and when they were in opposition, they were most suspicious of Chamberlain's weak Far East policy and repeatedly called for it. In short, those who assist Churchill are lofty and upright, and are all the best of the time. His cabinet lineup is like this, and he should be loved by the whole country. Chamberlain's international policy, although the international community generally recognized that it was not wrong, only because its expression was hesitant and it liked to call it "compromise" and "appeasement," it caused international contempt and suspicion from friendly countries. Now, with Churchill and his important cabinet members, it will show the firmness of its policy, and it will also be feared by those who are contemptuous and trusted by those who are suspicious. Now, in wartime, everything in the end depends on the victory or defeat of the military, but Churchill's cabinet will at least be able to increase the goodwill and confidence of the United States towards Britain, and will be able to increase the practical effect of its sympathy for China, thereby promoting the degree of parallel Anglo-American relations in the Far East. These are the backbone that determines the changes in the international situation in the future.

### German Troops Fiercely Attack, Penetrating French Territory; Europe Opens Unprecedented War; German Troops Advance on Both Wings Centered on Liège; French Garrison Forced to Retreat from Sedan and Longwy

Paris – Military sources here have recently stated that a major battle occurred between French and German troops along the Meuse River today. The intensity of the situation is unprecedented since the outbreak of the current European war. Ever since German troops invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, they have engaged with French forward units, but these have been skirmishes for the past three days. German troops are actively deploying according to their predetermined strategy, namely, using the city of Liège in Belgium as the center, they are advancing fiercely on both wings. Among them, the strength of the left wing is particularly strong. In addition to a large number of army units and aircraft, there are also two divisions of armored vehicles, which have already passed through the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Ardennes Mountains, and have arrived at the Moselle River. The French "Ardennes Mountain Troops" were immediately forced to retreat. From last night until this morning, German troops began to advance from the city of Liège along the Ourthe River towards the French city of Sedan. As for the east bank of the Meuse River, there was also fighting along the line from the city of Sedan to the Moselle River. After German troops reached the French border, they were fiercely bombarded and intercepted by French defensive batteries, but German troops were finally able to capture the cities of Sedan and Longwy. The fighting in each of these places was quite fierce. German troops continued to use tanks, artillery, and aircraft to bombard French positions and strafe with machine guns. In addition, the air forces of both sides were also extremely active today. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Paris – The General Headquarters recently issued a war bulletin stating that German troops, using aircraft and tanks to attack with all their strength, are becoming increasingly fierce in their advance. They have now advanced to the Meuse River, namely, the line from the city of Liège in Belgium, through Namur and Dinant, to the French city of Sedan. Fierce fighting is taking place in the suburbs of Sedan and north of Dinant. At the same time, the fighting along the line from the southern suburbs of the French city of Longwy to the Moselle River is also continuing. The enemy in the Wissembourg area has been repelled by our troops. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Paris – The great war has now begun, and German troops are mobilizing everywhere. From the Netherlands to the Moselle River, German troops are active everywhere. In the Netherlands, German troops are advancing westward towards Arnhem. 21,500 Dutch troops are currently holding their positions and resisting, and are also clearing German paratroopers or Dutch Nazi Party members in the interior. The work of eliminating the enemy in Rotterdam is still in progress. In Belgium, German mechanized units are departing from Maastricht, Hasselt, and Tongeren, and since yesterday, they have been engaged in the largest mechanized warfare the world has ever seen with French mechanized units. In some places, there are 1,500 to 2,000 tanks facing each other, galloping across the battlefield. French troops have ultimately demonstrated that their fighting power and war equipment are superior to the enemy's. According to the latest news, except for one brick fortress built during the reign of Louis XIV, the forts of Liège in Belgium are all holding firm. Germany is currently making great efforts in the Ardennes region of Belgium. Large formations of German troops are advancing westward, led by several armored divisions, followed by motorized bicycle units, machine gun teams, and tanks, with infantry advancing behind. Seeing the large-scale German offensive, the Belgian and French forward troops are gradually retreating, and fierce fighting has already broken out along the forest area along the Moselle River in front of the Maginot Line. Yesterday, land warfare intensified along the approximately 250-mile front from the Zuiderzee to the Moselle River, and equally fierce aerial encounters also occurred. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

The Hague – The Dutch General Headquarters recently issued a war bulletin stating: (1) After German troops crossed the IJssel River in the eastern part of our country, they advanced towards the western part of the Gelderland province and have approached our troop positions in several places. The province has already been flooded. (2) The vanguard of German troops in the northern part of our country has reached the coast of the Zuiderzee in certain places. Our border guards have retreated and suffered slight damage. (3) In the northern part of the Brabant province, German armored vehicle units have reached the city of Langestraat. (4) In the western part of our country, south of the port of Rotterdam, there are still a small number of German paratroop units. Although their weaponry is extremely complete, they do not have artillery. (5) Although the German Air Force has the advantage, our Air Force is still flying to the front lines to bomb enemy military targets. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

London – The Belgian radio station broadcast a communiqué from the Belgian General Headquarters stating, "There have been localized contacts at various points on our front. Our troops are currently resisting the enemy's pressure. Last night, our forward units were forced to retreat." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Brussels – The Commander-in-Chief recently issued a war bulletin stating, "Our troops fought fiercely on the front lines all day today, putting up a determined resistance against the enemy. After several villages and towns were temporarily lost, our troops, with the assistance of Allied tank units, launched a major counter-offensive and recaptured them. Several Belgian army units, infantry units, border bicycle units, Ardennes Mountain troops, and motorized units have fought bravely in recent days and have achieved considerable results." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

The Situation in the Netherlands is Extremely Grave; Allied Forces Join Forces to Defend Brussels

London – The vanguard units of the British and French forces in the Netherlands and Belgium have now mobilized to stem the increasingly fierce German offensive. Several million Allied and German troops, assisted by hundreds of aircraft and thousands of tanks each, are currently engaged in a desperate battle along the 150-mile front from the Zuiderzee in the northern Netherlands to the Moselle River. Paris – Well-informed military sources claim that the most important part of the front is the Meuse River area, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. It is expected that the vanguard of German troops in that area will attempt to cross the river today.

It is widely believed that the situation in the Netherlands is extremely serious. German troops have made progress in the Arnhem area and are advancing rapidly along both banks of the Rhine River towards Rotterdam. It is possible that they have already reached Rotterdam and joined forces with the German troops occupying the city. The Netherlands is still fighting bravely. A Dutch communiqué stated that Dutch troops' efforts to resist German troops' occupation of the Zuiderzee area have been quite successful. The area north of Rotterdam is definitely in Dutch hands. It is reported that Dutch troops are also holding the Dutch New Water Line. Den Helder is currently unharmed. Zeeland is in Dutch hands, but the situation in Brabant is uncertain.

The most reassuring factor is that the British and French forces, without being significantly harassed by the Germans, are continuing to advance towards their positions in northern and central Belgium. Fighting is still taking place east of the line where the Allied commanders plan to fight a decisive battle with the Germans. Yesterday, French and German armored units fought a major battle all day. Liège is still being held by Belgian troops, and the major battle there has not yet begun. Although the claim that German troops have occupied the Ében-Émael fortress in the north has not been confirmed, it is not impossible. If so, Liège will be cut off. However, Liège is unlikely to fall in the short term, but one should not be overly optimistic.

The vanguard of German troops reached the Meuse River in several places last night and advanced rapidly overnight. It is estimated that they have now reached all the crossing points of the Meuse River. German troops here are heading straight for Sedan. Mechanized units are advancing towards this place. Yesterday, they encountered French troops near Sedan, and there was fierce fighting. German troops have air units and artillery as support. Their second target is Dinant.

Allied troops are now cooperating with Belgian troops to jointly defend Brussels. In the past 48 hours, large numbers of British and French reinforcements and military supplies have arrived in various parts of Belgium. Because Belgian troops put up fierce resistance at the beginning of the sudden German offensive, Allied troops were able to make contact with them in a timely manner without difficulty. Belgian troops have now established strong positions, and large numbers of reinforcements have arrived.

According to opinions in London, the current fighting is still in its initial stages. The situation may not be very clear in two or three days. However, in any case, the great war has definitely begun. The claim that German troops are using nerve gas has not been confirmed, and the claim that German paratroopers have landed behind the French and Allied lines has also not been confirmed. Official circles do not believe this to be the case. However, paratroopers are still landing in large numbers in the Netherlands and Belgium. Traces of them were discovered in Brussels today, and many have been beaten to death by mobs. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London – It has just been reported that the Ében-Émael fortress, north of the city of Liège in Belgium, may have been occupied by German troops, but the war is still ongoing. It is generally believed that the city should still be able to hold out for some time. It is also reported that German paratroop units have landed behind the French and British lines. The fighting in southern Netherlands is also very fierce, and the situation is quite serious. In addition, British and French Allied forces are jointly joining forces with Belgian troops to jointly defend Brussels. It is expected that the great war will break out east of Brussels. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

German Troops Launch Large-Scale Offensives Against the Netherlands and Belgium; The Battle Line Stretches 400 Kilometers

Paris – Military sources here recently stated that today German troops launched large-scale offensives in the Netherlands, on both the north and south sides of the city of Liège in Belgium, and at the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with the area west of the Albert Canal being the most intense. French and German tank units both participated in the fighting, with a total of between 1,500 and 2,000 tanks. A summary of the war situation is as follows: (1) German propaganda claimed that the French city of Longwy (at the intersection of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) had been occupied by German troops. This is not true. French troops have very strong positions in that area and have installed obstacles to prevent German troops from advancing. (2) German troops in Belgium are attacking on two routes. One route is north of the city of Liège, advancing from the cities of Hasselt and Tongeren on the Albert Canal. The other route is southwest of the city of Liège, advancing towards the Ardennes Mountains. The motorized units attacking the cities of Tongeren and Hasselt have been subjected to fierce pressure from French troops. Although the situation in the Liège area is currently volatile and uncertain, the area has solid fortifications and can still be held. In addition, German troops are also attacking fiercely in the Ardennes Mountains. Some units, led by armored troops, are advancing towards the Meuse River. The deployment of German troops consists of motorized bicycle units in the first rank, followed by machine gun units, then tank units, with infantry bringing up the rear. The offensive is extremely fierce, and the Belgian and French forward troops are fighting and retreating. (3) Dutch troops are resisting German troops in the Arnhem area quite successfully. German paratroop units landed in the interior of the Netherlands, attempting to make contact with Dutch Nazi Party members. The situation was originally quite serious, but after Dutch police and troops searched and suppressed them, most have been eliminated, and the authorities have been able to control the overall situation. In summary, after Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, it extended the battle line from the Moselle River to the coast of the Zuiderzee in the Netherlands, a distance of 400 kilometers. In addition, the air forces of both sides were as active as usual on the front lines today. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the air forces of Britain and France have shot down more than 400 German aircraft in those countries. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

The Main Defense Lines in the Eastern Periphery of the Netherlands and Belgium Were Breached by German Mechanized Units

Berlin – The German General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this afternoon stating that the Grebbe Line southeast of Amersfoort in the Netherlands has been breached by our troops. Continued reinforcements are heading south to the Dutch fortress area. The city of Roosendaal has been occupied by our troops. In Belgium, after our troops crossed the Turnhout Canal, they have now advanced to De Groote Geete. North of Namur, our motorized units are currently pursuing enemy motorized units. The city of Liège is in our hands. From Liège to Namur, our troops have crossed the Ardennes. The outposts have advanced to the Meuse River between Namur and Huy. Our troops are also making extremely rapid progress in southern Belgium. At the junction of Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, our troops have broken into French territory in several places. Yesterday, the enemy lost a total of 150 aircraft, and our troops lost 27 aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Belgian Front – Yesterday, German troops used flanking maneuvers to break through the first line of defense of the Belgian troops. After putting up a strong resistance, the Belgian troops retreated to the second line of defense. It is expected that the British Expeditionary Force will join the second line of defense to fight the first major battle. This line is shorter than the first line, so it is stronger. German troops used armored units to penetrate the Belgian defense lines and continued their offensive. The German equipment can be described as extremely perfect. The Allied forces expressed great excitement over the heroic resistance of the Dutch troops.

Berlin – German military experts yesterday issued a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, declaring that after occupying northeastern Netherlands with swift action, German troops are now actively advancing. German mechanized units have made contact with army units that were transported by air and landed in Rotterdam. The so-called Dutch fortress has been surrounded. Between Moerdijk and The Hague, German troops have the advantage. The use of new German tactics has created a favorable military situation in the Netherlands. On the Belgian side, on the third day of operations, German troops have eliminated the Albert Canal defense line. The Liège fortress has not been completely overcome. Enemy troops are still stubbornly resisting in the eastern forts, but the capture of the Ében-Émael fortress proves the invincibility of modern German weapons. On the air front, several British aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of the Maastricht bridge yesterday at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 meters. German anti-aircraft guns shot down 25 aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Germany Concentrates its Main Force to Pressure the Border, Aiming to Cut Off Contact Between Belgian and Dutch Armies

London – The German army is now focusing all its efforts on cutting off the land army between Belgium and the Netherlands. The defense measures of the Netherlands and Belgium were not coordinated in advance, so the Allies expect Germany to push its main force to the Dutch-Belgian border to the North Sea. If this advance is successful, Germany will not only divide the Netherlands and Belgium into two parts, but it can also threaten the defenses of Antwerp and the Albert Canal. German troops are currently advancing on three routes: one from Maastricht to Brussels, one advancing towards Roermond, and one from Liège, forcing the Meuse route into France, the same as in 1914. Each route of advance is protected by aircraft, and paratroop units are landing behind the lines to assist in the attack. After the start of the war, the roads and railways between the Netherlands and Belgium were repeatedly bombed by German aircraft. Air Force intelligence reported that the Royal Air Force destroyed two bridges in the Maastricht area yesterday, because German troops were attacking Belgium from that area. The Royal Air Force also attacked German troops advancing towards Belgium. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

### Dutch Government Denies Allowing Third Country to Interfere in the Sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies; Dutch Embassy in Japan Issues Statement; British Troops Land on Curaçao Island

Hong Kong – Tokyo News: Mr. Van Gulik, secretary of the Dutch Embassy in Japan, issued a statement denying that the Dutch government has allowed a third country to interfere in the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies. It roughly stated that no matter what the situation in the Netherlands is, we are determined to reject any third party interfering with our territories. We are fully prepared to maintain our own sovereignty. The rumor that the Dutch West Indies have been occupied by the Allied forces is completely untrue. It so happens that a French warship sailed to the West Indies to purchase goods there. Its sailors also landed there, but it was not an occupation. Mr. Wan continued to say that on the 13th, the various branches of the Dutch Bank had received orders from the government to pay back all the funds that German expatriates had deposited before May 10th, without exception, and were not allowed to withhold them.

### Dutch and Belgian People, Supporting the Old and Leading the Young, Flee to English and French Borders for Refuge; Repeatedly Describe the Brutal Acts of the German Army; The Tragedy of Twenty Years Ago Reappears Today

Paris: The tragic scenes of 1914 have reappeared in Paris yesterday. Countless elderly, women, and children have arrived here in dismay from the cities that have crossed the border for refuge. The French army is busily setting up Belgian refugee camps in Paris and arranging beds for the refugees. Nurses are distributing food to the refugees. The displaced people are able to find temporary shelter in these simple places. Most of these Belgians are able to recount the tragic scenes they encountered in the war, repeatedly telling of the terror of German bombing. It is said that at this time, the cruel German planes showed no mercy to the people who were rushing to the French border for refuge. According to an old woman, when she fled her home in panic and ran along a road close to the German front line, her two sons who were traveling with her were shot and killed by German machine guns. She was unable to take care of her sons' bodies and bravely continued her journey, arriving here after many hardships. Now she has no clothes or money.

### British House of Lords Unanimously Passes Vote of Confidence in New Government; Halifax Proposes Motion and Praises Chamberlain's Contributions; Third Batch of Cabinet Members Announced

London: When Foreign Secretary Halifax proposed a motion of confidence in the new government in the House of Lords, he delivered a speech praising the achievements of former Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that anyone who knew his achievements would not worry about what kind of judgment history would make on his efforts to mediate peace or his efforts to conduct the war after the breakdown of peace. He then mentioned the new Prime Minister Churchill, saying that Mr. Churchill has undertaken the extremely heavy responsibility of the work that is commonly known in the House of Lords, and he will use his special talent that is trusted by the people to deal with this work. The House of Lords immediately passed this motion unanimously. The new Lord Chancellor, Sir John Simon, attended the House of Lords today. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London: New Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak amidst cheers, saying that on Friday evening, I was ordered to form a new government. Parliament and the nation all wished the new government to be built on the broadest foundation and to recruit all parties in the House of Commons who supported and opposed the previous government. In accordance with this wish, I have now completed this most important task and formed a war cabinet of five people to represent the unity of the nation. The leaders of the Labour Party have all taken office. Given the extreme urgency of the situation, the war cabinet had to be announced within a day. The other important positions were appointed yesterday, and another list will be submitted to the King for approval tonight. I hope that the appointments of the main officials can be announced tomorrow, and the rest will have to wait a little longer. However, I think this part of my work can be completed by the time the parliament meets next time, and the organization of the government will be completed in all aspects. For the sake of the public interest, I believe that it is necessary to convene the parliament today, and the Speaker also thinks so. Therefore, in accordance with his authority, he convened this meeting. After today's meeting, it is planned to ask the House of Commons to adjourn until May 21, but it will be convened in advance if necessary. The events that need to be considered at that time will be notified to the members of parliament as soon as possible. I now ask the House of Commons to pay attention to the proposed resolution, so as to express its agreement with the steps I have taken and to declare its trust in the new government. The organization of this mixed government is a major event in itself, but we must know that we are at the initial stage of the greatest war in history. We are engaged in war in many places in the Netherlands and Belgium. We must also be prepared in the Mediterranean. In addition, we must make various arrangements in the country. In this environment, I think I can be forgiven for speaking briefly today. If there are any omissions in etiquette, I hope that friends and colleagues will forgive me. I have told all the major officials who have joined the government that I have nothing to offer except blood, toil, tears, and sweat. Before us are long struggles and hardships. If anyone asks what our goal is, I can answer it in one sentence, that is, victory, no matter what the cost, no matter what the danger, no matter what the hardship, we must win, because we must know that without victory, the British Empire cannot exist, what the British Empire advocates cannot exist, and the era of human beings moving toward their goals cannot exist. However, I take up my work with a lively spirit and hope. This day requires the help of all, so I call out, let each rise up and move forward with the united strength of our people.

Labour Party member Clement Attlee stood up from his previous seat and spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, saying that the Labour Party immediately trusts the motion of the new government. Our country has achieved unity today through discussion, advice, and goodwill, but in other countries, unity is sought through detention camps, batons, and execution platforms. In less than two days after the cabinet upheaval last week, the war cabinet has been produced, and the new national defense officials have also taken office. The unity of the United Kingdom can be seen from this. David Lloyd George seconded, saying that I am one of the new Prime Minister's old friends. I congratulate him on taking office. I know his talent, perseverance, and his deep research and experience in war, all of which are urgently needed today. Now that he is in the highest position, I am deeply pleased to have found the right person. He exercises the highest responsibility in the most serious and difficult period that British Prime Ministers have ever encountered. All friends of freedom in the world wish him success. The hopes of the world are concentrated on him and pray for him. According to my observation, the United Kingdom and the British Empire are willing to offer their sacrifices for his command. (Great cheers) (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### British New Government's Far East Policy: Commentary from Chongqing Ta Kung Pao

Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao here recently published an editorial entitled "Asking the British New Cabinet's Foreign Policy", with quite blunt wording. Because it is a non-partisan newspaper, the tone expressed in the article can generally reflect the current views of the Chinese people. The article first calls Churchill a capable and diligent leader, saying that we are in this critical autumn of the European war, and it seems that it is not the time for us to ask the British new cabinet to state its Far East policy. However, there is something that we must point out, that is, if Mr. Churchill is not a decisive figure, we can save ourselves the trouble, because even if we ask, there will be no result. Now that Mr. Churchill has always expressed deep concern about Far East affairs and is a figure who embraces an active policy, we would like to raise this issue of mutual benefit to China and Britain. We frankly admit that in recent months, the general Chinese people have expressed concern about the possibility of a British-Japanese compromise. We are not very optimistic about it. It is not that we believe that Chamberlain is unwilling to compromise with Japan, but that this issue is not only related to Britain. According to our opinion, non-intervention is compromise. The British Foreign Office has recently declared that the British Far East policy has not changed and that it will not abandon the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, after careful consideration, we can assert that there is not much difference whether the British Far East policy has changed or not. Britain's trade has been destroyed by Japan, and its rights have been trampled on, but Britain has always tolerated it without taking any action. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has often requested compromise and understanding from Japan. Therefore, the British declaration that the Far East policy has not changed is actually empty talk, and there is reason to fear that it has secretly changed in fact, from passive compromise to active compromise. According to the opinions of various commentators, the late Chamberlain government was indeed willing to compromise with Japan. If Japan agreed to restore the Anglo-Japanese alliance or to reach an Anglo-Japanese understanding to maintain favorable neutrality for the British side in the European war, we can determine that Chamberlain would have accepted it. But why has the above situation not been realized? First, Japan wants another Anglo-Japanese alliance. Anti-British sentiment among the Japanese is quite strong, and Craigie's small actions are not enough to move the Japanese. The more humble Craigie's demeanor, the more arrogant Foreign Minister Hata becomes. Second, the American government and the public are against the policy of compromising with Japan. Because of the importance of the United States in the current European war, Craigie's policy has not been thoroughly implemented in the Chamberlain cabinet. Therefore, the failure of the Anglo-Japanese compromise is not due to the British policy, but to the policies of the United States and Japan. The main foreign policy of the Chinese government in the past ten years has always been pro-British. This situation is especially true among the Chinese people. Friendship with Britain is completely the same as with the Soviet Union and the United States. The reason is that British public opinion, especially the cultural class, is quite sympathetic to China. British officials and people in China and nearby areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore have all provided valuable assistance to China. The Chinese people are rich in emotion and understand the difficulties of others. Craigie's policy has caused Chinese people to wring their wrists but not to oppose it fiercely. We hope that Churchill will first decide who is the true friend and enemy of Britain in the Far East. He should not continue to compromise with the enemy but must provide effective assistance to the friend. We deeply know the significance of this war to Britain. At this critical time, Britain can no longer afford to have disputes with Japan. We understand this very well. However, attitude is one thing and policy is another. Unfortunately, Craigie's various activities last year have gone beyond the scope of attitude and are indeed the policy of the United Kingdom. Although Britain cannot adopt an anti-Japanese attitude, it can assist China. Britain has lent 25 million pounds to Turkey. What about its loans to China? I am afraid that the amount is far less than that lent to Romania. Britain currently needs 6 million pounds for daily war expenses. If it can use three days of expenses to assist China, its effect will be quite considerable. If Britain is prepared to fight for three years, then these three days of military spending will be a very great contribution to stabilizing the Far East situation, which would be negligible for its entire military budget.

### New York Foreign Exchange Market: Pound Continues to Fall

New York: Today, the pound exchange rate in the foreign exchange market has fallen due to the news that Germany has continued to make progress in the Netherlands and Belgium, and the lack of demand for the pound. However, speculators have bought in slightly. The opinions of military observers that Germany may launch a fierce air attack on the British Isles in the future are also the reasons for the fall in exchange rates. The opening was at $3.22, and the closing was at $3.16. The previous closing was at $3.28 to $3.31. This bank price feels that the pound's transaction has decreased, and it is expected that the list of goods that must be paid according to the official market exchange rate will be expanded, and the market will also be depleted. Currently, only a few thousand pounds of transactions can cause very large fluctuations. It is reported that exporters who have already received pounds that cannot be converted into US dollars according to the official market exchange rate have mostly hedged them out, so their losses will not be significant. The saying from London that it advocates controlling all pounds to avoid fluctuations in the price of free pounds is quite noticeable here. Those who say that Britain wants to expand control are easy to do, but it is doubtful that Britain is willing to risk losing gold or foreign exchange for unnecessary things. The French franc also continued to fall, with an opening of 1.815 and a closing of 1.79. The same is true for the Swiss franc, with an opening of 22.40 and a closing of 22.20.

### Anti-British Sentiment Rises Throughout Italy; Parliamentarians Accuse Britain and France of Monopolizing Oil Interests; Roman Students Stage Anti-British Demonstrations

Rome: The outcry against Britain and France has recently become more vocal in the Italian Upper House. Italian Upper House members have criticized Britain and France for monopolizing oil in Europe, preventing Italy from achieving self-sufficiency in oil. Senator Gayda made an even more impassioned speech this morning, saying that Prime Minister Mussolini will immediately work to resolve Italy's oil demands. Gayda claimed that, although Britain and the United States control gasoline, Italy's opportunity is coming, and the opportunity will come once the situation changes. All the famous gasoline locations are in the hands of Britain and France, while Italy has none. "The oil problem can be completely and actively resolved. I dare to believe that the Prime Minister will make Italy break away from this serious monopoly restriction." Senator Burzio recently spoke in the Upper House, believing that democratic countries are hindering Italy's self-sufficiency. Because once Italy can obtain oil, Italy's national power will increase. Wealthy countries such as Britain and France are all enemies of Italy, because these people are suspicious of Italy and regard Italy as an enemy. These wealthy countries may soon lose power, because science has become a powerful tool for the proletariat. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Rome: Students throughout Italy held demonstrations against the Allied contraband controls. Thousands of students in Rome paraded through the main streets, gathered in front of the Prime Minister's residence, and cheered Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister appeared on the balcony. The students later gathered in front of the palace, expressing their loyalty to the royal family and supporting the Prime Minister and the navy. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Rome: Foreign Minister Ciano released a memorandum yesterday detailing the damage to Italy's overseas trade caused by the British and French blockade policies. Newspapers here have reported it in a big way. "L'Osservatore Romano" also published an article, strongly criticizing the British naval inspection methods, roughly saying that this method is no different from piracy. We can hardly tolerate this any longer. The rights and prestige of the Italian nation have been trampled to this extent. This is unbearable. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Rome: The Italian news agency said that demonstrations against the Allied powers' abuse of contraband control laws have continued to occur in Italy. Police teams have now been added outside the British and French embassies and other consulates in Rome for protection. The general public is now increasingly resentful of those who buy and sell the "L'Osservatore Romano" published by the Vatican, because the "L'Osservatore Romano" commented on the heroic state of resistance of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, pointing out that the all-out war started by Germany has clearly shown that this is a war of annihilation without any psychological hesitation and also in violation of the laws of war. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### How Will Italy's Attitude Evolve? Depends on the Situation in Belgium

London: According to reliable but not yet officially confirmed sources, the Italian government recently provided assurances to the US ambassador, stating that it has no intention of immediately changing its current policy. However, political figures here say that it is necessary to be cautious about how Italy's attitude will evolve. The German and Italian governments have indeed been actively discussing the issue of troop passage recently. As of now, no decision has been made. However, the Italian authorities have clearly made many efforts to stir up anti-British and anti-French public opinion in the country. In short, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has not yet made a final decision on the issue of joining the war at this time. However, it would be too much of an illusion to think that the Italian Prime Minister might take into account the advice of the Vatican or moral concepts and abandon his plan. Therefore, the new guarantee recently provided by the Italian government to the United States, its validity period, I am afraid that it will be no more than two or three weeks at most. The situation of the battle in the Flemish region of Belgium will probably decide what decision the Italian Prime Minister will make in the future. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 14th)

### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Increase Defense Spending

Washington: President Roosevelt recently sent a special message to Congress, requesting an additional $63 million in supplementary defense funds in addition to the existing naval and army fees of $2 billion. Among the uses of these funds, $3.5 million will be used to purchase raw materials for defense projects required for military strategy and to cope with emergency situations, and the remaining $2.9 million will be used for the army to develop coastal defenses in Puerto Rico. President Roosevelt also said in his message that the above two expenses are urgently needed and should be resolved immediately.

Washington: Argentine Foreign Minister Cantilo recently made a proposal, advocating that the countries of the Americas should change their current neutral attitude to a "non-belligerent" attitude, so as to leave room for flexibility, just like Italy's attitude towards the current European war. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, the reporters asked for the government's views on the matter. According to the answer, the United States government is always prepared to carefully study any proposals made by any country, but this does not mean that it will always be accepted. Informed sources say that the State Department has already decided not to accept this proposal. There are two main reasons: (1) The so-called "non-belligerent" attitude has never been recognized by international law. (2) This attitude will conflict with the current Neutrality Act, and the amendment of the Neutrality Act must be approved by the people and Congress. Moreover, if the government authorities were to change course, not only would it be subject to criticism from isolationists across the country, but Japan would also regard it as a threat to the current state of the Dutch East Indies, thereby fueling its ambitions. For this reason, Foreign Minister Cantilo's proposal does not seem to be immediately submitted by the countries of the Americas for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Wang Chung-hui Broadcasts to the US, Expresses Concern for the Future of the Dutch East Indies, Japan May Take Action, Crisis Increasing in the Philippines, etc.

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui, in a broadcast speech to the United States tonight, expressed China's concern about the future of the Dutch East Indies as a result of Japan's recent declaration. He said, "A year ago, we pointed out that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island in China would be used as a stepping stone to threaten the Pacific possessions of various countries. Today, Japan has indeed stated in its declaration that it intends to place the Dutch East Indies under its protection, resulting in increased danger to the Philippines, the Straits Settlements, French Vietnam, and Australia. We are particularly concerned about what actions Japan may take in the Dutch East Indies, as there are over one million overseas Chinese there, who have made significant contributions to economic development and have substantial investments." Wang also stated that China's foreign policy has not changed in the recent developments in the international situation, and "we will not cease our resistance until our goals are achieved." (Reuters, 14th)

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui, in a broadcast speech tonight, briefly stated: "Although there have been many recent developments in the international situation, China's foreign policy remains the same as before. We are as determined as ever to resist Japanese aggression, and we will not lay down our arms until the Japanese militarists repent, regardless of how long the war may be prolonged. Recalling that we pointed out a year ago that after the Japanese militarists occupied our Hainan Island, they would use it to threaten the possessions of various countries in the Pacific, it is now clear from the statements issued by the Japanese side that the country's intention to covet the Dutch East Indies has been completely exposed. The impact of this is that the Philippine Islands, the Malay Peninsula, French Vietnam, and the Commonwealth of Australia have all been subjected to greater crises. It is estimated that the number of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is over one million, and the amount of their investment is particularly considerable. Therefore, if Japan takes any action in the Dutch East Indies, we cannot remain indifferent." (Havas, 14th)

### Sharp Drop in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, as various rumors circulated, were all beneficial to sellers, such as the German army suddenly attacking the Maginot Line, Allied war matters generally considered unfavorable. Affected by this, a major foreign bank in this city experienced a run on deposits. In addition, rumors about peace between China and Japan resurfaced.

### Rumors Rampant, Gold Market Unsightly, Foreign Exchange Softness Intensifies, Price Seen at 6460 Yuan

Yesterday's situation of the cash gold black market, the severity of the decline, was truly unprecedented, with a downward trend of a thousand miles. Operators were uneasy, especially those with long positions who suffered a great blow and were at a loss. Therefore, although the price fluctuations were huge, transactions were lacking. The reasons for the sharp decline were nothing more than rampant rumors. Among them, the recent great victories of the Chinese army and the speculation of peace between China and Japan, and the United States possibly entering the war, the bleak future of gold, and the rumor that German forces had broken through the Maginot Line, causing a run on deposits at foreign banks in this city, made the foreign exchange market extraordinarily soft, and the gold market followed suit.

Subsequently, because gold shops and a certain money changer competed to sell, and there were still few buyers, the price dropped another seventy yuan. The gold shop issued ten taels to a silver shop, for only six thousand seven hundred ninety yuan. Soon the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly, and the selling pressure eased, and another money changer and silver shop bought in quite a lot, resulting in a rise of sixty yuan. The silver shop took in a total of fifty taels from peers and others for six thousand eight hundred fifty yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, selling pressure resurfaced, as the market was filled with negative rumors, coupled with a sharp softening in the foreign exchange market, gold shops and securities firms competed to sell off, and a certain money changer came again to aggressively dump, and there were few buyers, and soon there was a sharp drop of two hundred seventy yuan. Silver shops did business with each other for ten taels, for only six thousand five hundred eighty yuan. By the closing time, the foreign exchange market had recovered slightly, so the market situation changed slightly, and a certain money changer and gold shop mutually re-entered to recover an increase of eighty yuan. The money changer entered thirty taels to the silver shop, for six thousand six hundred sixty yuan as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, gold shops raised prices to buy, reaching a slight increase. Gold shops entered thirty taels for silver brokers, for six thousand seven hundred yuan. However, at this time, sellers arose from all sides, doing business over the counter for fifty yuan less. Later, because the foreign exchange market softened, sellers came in an endless stream, and securities firms and money changers sold out in particular, and buyers were extremely cautious, so there was another sharp drop of two hundred yuan. The silver shop issued ten taels to the gold shop, for six thousand four hundred sixty yuan. It was stopped when the foreign exchange market stopped softening and started to recover, and the rumors that the peace rumors between China and Japan were inaccurate in the morning, which suddenly caused a buying frenzy. Silver brokers and another securities broker competed to drag in, and soon it rose by one hundred ninety yuan. The silver shop entered ten taels to the gold shop, for six thousand six hundred fifty yuan. After entering, the buyers reduced, and the price fell downward again. A certain securities firm came to spit out as much as it could, and it retreated to six thousand five hundred seventy yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by three hundred twenty-five yuan compared to the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, for a total drop of five hundred twenty yuan. After the close, it was ten yuan lower according to the evening closing price, and there were still few recipients. The entire market fluctuated by four hundred yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than the raw gold, and the purchase was reduced by twenty yuan.

### Yarn and Flowers, People's Hearts Timid, Yarn Market Plunges, Double Horse Falls Seventy Yuan

The yarn market plunged, and fell in a straight line. This was because the foreign exchange was lengthening, the price of gold was falling, and at the same time, rumors were rampant, and the market situation was as chaotic as hemp.

The initial opening of the spot yarn market was still peaceful. Because the foreign exchange rate changed to shrink, the spot price of 20s Double Horse was one thousand six hundred ten yuan, rising to twelve yuan. Then, rumors spread like a swarm, long positions sold out, and at the same time, the US exchange rose, and the selling pressure was great, falling to one thousand five hundred forty-five yuan.

### Securities, Foreign Stocks Plunge, Domestic Bonds Advance

Yesterday's securities grey market experienced an unexpected surge in prices, with a very strong trend. At the same time, the foreign exchange lengthened significantly, and gold and various commodities all fell sharply. Rumors arose in the market, some said ×× went to Chongqing, and the atmosphere for peace was strong. The market situation, which had been weak and listless for many days, suddenly became excited. Type A shares surged to over sixty yuan, and Type E shares broke out of the fifty yuan mark. The afternoon was especially firm, but the peace rumors had no basis. The sharp declines in other various sectors were entirely due to the poor situation in Holland and Belgium, and changes in the European war. Moreover, because it was impossible to determine the benefits and drawbacks, this trend was mostly a psychological effect. There are still many changes in the future, and one cannot stick to one view. Buyers from various accounts, such as Tiansheng, Lianyi, Yitai, and retail investors, continued to buy. Others such as Yitai, Zhongyi, Yikang, Yongkang, Hongda, and No. 64 also bought in successively. Long positions from Lianhe suddenly emerged again. Tongkang consistently sold off. Taifeng, Wufeng, Yichang, and Hongkang all sold off. The market price still rose sharply due to the demand exceeding the supply. The result was a consistent increase of six or seven jiao to one yuan and five fen, with a transaction volume of approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 60.10 59.35 60.00 Up 0.90

Unified B 51.85 50.90 51.85 Also 0.95

The Shanghai Industrial Share Exchange opened yesterday. Because the New York stock market had plunged the night before, prices were unsupported from the start. Later, the selling pressure intensified, to the point that buyers did not dare to bid. It was not until the last half hour before the evening closing that prices turned around. The losses were very large for English unions, Jardine Matheson, and various industrial stocks. International Trust and Yangtzekiang Silver Company each announced dividends of one and a half yuan, so the prices of the two were firm. Yangtzekiang shares fluctuated within a very narrow price range, unlike the large fluctuations of other well-known shares. The plunge was also severe, and the East India companies were under heavy selling pressure again.

### Miscellaneous Grains, Bean Cake Sales Develop

Yesterday's soybean cake market situation was still weak before firm, and the result was that because the external atmosphere was sluggish, yesterday's soybean cake sales were still active. In addition to the Shantou gang's half-installed and half-hearted sales, other gangs from Xiamen and various inland towns continued to inquire, so the trend in the morning maintained its shape. However, the afternoon was affected by the atmosphere, and the situation could not help but be shaken, and the transaction was diminished. A total of 6,000 zhang of Siyi Chang's brand cake was sold, priced at eleven yuan four jiao half to eleven yuan three jiao half. 300 zhang of Pudong Sheng Sheng's brand cake were priced at ten yuan six jiao half. 1 car of Changzhou Puli's brand Fatty character cake was priced at ten yuan seven jiao, and 3,000 zhang of Yantai cake were priced at eleven yuan to ten yuan eight jiao, it was said.

### Grains, Foreign Rice Rises Six Yuan in Recent Days, Japonica and Indica Rice Rise to Fifty-Three or Four Yuan

In recent times, the rice market has tightened again, rising every day, and yesterday's rise was still strong. The price of various foreign rice reached the highest peak of fifty-four yuan for number one Saigon and fifty-two yuan for Little Twist again for the previous time. In these few days, it has suddenly increased by a huge six yuan, which shows the ferocity of recent rice price changes. It is difficult to reconcile the rising prices of foreign rice producing areas. Subsequently, no further purchases were ordered, so the bottom of the Shanghai depot is now measurable. Moreover, as the European war intensifies and affects the future in many ways, it is rumored that the original merchants have a firmer mindset. Not only are they trying to hold firm, but they are also buying in monthly. Therefore, when there is an inquiry, the shouting rises repeatedly, and the actual needs are purchased regardless of the price. Inland village customers continue to release prices to search for various goods, and the prices have been seen to rise repeatedly under the mutual climbing. Unexpectedly, the market became tighter, and the general mindset was extremely chaotic. As soon as Saigon Little Twist reached the peak of the previous level, those who profited took advantage of the high price to sell their goods high, and then number one Saigon fell back to fifty-three yuan, and Little Twist fell to fifty-one yuan, a drop of one yuan. Knowing that the low price had just been issued, the short covering rose again, and the situation immediately became charming again, and the original market was restored in an instant. From then on, it was constantly fluctuating, and there were many changes, hovering back and forth, often with yuan worth of fluctuations. However, in the end, it could not penetrate the previous market, the new peak, and finally closed with fifty-four yuan for Saigon and fifty-two yuan for Little Twist, which was about one and a half yuan higher than the previous market closing price.

Since the domestic glutinous rice has recently been hoarding by large households, and the sales have turned strong, the market has reversed its previous state. Yesterday, although foreign rice continued to rise, its momentum was not as exciting as before, resulting in a price increase of only half a yuan to nearly a yuan. The price of Liyang Special yuan was 46 yuan 3 jiao, Jintan Special yuan 46 yuan 4 jiao, 5 jiao, 8 jiao, Changdan High yuan 44 yuan, 5 yuan, the market price was 42 yuan, 3 yuan.

The domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica is still scarce in its source, and the external dark market rumors about foreign rice are going hand in hand, opening is done in bulk, and the price is also rising by more than one yuan. Wuxi Special Clear billet 53 yuan and 4 yuan, Fen Japonica 52 yuan and 3 yuan, Chang Kun Japonica 52 yuan and 3 yuan, second grade to 51 yuan or so, Qing Si thin rice 52 yuan half, second grade to 51 yuan, Nan Gang early rice 51 yuan and so on.

### Flour and Wheat Transactions Quiet Again

The flour market was quiet again yesterday. This street's actual sales were sluggish due to the rain, and the purchase appetite was slow. Those directly approved by the factories were less than 5,000 bags. The return of the goods, buying and selling are both silent. The price of old brand warehouse orders is roughly the same as the factory price. Inland flour sales have also weakened. Only Shunfeng brand has opened at thirteen yuan eight jiao five fen, with occasional retail transactions. Japanese merchants are one-dimensional and still for wheat transactions, and sales from Chinese factories and export merchants are still sluggish. The listing of new wheat is getting closer, and the harvest is predicted to be abundant, so the old wheat market has already been declining, and the official transaction must wait for the new wheat to be listed.

### Piece Goods, Floating Hoarding and Dumping, Cloth Prices Plunge

Yesterday's domestic cloth market, the foreign exchange loosened, and gold and yarn prices all fell together. Due to the daily decline in actual sales, holders of cloth goods had floating thoughts and dumped sales. The market's downward trend gradually intensified, with fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth down by five jiao to one yuan and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth down by about one yuan. The street traded more than 200 pieces of various cloths. Hong Kong merchants purchased about 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and colored cloth. Zhejiang road, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taiwan merchants purchased nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Singapore overseas purchased several thousand pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth.

The actual sales of Dongbu are deserted, people's hearts are timid, and the downward trend is fierce. The lowest price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has dropped to 45 yuan and 8 jiao. It is said that due to the news of foreign exchange recovery, the market atmosphere expanded slightly. The Dragon Head closing price was 47 yuan and 2 jiao, but it was 3 yuan lower than the market price the previous day. Zhonglian brand fine cloth, and no one asked about it, plunging by 3 yuan and a half to 4 yuan per piece.

### Black Charcoal Interlining Searched Empty

Black charcoal interlining, the market was quite short of supply yesterday. According to the general factory households, most of the raw materials are expensive, and the cost is contrary to the market price, and they have all stopped weaving, and there are no products. Therefore, the single inventory of old goods is not enough to meet the demand, and it has gradually been searched empty. Full wool sells for 5 yuan and 5 jiao per yard, yarn wool number one sells for 4 yuan and 2 jiao half, number two sells for 3 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, and there are still few bulk buyers. Only Yuanchang, Huayang, and Dechang have a few sporadic products in the market. It is heard that the raw material wool for weaving black charcoal interlining, there are very few spot goods in foreign companies, and each pound must sell for 15 or 16 yuan. One pound of wool and cotton yarn can weave up to four and a half yards. Therefore, plus all the labor costs, the new black charcoal interlining, number two goods must cost more than four yuan per yard, and it is still a loss of three or four jiao compared to the current market.

### Sugar Market, Domestic Sugar Sees New High Price

Coarse white, initially weak and then firm in the morning, and then softened again in the afternoon. The association's marked price, spot 24 coarse white local depot 78 yuan to 78 yuan and a half, a small 4 jiao, new goods from foreign depots initially 76 yuan 9 jiao to 77 yuan, later rose to 78 yuan and a half, and fell back to 78 yuan and 2 jiao, and 77 yuan and a half in the afternoon, transshipment goods 61 yuan to 62 yuan in the morning, and 61 yuan and a half in the afternoon.

Domestic sugar is still soaring, especially white, which is especially expensive. Gongfen white saw a new high price of 94 yuan, with 94 bags traded. Second-grade Gongfen sugar, more than ten bags, also sold at 87 yuan.

### Silk Tea, Raw Silk Plunges

Yesterday, the price of silk suddenly turned down, with spot goods falling by 80 yuan, and forward goods falling by 48 yuan. New York's near-term was 1 jiao 2 fen lower than Saturday's, and the forward was 1 jiao 1 fen lower. Due to the fact that the cost of the spring cocoons this year is expensive and it is difficult to collect cocoons, and the weather has been bad, silk merchants are afraid to rashly throw their goods, and they are unwilling to sell their goods for cheap. There was no transaction in the market yesterday, and white silk was priced at 6200 yuan, but foreign merchants could not accept it, it was said.

Tianjin sent seven pieces of rayon and two hundred boxes of wool.

### Wuxi Spring Silkworms Are Good

- Daily Control Cocoon Row

The silkworms in the four villages of Wuxi have been developing quite rapidly in recent days. The large batches are now spinning. The early batches are opening leaves on the third sleep, but the output of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and the price is soaring. The price of each city street in the southeast road villages has been shouting as high as 12 to 13 yuan, and the price in the west road such as Wulihu area has been shouting as high as 15 yuan. Cocoon row is preparing, and the bulk is controlled by the Japanese side. All rows of cocoons to be collected must be registered.

### North-South Goods, Dried Longan Short

Dried longan, recently with no arrival, the inventory has become thin, the goods have long been opened and the stock is only sporadic and small, so the market price has turned from weak to strong, and there is hope of a rebound, but old goods are not strange, it is said.

### Hardware, Rebar Soars Hundreds of Yuan

The hardware market was still stable yesterday, as the foreign exchange had stabilized and people's hearts were at ease. However, the prices of various hardware products were still firm, which was due to the increasing expansion of the European war and the unfavorable situation in the Pacific Ocean. The source was tight, and the inventory in Shanghai was limited. However, the sales channels of the various merchants and factories remained the same, so the day when it would be difficult to stop in the future must be inevitable. Those holding goods are even more reluctant to sell, and the rebar is especially noteworthy. The only way to sell the goods is to the street construction gang, and there are few customers from other ports. It is noted that the goods were still sold for 1,000 yuan before May 1st (before the drastic changes in the foreign exchange this time), and the sales were very sluggish. Unexpectedly, after the foreign exchange plummeted this time, the intention to enter from all sides was strong, and the inventory was thin, and the market skyrocketed for a while, with the daily difference of hundreds of yuan. As of yesterday, the asking price per 1,000 catties has reached more than 1,500 yuan (three-point-four-point goods), and the selling price of five-point-to-coarse patterns per 1,000 catties has also soared to more than 1,450 yuan.

### New Pan Yuan Soars

The recent expansion of the European war has led to difficulties in transportation, which may lead to the shortage of new Pan Yuan goods, and the supply has been cut off, which has led to a sudden change in the market situation of foreign nails and soaring prices, and the standards of the goods have also been rising straight. The current market price per dan is 70 yuan, an increase of five or six yuan compared to the previous price. It is heard that about 100 dan were traded on the market yesterday, so the market is still not deserted.

### Lin Yutang Elaborates in the Philippines: China Holds the Advantage in the War of Resistance Against Japan; Japan's Strength is Hollow, Supply is Cut Off, Accurate Analysis Proves China's Inevitable Victory

The internationally renowned writer Mr. Lin, after residing in the United States for four years, has recently returned to China specifically to welcome the final victory of China. While passing through Manila, he made a speech, expressing infinite optimism about China's victory. It is now heard that Mr. Lin has given another public lecture in Manila, for which all attendees must purchase tickets, with all proceeds from ticket sales being allocated to the China Industrial Cooperatives.

Former Arrogance, Subsequent Humility, Helpless and Without a Plan

His speech stated that one can view the current Sino-Japanese War as a new Buick car speeding across a vast wilderness. Japan is the car, and China is the boundless wilderness. At present, it is difficult for us to predict whether the car can drive straight ahead or be damaged midway. However, what deserves attention is that the person driving the car has no goal. His fatal injury is the lack of gasoline in the car, relying entirely on the continuous supply from gas stations. However, all gas stations are operated by the United States. After the driver obtains gasoline, the reward given to the operator is constant insults, which makes the gas station owner angry and cut off the supply. Therefore, the driver, formerly arrogant and subsequently humble, is helpless and without a plan.

Favorable Situation is Exciting

He also said, "When I left the United States, newspapers there reported that Japan was quite optimistic about peace, but optimism about peace is also pessimism about war. China's attitude is the opposite. Japan has become weak and unable to launch battles like the Battle of Wuhan. Therefore, it is impossible for Japan to penetrate further into the interior. The reason why it cannot build well in the occupied areas is the same, in a word, its strength is hollow. The occupation of some land in China by Japan is only beneficial to Japan for the convenience of passing through when withdrawing troops." Mr. Lin also expressed great excitement about the current favorable situation in the war of resistance. After returning to China, Mr. Lin will take his family to live in Chongqing. It is heard that Mr. Lin also made his poetic remarks in Manila, saying, "I have always loved to admire the sunset, and I love it even more now. Every time I watch the sunset, I always think to myself, the sun has set, and the Japanese have spent another five million in wealth on the Chinese coast. I firmly believe that China's future is boundless and there is nothing to worry about, so people from all over the world do not need to worry about China."

### Shanghai Municipal Council is Considering a Salary Increase

Meeting to be Held on Thursday; Five Employees of the Public Works Department to be Dismissed

According to the English-language "North China Daily Mail," a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (the 14th) that the salaries of the Council's staff may be increased, and the exchange rate adjustment for Class A employees based on the exchange rate of one shilling and six pence will also be improved. However, details have not yet been announced. The Council's Personnel Committee, which is considering increasing salaries to cope with rising living costs, will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide on this issue and submit it to the next meeting of the Council's board for approval. The Director of the Public Works Department has submitted "certain proposals" to the Council's Public Works Committee. The Public Works Committee has discussed the Director of the Public Works Department's proposals and will submit a report at the Shanghai Municipal Council's board meeting on the 15th for approval.

It is heard that the nature of the Public Works Department Director's proposals is to seek to improve various problems in the Public Works Department, but the details were not known this morning. When reporters asked the Shanghai Municipal Council spokesman whether the Public Works Department Director's proposals were related to the Council's current austerity plan to lay off five employees of the Public Works Department, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of such news. According to recent reports, five employees of the Public Works Department received layoff notices last week, but the names of these five people could not be ascertained.

### The Gold Treasury Bond Lottery is Still Entrusted to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger

Future Payment Matters Will Also be Handled by This Bank

Since Germany's invasion of Belgium, people generally associated with the Shanghai branch of Banque Belge pour l'Étranger have feared the impact of the war and have rushed to withdraw deposits. Fortunately, the bank is well-prepared and sufficient to cope with the surplus. It is also heard that the bank is scheduled to hold the lottery and payment matters for the 1928 Six Li Gold Treasury Bonds on June 3rd at 3:00 PM on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China.

### After the Great Victory in Hubei and Henan, Uniform Bonds Surge, Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Price Decline Intensifies, Peace Rumors Proven False

Since yesterday, Shanghai's gold and financial markets have been experiencing turbulence due to reports of the war in Hubei and Henan, coupled with unsubstantiated rumors of peace talks. The black market for foreign exchange suddenly loosened, and the black market for gold and foreign stocks all plummeted. The value of legal tender on Shanghai's black market has risen, and the trading of national bonds on the stock market has been brisk, with prices soaring. The downward trend in raw cotton yarn is still intensifying, and speculators are once again actively engaged. The details are recorded as follows:

Frequent Victory Reports, National Bonds Soar: After the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange ordered a suspension of trading due to the war, trading in domestic public bonds has also been done on the black market. Last year, due to the increase in hot money in the Shanghai market, this black market trading became increasingly active. Today, because the government's commitment to maintaining credit remains unchanged, and with frequent reports of victory in the Hubei and Henan war, trading in black market public bonds has been brisk, and prices have soared. The closing prices for various Unified Bonds this afternoon are as follows: Class A closed at 59.55 yuan in the morning and 60 yuan in the afternoon; Class B closed at 51.10 yuan in the morning and 51.85 yuan in the afternoon; Class C closed at 48.95 yuan in the morning and 49.70 yuan in the afternoon; Class D closed at 48 yuan in the morning and 49.70 yuan in the afternoon; Class E closed at 49.90 yuan in the morning and 50.65 yuan in the afternoon.

Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens Sharply, Gold Plunges: Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a British bank, listed the British pound exchange rate as unchanged, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate was reduced by 1.25. The actual trading exchange rate suddenly loosened due to Chinese and Western merchants competing to hoard foreign exchange. At the same time, the black market for gold was rumored to be at peace, so the downward trend intensified. The morning closing price was 6,660 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 6,570 yuan, a significant drop of 325 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign stocks fell sharply yesterday, and the downward trend in raw cotton yarn intensified. The exchange rate premium fell to 110 yuan.

Market Rumors Proven Unfounded: Reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, such as someone flying to Hanoi to negotiate peace, have been proven unfounded. Speculators are deliberately spreading rumors to make profits during frequent reports of victory. In short, today's market in Shanghai is manipulated by speculators, which is completely different from the past. Today, seven out of ten transactions in the market are made by speculative experts. These people aim to make profits and are deeply afraid that rumors will subside and the market will stabilize, making it impossible to monopolize, so they create rumors at any time, and legitimate merchants suffer.

### Dutch Ships Resume Sailing: Java Ships Have Already Set Sail, But Limited to Within the British Naval Sphere of Influence; Routes to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian Ports Remain Unchanged

Since the European war affected the Netherlands, Dutch merchant ships sailing on European and Far Eastern routes were ordered to stop sailing. Dutch ships in the Far East were concentrated in Hong Kong and various British-controlled areas in Southeast Asia to await orders. According to reports from Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, after Dutch ships were ordered to temporarily suspend sailing, the Dutch government and British authorities discussed how to handle the situation. It is now learned that a decision has been made on the content of the plan, but details are unavailable. However, it is generally the same as the Norwegian merchant ship sailing plan, which is not to sail outside the British naval sphere of influence. Therefore, the original Dutch ships sailing in the Far East, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia will continue to operate on their original routes. It is now known that the Far Eastern Dutch ships exclusively managed by the Java Mail Steamship Company have been ordered to resume operating routes and temporarily not change. It is also known that the "Chisadan" ship, which had returned from Xiamen to Hong Kong to await orders, departed from Hong Kong on the 13th and will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th. The "Chine Cana" ship, which was waiting for orders in Little Luzon, also left Little Luzon the day before yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. In addition, the Royal Dutch Steamboat Company "Staghn" ship, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 16th. The new postal ship "Chi Zhalianjia" sailed from Shanghai back to Java, and was ordered to temporarily stop sailing at Little Luzon, and has now left the Philippines to return to Java.

### After the European Situation Becomes Tense, Mail Delivery Between Europe and Shanghai Continues as Usual

Since the expansion of the European war, ships from various countries have been ordered to stop sailing, resulting in reduced flights and transportation difficulties. In order to understand the status of overseas mail delivery, Xin Sheng News Agency reporters yesterday specifically visited the person in charge of the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration to inquire about the current methods of European mail delivery. The answer was as follows: The Postal Administration makes every effort to dredge and quickly deliver mail, both domestic and foreign, despite the extreme difficulties. Especially during the war, people in Shanghai all inquire about the situation at home by letter, so the Bureau will never interrupt the service within its possibilities to comfort the public. Regarding the current delivery of European mail, it is still transferred through the Pacific and Suez routes. Although the number of ship flights has been reduced, the delivery time may not be affected. Russia and Europe via Central and Western Siberia are now scheduled to be sent by train to Nanjing and Tianjin every Tuesday and Friday for transfer. The next mail to Europe will be sealed and sent on May 14th, May 19th via the Pacific, and June 3rd via Suez. The next parcel to the United States will be sealed and sent on May 14th. A large number of mails will arrive from Australia on the 15th at 8:00 AM, and the Bureau has prepared to distribute them to the recipients.

### Dutch Bank Ordered to Stop Paying German Deposits; Chinese and Other Nationals Can Still Withdraw; Similar Measures Taken by Dutch Banks in Japan

After news of the German invasion of the Netherlands reached Shanghai, there was a run on deposits at the Shanghai branches of Hollandsche Bank-Unie and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij. After the two banks were able to cope with the withdrawals with sufficient cash, the run gradually subsided. As for the deposits of German merchants, since no instructions had been received from the head office, payments were initially made as usual, and large amounts of funds were withdrawn successively. According to information from foreign banking circles learned by a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, the above two Shanghai branches received instructions from the head office the night before last that the deposits of Germans should be suspended from withdrawal from today. At the same time, the Dutch banks in Japan have also received similar instructions. The total amount of deposits of German merchants in Dutch banks there is 1.6 million yuan. Since receiving the order, payments have also been refused. As for the German people in Shanghai, since the formation of the Second European War situation on September 2 last year, all deposits that had been deposited in British and French banks have been successively withdrawn and transferred to various banks in the Netherlands and Belgium. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount is quite large. However, the deposits of Chinese and other nationals are still allowed to be withdrawn by the two banks and are not subject to any restrictions. In addition, the Shanghai branch of Banque Belge pour l'Étranger has not yet received any instructions from the head office, so the deposits of Germans are still being paid as usual.

In the majestic music of the Institute's band, the curtain was slowly opened. After performing the ceremony, Chairman of the Institute Yuan Ludeng delivered an opening speech, saying: "Today, the Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute is holding a charity bazaar at the Xin Xin Stage to raise funds for expanding education. Although the weather is not good and it is raining heavily, people from all walks of life are still enthusiastically coming to participate in the rain. This is not only something I am extremely grateful for, but all the staff of the Institute and more than 550 children should also bow their heads and thank you. As the saying goes, 'Doing good is the greatest joy.' Only children are the masters of the future. Moreover, in this period of resistance and construction, we should do our best for the future of the country, cultivate talents, and store them for national use. The significance of this is even more than simple charity and compassion. I would like to sincerely wish everyone present infinite longevity." Then the performance of the charity bazaar began.

Yesterday and today are the grand meeting of famous female Yue opera actors in Shanghai.

It is also not easy to collect national chess masters in one hall to compete with each other. Many people in Shanghai like this, but there is no opportunity to observe. Now that it can gather its great achievements and appreciate the art of various masters, it is also a grand event in the midst of disaster relief. All sectors of Shanghai society greatly admire the Institute's motivation for raising funds for children's education this time, so they are happy to undertake the sale of theatre tickets. It is heard that as of yesterday, the ticket revenue has reached 80,000 yuan.

### New Telephone Line Equipment Arrives in Shanghai; Installation Still Takes Time; Registered Users Will Be Installed Before the End of the Year; Chinese Employees of the Head Office Will Receive Salary Increases; Increase in Telephone Fees Not Yet Decided

Due to the abnormal development of industry and commerce and the rampant speculation, the installation of telephones in this city has experienced a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply. It is learned that there are more than 6,000 registered users who registered with the company months ago, but have not yet been installed. According to information obtained by a Pingming News Agency reporter from the company yesterday, the reason why telephones have not been installed is not because of a lack of telephone sets, but because the original equipment, with 7,100 automatic telephone lines and 1,000 ordinary telephone lines, has been

completely exhausted, so it is impossible to add more. For this reason, the company has ordered new equipment from the United States. The new equipment has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, but the installation procedures are quite time-consuming, so the users who have registered but have not yet been installed cannot be installed immediately, but at the latest by the end of this year, they can be installed. There are currently 2,500 telephone numbers starting with "6". Whether to increase them in the future depends on the number of needs. Because the automatic lines are insufficient, telephone numbers from "62" and below must be transferred by the company, so users feel quite inconvenient. This inconvenience can be eliminated after the new equipment is installed. The reporter then asked about the rumors that the company will increase telephone

fees. The company replied that this matter is true, but it has not yet reached the stage of decision. According to reports, the company's business is very prosperous, and last year's profit reached a huge 2,861,748 yuan. It is also reported that the company, in view of the soaring prices and the sharp increase in the cost of living, has been approved by the New York head office last month to increase the salaries of all Chinese employees of the Shanghai company by 30% and add a rice subsidy of 10 yuan.

### A Grand Musical Event of Chinese and Western Ensembles

For the Orphanage and Widows

Solo Recital Songs All Famous Songs: That night, Chinese and Western listeners gathered to listen to the beautiful music. There were solo recitals, ensemble singing before, and six special songs requested by the temporary audience. Among them, the moonlight piece by the famous musician Xu Men, Lei Cuike sang as if he was in the scene, thought-provoking, worthy of the artist's work of a great professor. It is a pity that Professor Lei did not sing the original vernacular of the song, but sang the translation, which is a pity, because the original meaning is inevitably lost once translated. However, the voice and tone are the soul of singing. Fortunately, Professor Lei can fully express the essence of music, which is admirable.

Hu Qiyuan Sings Italian Songs: Miss Hu Qiyuan sang a section of UnBeldi in Italian (i.e., one of the Butterfly Madam scripts), and then sang AveMarin in Latin, with clear pronunciation and very pleasant to the ear, making people fascinated. After years of hard training in the ancient Italian method, she was able to achieve this. Miss Hu's performance on stage is dignified and elegant, not only has musical intelligence, but also has natural beauty, both of which are rare. She can represent the characteristics of the Chinese nation's systematic characteristics. The reporter hopes that she will one day go abroad and promote the inherent culture of the Chinese nation.

Xue Jiangqing's Singing is Thought-Provoking: Xue Ying's singing, if further trained, will definitely be a promising material in the future. The sound is elegant, like the morning bird's language with crystal dew. The school is very similar to Mrs. Fia Lai, a famous singer for many years. Mrs. Jiang's voice, the beauty lies in the flexibility of adding a little bit, listening to it is thought-provoking. Although she has a slight cold, she can cope with it easily.

Bell Song is Rare and Valuable: The point of Miss Flumen's singing is that the work on the transfer of sound is indelible. She is young and has little experience, but for the bell song, the lyrics are long and the tune is high, and she can end the play, which is also rare and valuable. Mr. Lu Weide from Austria accompanied the entire program that night, never slackening, which shows his profound piano art.

Song, Flowers, and Shadows: Happy and Forgetful: The selection of the entire program that night was very precise. It was nearly midnight at the end of the show. The audience listened quietly and happily, and they were tireless. The splendor can be known. Moreover, the stage was full of fresh flowers, dazzling and beautiful. Later, the performers only saw Hibiscus's face, reflected in the flowers, and the clear songs were melodious, and came from the flowers. Beautiful women and famous flowers, reflecting each other's beauty, are like a wonderful painting of butterflies in love with flowers.

### Night Soil Collectors and Road Workers Strike, Authorities Seek Resolution, Road Workers Propose Five Conditions, Citizens Hope for Early End to Labor Unrest

Since night soil carters, street cleaners, and road workers demanded wage increases and went on strike, a noteworthy situation has developed in the past two days. Garbage cans in various alleys are full to overflowing, blocking the roads. Residents dump excrement everywhere, and after pouring it into the inner ditches, it repeatedly emerges on the ground, causing a stench that makes people cover their noses. Due to the street cleaners' strike, the city's appearance has been damaged, especially at tram and bus stops, where fruit peels and discarded tickets are scattered all over the ground, trampled by people, presenting a very messy and dirty scene.

Excrement and filth cover the ground, and a stench fills the air. Yesterday morning, near Xinzha Road and Chengzhe Road, a destroyed night soil cart was left by the roadside, and yellow and white objects were scattered everywhere, possibly destroyed by striking workers. Residents within the concession, mostly living in small rooms, cannot accumulate excrement and garbage for even a day, and all hope that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible. The English-language North China Daily News reported that the night soil carters in the Public Concession, demanding wage increases, began a strike. This morning (the 14th) at 8:00 AM, several night soil carters dumped the night soil from their carts onto the road at the intersection of Beijing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. It is reported that similar disturbances have occurred in other parts of the Public Concession. The Fire Brigade was called to the intersection of Beijing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road to wash away the night soil. Several night soil carters attempted to stop them, but retreated when the police arrived on the scene. In addition, the striking street cleaners have not yet made direct demands to the Public Works Department. However, according to an official from the Public Works Department this morning, the authorities will meet with representatives of the strikers today or tomorrow in order to resolve the dispute.

Road Workers' Five Conditions After road workers in the Public Concession went on strike due to demands for wage increases and rice subsidies, yesterday morning, they sent representatives to petition public organizations such as the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the First Special District Citizens' Federation, requesting assistance. In addition to stating that they were forced to ask the Municipal Council to improve their treatment due to prices and the difficulty of making a living, the representatives submitted five conditions, requesting that they be conveyed to the Municipal Council for adoption. The five conditions are recorded as follows: (1) For wages, request an increase of 30% on the existing wages; (2) For rice subsidies, take a rice price of 20 yuan as the standard, and the Municipal Council should subsidize the excess (with each person supplying two non-working family members as the standard, requiring three liters of rice per day); otherwise, please the Municipal Council sell at a flat price of 20 yuan per dan; (3) During holidays, if work is required, please pay wages at double the rate; (4) Wages should also be paid during weekdays when there is no work; (5) Raincoats must be provided for working in the rain, and if work is stopped due to rain, wages should still be paid.

Demands of Night Soil Cart Workers The minimum wage for night soil cart workers is only four yuan, with most earning nine yuan per month. The workers are now requesting the contractors to whom they are subcontracted: (1) A monthly rice subsidy of ten yuan, which will not be paid if the rice price falls to twenty yuan; (2) The small account for each cart is currently six fen, please add two fen to make it eight fen in total; (3) It is customary for each store and household to receive a subsidy of two jiao per commode, now please increase it to three jiao. For the above three items, the workers request the contractors to apply to the Municipal Council for approval.

### Mother and Daughter Tragically Strangled, Perpetrator Flees Without a Trace, Victims Dressed as Villagers, Two Men Accompanied Them to a Private Room in a Hotel, Why They Were Killed is Still Under Investigation

In Room 29, No. 5, Lane 606, Fuzhou Road, a tragic case of a mother and daughter being suddenly strangled to death occurred on the ninth of the month. The two murderers fled without a trace after the incident. The general situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, details of the situation are explored and recorded as follows.

Private Room in a Hotel Runhua Hotel is located at No. 5, Lane 606, Xiaohuajiao, Zhejiang Road, Fuzhou Road, and has been open for many years. Most of the guests come from other ports. The other day (the 13th) around 4:00 PM, two men and one woman arrived, the woman carrying a girl about two or three years old. The waiter led them to Room 29 on the second floor, paid three yuan for the room, and registered as Wang Zhongli, from Qidong, 36 years old, a cloth merchant. After the waiter brought tea and firewood, the door was immediately closed, and there was no sound.

Tragically Murdered It was not until around 8:00 PM that the two men went out together. Around 9:00 PM, the waiter went to the room to get slippers and found the mother and daughter both tragically strangled under the bed. Their bodies were cold, and they were dead. He immediately reported the situation to the Laoza Gate Police Station, which ordered four detectives to investigate and take photos. An inspection of the clothes and bags left in the room revealed only the girl's diapers and a few small clothes. The mother's neck still had a woman's belt around it, and the child's head and neck had a hemp rope around them. The corpses were still lying on their mothers. After careful inspection, it was clear that the mother and daughter had been strangled to death, and the bamboo mat was placed upright on the bed. It was undoubtedly the two men who had murdered them. The police are currently conducting a strict search for the two fugitives.

Investigation of the Case When the reporter heard the news, he rushed to investigate. According to the hotel accountant, the people in this case were all dressed as villagers. One man was wearing a coffee-colored long gown, and the other man was wearing a light gray short jacket, both around thirty years old. The murdered woman was wearing a black short coat, new black cloth shoes, and a striped cloth shirt and pants. She was also about twenty years old. The dead child was wearing a floral striped short jacket and pants, and a red cloth vest. It was later discovered that the mouths of the two dead were stuffed with straw paper, so the adjacent rooms on the left and right did not hear any noise when the murder occurred. The reason why the two men committed this heinous act is still unknown.

### Case of Kidnapping Chen Wenzhao, One Bandit Arrested, According to Confession, Two Accomplices Released by Puppet Police

Chen Wenzhao, who lives at No. 16, Lane 335, Yanping Road, is a contractor with some savings. On the 27th of last month at 11:30 PM, more than ten bandits, each armed with pistols and Mauser pistols, broke into his house and robbed him of 100 yuan in cash, as well as gold rings and coats. At the same time, they handcuffed Chen, kidnapped him. At this time, a certain Jia, the lane manager, learned that Chen's house had been robbed and reported it to the Chinese police and puppet police stationed nearby. At the time, the puppet police officer Xie immediately rushed to the outside of Chen's house.

They fired three shots in warning, and the bandits fired back three shots. Then they took Chen and fled. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already fled without a trace. The detectives found a ladder, three Mauser pistol shell casings, and a pair of shoes left by the bandits in the victim's house. Chen was released by the bandits the next day after being kidnapped, but he suffered minor injuries from falling when he was suddenly taken away by the bandits. It was not until the other day that Xu Decheng, Tao Aifu, and Wu De Kui, detectives from the Route Tenant de Tourville Police Station, arrested

Yu Zhijiang, a bandit from Yangzhou, was brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the lawyer of the police station, Jiang Baolian, explained the process, and said that according to the defendant's confession, they had planned to kidnap Chen and demand a ransom of 50,000 yuan when they went to Chen's house at the time. However, after kidnapping him, they released Chen because the situation was urgent. The cotton-padded coat that the defendant had robbed had already been recovered by the detectives. It was also found that the Zhabei "Police Station" had arrested two suspects after the incident. When the police station went to inquire, the "Station" claimed that the two had nothing to do with the case and had released them that night. But now,

According to Yu's confession, the two people arrested by the "Police Station" at the time were accomplices who went with him, and they were all carrying weapons. The case still needs to be investigated, so he requested that the hearing be postponed. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned Chen Wenzhao and Yu Zhijiang, he ordered Yu to be returned to custody and the hearing postponed.

### Gatekeeper Shot and Killed by Thieves

Qiu Changchun, a Shandong native, 53 years old, was a gatekeeper at No. 2, Lane 355, near the intersection of Connaught Road and Avenue Haig. At around 9:30 PM last night, several thieves attempted to enter the house to rob it. At the time, the gatekeeper, seeing that the people who came were suspicious, questioned them. Unexpectedly, they took the initiative to grab the gatekeeper around the waist and snatch the official pistol he was carrying. The gatekeeper fought back regardless of his own safety, and shouted for help. However, he was outnumbered, and the gun eventually fell into the hands of the thieves. Seeing that the gatekeeper was still shouting, they opened fire. The gatekeeper fell to the ground, and the thieves scattered and fled with the gun. By the time the people in the house heard the noise and came out to see what had happened, the gatekeeper was already dying. They quickly reported it to the police station, which sent the gatekeeper to the hospital. However, because the injury was to a vital area, he died shortly after. The police are currently searching for the gang of thieves and tracking down the whereabouts of the gun.

### Thieves Arrested for Resisting Arrest

Near the intersection of Route Paul Henry and Route Tokyo in western Shanghai, several thieves were plotting something at around 9:00 PM last night. A patrol of Chinese police officers passed by and tried to search them. Unexpectedly, the thieves opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese police officers fought back, resulting in the capture of one thief and the seizure of a pistol. The remaining thieves escaped. The captured thief and the weapon were taken to the police station. It is reported that the thief is named Wang Xiaosanzi, from Jiangbei, 22 years old. He was shot in the chest and legs by the Chinese police officers and fell to the ground.

### The Dade Steamer, Fully Loaded with Cotton, Had a Huge Sum of Money Hidden Inside and Was Robbed. A Seaman Was Arrested and Confessed to Dozens of Accomplices. Negotiations Were Proposed After the Dade Steamer Was Burned.

The Dade Steamer (flying the Japanese flag) previously loaded more than 100 pieces of cotton and more than 20 pieces of yellow wolf skins in northern Jiangsu and came to Shanghai. It was docked at the Xinhuishan Wharf for transshipment and unloading. It was rumored that more than 200,000 yuan in silver dollars was hidden in the cotton. Later, it was discovered by Little Xu, a cotton merchant king from Changzhou in the Hongkou North Gang, and Zhang Miaolin and Wang Changsheng, who worked as longshoreman. They colluded to set the steamer on fire to rob it. Later,

Due to the uneven distribution of the loot, infighting broke out and it was exposed. A thug impersonated a detective and blackmailed them for 1,700 yuan. At the same time, the Customs and Jiangkou Police Station on Avenue Edward VII learned about it and sent Detective Gu Wenkui to investigate. It is now known that the details of this case are extremely complicated, and there have been recent developments. The seaman Little Mao Lang has been arrested. He confessed to more than 50 accomplices. Later, several seamen, including Little Mazi, Lansheng, and Atu, were also arrested. They also confessed that Jin Mei represented Wang Changsheng in resolving the blackmail matter, and Wang Changsheng's

lighter was impounded and a small amount of stolen goods were recovered. It is reported that there were two leather suitcases, containing some gold bars, which have been moved ashore. Later, an informant, Little Mao Gou, reported that Wang Changsheng's two sons, Quan Shoufu and Shouquan, were hiding in the Dahua Hotel on Baliliqiao Street, so the police first arrested the Wang Shouquan and Shoufu brothers. Zhang Miaolin set up a tea party at No. 36 Yong'an Street (the former Senhe Tea House, which is now closed). Others also set up a lighter company upstairs, specializing in transporting goods for customers. He went to arrest him, but Zhang Miaolin had already

escaped after hearing the news. As for the 26 lighters, small steamers were used to tow them to Bailianjing, Zhoujiadu, Liuliqiao and other places to escape. The lighters had no shareholder relationship with Zhang Miaolin, and were probably hired by Zhang to transport goods. It is reported that the cotton and yellow wolf skins were declared and transported by Zhonghe Customs Broker on behalf of the customer. After the Dade Steamer was burned, it could no longer operate. Negotiations have also been proposed, requesting compensation. The fugitives are currently being strictly arrested and brought to justice.

### The Kidnapping of Elementary School Student Li Zhaolin

The kidnapping of Ningbo student Li Zhaolin at 4:30 PM the other day has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the French-language newspaper in this port, the details of the case are disclosed in detail as follows: At 6:05 PM the other night, a foreigner living on Route Amiral Courbet called the Jing'an Temple Police Station and said that across from his residence, he had found a silver car parked for more than half an hour. There was no one in the car, and he feared that the car was being used in a certain case. After receiving the news, the police station immediately sent detectives to the scene. Inside this car, a schoolbag was found, with books tied with leather straps, and there was a seal of a certain elementary school on Route Amiral Courbet. The detectives then went to the school to inquire and learned that the books belonged to Li Zhaolin (11 years old), a student at the school. Li is the son of real estate businessman Li Aian, residing at No. 2, Lane 767, Route Kaufmann. After his parents confirmed that the schoolbag was indeed his son's, they realized that Li had been kidnapped. The car driver also went to the police station to report that at 4:40 PM, he carried four customers and drove to Route Amiral Courbet when he was threatened by guns by these people and driven out of the car. At the time, they also took his cap and put it on by another man and drove away quickly. He was taken by two bandits to a village where he walked around for about an hour, and then released him after 6:00 PM. The police have now obtained clues and found that someone witnessed four bandits forcibly dragging a child towards a small village after 5:00 PM. The child was still struggling and calling for help.

### The Origin of Soda Fountains

Durand invented the soda fountain, which became popular from the United States to France, England... Many businessmen have since become wealthy, and tens of thousands of men, women, old and young, have become close friends with this refreshing, invigorating, and fatigue-recovering fountain. In the United States alone, there are as many as 90,000 of these soda shops, of which 30,000 belong to pharmacies and 40,000 belong to candy stores, clubs, ballparks, and subway stations. In addition, 15,000 soda fountains are located in department stores and various shops, and 5,000 are in hotels and restaurants, with total annual sales being considerable.

This Frenchman Durand originally served as a pharmacist in Napoleon's army. In 1817, he was exiled to the United States to seek a living, wandering in New York, Boston, Baltimore, and finally to Philadelphia. There were quite a few French people there, including one of Napoleon's brothers, and this place was also the center of the American pharmaceutical industry, so Durand decided to start a business there.

Before serving in Napoleon's army, Durand studied under Mr. Chevillot, a versatile Frenchman. All botany, mineralogy, medicine, and chemistry were taught by Mr. Chevillot, so Durand also became a versatile person. He opened a pharmacy in Philadelphia, selling beverages, tobacco, and other items. The various sodas he sold were his special drinks.

This new-style shop opened in April 1825, and the soda fountain became the most popular installation, with mahogany, cabinets, magnetic bottles, French medicines, chemicals, mirrors, and a large marble counter. The equipment for making soda water was installed on this large marble counter. The soda fountains in the cold drink shops in Shanghai are not accidentally made of large marble counters. (E.L.)

### Police Solve Petty Thief Gang, Leader Arrested

Several days ago, detectives from the Laoza Gate Police Station cracked a large-scale pickpocket organization in this city, arresting three men, two girls, and six boys. According to the investigation, the two men rented a room in a hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, specializing in taking in runaway children aged 16 to 18 and teaching them pickpocketing skills. They had two boys pretend to fight in the street, while their accomplices took the opportunity to pickpocket in the crowd. After several months of "training," they were dispatched to the busy areas of Nanjing Road every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, dressed as students. They conducted their first trial on the 7th of this month and it was unexpectedly effective, so they had accumulated a large amount of stolen goods in the past few weeks, such as wallets, fountain pens, pencils, etc. Unexpectedly, they were cracked in front of Wing On Department Store. After strict questioning by the police, clues were obtained and the leader of the organization was arrested at the address.

### Construction Industry's Miao Kaikin Detained

Family Members Trying to Rescue Him

Miao Kaikin, a native of Funing, lives at No. 3283, South Yinghua Lane, Route Paul Henry. Before August 13th, he was engaged in the building materials business. Later, his business was suspended due to the war. His mother and several brothers were killed in a Japanese air raid at their residence on Yangjiazhai Road in Shanghai. Miao was deeply stimulated, and his national consciousness became stronger. During the puppet Reformed Government, the Japanese advisor of the puppet Ministry of Industry, Takahashi, once invited Miao to handle construction matters for the Japanese army. Miao was not tempted and resolutely refused. Unexpectedly, he was resented by a certain party for this reason. At around 8:00 AM on the 7th of this month, he was instructed by a certain Zhou to go to the leasing office at No. 1, Lane 1, North Yinghua Lane, Route Paul Henry, to talk. It was heard that it belonged to the Rihua Spinning Mill. He was detained in the team by a certain gendarmerie stationed at the Rihua Spinning Mill and has not been released yet. Later, his family reported it to the police station, and they are currently trying to rescue him.

### Relief Association Branch to Discuss Tomorrow How to Settle the Remaining Displaced Persons

Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch began the second batch of resettlement work, there are currently more than 5,000 refugees under the management of the branch. By the 17th of this month, more than 2,000 people can still be resettled. Although most of the remaining 1,000 refugees are elderly, weak, women and children, there are also some young and strong people. Although the Relief Association has notified all shelters to resettle the young and strong by the end of this month, the industries and others have no place to accommodate them after that, and they have requested to continue to be accommodated. It is reported that since the Dunxin Road Refugee Shelter, which is affiliated to the Relief Association, began resettlement work, the total number of refugees accommodated has decreased from 14,000 to 11,000. The number of refugees in the shelters of the Cilian General Association is still more than 12,000, plus the more than 5,000 refugees in the Cilian Branch, the total number of refugees is less than 20,000. The refugees in the shelters have decreased, but the number of beggars in the streets has obviously increased, which is quite noteworthy.

### Weather Report

The Meteorological Observatory in Xujiahui reported at 4:30 PM on the 15th that the weather around Shandong is changeable and uncertain, with directional dust storms. There is a strong squall cyclone in the northern East China Sea, with rain or fog, due to the low pressure passing through the northeast east. Fog in the south of Ma'an Island, with a strong squall southeast wind. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 66.0 and the lowest was 61.0. On the same day last year, the highest was 80.8 and the lowest was 57.6.

### Watching a Play Causes Trouble (2)

The bannermen below the stage were rubbing their fists and palms, thinking in their hearts that the villagers, seeing external support, would definitely urge an attack from within, so that they could break through the encirclement with a combined attack from inside and out. Therefore, several bannermen clamored and advanced, intending to first open the theater door to support the people on stage. The crowd of villagers guarding the door saw the bannermen below the stage rising up together with clenched fists, knowing that they were going to assist those on stage. They couldn't help but bare their arms and shout loudly in response. In an instant, hundreds of villagers, both inside and outside the temple, rushed to gather. Although the villagers had no other weapons, the carrying poles on their shoulders and the tobacco pipes in their hands were swung horizontally and struck downwards with the force of a rainstorm. The bannermen were trapped in the center, outnumbered and unable to defend themselves, let alone rescue others. They all risked their lives to break through the encirclement, scrambling to escape. However, more and more villagers came from near and far, their courage increasing. They then threw open the theater door, and when they saw someone escaping, they attacked him as a group. Therefore, none of the dozen or so people standing on the stage managed to escape. Although none suffered fatal injuries, their clothes were all torn, and they returned covered in blood, suffering from their wounds. It was said that more than a dozen villagers were also injured. During the conflict between the two sides, there were a dozen or so bannermen, neatly dressed, standing under the mulberry trees, watching with their hands in their sleeves, not coming to help. The villagers treated them with the respect due to honored guests and even apologized to them, showing how effective propriety and law can be in subjugating people.

### The Character of a Mother (3)

A child without a mother has fewer opportunities in life than others, and his life race will be greatly hindered as a result. The success of great figures is often due to their mothers. A child without a mother is pitiful, and a child without a good mother is even more pitiful. Xiang Bo had a disreputable mother, who bore a disreputable son. Once, the son committed a crime and was arrested. When the prosecutor said he wanted to meet with the mother, the prosecutor allowed it. Unexpectedly, during the meeting, he hatefully bit off one of his mother's ears. It is said that his mother had deprived him of his natural rights and proper upbringing. When ancient Greece and Rome had virtuous mothers who trained their children, their countries were strong and dominant for a time. Later, Greece produced a group of playboys, and Rome produced a group of lewd individuals. God then began to erase their glory, causing their countries to be overthrown, just as one wipes away the contents of a plate and then turns the plate upside down. (4) The growth of benevolent white flowers shows the benevolence of the mother. The mother's life is benevolent and progressive. In this family school, not only are there children as students, but the mother herself also learns carefully in all matters. Therefore, her loving heart is expanding day by day. (5) The quality of faithful white flowers shows the mother's faithfulness. The mother's love never diminishes, and her attitude is very faithful. When a child is sick and lingers without recovery, the father may become discouraged due to anxiety, but the mother forgets her fatigue and always hopes forward. The father is impatient with the son's stubbornness and disobedience, or even wants to drive the son out of the house, but the mother is not like that. She never loses heart, and her love binds her children, not letting them wander away. Therefore, human mothers are worthy of our utmost respect. However, a sensible mother is unwilling to take such respect for herself, because all her purity, beauty, love, and faithfulness are only reflections of God's true light. She must give all glory to God. (The End) If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

### A Sixth-Grader's Diary

— Xu Bide

The author was introduced by a good friend to teach on probation at a certain free primary school. When grading a sixth-grader's diary, there were several pages like this, and now I have copied them below:

May 2nd: Today, the second landlord called three loafers and unreasonably moved our bed, table, and chairs all into the alley. My dad said, "Please give us a few more days to pay the rent, and move the things back in, okay?" The loafers not only didn't agree but also clenched their fists, looking very fierce, which made my mom speechless and my little sister cry non-stop. Later, thanks to the old uncle next door who interceded, they agreed to wait a few days for payment, and the things were moved back in.

May 3rd: Dad is frowning and worried because I still can't find a job. Dad said to Mom, "I'm thinking of borrowing usurious loans to try being a peddler." Mom said, "You have to donate for a permit first before you can do that."

May 4th: Dad is breathless and his face doesn't look good. He said, "Alas! The thirty yuan I borrowed from the usurious loan today was lost in my pocket, I don't know how." Mom said anxiously, "What's going to happen? The poorer we are, the closer we are to death!"

May 5th: Mom is sick, her body is hot. Dad has empty hands, how can we have money to hire a doctor? Little sister is still crying and asking Dad for fried dough sticks to eat, but Dad has no way.

May 6th: Mom can get up now, probably because the tea medicine was effective yesterday afternoon. I'm really happy, Mom has the strength again to wash clothes for others. Dad said, "Today's usurious loan has to be paid no matter what, and the rent has to be paid too, if we don't pay, they'll do that again." Mom said, "There's nowhere to borrow money, and I can't find work. Now we have no choice but to sell the table and chairs to the used goods stall."

May 8th: Now, in our house, besides some broken things, there is only one bed left.

### The Problem of Juvenile Delinquency

When a little life cries out upon landing in the world, the parents always have indescribable joy and even hold sky-high hopes, hoping that their child will grow up to be outstanding, make a great career, bring glory to the family, and serve society and the country. But without the parents' painstaking guidance, it is very dangerous. The saying "At the beginning of man, his nature is good, his natures are similar, his habits are different" is an observation of human nature by the ancients. Human nature is inherently good, but the goodness or badness of the environment can lead the child's innocent goodness astray.

Juvenile delinquency has become one of the serious problems in today's society, and it has to be attributed to major defects in children's education.

This problem is more likely to occur in bustling cities and has been developing rapidly in recent years. A few days ago, there was a report on "petty theft gangs" that needs to be institutionalized. And the proactive solution, the only way to start from the bottom is not for merit.

(1) Causes of juvenile delinquency

(1) Poor family environment: (2) Association with despicable friends: (3) Poor children's guardians: (4) Temptation from the outside world.

(2) Types of juvenile delinquency

(1) Theft or robbery: (2) Laziness and truancy: (3) Minor misconduct, disrupting public order.

(3) How to prevent juvenile delinquency

(1) Organize educational children's gatherings; (2) Improve youth groups (reformatories), etc.; (3) Implement better juvenile delinquency laws; (4) Have sufficient parks and sports fields for children to play properly; (5) Guide them with normal entertainment; (6) Implement compulsory education to make children understand their own cleanliness and goodness and get on the right track; (7) Study the causes and provide good guidance.

The above is just a rough outline. I hope that people who are enthusiastic about public welfare will do some good deeds to improve children, seek happiness for society, and create a bright future for the country.

### A Lesson in Hoarding

— Jian Tian

After the outbreak of the European war, a new "maxim" became popular in the speculative market: all imported goods can be hoarded. So, all kinds of clothing, daily necessities, and even medicines and cosmetics were locked in warehouses and shelved, waiting for exchange rate fluctuations, smoking cigars, and waiting to get rich.

This situation also affected ordinary people. Those with a little money in their hands also copied other people's old tricks and "bought a little bit of goods."

My friend, Mr. So-and-so, for some unknown reason, perhaps it was to play a "dark horse," hoarded a batch of sewing needles. After a few days, it was as if hot chestnuts popped out of cold embers, and the price of foreign needles soared. But it's easy to hoard, hard to sell, and waiting and waiting, they were piled up at home and couldn't be "realized." Up to now, according to market prices, he would certainly have earned money, but even if he put up an advertisement, no one would buy. It seems that he can only keep them for himself and hoard them to the end!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 24: Lakes and Mountains Refreshed, Each With Its Own Beauty; Men and Women Rejoicing, Together Shouting "Long Live"

It is said that when Zhu Airen and others arrived at the toy stall on Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi, they saw a set of three clay figurines of children displayed there, their faces strikingly similar to the triplets in their orphanage. Asking about the reason, they learned that they were also products of Mrs. Xue's toy factory. Originally, this was first started by those toy companies in Europe and America. Ten years ago, the foreign dolls they made included idols of movie child stars Shirley Temple and Joan Carroll. There were also quintuplets from Canada who were also made into toys. This trend has gradually become popular in China. Zhu Airen asked Mrs. Xue, and Mrs. Xue felt very sorry. She said, "I didn't know they were from your orphanage. There is a technician in our factory who said that there is a family of triplets who are very lively and cute. He took a few photos and simulated them from the photos. He said he had even gone to see them himself. I was negligent for a moment and didn't ask where he had seen them. This is still a new product! I'm really sorry. I don't know if he ever sought the consent of the children's parents and guardians. Dr. Zhu, what do you think we should do?" Zhu Airen said, "It's not a big deal. Fortunately, you're not using the children for advertising. This comes from a love of beauty. I'll go back and inform their parents." Shao Huihua had already taken the clay figurine of the child in her hand. The head, face, hands, and feet were exposed, and the rest were wearing colorful clothes that could be changed. Mrs. Xue said, "This is a bit more exquisite. Although it's called a clay figurine, it must be mixed with other oil wax materials to be so beautiful and not easily broken." As she spoke, she discussed with the toy store and gave each of them a set of these clay figurines of the triplets. However, Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyu, a newly married couple, were given one set together. In a moment, the toy company would return them to the toy store, as they were only borrowing them temporarily. At this time, Shao Huihua looked closely at the clay figurines of the triplets and suddenly smiled, "Mrs. Xue! We're sending you materials again today." Mrs. Xue said, "What materials?" Shao Huihua smiled, "Since the technician in your company can sculpt the likenesses of triplets, he can naturally sculpt the likenesses of twins. We have a pair of twins here right now." As she spoke, she pointed to the two Miss He's, "If you can make these two sisters into clay figurines, then I will definitely take two back to worship them." Jin Danyu said, "If you're going to sculpt our likenesses, of course, you should sculpt you first. You said that if you can sculpt triplets, you can sculpt twins. I say that if you can sculpt twins, you can sculpt singletons." (277)

### Under the Heavy Pressure of Life, a Family Meeting

— Jin Chuan

The heavy pressure of life squeezed the breath out of us, and everyone's face was full of worry, especially my mother, who murmured all day long about the price of briquettes and rice, which made her worried and frustrated. Last night, my father, mother, sister, and I held a family meeting. My mother strongly advocated moving to the occupied area. Her reason was that rent was not required and the cost of living was lower. But my father spoke with great righteousness and finally persuaded my mother. But what should we do living in Shanghai? My sister spoke up and said, "The soaring prices and the inability to live is a global problem, we are not parasites, we are working, but the compensation we get is not commensurate with the cost of living and we are starving to death, this is not our fault, this is a 'man-made disaster', and the culprits who caused the 'man-made disaster' are of course someone else, which doesn't have to be stated clearly, but the accomplices are these hoarders and manipulators. It is ineffective to deal with the manipulation of the hoarders and hope for a little conscience and the government's restrictions, because conscience is a rational thing, and without reason, there is no conscience; and the government's price limits have also failed in the past. Hoarders have many tricks to play, such as the fixed price of rice, but the invoice may be written as Saigon rice, and so on. Now we just need to encourage the staff and coolies who serve the hoarders to take non-cooperation, and reporting method: he wants to hoard, the coolie does not help to transport and stack; he wants to raise prices, the clerk will not work with him, but because of this he is unemployed, all the residents of Shanghai will pay to rescue them." My father said, "Isn't that too idealistic!"

My sister replied, "It's not idealistic at all. In today's isolated island, there is a lack of a leading figure, and the general level of education is also low. During the First World War, I was in London, where all prices were controlled by the government. If you hoarded goods in your home, someone would immediately go to the police station to report it, and the police would immediately come to check and impose a lot of fines, and they were ashamed of hoarding for the war. But in Shanghai, there is no way to implement it, and we have to regret it!"

Everyone nodded, and the family meeting came to a close.

### Film Emperor Miguel Rona's Top Ten Favorite Stars

— Qinghui

This year's Film Emperor Miguel Rona, at the request of the famous American magazine LOOK, selected his top ten favorite stars, with a few concise reasons, which are now excerpted and translated below:

(1) Clark Gable—He is a genuine heroic figure, with ruthlessness containing emotion, and ruggedness with gentleness. I'm afraid you won't find another person with such a personality in Hollywood.

(2) Judy Garland—When she sings, how pleasant and moving it is. Her bright voice makes me even more excited.

(3) Norma Shearer—Her acting skills are multifaceted. Besides the word "genius," there is no other word to describe her.

(4) Spencer Tracy—His calm and determined style is unmatched.

(5) John Garfield—He is the younger Spencer Tracy.

(6) Henry Fonda—Like me, he is not beautiful, but he has a special power that makes women like him.

(7) Luise Rainer—Her frail body, gentle and docile posture, and melancholy expression have earned me countless tears of sympathy on the screen.

(8) Paul Muni—He plays historical roles realistically. Only she in Hollywood has this ability.

(9) Errol Flynn—His two sword-like eyebrows are a symbol of heroism, and his blue eyes contain perseverance, but what I admire most is his tall physique.

(10) Tyrone Power—I hope to have his sparkling eyes, cute nose, red lips, and snow-white teeth.

### Film Performance and Cigarette Butts

— Xin

In many theaters in England, France, and the United States, smoking is allowed. The owners use the density of smoke to test the performance of the film being shown. If many people are smoking pipes or cigarettes, it means that the audience is not interested in the film. Conversely, if the film is very moving, then there will be fewer smokers.

The length of the cigarette butts thrown on the ground after the show is an even better test. If the film is exciting and moving, there will definitely be many half-smoked butts on the ground. This indicates that the smoking audience just lit up, and their emotions were attracted by the performance on the film, so they threw it away before smoking half of it. If the audience is bored with the film, then there will definitely be countless short cigarette butts thrown away.

### "China Travel" and *The True Story of Ah Q*

— Ming Ruoshui

Ah Q is the creation of a typical character in literature. From him, the weaknesses of old Chinese society are reproduced. I agree with Ms. Xu Guangping's words: "Ah Q not only represents the weaknesses of Chinese national character, but also represents the weaknesses of half of the world's nations, especially in rural or oppressed nations. This type can be found anytime, anywhere."

Ah Q contains many aspects of a complex character; he is ridiculous, but even more lovable; he is despised, but he is even more worthy of sympathy. It should be said that "The True Story of Ah Q" is a tragedy, not a comedy. In those roars of laughter, there is an infinite amount of poignant human touch.

The adaptation of "The True Story of Ah Q" into a stage play is an arduous task. Chen Yu's script is quite successful. It is said that this script was written specifically for "China Travel." "China Travel" put it on the stage for the first time in Wuhan after the Anti-Japanese War, and directed by Hong Shen, it created an unprecedented success record in the theater world. Now, this national drama is bringing it to the audiences in Shanghai.

The performance of "Ah Q" at this time and place has great significance in terms of theater movement and any other aspect. "The remaining forces of feudalism are still very large, we must continue to fight!..." We should remember the revolutionaries' shouts in the fifth act of the play. Light will sweep away all this corrupting labor! It brings us truth. These have great effects on the current sacred cause.

Last night, the author was very honored to visit the performance of this script and considered it a satisfactory appreciation. This time, Li Jingbo's Ah Q does not seem to be as the original depicts. However, according to what Zhou Zuoren saw of Ah Q in the past, he himself was also relatively fat, although he was poor, he was not haggard, his body was quite strong, his face was slightly round, and he had a very imposing appearance. In this way, Mr. Li is just like that character.

### New Film Techniques

— Xing

Guohua's new film "The Romantic Emperor" will begin filming soon. It is said that this film will create a new record in Chinese film photography technology, that is, the female lead Zhou Manhua will play two roles at the same time, and she must appear in the same scene, and she can act lively and unrestrained.

### Zhou Jianyun Talks About the Purpose of "Golden Star"

— Haixing

Zhou Jianyun, for the newly created Golden Star Film Company, invited reporters yesterday to discuss everything. Zhou said first: "What I am going to tell you today can be said to be the correct report of Golden Star Company, and it can also be said to be a total correction of the company's news in the past." Zhou continued to talk about the purpose of preparing for the company, the process, and the ambitions, etc. "The company began preparations in the summer of last year. The shareholders are Nanyang film merchants and honest merchants in this port. Their purpose is not only for profit, because they all have great interest in the film industry. The works filmed may have sugar coating, but they must contain good medicine, and absolutely cannot be mixed with poison. In terms of the photography field, we have adopted a consumer cooperative system with Guohua. Whether it is technicians or actors (except Zhou Xuan), both parties can allocate and apply. Male and female leads have now been sent to Yu, Dian, Gui, and Hong Kong to ask the stars of the past from the old companies. If they are willing to come, they are all welcome to cooperate, and Bai Yang and Gao Qian are also on the list. In Shanghai, all those who have not signed a basic contract with any company are also planned to be gradually invited. The number of films released each year is ten. Both modern and period films are produced. I think the decline of period films is probably not far away. In other words, modern films are about to regain their brilliance." Finally, Zhou smiled and said to the reporters: "The new company's name: once called Lianxing, but the final decision was Jinxing of Venus, not 　xing. The executive director is Lawyer Wu Zhengfeng. I have no investment relationship, and I am only the business director. The date of establishment is June 1."
