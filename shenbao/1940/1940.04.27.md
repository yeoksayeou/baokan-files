### Speculation in Foreign Stocks

Since foreign stocks have become the target of speculation, many stocks have increased in market price by six or seven times, or even ten or twenty times, compared to their face value. For example, the China Land Reclamation shares have a face value of two taels and five qian of silver, but the market price yesterday was thirty-three yuan. As for Jardine Matheson shares, the face value is ten taels of silver, and the highest price on the 22nd was two hundred and seventy-two yuan. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard shares have a face value of ten yuan in national currency, and the market price is fifty-seven yuan and five jiao. The Steel Industry shares have a face value of five yuan in national currency, and the market price is forty-three yuan. The Jardine Matheson Timber shares have a face value of ten taels of silver, and the market price is sixty-two yuan. These are all the most actively traded stocks on the market. Other companies holding the aforementioned stocks, their stocks fluctuate along with the stocks they hold. For example, international trust, Yangzi, Shanghai and other silver companies hold a large number of Jardine Matheson stocks, so Jardine Matheson's stock rises when the former rises, and falls when the former falls. The relationship is like a drum and its beat, with no deviation. This is the extreme of "riding the bear."

Generally, the rise and fall of stocks depend on the increase or decrease of their assets. Looking at the companies of the aforementioned stocks, it is true that their business has generous dividends due to the soaring prices, but this is not only true for foreign companies, Chinese companies and factories certainly have profits, and even more so. Some believe that this is due to the response of legal tender, but in fact, the aforementioned stocks are not in foreign currency, but are stocks valued in silver and national currency, which is the same as other Chinese company stocks. Granted that assets are estimated based on current prices, there is a large increase, but this is based on the concept of currency value, and has nothing to do with the value of the assets themselves. If their future business prospects are guaranteed, and the dividends paid will exceed those of today, hence the rush to buy and the soaring market price, if that is the case, how can it be known that future dividends will necessarily be eight or ten times the normal rate?

It is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole to use a normal perspective to comment on extraordinary speculation. Buying and selling stocks today is not for investment, but for speculation. Speculation aims to profit from the price difference between buying and selling, hoping for a continuous drop when shorting, and hoping for a big rise when going long, so that the profit is greater. It does not matter what the true value of the stock itself is, as long as there is someone buying and selling, just like the stocks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the early years of the Republic of China, which rose before the opening, not because there were profits or losses to speak of. So, buying and selling foreign stocks now still has considerable profits to be made, so it is reasonable to rush to it. However, paying attention to whether there are dividends is still an investment perspective. Even the stocks of companies that are going out of business are searched for in speculation, with one person selling and another buying, the price rises and falls, regardless of whether they will be waste paper in the future. Some say that the foreign stocks being bought and sold today, their companies are still operating as usual and are developing, so how can they be regarded as speculation? But it is not known whether a transaction is speculative should be based on its behavior. For example, Jardine Matheson shares rose from 143 yuan to 272 yuan in a week, a rise of almost double. But the next day, it fell by fifty yuan, a wild rise and a big fall. Could it be that the company's business had a huge change in a week? Everyone knows that this is not the case. Generally, speculation relies on the opportunity to speculate. Speculation must have something to rely on in order to stir up people's hearts and use tricks. The decision to short or go long must be organized and planned behind the scenes in order to achieve success. Thirdly, it is also necessary to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the stocks being speculated on, and use them as tools for manipulation, such as shares with fewer being easily manipulated by multiple parties. Those who are good at speculation often have unpredictable entries and exits, pretending to be bullish while acting bearish, making the virtual real and the real virtual, giving before taking, taking what others abandon, and giving what others take, in countless ways. This is what speculators use to hunt for huge profits. However, there must also be conditions, first with a united team of operators, acting positive or negative, confusing people like falling into a five-mile fog, and only the opposite side of their purpose is targeted. And they must have the financial resources to cope with everything. They must also take the initiative in advance and then create an atmosphere to make people believe it is true. In short, the art of speculation is full of tricks. Even those who make a living from speculation may not always profit, and blindly following speculation is just creating opportunities for real speculators.

At present, the market is full of talk of profits. This is not only true for foreign stocks, but also for the prices of goods that only increase and never decrease, anyone with goods will profit. In general, people only know that there are profits to be made, regardless of the facts, and advance or retreat every day. But what is the basis for these advances and retreats? I am afraid they do not know at all, and just follow what others say. This is what is found in the market for the majority of people, and they do not realize that people are tempting them with great profits, and once they enter their trap, their profits will be taken away by others. And if everyone is making profits, where do the profits come from? There are only two ways: for goods, the huge profits made by hoarders are ultimately extracted from the general consumers. As for stock trading, if everyone is making profits, the final burden of loss will be borne by the one who buys in at a high price last. Understanding this, the world certainly has no one who gets rich by speculation. If there are, they will also lose their wealth through speculation. Ill-gotten gains never prosper. Moreover, prices that only increase and never decrease cannot last for long. When people's desires are filled, the reaction will be unpredictable. Those who buy stocks at high prices originally thought of selling them at even higher prices to make a profit. If the high price created by speculation suddenly stops, they cannot sell them, and they cannot keep them, the situation of being unable to advance or retreat will be extremely embarrassing, all caused by today's greed. Those who follow speculation regardless of everything should seriously reflect on themselves.

### Spokesman for the Chinese Military Discusses Important War Results in Henan, Shanxi, and Jiangxi: Part of the Chinese Army That Entered Kaifeng is Fighting in the Suburbs. The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Launched Fierce Attacks Along Nine Routes but Failed. Important Outlying Strongholds of Nanchang are Firmly in Chinese Hands.

Chongqing: Over the past week, the Chinese and Japanese armies have successively launched large-scale battles in the vicinity of Kaifeng, southern Shanxi, and Nanchang. The Chinese army launched a proactive offensive to thoroughly annihilate the Japanese. Since the beginning of the war, they have conquered land and recovered cities, achieving great successes and demonstrating the most brilliant victory results. The good news has spread, and the whole country is rejoicing, especially the people of the capital. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a military spokesman this morning to inquire about the process and significance of the Chinese soldiers' heroic annihilation of the Japanese in various war zones. The spokesman explained the following:

Kaifeng

On the Henan front, the Chinese army in eastern Henan began to complete a thorough deployment near Kaifeng last week. On the night of the 22nd, taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness, they launched a major offensive on the four suburbs of Kaifeng. After three hours of fighting, the main force of the Chinese army stormed into the walls of Kaifeng. The next morning, three more routes stormed into the city successively. Street fighting broke out that night. The advanced troops of the Chinese army that entered the city captured the Japanese headquarters and continued to mop up the remaining Japanese hiding in the houses of the people. By 6:00 PM, the Japanese army in the city was completely annihilated, with no survivors. Many officers were among them. The material losses of the Japanese in the city were extremely heavy. From the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese sent reinforcements from various directions to Kaifeng, mainly along the Longhai Railway. However, the traffic on this line has been completely destroyed by the Chinese, and so far, the Japanese have been unable to advance along this road. The newly built Jixin Railway by the Japanese has also been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese, and the Japanese cannot use it. However, the Japanese traffic on the north bank of the Yellow River has not been cut off, causing the Japanese to send reinforcements from Xinxiang and other areas on the afternoon of the 23rd, arriving near Kaifeng. Fierce fighting broke out in the northern suburbs of Kaifeng. The Japanese were eager to reoccupy the walls, and actively sent reinforcements from Taikang and Zhuxian Town, so they contacted the Chinese troops in the west and south of Kaifeng. The fighting was fierce. Another unit of the Chinese army captured Huaiyang in one fell swoop while attacking Kaifeng, annihilating all the surrounded Japanese there. The situation near Kaifeng, as of now, has not entered any new phase. It is believed that the Chinese army is determined to create another most shocking victory near Kaifeng. Regarding the Chinese troops in Bian City, it is understood that there is no intention to ensure the defense of Kaifeng, but no report has been received of their withdrawal from Kaifeng. Judging from the situation, a part of the Chinese troops inside the city has been participating in the fighting in the suburbs since yesterday morning.

Southern Shanxi

In the area between the Zhongtiao Mountains and the Taihang Mountains, the Japanese attempted to launch a large-scale offensive. The number of troops and the ambition were more significant than in any previous operation. Since the 11th, the Japanese have attacked southward along five routes: (1) In Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng, the Japanese attacked Pinglu and Maojin, occupying Pinglu on the 18th. The Chinese troops near Pinglu gave the Japanese a heavy blow, driving most of the Japanese in the suburbs into the city. The remaining Japanese are still stubbornly defending. The Chinese army continued to advance northward to cut off their retreat. (2) Maojin Ferry also fell on the 18th. The Chinese army recovered the area that afternoon. The victorious Chinese troops continued to pursue the routed Japanese. Currently, the Chinese army is engaged in a seesaw battle with the Japanese in the area east of the main road between Zhangdian Town and Maojin Ferry. The fighting is fierce. As of yesterday morning, all the Japanese had been defeated and were retreating. A few remaining Japanese were retreating northeast. (3) The Japanese in Yicheng attacked Nakamura and Zhangma Town, attempting to attack in the direction of Yuanqu. Since the 18th, the Chinese and Japanese armies have engaged in fierce fighting in the area around Nakamura and Zhangma Town. The Chinese fortifications in the area are solid, and the terrain is extremely advantageous to the Chinese, so the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. Fighting is still ongoing. (4) The Japanese in Changzi and Changzhi attacked southward, advancing to the vicinity of Xihuo Town and Jianning Town on the 20th, where they engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army. By dawn on the 21st, the Japanese broke out from Dayi Town and were intercepted by the Chinese near Gaoping, and were attacked on the side and rear. By the 23rd, over 10,000 Japanese troops on this route had been completely defeated by the Chinese in the northwest of Gaoping. (5) At noon on the 21st, over 3,000 Japanese attacked Zhengcun, forcibly crossing the Qin River. The Chinese took advantage of the Japanese's halfway crossing, suddenly launching a fierce attack, killing more than half of the Japanese. The remaining Japanese were defeated and retreated and are currently confronting each other across the river. In short, this battle in southern Shanxi is extremely complicated. On the surface, the Japanese attacked southward along five routes, but in reality, there were as many as nine routes. But no matter how fiercely the Japanese attack, it is safe to say that the result will be a very heavy defeat. What's more, the Japanese are already showing an irreversible decline.

Nanchang

After the Chinese army recovered Anyi and Wanshou Palace, the Japanese in Nanchang fell into an irrecoverable state. The Japanese constantly reinforced and counterattacked the Chinese. The victorious Chinese troops continued to surround and attack the Japanese, launching a sustained and fierce battle. The Japanese recently sent reinforcements from Jiujiang, part of which has arrived in Nanchang. Since the 22nd, they have attacked fiercely along two routes: one route fought near Wanjiabu, west of Anyi, and the other fought near Shengmi Street, east of Wanshou Palace. The fighting was fierce, unprecedented. After the Chinese recovered Xiangtang, south of Nanchang, the Chinese soldiers took advantage of the momentum to attack Liantang. The Japanese in Nanchang felt a major threat. At the same time, the Chinese continued to attack Jiujiang and the various troops along the Nanxun Road, launching a fierce attack on Xiushui yesterday, making good progress. As the situation has developed to this point, the war around Nanchang is still continuing to develop under the strong control of the Chinese army. (Telegram, 26th)

### Soviet Newspaper Discusses "Unsubmissive China," Praising the Spirit of Chinese Resistance and Inspiring Patriotic Sentiment

Chongqing: Moscow, 25th - The Moscow Bolshevik newspaper recently published an article entitled "The Unsubmissive Republic of China," stating that China's war of resistance has experienced great hardship, but the Chinese people's noble patriotism has been inspired by this. All 450 million people are under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, defending against the enemy. The Chinese government's outstanding economic measures have made northwest and southwest China new industrial centers. The Chinese industrial cooperative movement has made great contributions. The Chinese government's financial reforms have been especially beneficial to the improvement of the domestic industrial and agricultural economy. The National Government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek enjoys the support of the people of the whole country. The end of those who rely on Japanese bayonets is undoubtedly tragic failure. China's war of resistance has lasted for three years. Japanese imperialism's manpower and resources have been exhausted, while China continues to fight calmly to achieve its sacred purpose. This is truly admirable. (Telegram, 26th)

### Various Countries Continue to Support the Legitimate Government of China

Chongqing: Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, according to information received by the Ministry, most countries in the world have expressed their decision not to recognize the "New Regime." After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to various countries on March 30 clarifying the attitude of the National Government, it also instructed Chinese diplomatic envoys overseas to report the attitude of various countries on this matter. According to the reports received so far, the United States, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, and the Dominican Republic have all firmly announced their decision not to recognize the "New Regime." Editorials in official Soviet publications and statements in the British House of Commons have also indicated that they will continue to recognize Chongqing as the National Government of China. The spokesperson also solemnly stated that, because the note issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not request a response, the failure of some countries to respond or issue any formal documents cannot be regarded as considering recognition of the "New Regime." In fact, several other countries will soon issue similar declarations, reiterating their policy of recognizing the Chongqing government. (Reuters telegram, 26th)

### Residents of Chongqing Withdraw Successively

Chongqing: Since the first air raid this year, over 100,000 residents of Chongqing have withdrawn outside the city during the past four months. This withdrawal has reduced the number of residents in Chongqing to 260,000. The air defense authorities consider this number to be the maximum number of residents that should remain in the city. The air raid on Monday has intensified air defense work even more. Currently, 3,000 stonemasons are working day and night in the mountains, rushing to build air raid shelters. The crowding in the air raid trenches last year did not occur this week. The increase in stone caves has made it unnecessary for residents to go to the air raid trenches again.

### The Japanese Military Acts Autocratically, Controlling Wartime Industrial Profits; This Move Disrupts the Entire Economic System and Has Caused Great Agitation Among Capitalists

Tokyo - The Japanese military recently announced suddenly that it has decided to control profits from today onwards so that wartime industries do not obtain excessive surpluses. This undertaking has caused great shock in political and business circles. It is noted that the Japanese military's goals in adopting this measure are as follows: (1) to supervise profits, (2) to improve factory production methods, (3) to unify manufacturing methods, and (4) to increase production efficiency, thereby reducing production costs. Therefore, before implementing this measure, a detailed investigation of the internal situation of various manufacturers will be conducted. At the same time, the munitions industry will also be reorganized to serve as a model for other industries. The newspapers here are paying close attention to this, but they are unanimously criticizing the price policy adopted by Minister of Commerce and Industry Ginjiro Fujiwara and the economic policy of the Yonai Cabinet. "Miyako Shimbun" stated, "The military's plan is truly a major revolution in the financial world." The military's newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" stated, "The military's decision is a major correction to the industrial concept of free capitalism. If controlling profits can achieve results, then the entire economic system will be completely transformed. However, according to the military's main goal, it is not to implement anti-capitalist control, but to implement new policies to improve production efficiency." (April 25th, Havas dispatch)

### The Dutch Navy Officially Advocates Strengthening the Defense of the East Indies; Conflicts of Interest Among Powers in the Pacific; Soviet Newspaper Believes War May Be Possible

The Hague - Lieutenant Commander Newbolt, Principal of the Higher Naval Academy, recently gave a lecture at the academy on the subject of the Dutch East Indies, advocating the construction of three powerful battlecruisers to strengthen the defense there. He stated, "Our troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies are weak and insufficient to cope with the tasks they are responsible for. Some say that having a strong air force is enough to deter enemy landings, but this is not entirely true. If there are no troops stationed along the coast, or if there are troops but they are small in number, then defense is just empty talk. The Allied forces of Britain and France were able to land in Norwegian coastal ports despite being heavily bombed by German aircraft, which serves as proof. If maritime supremacy is in the hands of the enemy, then even if we order the air force to bomb them when they attempt to land, we will not be able to stop them. Therefore, if the Indian Ocean is under enemy control, then we will not be able to defend the Dutch East Indies, even if we want to. The only way to do this is to build battlecruisers to strengthen our defense. If we have three such warships, then under the current naval balance in the Pacific, it will be impossible for any party to attack the Dutch East Indies." (April 26th, Havas dispatch)

London - The "Daily Telegraph" Washington dispatch recently stated that the Dutch Ambassador to the United States, Mr. [Name], earnestly believes that the rumor that the Netherlands asked Britain to raise the issue of the future of the Dutch East Indies is aimed at pulling the United States into the war from behind. After contacting the Dutch government, the ambassador stated that the statement that Britain is responsible for raising the issue of the future of the Dutch East Indies does not represent the opinion of the Dutch government. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

Moscow - The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper today published an article on the Dutch East Indies issue, titled "The Struggle for the Dutch East Indies." The article stated, "So far, the debate among imperialist powers over the division of the Dutch East Indies is only on a small scale, but this debate has proven that important and serious conflicts will occur among imperialists in the Pacific. In Europe, the possibility of the Netherlands' neutrality being broken has become even more obvious, and thus it has extended to the Pacific. British, American, and Japanese politicians are now making statements on this issue, and their main points are concentrated on the Dutch East Indies, because it is the richest Dutch colony in the Pacific. Japan is Britain's main competitor in the Dutch East Indies. Japan's expansion in the South China Sea has caused unease in London. Recent statements by Japanese newspapers and some Japanese government officials prove that the Dutch East Indies will become Japan's target for expansion. Japanese newspapers have also clearly stated that Japan will not hesitate to use force against Britain and the United States over the Dutch East Indies issue. At the same time, Japan will never allow the Dutch East Indies to become a British or American protectorate. The United States also wants to occupy the Dutch East Indies and does not want to lose the current opportunity. The United States has openly stated that they are willing to control the Dry Tortugas and the Caribbean Islands. They also oppose Japan seizing the Dutch East Indies, because if Japan occupies the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines will be in a dangerous position." (April 25th, TASS dispatch)

### Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty Extended by One Month; British-Japanese Negotiations Not Proceeding; Wartime Commercial Treaty Negotiations

Tokyo - On April 23, the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reported that Britain had suggested to Japan to conclude a new commercial treaty regarding the German economic blockade. The newspaper's London correspondent also stated that "well-informed sources say that the British government's attitude towards Japan has recently changed significantly." When Japanese officials hosted a press conference today, they were asked whether the British government had made this suggestion. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied, "No such negotiations are currently underway between the two countries. Regarding the rumor that the import of Japanese goods into French Morocco is restricted, the Japanese government has not taken any action. The Franco-Japanese commercial treaty has been extended by one month until May 15 to allow France and Japan to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a new commercial treaty, but there have been no talks between the two governments. The various aspects of Franco-Japanese trade, including the Moroccan issue, will be discussed when the talks begin." (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

London - According to news received here today, the Allied forces in the Steinkjer area are now defending positions about four miles north of the city. Observing the situation, it does not appear that the German army is launching any attacks. The general opinion here is that the troops mentioned in last night's War Office communiqué landed in Namsos. The vanguard sent by the British commander appears to have been moving towards Trondheim, attacked by German troops landing from German destroyers, and retreated, but the extent of the losses and troop strength are still unclear. However, it seems that this vanguard would not have carried heavy artillery or anti-aircraft guns. According to news received here, the Østerdalen valley has been closed off, and large numbers of Norwegian troops have destroyed bridges and roads to prevent the German army from advancing and establishing contact with the German army in Trondheim. There is no news from Narvik today, but the extremely bad weather in the past 24 hours may be the reason why there has been no activity on either side. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm - It is heard that the German army is now continuously attacking the positions of the British and Norwegian Allied forces north of Steinkjer. According to a Swedish newspaper reporter, the German vanguard that was rumored to have arrived in Røros yesterday has now suddenly withdrawn about fifteen miles from there. Another report says that the German army has been intercepted by Norwegian troops north of Røros. When the German army advanced rapidly towards the area, it used tanks, armored vehicles, and motorcycles. It is reported that two German tanks have been destroyed. It is reported that Allied forces now occupy the important railway junction of Støren, so the northern exit of Østerdalen has been blocked. The German troops moving south from Trondheim, who were previously reported to have reached Støren, have apparently been called back, mainly to deal with the Allied troops from Namsos. It is heard that the Allied forces' attack in the Narvik area has been temporarily suspended due to bad weather. (April 28th, Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm - According to news received here that has not yet been officially confirmed, the German army's fierce attacks on the Allied forces' positions in Steinkjer have all been repelled. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

The enemy is digging trenches north of Steinkjer, but south of Trondheim, enemy pressure is increasing, and the Allied forces have had to abandon their original positions near Lillehammer." As for rumors that British troops have been cut into several sections by Swedish troops and have collapsed, this is not true. After the German troops gained reinforcements and launched a large-scale counterattack, the vanguard of our troops attacking Trondheim harbor was in danger of being cut off and had to retreat, suffering some losses, but the German troops did not follow. (April 25th, Havas dispatch)

London - The British War Office recently issued a communiqué stating that there has been no further fighting in the area north of Trondheim.

German troops northwest and north of Oslo advanced. In the Trondheim area, German reinforcements arrived. In the Bergen area, German troops are preparing to clear out the Norwegian troops near Voss. German aircraft bombed enemy concentration points and transportation routes and vehicles. Enemy transportation in harbors was also destroyed by bombs. The airfield between Dombås and Åndalsnes was bombed by German aircraft, destroying eleven enemy aircraft. Several British ships not far from the west coast of Norway were also bombed by German aircraft. A torpedo boat was hit and smoke billowed. The boat remained stationary in the water for a long time without moving. An oil tanker was hit. A transport ship was hit and ran aground. Another troop transport ship had its boilers explode after being hit by a bomb. As a result of the British bombing of the airfield near Trondheim, several German aircraft were damaged by bomb fragments. Last night, British aircraft attacked Oslo. The extent of the damage in the city is not yet known in detail. However, there was no loss of military equipment at the airfield. A German reconnaissance plane was forced to land in Belgium. The crew was unharmed. Enemy aircraft entered German bays several times. One was shot down near the Scheldt and crashed into the sea. (April 26th, Haitong dispatch)

London - It has been learned that several squadrons of destroyers belonging to the British Air Force have arrived at the front line in Norway and will assist the existing air force there in stopping German bombing. These destroyers are landing on frozen lakes. Although German aircraft bombed fiercely, Allied aircraft are still able to use these lakes as airfields. (April 26th, Havas dispatch)

### Allied Retreat Not a Defeat

London - A special dispatch from here states that the British newspapers are still using the development of the Norwegian war as their main source of information, saying that the Norwegian military situation was never expected to be easy from the beginning, because the German troops' sudden invasion of Norway had already gained military strongholds, including airfields, before the arrival of the Allied forces. The Allied troops' withdrawal from the positions near Lillehammer should not be considered a defeat, but a halt. According to recent Swedish news, Allied reinforcements have moved from Dombås along the Gudbrandsdalen valley. According to the opinions of various military correspondents, an orderly retreat can inflict great losses on the enemy and force them to constantly deploy their troops in their advance. The newspapers all believe that the German army is using bombers as its main weapon in this campaign, so the Allies should establish air bases in Norway as soon as possible. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

### German Aircraft Bomb Norwegian Villages and Towns

Somewhere in Norway - The Norwegian Telegraph Agency announced that German bombers circled over the mountains and bays of western Norway all day yesterday, bombing villages and towns and strafing civilians with machine guns. However, there were few deaths and injuries, and the damage was also light. When German aircraft attacked Åndalsnes, one was shot down. It is heard that the bombs dropped by German aircraft in the mountains were far from military targets, and their sole purpose was often civilians. Residents of various cities and towns are at a loss as to whether to evacuate or not because German aircraft are constantly harassing them everywhere. The people of Norway are extremely indignant at this form of "protection" from Germany, and their determination to resist the enemy is becoming stronger and stronger. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

### A Column of Norwegian Military Vehicles Bombed

Stockholm - Yesterday's "Svenska Dagbladet" carried a dispatch from its correspondent stating that the Norwegian troops fighting in the Glomma River and Østerdalen valley suffered heavy losses because the German army advanced so rapidly that they could not retreat in time. When news came from the Røros area that German troops had approached Tynset, Norway sent troops to reinforce them, but the train they were traveling on was bombed by German aircraft en route and was completely destroyed except for the locomotive. (April 26th, Haitong Agency dispatch)

### The Withdrawal of Three Battalions of British Troops

London - It has been learned that the British expeditionary force was repulsed by German troops when it attacked Trondheim, Norway, yesterday. The Daily Express recently published an account of its withdrawal, which stated, in brief, that according to reliable sources, when British troops landed at Namsos some days ago, the Germans were quite alarmed by their sudden arrival. The Allied Command took advantage of this weakness of the enemy and, without waiting for full preparation, sent three battalions of British troops on a forced march, attempting to take Trondheim in one fell swoop. At that time, they did not send a small reconnaissance team to probe the enemy's true situation first. These three battalions of British troops attacked without encountering any resistance and marched straight ahead until they reached the city of Steinkjer, where they met the German troops who had quickly marched north from Trondheim. The German troops had already built fortifications there, so after arriving at their destination, they relied on these fortifications to resist stubbornly. The British troops lacked reinforcements and were attacked from the flanks by German special forces landing from Trondheim Bay, in addition to which the Germans used aircraft to bomb them heavily, and their warships anchored in the bay also opened fire. The three battalions of British troops were only carrying rifles and machine guns, so it was difficult for them to resist. Therefore, they reorganized and withdrew several miles to wait for the main force to arrive before attacking again. The above is the truth about the British troops' brief retreat yesterday. (April 26th, Havas dispatch)

### The German Air Force Has Superiority

Stockholm - Well-informed sources here recently stated that the news of yesterday's battles, especially the news issued by German propaganda organs, is very worrying, but judging from the battle reports received from various sources today, the situation has become more optimistic. The Allied forces and the German army are now fighting fiercely for Trondheim, because the port is one of the strategic strongholds of Norway, so they are sparing no effort to fight for it. At this moment, the German side only has superiority in the air force, but according to the latest news, the Allied forces are preparing to fully mobilize the air force to fight the Germans. An aircraft carrier has already sailed to a port in Norway, and an air force base is being built somewhere, but the authorities are still keeping the location a secret. Today, the Hegra Fortress in central Norway was attacked by German aircraft again and again, while on the Allied side, the German air force base at Værnes (which is the German aircraft base in northern Norway) was bombed continuously. Recently, a large number of aircraft and military supplies have been transported to Norway. Judging from the fact that the German air force's repeated bombings of Namsos have not succeeded, it can be seen that the Allied forces are not only prepared in the air force, but their anti-aircraft gun teams are also extremely effective. A British cruiser has also repeatedly shelled important German strongholds and has been quite successful. The close cooperation of the British and French fleets with the land and air forces is enough to make the German efforts come to naught. As for the German use of aircraft to transport troops and military supplies, there is no need to overemphasize it, because Allied aircraft may not be unable to have a decisive force in future battles. According to reliable sources, British troops have advanced towards Røros, and fighting is also taking place in the Støren area. The number of French troops landing in Norwegian ports is equivalent to that of the British expeditionary force. (April 26th, Havas dispatch)

### Norwegian Troops Transferred to New Positions

Somewhere in Norway - The Norwegian General Headquarters announced today that on April 24, the German army, with the aid of artillery and light tanks, attacked our positions in the southern part of the Gudbrandsdalen. Our troops have transferred to newly arranged positions. The German troops in the Østerdalen area are still advancing. German aircraft continue to bomb transportation lines. One of them was shot down, and another was forced to land. British destroyers are now patrolling the Gudbrandsdalen area. When the German army attempted to land, it violated international law by using Norwegian fishing boats and their civilian crews as cover. One fisherman was injured and killed. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)

### Fire in Oil Pools in Oslo Fjord

London - The British Air Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating, "A large number of our aircraft repeatedly attacked German bases in Denmark and Norway yesterday. Oil pools in the port of Vallø along the Oslo Fjord were hit by bombs dropped by our aircraft and caught fire as a result. A German giant transport ship in the fjord was also hit by a bomb and damaged. In addition, our aircraft also attacked the seaplane base in Stavanger and a large number of enemy ships anchored off the northwest coast of the port. Our patrol squadrons shot down an enemy bomber in the North Sea and severely damaged an enemy seaplane. In total, five of our aircraft went missing yesterday, but six enemy aircraft were shot down, and at least eight were damaged." (April 26th, Havas dispatch)

### American and Italian Newspapers Comment on the War Situation

New York: The current situation of the war in Norway was commented on by the Democratic Party's New York Times, which stated that the British government's communiqué had already admitted that the expeditionary force had to withdraw from Lillehammer due to being outnumbered. "Although this setback is significant in nature, it is not the key to the victory or defeat of the war in Norway." For Britain and France, the crux of the current problem lies in how to use the air force. "If an air base cannot be found in Norway, aircraft carriers must be deployed to park on the Norwegian sea. Without the help of the air force, even if Britain and France have control at sea, and even if their troops are extremely brave and determined to drive the Germans out of the Scandinavian Peninsula, they will still be difficult to succeed." (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

Milan: This evening's local newspaper commented on the situation of the war in Norway, saying that when the Anglo-French Allied forces first launched a large-scale operation in the area of ​​Steinkjer and along the Lillehammer railway, they were eager to make the war favorable to Britain and France, but the result was not as expected. This was a major blow to Britain and France. The Italian People's Daily stated that the superiority of the German air force has been proven by facts. The actions of the British and French navies are always detected by German aircraft, and the German army can easily cope with them. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

New York: "New York Post" reporter Stowe published an article in the newspaper, commenting on the military operations of the British Expeditionary Force north of Trondheim, believing that this move was the biggest mistake in modern British history. According to Stowe, about 1,500 British Expeditionary Force troops advanced from Namsos. They were poorly equipped and untrained. In the snowy and muddy climate of Norway in April, it was difficult to win against the powerful German army, and it was undoubtedly a major military blunder. After four days of combat, most of the troops had been lost. According to a report from a British officer, 200 soldiers in the battalion under his command had been killed, and one company had been captured. (Haitong News Agency on the 26th)

### German Official Stationed in Norway Arrives in Oslo

London: It has been officially announced that the British fleet engaged in a naval battle with the German fleet in the waters near Narvik, Norway, today. Ten of our destroyers, led by the battleship "Warspite" (31,000 tons displacement), participated in the battle. One enemy destroyer was surrounded by four of our ships. Although it resisted stubbornly, it was hit and caught fire in the bow, stern, and middle due to our fierce artillery fire. Only one gun continued to fire, and it was eventually destroyed by our main battleship. In addition, another enemy destroyer was hit in the hull and tilted, and it has also gradually sunk. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### British Admiralty Releases Details of Naval Battle, Seven German Ships Destroyed, Three British Ships Also Damaged

London: The British Admiralty released a communiqué last night, detailing the second naval battle between British and German forces in Narvik on the 13th of this month. It stated that at noon on April 13th, it was cloudy with fog and drizzling rain. A team of British ships sailed past the end of West Bay to Ottenfjord and Narvik. The fleet included the destroyers "Icarus," "Hero," "Foxhound," "Kimberley," "Forrester," the Tribal-class destroyers "Bedouin," "Punjabi," "Eskimo," "Cossack," and the battleship "Warspite," commanded by Vice Admiral Whitworth. The battleship's voyage through the narrow waters to Narvik was a heroic feat of great danger, as it was known that German destroyers were lying in ambush in the bay. Although aerial reconnaissance by British aircraft and escort by destroyers had reduced the danger, no one knew what kind of traps the Germans had set. At 12:26, a German destroyer appeared through the fog. Four British destroyers opened fire on it, and the enemy ship turned away. At 12:45, another German destroyer appeared, followed by others. The first German destroyer resisted stubbornly, but was subjected to fierce artillery fire from the "Icarus" and three Tribal-class destroyers. Eight minutes later, the German ship caught fire in the middle and rear, but continued to fire back until its guns were destroyed by the "Warspite." At that time, enemy destroyers continued to appear, totaling six, zigzagging in front of the British ships, and fierce fighting broke out. Each ship fired rapidly and changed course frequently to avoid enemy fire. At this time, German ships fired and landed close to the British ships, but the British ships' tactics were skillful and none were hit. A German Heinkel bomber arrived, but flew out of the range of the artillery fire. Then the two sides fought and moved, and the enemy ships always retreated, gradually showing signs of injury. The half-hour after 2:00 pm was the decisive period of the battle. According to a report from the bridge of a British destroyer, at 1:30, an enemy ship was hit and severely damaged. At 2:03, the ship caught fire and was also hit by a torpedo. Another place caught fire. At 2:14, another enemy ship caught fire. At 2:24, the second enemy ship that caught fire exploded for the second time, followed by another German destroyer exploding for the second time. The battle seemed to be over at this point, but four German destroyers fled upstream to Rombaksfjord, releasing smoke to block the British ships. At 2:30, one of the enemy ships had become a burning wreck. Another enemy ship was floating north of Narvik, and its crew had abandoned ship and swam ashore. The third enemy ship ran aground, and the remaining ships took refuge in Rombaksfjord. While the destroyers were fighting, the "Warspite" shelled the shore batteries at a range of less than half a mile, and the "Cossack" also assisted in the shelling, destroying a German howitzer. The "Punjabi" and "Bedouin" followed the "Cossack" and opened fire. At this time, other destroyers sailed up Rombaksfjord in pursuit of the enemy ships. The bay is ten miles long and has a narrow neck 100 yards wide. When the "Eskimo" sailed through the narrow neck, it was attacked by a wounded and grounded German destroyer. The "Eskimo" immediately returned fire, destroying the German ship, but it was slightly damaged itself. When other British destroyers sailed through the narrow neck, they saw that the enemy ship was burning from stem to stern. Therefore, the "Hero" took the lead and accompanied the central ship forward, passing another bend to explore the situation. They saw three German destroyers moored in an ice-bound bay. One of them seemed intact and undamaged, but there was no movement on the ship. The second ship only had its bow exposed above the water, and the third ship was burning. The "Hero" and "Kimberley" fired a few shots, but stopped quickly because the enemy ships did not return fire. At this time, the British ships sent armed sailors in small boats to investigate. They saw that the first enemy ship, which seemed intact and undamaged, was slowly sinking, having been scuttled. The British soldiers then boarded the last German ship, which was burning. This ship was named "Ruedesheim." The British soldiers tore down the German flag and replaced it with a white flag. They found only one wounded officer on the ship, who had been placed on a stretcher, ready to leave the ship. But the "Hero" arrived and the German crew fled without taking him with them. The British soldiers then transferred the wounded German officer to the "Hero." The fire on the German ship was so intense that it could not be saved. The "Hero" then fired a torpedo and sank this seventh German ship. All seven German destroyers were destroyed at this point, and the shore batteries were silenced. Three British ships were damaged and immediately withdrew, leaving the "Ivanhoe" and "Kimberley" to occupy the bay. The "Ivanhoe" sent armed soldiers ashore to take care of a hospital and a school, as British wounded soldiers were being treated there. At night, 120 German soldiers entered the town and surrendered to 24 British soldiers. When the landing British soldiers returned to their ships, at the request of the Norwegian authorities, they supplied the mostly fishermen Norwegians with Lee-Enfield rifles and ammunition to prevent the German prisoners from escaping.

### German Report on the Air Raid on Sylt Island

Berlin: German war correspondent Stadtde described the situation of the air raid on Sylt Island from the night of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th. He said that when the first British plane approached Sylt Island, the ground searchlights searched the air, and the anti-aircraft artillery prepared to fire. A few minutes later, the British plane was surrounded by searchlight beams. Although the British plane collided from side to side, it could not fly out of the range of the searchlights, giving the anti-aircraft artillery a clear target. The anti-aircraft shells exploded around the enemy plane, and the sparks flew, creating a spectacular sight. The enemy plane knew it was in a dangerous situation and wanted to reduce the weight of the bombs it was carrying in an attempt to escape, so it dropped the bombs on the ground aimlessly, but still did not succeed. One plane's engine was hit and destroyed at sea, another fell straight from the air into the sea, and the third caught fire and exploded in the air. Other planes dared not fly close to Sylt Island, dropped their bombs into the sea, and then fled. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)

Berlin: German officials yesterday met with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency and stated that the German Supreme Command has reached an intolerable limit because the enemy's bombing has reached undefended towns, such as the bombing of the Hörnum station on the coast of Holstein by British planes on April 12, and the bombing of the residential area of Oslo on the night of April 22. The German Air Force is still adhering to the order not to bomb non-military targets. If Britain carries out indiscriminate bombing, the German Air Force will eventually take retaliatory measures.

### Belgian Cabinet Withdraws Resignation, Political Crisis Quickly Subsides

Brussels: The cabinet led by Prime Minister Pierlot, following the wishes of the King of Belgium, has decided to continue in office. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

Brussels: The Belgian House of Representatives passed the education budget with 120 votes to 45, with 15 abstentions. The Minister of Education proposed adding staff because some important officials in the ministry only spoke one of Belgium's national languages. The Liberal Party did not agree with this policy. Prime Minister Pierlot considered this a matter of confidence. During the vote, all members of the Liberal Party, except for two, voted against it. The Liberal Party occupies three seats in the 14-seat cabinet and 33 seats in the 202-seat House of Representatives. The cabinet led by Pierlot therefore resigned last night.

### President Roosevelt Announces Recognition of Norway as a Belligerent, Neutrality Act Provisions Implemented, US Establishes Diplomatic Relations with Iceland

Warm Springs, Georgia: President Roosevelt announced here yesterday the existence of a state of war between Norway and Germany and declared the application of the US Neutrality Act. This Neutrality Act prohibits any submarines of belligerent nations from entering US ports and territorial waters, and implements the "cash and carry" provision of the Neutrality Act for Norway, as well as other laws applicable to belligerent nations, including provisions regarding the issuance of securities in the United States. However, the President did not mention Denmark. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

Washington: Under the provisions of the Neutrality Act, President Roosevelt reluctantly announced today that Norway and Germany are in a state of war. Therefore, the cash-and-carry provisions and other restrictions that had previously been applied to the Allied Powers and Germany must also be implemented for Norway. Roosevelt signed this proclamation on a mild spring day. As Roosevelt's pen moved, Norway's hope of resisting German aggression by borrowing US credit became a fantasy. Official sources said that before the German attack on Norway, the Export-Import Bank had allocated $10 million in loans to Norway, which must now be cancelled unless Congress takes any remedial measures. The Norwegian government, which was once considered a reliable borrower in the world, must now adhere to the cash-and-carry principle in order to obtain goods from the United States. In fact, since Roosevelt designated the entire Scandinavian region as a war zone, the shipment of Norwegian goods by American ships has been prohibited. Moreover, banks are considered to be acting illegally on behalf of Norway, and all American groups raising funds to help Norway must submit their monthly accounts to Secretary of State Hull for review. As for Hull himself, he immediately issued various regulations after President Roosevelt signed the above proclamation, the same as those previously issued to deal with Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, prohibiting the Norwegian army from recruiting new soldiers in the United States, not allowing Norwegian ships to assemble components in American ports, and not allowing Americans to travel on Norwegian ships. It is reported that Norwegian Ambassador to the United States Morgenstierne requested the US government to postpone the recognition of Norway as a belligerent, and it was also heard that the Ambassador had advised the Norwegian government to postpone the formal declaration of war with Germany. Therefore, the above proclamation could not help but sadden Morgenstierne. According to official sources here, the US government also hoped not to recognize Norway as a belligerent, just as it had ignored the Soviet-Finnish and Sino-Japanese wars. However, the powers now competing in Norway are all belligerent nations that the United States has already recognized and declared, so the situation is different from before. The US government cannot but recognize Norway as a belligerent. (International News Service dispatch on the 26th)

Washington: The US State Department exchanged telegrams with Icelandic Foreign Minister Stefánsson yesterday, recognizing the mutual appointment of diplomatic representatives. It is reported that the Icelandic Consul General to the United States is Vilhjálmur Finsen, and the American Consul to Iceland is Konni Z. Heim. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

### Åland Islands Strongly Defended, Within Soviet Sphere of Influence, Germany Not Allowed to Occupy Them

London: Soviet sources here stated that the Soviet government firmly opposes the German occupation of the Åland Islands (belonging to Finland). Their motivation is not sympathy for the Allied Powers, but because they do not want Germany to easily obtain Swedish iron ore. The Åland Islands are in the Baltic Sea, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, located between Finland and Sweden, that is, in the "Soviet sphere of influence in the Baltic Sea" as defined by the Soviet Union. If Germany occupies them, it will not only gain economic benefits, but also gain an important strategic stronghold, especially in the summer when the Gulf of Bothnia thaws. The Soviet Union is certainly not willing to accept this. However, Finland has built strong fortifications on the Åland Islands and laid mines along the coast. Germany will encounter difficulties if it attacks, and Finland's resistance will inevitably become stronger due to the Soviet Union's attitude. However, if Germany believes that it must occupy the Åland Islands in order to consolidate its position in the Scandinavian Peninsula, it is feared that it will still act recklessly regardless of the consequences. This is a matter of great concern.

New Concepts in Family Life: Dr. Hermann's original German work, translated into Chinese after more than 30 years of experience and proof from two generations of parents, offers the most convenient birth control method. We rack our brains to serve the public. We open a line of life for sick women who should not have children. If a family's reproduction is too large and rapid, it is not a blessing for parents, but a burden. First of all, they should examine their own economic situation to avoid suffering for themselves and their babies, so that every child can be fully cared for by the mother and the father can have enough time to plan for it. How superior are the opportunities for these children to grow up happy and healthy and become useful members of society?

### To Cope with the Far Eastern Situation, the US Should Cooperate with the British and French Navies, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee Makes a Proposal, Shipbuilding Plan is Being Intensified

Washington: Massachusetts Democratic Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, made a broadcast last night, advocating that the United States should increase its navy to be equal to that of other countries. However, Walsh also stated that he strongly opposes the United States participating in the European War and also opposes getting involved in war over the Far East issue. He does not believe that the United States will intervene in and resolve the Dutch East Indies issue. Walsh also stated that US naval experts believe that the only way for the United States to achieve victory in the Far East is to cooperate with the British and French navies, but any military alliance is contrary to American traditionalism. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

Washington: The US Navy Department yesterday called for bids to manufacture submarine defense nets to meet the needs of Pearl Harbor, the Panama Canal, the Golden Gate, and Guantanamo. This defense net will be manufactured at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California, with a total cost of approximately $22 million.

### U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Postpones Trip to Japan, Philippine Islands Restrict Immigration, Eastern Newspaper Vehemently Opposes

Tokyo: The arrival of U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, in Tokyo has been postponed to the 29th of this month. Initially, it was expected that Sayre would arrive today, so U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, had prepared a banquet to welcome Sayre tonight. When Japanese officials met with journalists this morning, they were asked if Sayre would meet with Japanese officials. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied that there was no definite plan for a meeting, but it was expected that Sayre would meet with Foreign Minister Arita. He was asked whether Sayre and Arita would discuss the Philippine Islands immigration bill, as its passage into law would reduce the number of Japanese immigrants to the Philippine Islands to 500 per year. The spokesperson said he had no knowledge of this. The U.S. Ambassador had suggested introducing Sayre to the Emperor, but due to the postponement of Sayre's arrival, no definite arrangements had been made. Sayre will stay in Tokyo for about ten days and return home by ship from Kobe on May 8th. It is reported that Grew will leave for home for vacation after meeting with Sayre. According to reports, when Sayre arrived in Shanghai on the flagship USS Augusta of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on the 22nd of this month, he told reporters that he intended to meet with the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo to maintain close contact with international developments. He said that this trip would promote closer cooperation among U.S. diplomats overseas. (Reuters, 26th)

Tokyo: According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," the Philippine immigration restriction bill is another manifestation of the U.S. anti-Japanese policy. The U.S. State Department and the Labor Department have followed the recommendations of former U.S. Commissioner to the Philippine Islands, McCutcheon, and sent representatives to participate in the drafting of the bill. Therefore, there is a mastermind behind the bill. It ostensibly claims to restrict the entry of Jewish and Spanish refugees to reduce unemployment among Filipinos, but in reality, it is aimed at Japan. The newspaper then listed the achievements of the Japanese in developing the Philippine Islands, saying that the Philippine authorities are now repaying kindness with enmity by reducing the number of Japanese immigrants to 500 per year, the same quota as the United Kingdom and France, which have never sent immigrants to the Philippines, which is a distinctly unfriendly act.

### Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan to Build Mongolia, Establish More Than 300 New Cities in the Far East and Central Asia

TASS Special Dispatch: During the Five-Year Plans (1928 to 1937), the total residential area newly built in Soviet cities and workers' districts reached 50,200,000 square meters. The construction costs were borne by various economic organizations and local Soviets. 354 new cities have been established beyond the Arctic Circle, in the Far East, Siberia, and Central Asia. In the Ural region alone, 37 new cities have been established in recent years. The small wooden houses of the past have now been replaced by tall buildings, and backward towns have been transformed into modern cities. The development of Stalingrad, in particular, has been rapid. During the Five-Year Plans, the city's residential area has tripled. In addition, the construction of residential buildings in various republics and workers' districts has also developed rapidly. The area of new housing built in Ukraine is 10 million square meters, and the residential area in Belarus has also increased by 50%. Housing construction in Moscow is particularly active, with simultaneous development inside and outside the city. Currently, the construction outside the city is no less than that inside the city.

In Tsarist Russia, the rent paid by laborers accounted for 20% of their wages. Currently, the rent they pay only accounts for 4% of their wages.

### Traveling Freely in China, Dr. Monroe Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Says China Will Surely Win, Deeply Impressed by Traveling Around, Will Urge the U.S. to Continue to Lend Large Sums

Dr. Monroe of the United States arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm on the President Pierce. Dr. Monroe traveled to "Free China" in the middle of last month. He said that he had a very good impression and guaranteed that China would defeat Japan in this war of resistance and achieve the goal of "winning the war of resistance and building the country." Dr. Monroe is an old man with gray hair, but he is energetic and his words fully express his optimism about China's future. The following is a record of his speech:

Very Impressed by Traveling Around

Dr. Monroe said that he had previously visited the United States and done his best in Washington to urge the U.S. government to continue to provide credit loans to China. After traveling around "Free China" this time, he was very impressed and believed that China would definitely defeat Japan and achieve the ultimate goal of the war of resistance. As for Chairman Chiang and the senior officials of the Chinese government, they firmly believe that this war of resistance will use a strategy of attrition to cause Japan to suffer a disastrous defeat in a long-term war. At present, the Chinese government and the people have a unified belief that the war of resistance will be won. All farmers, workers, and soldiers have ten times more trust in the Chinese government than in the past, and they are united and act as a backing for the government because of the arousal of patriotism.

Self-Sufficient and Not Lacking

Dr. Monroe continued, "When I traveled in 'Free China,' I obtained ironclad proof that China can be self-sufficient. Factories have been set up everywhere, and the quantity of products has increased greatly. It is especially worth noting that China is now able to manufacture its own military supplies, which proves that the Chinese people are able to do their best to resist Japanese aggression." A certain Mr. met an old man who pointed to his five-year-old child and said, "Ten years later, he can serve the country." Mr. also met a Chinese peasant woman who said, "China has now completely woken up." All of these are enough to prove that China's future is infinitely bright.

Construction and War of Resistance at the Same Time

Dr. Monroe believes that the most impressive thing is that there are so many intellectual youths and students in the interior who are serving the country. He said, "Looking back on the past, people all believed that most of the Chinese students who returned to China were useless because the technical knowledge they learned was not suitable for Chinese society. Now it is different. Returned students and technical talents are urgently needed by the government. Since the outbreak of the war, China has been building and resisting at the same time, and the importance of technical talents has been recognized by society." Another factor that China can defeat Japan is its vast human resources. He said, "In Sichuan, there are crowds of people everywhere, which is very harmonious. When I passed through Japan, there was no such situation."

Attrition Warfare Consumes the Japanese Army

Dr. Monroe also said, "Although I did not personally see the scene of the battlefield during this trip, the Japanese strategy is almost entirely based on old methods, that is, to make a linear advance in the territory of 'Free China.' The areas occupied by the Japanese army are often constantly bombed by the Chinese air force and suffer heavy blows. The Chinese army hopes that the Japanese army will not abandon the land it has occupied and engage in attrition warfare, because only in this way can the enemy be consumed."

All Countries Should Intensify Aid to China

Finally, Dr. said, "I believe that Western countries should quickly intensify aid to China and lend large sums of money to China. This action is by no means an unfriendly act to Japan. The unfriendly act to Japan is the embargo on Japan." Dr. Monroe said that when he returns to the United States this time, he will do his best to urge the Americans to aid China and lend China large sums of money so that China can continue to resist the war and win the final victory.

### French Ambassador Comes to Shanghai, Arrives Here at 10:00 AM Tomorrow, Purely to Handle Private Affairs

The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, left Shanghai on the Zhi Ba De of the Java Mail Line on November 10th of last year to pay respects to the central authorities and handle official affairs, taking the route of Hanoi and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Chongqing. He stayed in Chongqing for a very long time. Now that the official affairs are relatively relaxed, he flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong by plane last week. As for private affairs in Shanghai, they are still awaiting contact. The ambassador has taken the "Peleks Leshaner" of the French Mail Line to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the French Mail Line last night that the ship is scheduled to arrive here at 10:00 am tomorrow and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.

### British Government Controls British Merchant Ships in China, Subject to Adjustment at Any Time, Still Maintain Original Routes, Jardine Matheson Has Received Accurate News

China's shipping industry has been completely suspended since the invasion two years ago. The largest shipping agency is the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company has already moved its office to Chongqing, and the Jiangchuan Line on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, namely the Yichang-Chongqing Line, is still operating as usual. As for the recent rumors that the company is planning to develop shipping routes in Southeast Asia, it may be too early to say. The Yangtze River and coastal ports have been monopolized by Japanese ships. Therefore, foreign ships on the Yangtze River Line have also suspended sailing along with Chinese ships for nearly three years. Although the coastal routes are often obstructed by unexpected events, the business is still prosperous. Since China's war of resistance, foreign ships have made a lot of profit. However, after the outbreak of the European War, all German ships sailing in the Far East have been suspended. Recently, as Denmark and Norway have been drawn into the vortex, Danish and Norwegian ships have also been suspended. Norwegian ships have now resumed sailing, but there is no news of Danish ships.

Requisition News

According to yesterday's report, the British company Jardine Matheson has received news that the British authorities may requisition all of its sea ships, except for those on the Yangtze River, through its China Navigation Company. It is learned that the company owns 18 sea ships, and it newly purchased 4 sea ships in Hong Kong last year, bringing the total to 22 sea ships. There are 13 small ships on the Yangtze River and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After seeing the Hong Kong telegram, the company was inquired about it. According to the company in Shanghai, it has indeed received the above news. However, the Westerners strictly keep the telegram secret. It is also said that if they are requisitioned in the future, it is estimated that not all of them will be requisitioned, and some will definitely be left to maintain the shipping routes. Recently, foreign shipping businesses have also been affected by the European War and are in a precarious situation. It can be said to be a troubled time.

Newly Revised Regulations

It was also reported yesterday that the British naval authorities had learned that the British government has formulated new regulations to continue to requisition British merchant ships sailing to various ports along the Chinese coast, which will be implemented from the first day of next month. Under these regulations, the companies most affected will be Jardine Matheson and Taikoo. Other British merchant shipping companies will also be affected to a considerable extent. According to sources in the shipping industry, the situation after the implementation of the new regulations will not be as serious as generally expected, as British merchant ships will not be completely suspended. It is said that all ships will not be completely transferred to Europe and will not be transferred out of the Far East. The new regulations will include two points: one is that British ships will be completely requisitioned by the government and transferred to Europe or other areas to serve; the other is that they will be controlled by the British government, and the ships will continue to sail on their original routes.

No Drastic Changes

The possibility of stipulating the latter method is even greater, that is, all ships will be controlled by the government, but the shipping companies will still retain a share of the management power. Therefore, it is expected that from the first day of next month, there will be no drastic changes in British Far East shipping. According to reports, the passenger and cargo transportation of British ships will continue, but the sailing schedule of the ships will depend on the changes in the political and military situation in the Far East and Europe. At present, the British merchant ships that will be affected are estimated to be about 60. All ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo will be completely restricted.

Norwegian Shipping Routes

After the Norwegian merchant ships sailing in the Far East were allowed to resume sailing, the ships that had been ordered to sail to Hong Kong were all preparing to come to Shanghai and resume sailing. However, it is learned that the Norwegian ships sailing in the Far East will not all sail according to the old routes in the future. The shipping route will mainly be the Hong Kong-Shanghai line, and the rest will be Saigon and various ports in South China, North China, and Central China. It is also learned that the Norwegian ship Rani has now returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and will sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin line soon. There is also a ship named New Anmao Mimer, and the telegram has reported that it left Hong Kong yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month.

Ship Officers Demand

Foreign ship officers of British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have demanded a raise in salary and a guarantee that each ship will hire a third officer. The company is currently considering these demands and has not yet responded. It has been found that although some ships sailing along the coast have hired Chinese third officers, the rest only hire a chief officer and a second officer. Therefore, they are resentful and claim that the time spent on watch is too long, and a few ship officers have to watch for as long as twelve hours, which is contrary to the work regulations. The Chinese Ship Officers Union of various ports and the Chinese Engineers Union held a joint meeting in Hong Kong last week to discuss this issue, but no action was taken. At present, no action will be taken until the company has responded to the demands. It is said that all ship officers believe that a living allowance is necessary, so they ask the company to increase their salaries appropriately. Ship officers who have to support their families are particularly eager for a raise.

### Active Chinese Army on the Shanghai-Nanking Railway, Tracks Disrupted, Train Delayed Four Hours the Day Before Yesterday

In the middle section of the Shanghai-Nanking Railway, between Wuxi and Zhenjiang, the Chinese army is very active and often attacks the Japanese army. The tracks in Zhenjiang and Danyang are also often destroyed by the Chinese army. Therefore, the Shanghai-Nanking morning train the day before yesterday (the 25th), which was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 7:00 am to Nanking, was delayed because the tracks were disrupted and not repaired. It did not depart from Shanghai until 11:00 am.

### British Soldier Who Committed a Crime Sent to Hong Kong for Imprisonment

On April 1, the sentence was approved by the British Ambassador. It is now learned that the soldier Ifok will be taken from the prison (Ward Road Prison) and sent to Hong Kong to perform hard labor. After the British authorities in Hong Kong interrogate him, he may still be imprisoned in Hong Kong. It is reported that Ifok still has two or three months of detention in Shanghai.

### U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Takes Ship to Japan Tonight, Discusses Far East Issues with Ambassador Grew, Hosted Banquet Last Night for U.S. Officials in Shanghai

It is generally believed that Ambassador Grew will report what he has learned from his meeting with Sayre after returning to the United States.

Hosted a Banquet Last Night

U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, and his wife took the opportunity of passing through Shanghai on their way to Japan to host a banquet at the Cathay Hotel, where they were staying, at 8:00 pm yesterday to entertain senior U.S. diplomatic and military personnel in Shanghai.

### Public Works Bureau Reduction Plan to be Studied by the Economic Committee; Committee Members to be Fully Announced Next Week; the Bureau Recently Dismissed a Batch of Western Employees

Following the resolution of the Western taxpayers' annual meeting on the 17th of this month to expand the organization of the Public Works Bureau's Economic Committee, to internationalize it, and to increase the number of committee members from four to twelve, in addition to the original four from China, Britain, America, and Japan, one more member each will be added from these four countries, and one member each will be added from France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The committee's task is to study government reductions. The list of committee members is expected to be fully released next week. Details are as follows:

Responsible for Studying Reduction Plans

According to a certain Chinese director, the establishment of the Public Works Bureau's Economic Committee is responsible for studying methods of government reductions for the Public Works Bureau, to ensure that government reductions do not affect its administrative efficiency in the future. In detail, it will study (1) how to make municipal management more rational, (2) how the Public Works Bureau can implement government reductions without hindering its administrative efficiency, (3) employing Westerners and Chinese residing in Shanghai to replace Westerners from Europe, and (4) reviewing relevant documents and conducting detailed reviews and discussions on the overall situation, and then produce a report for the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors to refer to. After implementation, the committee's task will be completed.

Economic Committee Previously Established

Five or six years ago, the Public Works Bureau established a similar temporary committee. At that time, the chairman was former Chairman Fessenden. The result of the study on government reductions at that time was to reduce expenditures by more than one million yuan. However, after August 13th, the currency value fell, and Western employees were paid huge foreign exchange subsidies. Last year, grain prices soared, and Chinese employees were paid rice subsidies. The one million yuan previously reduced was offset by this, and it was not even enough. Therefore, the Bureau decided to increase donations in the next year and accepted suggestions from all parties to establish an Economic Committee and expand its organization to further study reasonable government reduction methods.

Current Organization is Temporary

As for the statement that this organization is an expansion of the Finance Committee, this is a misunderstanding. The Public Works Bureau Board of Directors has several standing subcommittees. When the Board of Directors encounters cases that need to be reviewed, it assigns them to a specific subcommittee based on their nature. The Finance Committee is one such standing subcommittee. In addition, temporary subcommittees may be established when necessary for temporary events until their task is completed and they are dissolved. The Rickshaw Pullers Committee is one example. The nature of the Economic Committee is different from that of standing committees.

Committee Members to be Announced Next Week

The list of committee members from each country, except for the two Chinese members, who have already been recommended by the Chinese Ratepayers Association to be Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, is currently being selected by the expatriates of each country. According to sources close to the Concession authorities, the full list of committee members is expected to be released next week, and it is believed that British Director Powell and Japanese Director Kazuo Okamoto will both be included in the selection.

Bureau Dismissed Several More Western Employees

The Public Works Bureau's public announcement yesterday included the list of dismissed employees. According to investigations, in addition to the previously known dismissed personnel, there is one more person on the list. That person is Pando, a highway engineer who has served in the Public Works Bureau for twenty-seven years. He has now received a retirement notice and must leave within two months. It is also learned that the staff of various departments of the Public Works Bureau are currently not very clear about the issue of layoffs, as the terms "layoff" and "retirement" have been confused. They are extremely worried about whether they will suffer the same fate in the near future. The vacancies of the dismissed employees were previously rumored to be filled by Jewish refugees, but the Public Works Bureau officially denied this. However, yesterday, reliable sources revealed that after the dismissal of automobile engineer Walter Fels, four Jewish refugees have filled his position. It is also reported that the Public Works Department has a total of nine people who were dismissed. Another is the Director of the Intelligence Department, Foulonshan. They all received retirement notices around March 29th and left their positions within twenty-four hours. As for their names, in addition to Pando, there are also Bairington, Fang Boluo, Hopkin, Nai Tuo, Jie Xun, Ke Er, Si Wei Qifu Kan, Tom Shi, and Walter Fels. The announcement also stated that some police officers will also retire.

Recently, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have repeatedly gathered to discuss the issue of commercial competition between Japan and third countries after the opening of the Yangtze River. They have now requested the government to exclude Central China, especially the Shanghai area, from the Yen Bloc to compete with third countries as much as possible. It is reported that Japan's trade with China is currently facing major difficulties.

Yen Overabundance

The reason for this is the overabundance of Japanese currency in China. If the Japanese side wants to maintain the status of its currency in China, it must at least back it with materials, allowing Japanese merchants in China to remit yen back to the country to purchase goods. However, if this is done, the result of the influx of Japanese goods into China will inevitably accelerate the rise of domestic prices in Japan and increase the value of the yen in China. This method is naturally not adopted by the Japanese government, which would rather transport these goods to third countries to obtain foreign exchange. However, if trade with China is completely excluded from the Yen Bloc,

Gathering Foreign Exchange

According to what the Japanese merchants have requested, Japan can easily obtain foreign exchange, but if the medium of exchange is legal tender, the yen will lose its backing and will inevitably plummet, which will not be allowed by the Japanese military in China. This time, the Japanese merchants' request is ambiguous about whether to use yen or legal tender in the future, only seeking to lift restrictions and remove the constraints on Japanese goods entering China, to compete with third countries, especially the United States, because the United States' trade with Shanghai is currently three times that of Japan. However, the difficulty for the Japanese government to devise a good plan is within the realm of imagination. Therefore, it is also hesitant about the opening of the Yangtze River. How the Japanese government decides on the Japanese merchants' request is closely related to the price of Japanese yarn in China. The recent decline of the yen is said to have been affected by this shock.

### Public Works Bureau to Form a Special Committee to Resolve the Livelihood of Dispersed Refugees; Fear of Further Drifting or Even Returning to Shanghai as Vagrants; the Beggar Problem is Becoming Increasingly Serious and Deserves Attention

The Da Zhong News Agency reports that there are a total of twenty-four refugee camps in this city. According to Morris, the leader of the Salvation Army, the refugees in the camps will be completely resettled. It is now learned that in the past few weeks, about 30,000 refugees, an average of 400 per day, have been resettled. The Public Works Bureau will organize a special committee to handle this matter. Currently, this work is being undertaken by the Refugee Relief Association and the Salvation Army. Each resettled refugee is given a considerable subsidy, 15 yuan for adults and 10 yuan for those under 16 years old, to enable them to return to their hometowns or engage in other livelihoods. The difficulty is that these refugees receive some resettlement subsidies but do not immediately leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns, and instead drift around Shanghai, eventually becoming beggars. This will still increase the burden on society. The Public Works Bureau, in view of this, plans to organize a special committee to investigate whether the resettled refugees have indeed left Shanghai, or have found employment in Shanghai, to avoid the risk of drifting away.

After Resettlement

Morris and Yuan Ludeng both believe that the future of resettled refugees is not optimistic, because countless refugees will inevitably exhaust their subsidies, return to the streets, and become beggars. Morris further pointed out that some refugees will have difficulties immediately after resettlement, namely, that they will not be able to have a residence in this densely populated city. Regarding this point, it is said that the Public Works Bureau will find a solution, and the special committee organized by the Public Works Bureau will make the greatest effort to solve the resettlement problem and the various problems caused by resettlement. According to Morris, the Dunxin Road refugee camp will be retained after all the refugees have been resettled, and will be used to accommodate the elderly, weak, and disabled. Refugees who cannot be completely resettled in the near future will be temporarily accommodated in the Yanping Road refugee camp, and then another solution will be found. At present, the most concrete thing that the special committee can decide is to purchase boat or train tickets for the refugees to enable them to return to their hometowns. Currently, refugees who are resettled have not received assistance from the Public Works Bureau, so many of them stay in the suburbs of Shanghai and have not returned to their hometowns.

Becoming Beggars

According to Nash, Deputy Director of the Public Works Bureau, the difficult problem in resettling refugees in Shanghai is that there are not a few refugees who have drifted to Shanghai from the suburbs. After resettlement, they can certainly return to their hometowns in the short term, but if they have nothing to live on in their hometowns, they will inevitably become drifters again, and the seriousness of the beggar problem in Shanghai will be formed. Therefore, the urgent task is the beggar problem. There is currently no accurate statistic on the total number of beggars in Shanghai, but according to general estimates, the number should be above the number of refugees. This is proved by the number of beggars found on the streets by the police and the number of beggar corpses received by charitable organizations.

Insufficient Funding

In addition to the resettled refugees, there are still 5,000 to 10,000 elderly, weak, and disabled people left in Shanghai who need to be provided for. This estimate was confirmed yesterday by Morris, the leader of the Salvation Army. According to Yuan Ludeng's announcement yesterday, the current disaster relief fund requires about 300,000 yuan per month, but the current donations from all parties are only 200,000 yuan. The rising cost of living has made this problem increasingly serious. Two years ago, each refugee only needed 2 yuan per month for supplies, but now it has increased to more than 6 yuan. Last year, the total income of the disaster relief fund was 4,500,000 yuan, while the expenditure was only 4,000,000 yuan. This year, the situation is much worse.

### After the Implementation of the Public Treasury Law, Refund Methods are Revised

The Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that because the Public Treasury Law has been implemented, the bureau's past three refund methods are no longer applicable. It has specially revised the refund methods into four articles. When applying for a refund, the applicant or agent must apply for verification according to the new method, one of which is selected. The new methods are recorded as follows: (1) When a trademark applicant or agent applies to transfer the refundable fees from case A to case B, the original receipt shall still be submitted to the bureau for cancellation and re-issuance, or re-issuance with additional notes, in accordance with the previous method. (2) If the applicant or agent is in Chongqing, when applying for a refund, the original receipt issued by the bureau shall be attached, and the bureau shall fill in the "Income Refund Form" and attach it to the reply. After receiving the aforementioned "Income Refund Form", the applicant shall affix the same seal as on the original application form in the "Signature and Seal of Refund Recipient" column, and take it to the National Treasury Main Treasury to exchange it for cash. (3) If the applicant or agent is in another location and entrusts a familiar business or relative in Chongqing to collect the refund on their behalf, they shall state this in the application for a refund and attach the original receipt issued by the bureau. The bureau shall fill in the "Income Refund Form" and attach it to the reply. After the applicant signs and affixes the same seal as on the original application form, it shall be sent to the familiar business or relative in Chongqing, who shall take it to the National Treasury Main Treasury to collect the refund on their behalf. (4) If the applicant or agent is in another location and it is inconvenient to entrust someone in Chongqing to collect the refund on their behalf, they shall also state this in the application and attach the original receipt, which will be filled in by the bureau "Income Refund Form" and sent directly to the National Treasury for remittance.

### 190,000 Yuan Robbery Case; Two Members of the Robber Gang Arrested; Part of the Stolen Goods Worth 4,000 Yuan Recovered

Huiyuan Bank at 4 and 5 Ningbo Road previously transferred a large sum of money to its Lianhao Xiangfeng Bank in Wuxi. Xiangfeng ordered its staff to escort 160,000 yuan in legal tender to Shanghai on the 9th of this month. When it arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 noon, just as it was about to deliver the money to Huiyuan, while walking next to the Qiujiang Road railway, several robbers suddenly came forward and robbed all 160,000 yuan. After this case occurred, Huiyuan reported to the police and requested an investigation. At the same time, a reward was offered in the newspaper in the hope of solving the case. Since the occurrence of this case, Chinese and foreign detectives in various police stations in the Public Concession have done their best to investigate. Until recently, Chinese Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Li Pengfei, Detective Sun Dafa, Qin Lianggdeng, and others from the Lao Zha Police Station arrested Sun A'bao, a robber from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, on Aiduo Ya Road. Later, Wei Xiaode, an accomplice, was arrested on the Bund of Jiujiang Road. It was revealed that a large amount of stolen money was hidden at the home of Xu Wenhua, an accomplice, in a bungalow on Huishan Road. The detectives went to arrest Xu but found him missing, only arresting Xu Gu Shi, Xu Zhang Shi, and Zhang Li Shi, three women, and recovering part of the stolen goods, 4,000 yuan (which have been deposited in various banks with passbooks). They were taken to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court to continue the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement of the hearing because it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices. After questioning by Judge Feng, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

### Three Japanese Kidnapped Outside Wusong Estuary; Kidnapped After Sailing from Si Jiao to Shanghai; Japanese Military Searched Afterwards with No News

It was previously reported in this city that three Japanese were kidnapped while sailing outside the Wusong Estuary. The Japanese side has now dispatched detectives everywhere, but as of press time, there has been no news of the missing Japanese returning. The incident occurred when Ishizaki Tokuhisa (26 years old), his wife Kimie (21 years old), and another employee, Tomioka Aki (29 years old), employees of the Jiangnan Industrial Company Si Jiao Island Branch, a Japanese company at 167 Tiantong Road in this city, sailed to Shanghai on the company's 80th Sanhe Xiao Wheel on the night of the 24th. At around 11 a.m. on the 25th, when they arrived at a certain place about four miles from the Wusong Estuary, two small boats carrying armed men surrounded the wheel from the left and right, shouting for it to stop. At that time, Ishizaki fired a pistol wildly, but was still no match. At that time, all three were kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown.

### Opium for Stomach Pain

Chinese people lack common sense, and when they see relatives and friends suffering from severe stomach pain, they earnestly persuade them to smoke a few puffs of opium to relieve the pain, saying it with great conviction, as if opium can indeed cure stomach pain, and only opium can save them. In fact, how can opium cure stomach pain? It is merely using its anesthetic power to cover up the stomach pain, like using a smoke bomb to hide it, or using a blanket to cover it up. Not only is the root cause of the stomach pain not removed, but they also become addicted to opium, causing lifelong harm. The addiction grows bigger and bigger, and when the stomach pain flares up, one pipe is enough at first, but later it slowly becomes two or three pipes. At that time, they are busy getting high all day long, and there is no time to think about the deep-seated stomach disease that is getting worse every day. One day, it will become unmanageable. If you think about it, those who want to quit smoking, after quitting for a short time, the stomach disease reappears, and in the end, they cannot bear the pain and can never quit. This is also a serious problem in the process of quitting smoking.

According to hospital surveys, people with stomach diseases can only take "Five Minutes" stomach pain relief powder. Not only does it relieve pain quickly, but it also removes the root cause of the disease and never recurs. At that time, quitting smoking will also be unspeakably safe and pleasant.

Five Minutes

Stomach Pain Relief Powder has precious ingredients that have been tested and proven to contain no anesthetics or other toxic substances, so even children can take it. It has been popular in the South Seas for 20 years, and now its reputation is well-known far and wide. The price is popular and helps the world. Each box of 12 bags is 2 yuan, and each bag is 2 jiao. It is available everywhere. Shanghai Minghua Business Firm, General Manager, Telephone 12298 (Security).

In the women's championship final between the Chinese and Jewish teams, the Chinese team lived up to expectations and won by a score of 4-1, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. In the men's final, the Chinese athletes were in high spirits. The entire team wore white tennis short-sleeved shirts with the national flag embroidered on their chests, and they were led by team leader Chen Linsheng. Due to the absence of Ouyang Wei, Huang Zhijun, a reserve player, participated for China. The Chinese team won the first four games in a row. In the fifth game, Qiao Linhuike displayed excellent chopping and defensive skills, providing strong resistance to Li Zongpei. Qiao eventually won 22-20, earning the most valuable point for the Jewish team. In the end, the Chinese team crushed the Jewish team 13-1 to win the championship. After the match, according to Chinese team leader Chen Linsheng, Siff, the world runner-up in table tennis singles, and the three most famous players in the United States, Wagner and McCoy, will come to Shanghai in early June to challenge. At that time, it will be the time for the Jingwu Cup individual finals, and he hopes that the winners will work hard to practice and compete for international glory.

### Grain: Attempting to Manipulate the Market Continues, Imported Rice Immediately Imported After Price Drop; Glutinous Rice Difficult to Sell Due to Hot Weather, Seeking to Dispose of Stocks

After the Rice Market Bureau returned to Kunshan again, yesterday, both buyers and sellers continued to strengthen their efforts. As a result, the prices of various types of imported rice rose again. The situation of Yingtong Lai imported rice is different from the past. It does not rely solely on actual sales and seems to be engaged in short-selling and buying, like a stock exchange. Although the market has announced that such practices are prohibited, it is nothing more than covering up for foreigners and deceiving the world. Those engaged in speculation continue to use people's food as a "rubber ball," which is hateful to say. Currently, when the price is high, there are many short sellers. In the past two days, they still believed that the decline had not stopped and were full of hope. However, the market tightened again overnight, and they could not resist, so they hurriedly sought to cover their positions. Therefore, before the market opened in the morning, inquiries were made and efforts were made to occupy a favorable position. The market was quickly bought up, and the shouts rose one after another. In the meantime, some customers from inland villages and stores also participated, making the market even more lively. In a short time, the prices of various goods increased by about one and a half yuan. At this time, the price was already high, and the desire to cover positions gradually weakened. Other sales venues followed suit, and the overall trend began to weaken slightly. It was almost noon, and the price had fallen by nearly one yuan. However, the market is changeable and difficult to grasp. After falling once, short covering resumed, and the situation became tense again. By the close of the market, it had not weakened slightly. As a result, the closing price was one and a half yuan higher than the previous day's closing price.

In other news, after several days of decline in the price of imported rice, yesterday it attracted the interest of the rice merchants. The Shantou, Xiamen, and Tianjin merchants were preparing to load five to six thousand bags of rice. It is rumored that the Taiwanese merchants are shipping five thousand bags, but the goods are actually being shipped by Japanese merchants. However, the market and people's minds have been stirred up, and the prices of various types of rice have risen sharply, especially the price of small-grained rice, which has been actively traded and has risen the most. The price of 40.9 yuan yesterday rose to 42.5 yuan yesterday, but in the afternoon, some profits were taken out, and it was also affected by the new deal for Saigon No. 2, and the closing price was only 42.1 yuan. The prices of other Saigon and Siamese rice all rose by more than one yuan in the morning and fell by four or five cents in the afternoon. The prices of Saigon No. 2 for April and May have been rising all the way, opening at 53 yuan and rising to 53.5 yuan. 500 tons of New Saigon No. 2 have been sold, and it is rumored that 2,500 tons have been sold at prices of 53 yuan and 51.9 yuan. More than 300 tons have been covered. There are currently more than 10,000 bags of imported rice.

More imported rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 8,435 bags of rice and docked at the French Concession Bund wharf. Unloading will begin this morning. It is reported that the Italian (transliteration) vessel "Huáěrbǐ" (transliteration) is arriving in Shanghai today directly from Saigon with 97 tons of rice. In addition, the French postal ship "Fó lì shì Luó zǐ" (transliteration) is also scheduled to arrive today, and it is said that it also has imported rice on board. The amount will be known after the ship arrives.

Due to the continuous arrival of glutinous rice, yesterday there were also 2,300 to 400 bags of goods from the Changxi Sujia area arriving, and the weather is hot and humid, and mold will arrive soon, so it is not easy to keep it for a long time. They all seek to dispose of it quickly, so it is still flat and can only keep pace with imported rice. In the market, Changzhou Suxu sticky rice is being sold at 39.8 yuan, and Nangang Huzao at 40 yuan to 39.5 yuan. Outside the market, it is rumored that Changxi high-quality glutinous rice is at 44 to 45 yuan, Zhongguan at 43 yuan, Kunsu glutinous rice at 43.5 to 42.5 yuan, Qingpu and Sijing (falsely called) at 43.5 to 42.5 yuan, and Nangang original package early and late rice at 42.5 to 41.5 yuan.

Yesterday, glutinous rice was being sold at 39.5 yuan for Liyang special rice, and 38.5 to 38 yuan for Danyang and Changzhou rice. Medium-quality glutinous rice was sold at 37 yuan wholesale.

### Flour Market Resumes Slackness —Maintained by Mai Yi-pin—

Flour: Yesterday, due to export issues not yet resolved, sales to out-of-town merchants in the market were temporarily disappointing. Trading within the city was also affected because more flour from inland areas has been arriving recently. Many flour dealers are bundling sales with miscellaneous brands, leading to a decrease in retail sales within the city. Only four to five thousand bags were directly sold by factories. The asking price for No. 2 flour from factories remains at $13.80, while returned goods with the old trademark are priced at $13.70, a slight decrease of five cents compared to the previous day. It is reported that the price of flour from Changshu and other inland areas is between $13.30 and $13.40. Suppliers fear continued dumping in Shanghai due to the lower prices in those areas.

Wheat: Recent sources are scarce, and trading has been rare for a long time. Aside from a few scattered deliveries to factories, there are virtually no large-scale transactions in the market. This is because the season is already past, and the recent weather has been suitable, making a good harvest of new wheat expected. Therefore, Chinese factories are reluctant to buy and are trying to suppress prices, while suppliers are unwilling to compromise too much, resulting in stagnant buying and selling.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Mediocre

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market situation saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The black market rates for British and American currencies initially eased slightly but then returned to par, indicating a very mediocre situation. Trading was sluggish due to end-of-month settlement requirements. In the morning, speculative traders sold more than they bought, and external demand was slightly weak, leading to a hardening of rates. However, as inflows and outflows gradually balanced, the market returned to par. The afternoon was even more quiet, and the closing price was unchanged from the previous day. The same was true for futures.

Trading was also very quiet.

In the early morning, London's spot rate fell by 0.0625, while the forward rate remained flat. New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. Exchange rates for British currency against American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American currency was mostly flat against British currency, unchanged against Shanghai currency, and up 0.0375 against French currency. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 4 1/8 pence for British gold and $6.03125 for American currency, both unchanged from the previous night's close. Futures opened at the same rates, also unchanged. The market remained quiet after the opening, with some speculative traders selling off, resulting in the acceptance of May's American currency at $5.78125. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 50 cents. Subsequently, speculative traders continued to sell, and rates became slack due to ample positions. At that time, speculative traders sold May's American currency at $5.8125 and sold April's American currency to the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at $6.0625. It was reported that the spread between spot and forward was still 0.25. By the time of the noon closing, rates returned to par as sellers stopped selling. British gold closed at 4 1/8 pence, and American currency closed at $6.03125. As a result, the spot and futures rates were the same as the morning opening.

Results showed no gains or losses.

There were no changes in the afternoon, and no trading was reported. As a result, British gold was 4 1/8 pence, American currency was $6.03125, April British gold was 4 1/8 pence, April American currency was $6.03125, May British gold was 3.984375 pence, and May American currency was $5.78125, all unchanged from the previous night's close.

Hong Kong exchange market stable.

Hong Kong, 26th (Friday) telegram: This morning's exchange market was stable. British, American, and Shanghai currencies showed no gains or losses. The spot rate for Japanese currency eased by 0.025 to 92.5 yen. It was stable at 11:30 AM, with no changes in any exchange rates. It was reported flat at 2:30 PM. The spot rate for American currency eased by 0.0625 to $21.8125.

Tianjin market also unchanged.

Tianjin, 26th (Friday) telegram: This morning's exchange market opened stably. The black market rates for British, American, and "Joint Notes" remained at their original levels. The Shanghai currency rose slightly by 0.025 to $111.75.

### Heavy Pressure: Difficult to Reverse the Declining Trend in the Gold Market

Yesterday's black market situation for the current "Yu Ye He Chi" (a type of gold bar) was sluggish and uninteresting. Generally, operators are unable to exert their influence due to the double pressure of mortgage and tight credit. Furthermore, the exchange market was slack and flat, so prices were difficult to raise. It was difficult for bullish players without real strength to make trades even with a daily interest rate of over 0.03. The trend of selling was difficult to stop. Initially, trading was slightly suppressed due to the increase in exchange rates, but the market soon improved, reaching a high of $5,648. However, securities firms and gold shops frequently sold, and the lowest price was only $5,605. Silver shops slightly absorbed at the noon closing, rising to $5,630. In the afternoon, retail investors suddenly bought in, and the buying momentum was temporarily strong. However, sales by silver shops and gold shops of larger amounts caused the price to retreat from a high of $5,650 to $5,630. Later, due to quiet trading, the market closed at 2:30 PM at a price of $5,635, down $24 from the previous day. Total trading volume for the day was approximately one thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry gold initially fell but then returned to par. Customs gold remained stable.

"Yu Ye He Chi" further down by $0.04.

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw a slight decline due to the increase in exchange rates. The market opened down $14, with gold shops selling twenty taels for exchange at $5,645. Later, silver shops slightly supported, pulling the price up by $3. Silver shops traded thirty taels with each other at $5,648. Securities firms and money exchange firms then sold off, pushing the price down again. Silver shops traded ten taels with each other, dropping to $5,633. Later, a certain money exchange firm showed strong buying interest, bringing the price back up by $7. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange firms at $5,640. After that, securities firms repeatedly sold off, and retail investors also followed suit, causing the market to become filled with supply and drop by $25. Gold shops sold fifty taels for exchange at $5,605. After 11:30 AM, the market suddenly turned around because the exchange market futures tightened slightly. Buyers suddenly became active, and money exchange firms and gold shops returned to buying, gradually rising by $25. Gold shops sold thirty taels to silver shops, making the noon closing price $5,630. In the afternoon, the market initially opened strongly, rising $15 at the opening. Money exchange firms bought twenty taels from gold shops at $5,645. Later, money exchange firms slightly absorbed, pulling the price up another $5. Money exchange firms bought ten taels from securities firms at $5,650. Later, silver shops saw high prices and sold, and buyers stopped buying, frequently seeing a drop of $20. Silver shops sold fifty taels to securities firms at $5,630. Afterwards, a certain silver shop slightly scooped up, rising back $5. Silver shops bought ten taels from money exchange firms, making the evening closing price $5,635. As a result, it continued to fall $24 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $45 throughout the day. The selling price of existing cash gold at gold shops was a few dollars higher than "Yu Ye He Chi," while the buying price was $20 lower. The current price of standard gold was over $59 lower than the listed price, with almost no trading reported.

Jewelry gold initially fell but then remained flat.

The selling price of jewelry gold at silver shops initially remained at $570 per tael at Da Tong Hang (a major gold shop), but at 10:30 AM, it decreased by $5, and at noon, it returned to $5. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Da Tong Hang still quoted $570. The prices at new gold shops were the same as the previous price, with buying prices reduced by about $15.

### Exchange Drafts and Discount Rates Fall Sharply

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes continued to fall. Initially, it dropped to $97.50 per thousand, and later it could not hold, falling to $84. At noon, it slightly recovered to $87.50. In the afternoon, it continued to trade higher to $95, a further decrease of $5 compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, unchanged.

### Fresh Bills Continue to Decline

Yesterday, due to the decline in the British, American, and gold exchange rates, the gold bill also followed and fell by $1. The supply and demand for British gold bills and Hong Kong bills were balanced, and the market price remained stable. The American gold bill initially rose to $16.41, but due to the approaching end of the fourth period, all firms needed legal tender, and various parties dumped their holdings, causing the market price to fall. By noon, it had retreated to $16.34. In the afternoon, supply and demand were still balanced, and the market price remained stable, but it was still down by $0.03 compared to the previous day. The demand for French franc bills was weak, and the market price continued to decline. Dutch bills also became weak again. The demand for Japanese bills slightly increased, and the evening market was slightly higher at $1.269. There were still many Korean bills supplied, and the market price became even more unsustainable, retreating to $0.983 in the evening market.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Ask for Four Days of Trading; Trading Volume Reaches $10,000,000; An Unprecedented Record Since the Establishment of the Securities Association

The black market for domestic bonds was relatively stable yesterday morning but weak in the afternoon. Investor sentiment remained unable to recover. News was more negative than positive, and there was no sign of easing in the tight credit situation. In addition, the government's discount of bills excluded public bonds, making it inconvenient for bill holders who wanted to be active. Moreover, in the current environment of high interest rates, going long was not as profitable as lending. Therefore, apart from covering short positions, new bullish positions were extremely rare in the market. There was very little trading yesterday morning, mostly retail investors buying and Jiu Feng covering short positions. Nos. 20 and Wanchun Tong Ji Hongkang, among others, were selling. The market price varied between 5 cents and 10 cents. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng continued to cover short positions, Changji entered Ding class, and Lianyi entered Bing class and exited Jia and Yi classes. Xinchang and Renchang slightly bought in, while sellers were still very enthusiastic. Nos. 20, Lianhe, Yongxiang, Runli, and Tongkang, among others, were all selling, with Zhongxin selling regardless of price. The market price gradually declined, eventually turning weak and falling by 1.5 cents to 4.5 cents compared to the previous day. The total trading volume was approximately $800,000. A brief table is listed below:

London, 25th (Thursday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower ranges of various bonds.

The stock market for various vegetables was filled with selling pressure. All good prospects temporarily disappeared, and the downward trend continued until noon, when there was a turnaround. Those closing positions did not care about the selling price at all. If buyers had not continuously maintained support, it is difficult to imagine the extent to which the downward trend would have expanded. At the close, most industrial stocks returned to their opening prices.

Jardine Matheson shares have suffered a severe price drop from their highest level at the beginning of the week due to unconfirmed rumors over the past few days. Yesterday, they were once again at the forefront of the wave of selling pressure, once trending weakly to a low price of $190. Fortunately, buyers persisted and did not let go, stopping each drop and rebounding to close at $193. There were no sellers in sight. There was a large trading volume in International shares, totaling 62,000 shares. They opened at $31.75 and then fluctuated between that price and $33, closing at $31.50. The buying interest in Yangtze shares was better, and the closing price was still the original opening price of $20.25. There was also a severe wind of cutting long positions in steel shares, and large numbers of shares were easily absorbed. There were buyers at $42 at the close. The price fluctuations for Shanghai Land Investment shares were moderate, and there were many buyers at the closing price of $33.50. The action of China Land and Investment shares was very unique. Although the number of long positions closing out was also astonishing, absorption was too easy, and a new high price of $33.25 was created.

Rubber stocks had a better trend because people generally focused too much attention on U.S. stocks, so their fluctuations were minimal. The public was satisfied with the dividend announced by Ling Zhi, as it was able to show the recent progress of the company. Ling Zhi Rubber Trust and Kangsha Lai Te all had good demand.

Although the trading period this week was only four days, the trading volume was the highest on record in the history of the Securities Association. Calculated by price, the total number of shares traded was less than $10,000,000.

Regarding Chinese stock trading, 50 shares of Y盐业 Bank shares were traded at a price of $73. London, 25th (Thursday) telegram: Today's listed prices for British Far East companies' stocks all turned for the better. Mercantile Bank shares rose 1 shilling and 3 pence to £9 5s. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares each rose half a pound to £93 1/2. Kailan Mining Administration bearer shares rose 1 penny and a half to 19 shillings and 6 pence. Glucker and Lambotte Rubber shares alone fell 1 penny and a half to 18 shillings and 1 penny. The rest were unchanged.

### Ling Zhi Rubber Distributes Two Dividends

Ling Zhi Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm McBain & Co. in this city, is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting on May 14. A dividend of 18 Dutch cents per share is proposed for the year ending October 1939.

In addition, an interim dividend will also be paid at the same time for the year ending October 1940, with a proposed dividend of 14 Dutch cents per share. The total dividend paid is 32 Dutch cents. (Based on the Dutch Bank's Java guilder buying price of 11.5 guilders, the dividend per share is equivalent to $2.88 in national currency.)

### Yarn and Cloth: Factories Have Already Released Large Quantities; Cotton Yarn Still Looking Good; Why is the Spot Business So Sluggish?

The yarn market has risen again, but the actual demand for transactions remains sluggish and has not improved. However, investor sentiment remains bullish, so the market is tight and slightly loose. However, the current chips still feel dry because a large number of transactions were made during the spring sales period. However, in the later period, it gradually entered a quiet period. In addition, the factory also released approximately 10,000 packages.

In the morning, the market opened, and the market sentiment continued to be good due to the improved market atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day. The unit price for 20-count Double Horse factory orders was $1,445, immediately rising to $55. At this time, the acceptance of factory orders and the hedging of transactions for the next month continued. As a result, the market was pushed up, rising to $1,480, but the spot business was particularly sluggish. According to the daytime transaction statistics, 1,645 packages were traded, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse rising by $20. Shenxin Factory released 1,900 packages of 20-count Double Horse at a price of $1,470 in cash. Xinsheng Factory released 400 packages of 20-count Golden Tiger at a price of $1,420, another 400 packages at a price of $1,440, and 500 packages of 14-count Golden Tiger at a price of $1,270.

The amount purchased by each gang is listed below: Tonghang 1,390; Hong Kong 255; Total 1,645

### Shenxin Hedges with Indian Cotton; Spot Trading is Particularly Active

There were still few transactions in this cotton, but the demand for Indian cotton was relatively strong. Shenxin Factory hedged cotton because it released a large amount of cotton yarn. Other transactions were still mostly inter-dealer buying and selling. The cotton market lacked signs of improvement due to the lack of inventory and the tight credit situation. Regardless of the tight situation, the current cotton situation is as follows:

Xingheng $223.00 Tonghang entered 100 pieces

Oomra $210.50 Rong entered 500 pieces

Pengjiapu $251.00 Tonghang entered 400 pieces

Bai Luo $254.00 Also 10 pieces

Huocao Bao $213.00 Also 697 packages

Also $208.00 Also 100 packages

Argentina $274.00 Also 110 pieces

Bai Luoqu $251.00 Shenxin entered 1,500 pieces

Nantai $217.50 Tonghang entered 155 packages

Mitelin $298.00 Also 100 pieces

Pila $236.00 Also 200 pieces

Another news item about the price of foreign cotton, New York, was particularly weak yesterday. The Wall Street market sold and partially closed out long positions, resulting in a price drop. The closing price for the near term was down 1 point, and the far term was down 5 to 7 points. The Indian cotton market rose 2 rupees along with the forecast yesterday, and Egyptian cotton fell 2 to 3 points.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market remained active yesterday despite the approaching end of the month and extremely tight credit. However, futures trading was relatively quiet because all parties firmly believed that it would be difficult to ship on schedule and that there were many difficulties due to the unpredictable changes in the European situation. However, spot trading was extremely active, and the asking price for 42-count Mitelin was as high as $310. It is said that this was due to the sale of cheap cuts due to tight funds. The price of cotton in mid-May is generally considered to be very bullish. The factory prices for cotton, converted at an exchange rate of $6.00, are listed below:

20-count American Mitelin $292.50

20-count Also, Lower Grade $283.40

32-count Also $310.60

32-count Also, Lower Grade $300.20

42-count Also $313.60

42-count Also, Lower Grade $304.00

More than 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai today, shipped from Karachi, India, on the Italian ship "Wallby" (transliteration) and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo "Che Bai" Shortage; Selling Price Rises Another 50 Cents

Yesterday, according to a Dutch telegram, "Cu Bai" (coarse white sugar) recovered slightly by about 20 cents, with a C.I.F. K.G. price of 8.715 Dutch guilders. The city's association adjusted the market price accordingly, resulting in a slight decline. The current spot price for 24 coarse white sugar was $63.30 for local warehouses, with new goods in foreign warehouses initially at $63.20, then falling to $63. The price for goods arriving on March 18 was $62.90, and the price for goods arriving on November 7 was $61.80. Transshipment remained at $50. Due to the shortage of Taikoo "Che Bai," the selling price rose another 50 cents. The price for Western warehouses B mark was $71.80, the price for CW mark was $71.50, and so on, rising by 20 to 30 cents. The price for CX mark was $71, the price for DY mark was $70.50, and the price for HX mark was $70.30. The remaining prices were largely unchanged. Guangbang opened 40 cases of green strip sugar for national sugar, at $39.60. In addition, 844 packages of sugar arrived from Haikou on the 26th, and 500 packages arrived from Hong Kong.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Pickled Mustard Greens are Expensive

Pickled mustard greens have been in short supply for a long time, and the market inventory is extremely tight and almost exhausted. The market price yesterday was $150 to $160, which can be said to be extremely high.

### Oil Market: Little Activity in Raw Soybean Oil —Soybeans Traded—

Yesterday's oil market saw a significant decrease in transactions because the environment was unfavorable for long positions, resulting in a weakening of activity. Therefore, although the market was sluggish, the entire market was focused on actual goods and sales. Only five barrels of Qingdao peanut oil and ten barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil were traded.

Whole grains: 200 bags of Anqing soybeans, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans, 80 bags of Chongsi sand yellow, 70 bags of Pinghu She soybeans, and 50 bags of Peidong Du soybeans were traded throughout the day. Detailed sales prices are listed in the market price section.

### Woolen Fabrics: "Sharkskin" for Summer Wear; Initially from the United States, Followed by British Goods; This Summer's Arrivals are Very Abundant, with Many Colors

Sharkskin is a newly emerging type of material in the field of suit fabrics. Because its texture is similar to silk fabrics, it has occupied a unique position in summer clothing materials in recent years, becoming popular for a time.

Sharkskin originally came from the United States and was initially popular in Manila and Luzon. However, it gradually began to appear in the Shanghai market in the previous year. However, most of it was sent from Hong Kong. Until last year, a few Shanghai woolen fabric businesses also began to order weaving from abroad, not limited to the United States. Therefore, pure American goods were difficult to find in the Shanghai market last year, while British goods became popular for a time, with prices ranging from $7 to $8 per yard.

In view of the popularity of sharkskin last summer, many woolen fabric firms began to order weaving. As a result, this spring's arrivals are very abundant, and the colors have become more numerous than in previous years. American goods are particularly abundant, with colors such as yellow, gray, and white. The width is around 38 inches. The price before delivery was around one US dollar. The current general retail price is between $25 and $26. However, British goods have not decreased in color, because their material is slightly thinner, and the price is also cheaper, around $15 to $16, about $10 less than American products. In addition, there is also a type of Japanese goods, priced between $5 and $6 per yard, but the surface can be compared with Western goods, but the body is far inferior to British and American goods.

### Old News, New Copy: 67 Years Ago (366)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

A Monk Risking His Life to Solicit Donations

In the Desheng Bridge area of Hangzhou, generally known as Jiacheng Lane, there was once a King Kong Temple, the former site of the Southern Song Dynasty, a solid and solemn large temple. It is said that a certain monk during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras completed his meritorious deeds and ascended to heaven, and even today the elders can still talk about it. Since the Ochre Bandits disturbed Zhejiang, the temple was destroyed, and now only dilapidated walls remain. Last winter, an old monk settled here, determined to restore the old rules and rebuild the temple, and he solicited donations for a long time, but nothing came to fruition. He recruited one or two monks, and they discussed with each other, saying that without a shocking event to stir up the city and countryside, it would be impossible to obtain a large sum of money. The old monk was already over seventy years old and was about to die, so he planned to risk his life to fulfill this grand wish. It would be enough if the mountain gate could be rebuilt, and the old monk could be revered as the founder of the mountain. The disciples all gladly accepted the teaching. The monk first spread the word everywhere several months ago, predicting the date of his death and that he must be cremated immediately three days after Nirvana, otherwise it would hinder his ascent to heaven. Therefore, on that day, devout men and women all donated money to form good karma, but the esteemed officials of Renhe and Qiantang counties had also heard about it early on and initially dismissed it as a clever trick by monks and Taoists to collect money. When they heard that there were too many people seeing him off to his death, they brought officials and coroners to the place on the following day to personally verify. When they arrived, there were countless men and women along the way burning incense and bowing in worship. They immediately summoned his disciples for questioning, who replied that it was for the monk's successful ascension to heaven. The county officials saw that the high platform was filled with stacked firewood, and on the platform was a high niche, sealed on all sides, requiring a large amount of money to be named. The monk had set the date for cremation on the sixteenth night, so the disciples wanted to wait until the time to start the fire. The Xing county official suspected that he had committed suicide by taking poison, so he made his statement mysterious, wanting to open the niche for examination. The Zhou county official thought that since he had already passed away, there was no need to look at him again, but cremation within three days was too fast, and he should be ordered to wait until seven days later to see what happened. He ordered his disciples to investigate if they disobeyed and secretly instructed the constables to guard day and night in shifts.

Psychology

### The Science of Living

— Yang Tongfang

Psychologist Dr. A. Adler once wrote a book called "Science of Living," which, from the perspectives of education and psychology, provides appropriate guidance on three important issues in life—social problems, occupational problems, and romantic relationship problems. It is a good book that is both popular and practical.

Dr. Adler is a respected authority on individual psychology and developmental psychology, and his writings are highly regarded. In this book, his discussion of the influence of "Inferiority Complex" and "Superiority Complex" on life is extremely insightful, indeed providing much guidance for our actual lives. He believes that abnormal behavior in human psychology originates entirely from adverse childhood environments. Educators should pay close attention to training children, cultivate their healthy psychological development, and make every effort to develop their social interests, guiding their emotions in beneficial directions. This precisely aligns with the key points of modern mental hygiene.

Recent psychological research has shown a trend towards close application to life. This specialized academic field makes a significant contribution to the improvement of human life. Major discoveries in psychology are often generated by practical needs. Many theories and experiments help us solve many problems in life. Not only do the abnormal behaviors of psychiatric patients require psychological research for remediation and prevention, but also willpower, emotions, habits, thinking, etc., which are most closely related to daily life, must adopt psychological principles to solve difficult problems.

Traditional views believe that life and science have no connection. Science only explores the principles of the natural and social environment and is a purely academic pursuit. They forget the application aspects of science. Since psychology is an independent science, its research should aim to solve life's difficulties. Human life will become more meaningful and valuable because of psychological research. The content of our lives will be enriched, and our lifestyles will be improved, making life the most rational and sublime activity, filtering out and discarding all the stale dregs of life. As Dr. Adler said, "This science (referring to psychology) naturally emphasizes practicality because, with the assistance of knowledge, we can change and correct our attitudes."

The scope of life is very broad, encompassing all human activities. Psychologists often say that life is a purposeful expression. Muddled, casual, and aimless living without a clear goal cannot be considered a proper attitude towards life. An ideal life should have educational value, not only in developing oneself but also in improving society and benefiting humanity. Therefore, the highest function of human life lies in constantly conducting objective self-criticism at any time and place, continuously identifying the shortcomings of life, and changing and correcting them. Therefore, we must absorb more knowledge about life.

Around us, there are many people living in frustration, sorrow, depression, and negativity. They lack faith and enthusiasm for life, leading to decadence, depression, and helplessness. Unless they awaken as soon as possible, absorb and refine scientific knowledge related to life improvement, eradicate the bad habits of sluggishness, cultivate healthy and normal emotions, enrich the meaning of life, and unleash their inner potential, they will forever be trapped in the bottomless abyss of darkness without any hope of extrication.

### Warmth and Loveliness

— Ding Lianfang

It is the late spring season, once again the season of lush grasses and flying orioles in the Jiangnan region. The earth has received warmth, and everything seems to be awakening. "The year's plan starts in spring" is precisely because spring is warm and conducive to getting things done, making it particularly important. Apart from humans, warmth also offers many benefits to other animals and plants. The world's organisms are most abundant and developed in temperate zones. Flowers and plants germinate in spring, and birds and beasts are particularly lively in spring. According to the results of psychological research, we know that both extreme cold and extreme heat can reduce people's attention. Therefore, the most civilized and prosperous parts of the world are the temperate zones. Temperate zones produce more great people, more contributions, and more inventions. The philosopher Russell wanted to write articles in the sun, and the poet Byron feared the cold, like a sheep. Milton's Paradise Lost was written in spring, and Goethe's poems were written in autumn. Someone has compiled statistics on great works of world literature, with May having the most, followed by April and September, and January, October, December, and February having the fewest.

Besides the warmth of the climate, the warmth of the soul is also extremely precious. When a family joyfully gathers, both body and mind feel immense comfort. Having an interest in one's career can also warm the soul. "If you have done nothing wrong during the day, you will not be alarmed by high gates in the middle of the night." This is certainly due to the comfort and ease brought by a warm soul. Contact with good teachers and helpful friends, and harmonious relationships between people, further adds to the warmth of the soul.

Warmth can make us feel the joy of life and can make us approach the world with a positive attitude. Therefore, we must work hard in a timely manner and not give up the warm days that nature bestows upon us. At the same time, we should not waste or abandon the warmth needed by the soul.

### God Above All (3)

Have you understood the difference between putting God first? If you trust God, you will trust your fellow man. Loving God means loving your fellow man. Believing in God means believing that this world is God's home, and you are children of a loving Father. Believing that God is great, creative, wise, and powerful, and that He is constantly working in the universe, you will believe that justice, virtue, and love are the greatest forces in the world. Believing in God, you are convinced that loyalty, faith, and love are valuable and will ultimately triumph. Such faith enables you to cope with all the difficulties and disappointments in the world because you believe that "good" can overcome "evil," "truth" can overcome "falsehood," and "love" can overcome "evil," and eternal life can overcome death. A person who lives with the consciousness of God will always have a victorious attitude. No matter what comes, he will always face it fearlessly and unashamedly. God supports him and takes care of him to the end because he is part of God's eternal will. At one of the most shocking moments in religious history, an unknown prophet in exile wrote these great words, "Those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint." When the Hebrews were exiled and returned to rebuild their spiritual culture and renew the foundations of their faith, the prophet led them before God, preparing them for that work. Waiting on God can increase your strength and give you unprecedented power. He told them that putting God before their work would lead to three things: being able to fly, run, and walk. In other words, being close to God provides endless encouragement, and regardless of circumstances, one can face everything with absolute fearlessness. We must learn to walk the path of life tirelessly and unyieldingly. The hope of today's world lies in finding God within people and expressing Him in life.

### Post-Marriage Confessions

— Jin

I remember when I got married with beautiful dreams and a happy heart, I never thought that I would encounter so many things that I find unpleasant to see and hear. Just speaking of our love, although I can't say that our love has entered the grave, love no longer inspires us, immersing our body and mind in it.

He gets up early every morning, eats breakfast in a hurry, and has to rush to the office by eight o'clock. Whether I get up with him or not, he seems to no longer care about my warm concern. Before marriage, even if I walked an extra distance with him, he would be overjoyed and thank me endlessly. He comes home after six o'clock every night, dragging a tired body to bed, and has nothing to say to me at all. "Heart-to-heart talks" are even more out of the question. There is no more consideration or gentleness between us. All our relationship is built entirely on the name of husband and wife.

This is so painful for me! It's not that I necessarily need love, as if I can't live without it. But my life now is so devoid of emotion, everything is cold and stark, and I only have nominal relationships with people. A lively girl suddenly finds herself trapped in this eternally icy and snowy family. The spiritual loneliness and pain she feels are indescribable, and her transformation is self-evident.

In my own home, I have parents, brothers, and sisters. We are lively, my family is full of vitality, and my life seems to have always shone with extraordinary brilliance. The harmony and enthusiasm of our family filled me with infinite hope and joy for life. After I met him, I felt that life was even more fulfilling, as if I were living in a loving mist, full of sweetness. I fantasized that if I married him, wouldn't everything be even more perfect? Who knew that after we got married, things didn't turn out as I had ever imagined. I initially overlooked the fact that I was going to live in a different environment.

Look at my current family. I have a mother-in-law, uncles, aunts, sisters-in-law, and a large group of people. This is a completely authentic and typical Chinese extended family. They see me as a stranger, and of course, they don't develop any feelings for me. Not only that, but they also feel that there is one more person, and the family has one more nuisance. Although I have never had any direct conflicts with them in terms of opinions. I get up early, do my things, and he goes to his office. From then until evening, every day, every day, I spend my precious youthful years in this way. I am even more reluctant to casually step out of the room for no reason. The world outside the room is cold and hypocritical. They don't like me much either, saying that I am a modern woman, and they don't talk to me casually unless it is necessary. This is exactly what I want. To be honest, I have nothing to say to this large group of people except for perfunctory words. They all consider themselves old-fashioned and think that I, a modern woman, am not compatible with them. I really don't understand where I am modern.

### Ambition

— Ru

He who does not set his ambition when young, will accomplish nothing when old.

What is ambition? There would be many different explanations for it, I'm afraid? Many people are without ambition, all they have is how to stay alive, in other words: "Take each day as it comes," and that's all.

A person has ambition pertaining to a particular time in their life in a given era. The ambition of one's youth changes in middle age, and the ambition of middle age changes in old age; people whose ambition remains constant are few. If such a person exists, they are definitely a hero or a great person.

Having ambition alone is useless. What "ambition" needs is "action" and "effort," and above all, one must have "perseverance." If these four are all present, then the door to success will be opened, just waiting for people to enter. "Time" is the enemy of ambition. If one slackens off even slightly, "Father Time" will quietly slip away, and even the greatest ambition will become a bubble.

If you have an ambition, just do it quietly. When you succeed, everyone will naturally admire you. If you have an ambition but don't focus on realizing it, but instead keep talking about it, boasting to others, then people will feel infinitely annoyed by your ambition.

Some people's ambitions are very admirable. Why? It is because they have the spirit of knowing something is impossible but still trying to do it, or they are upright and honorable, never hoping to enjoy the beautiful fruits after their ambition is realized. Many revolutionary heroes, such as Mazzini of Italy, Lenin of Russia, and Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa of China, as well as Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in modern times, are all people of this kind.

Many people say they are not afraid of hardship and will definitely realize their ambitions, but in reality, when their ambition is not even half completed, they have already changed their attitude. When Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui were young, didn't they want to stand tall and be upright people? But when it came to the point of profit and wealth, even their personality could be sacrificed, and their nation and country could be offered up. If they had died a few years earlier, who would say they weren't good people?

Human Affairs

### Labor Training

— Qing

Recently, the chief official of the Labor Service Department of the German National Socialist Party proposed that future newlyweds must first work voluntarily in the Labor Service Department for a considerable period of time, and only those who obtain a "passing" certificate will be allowed to marry. The chief official believes that this type of service will not only be sufficient to guarantee a happy married life, but also serve as clear proof of the following slogan: "The best school for cultivating the character of young people is the voluntary Labor Service Department."

He also advocated that in the future, not only newlyweds must obtain this type of labor "passing" certificate before they are allowed to register their marriage, but all young people under the age of twenty-five must receive this training. Apprentices in various trades must also obtain this "passing" certificate before they are promoted to master craftsmen, and even all doctors and lawyers must first have this certificate before they are allowed to practice.

### Good News for Mothers

Maternity department of Leren Hospital offers low-cost delivery services. Director Dr. Zhang Yongming is knowledgeable and experienced.

"Everyone knows that childbirth is the most important and dangerous thing for women. Because of this, it is essential to have basic knowledge about childbirth. This is especially important for first-time mothers. If the fetus is difficult to deliver, there is excessive bleeding after childbirth, or there is a fever after childbirth, these can all endanger the life of the mother. However, most women in our country are ashamed of physical examinations, etc., by doctors. Whenever they give birth, they rely solely on village midwives, which often leads to the loss of lives. Playing around with life is truly lamentable. For the sake of the mother and for the sake of the baby, women should make an appointment with a obstetrician as soon as they become pregnant. All matters during pregnancy, childbirth, and after childbirth should be entrusted to their guidance, so that both the mother and the fetus will benefit. During pregnancy, pathological changes are unpredictable, or the position of the fetus may change, etc., which can all be avoided with the guidance of a doctor and prevented before it happens. In view of this, Leren Hospital at 70 Gu Ba Lu has specially hired obstetrician Zhang Yongming and several head midwives to be in charge of delivery matters. All obstetric equipment is extremely complete. Recently, Dr. Zhang has compiled a book entitled "Mothers' Guide," which is based on scientific medicine and comprehensively describes the essential points of pregnancy diagnosis, pregnancy hygiene, pregnancy warnings, management during labor, management after childbirth, infant care, infant feeding, care of newborn infants, and crises of newborn infants, which is indeed a must-read for general pregnant women. Five thousand copies of the book have been printed and are available for free. It is said that the hospital charges low fees for delivery and offers special discounts for purchasing prenatal care vouchers in advance."

### Xiong Shi-i's New Work "Professor from Peking" - Actually a Counter-Propaganda for Business Gain. This Kind of Playwright Should Be Strictly Investigated

— Haixing

Professor Xiong Shi-i made both fame and fortune overseas with his English script of "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan," and has since lived a comfortable life in London on royalties. Recently, he completed an original script called "Professor Come From Peking," a three-act play that lacks both a central idea and descriptive skills. The general idea is about a university professor Zhang, who was initially a leader of the student movement in the May Fourth era and also a member of the Communist Party. Later, he betrayed the students and his thoughts degenerated. By the time of the Northern Expedition, he joined the Wuhan organization after the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and his behavior became even more corrupt, such as playing with female staff and female students. On the eve of "August 13," he suddenly became a staunch supporter of the war of resistance. The play depicts Zhang as a powerful figure behind Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Sino-Japanese war was instigated by this person, etc. The whole play has many so-called gimmicks, all from Zhang's mouth, such as: "Tomorrow I will go to see Chiang Kai-shek!" "Chen Youren discussed with me the recovery of the British concession," "Fourth Mistress call Song Ziwen"... etc. When it was performed in England, the foreigners laughed endlessly.

When a certain playwright told a reporter about the outline of the play, he said with emotion: "Xiong Shi-i's view on the war of resistance is very superficial, as if all corrupt elements can become heroes of the war of resistance once the flames of war are ignited. The so-called Zhang, in the eyes of foreigners, may be thought to have hidden allusions, but according to what we know, there is definitely no such person behind Chairman Chiang today. Xiong Shi-i's "Professor from Peking" is actually entirely for business purposes. He not only does not make favorable propaganda for the war of resistance, but also exposes the weaknesses of the nation, which is very regrettable."

### Wenji Returns to Han

— Xiaotian

"Wenji Returns to Han" is one of Cheng Yanqiu's famous plays, with heavy singing and the best of all plays. Before this, no one had performed it, and after this, the skills of the performers were far inferior to Cheng's, not worth commenting on.

Among the rhythms of singing, the most formal in its form, the greatest in its scope, the most meticulous in its structure, and the one that occupies the greatest importance in the whole play is the slow three-beat. In the last three scenes of this play, there are three long sections of slow three-beat in Xipi Erhuang Fanerhuang sung in a row. It goes without saying how strenuous and noisy it is, so Yanqiu is reluctant to sing it easily. In his previous two visits to Shanghai, every time this play was performed, I would go to listen. When singing the Fanerhuang section at the Tomb of Zhao Jun, he would show signs of declining energy and fatigue. This time, even until the last section of Yaoban, he still had energy to spare, showing Yanqiu's skill has improved again.

The story of this play is only about Cai Wenji being captured in the chaos and forced to marry the Left Sage King, and being redeemed and returning to her country, which is not very interesting. And the emotion of the whole play is only the word "sadness." Being widowed is sad, being captured in the chaos is also sad, living in a foreign land is sad, and returning to her country is thinking of her children. There is nothing that is not sad. Visiting Zhao Jun's tomb evokes a feeling of sympathy for those with similar experiences, so why not be sad? It's easy to act, it's hard to express emotions. It's easy to express alternating emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, but it's hard to express one emotion from beginning to end. Although the sadness of being widowed and the sadness of separation are the same, the feelings that give rise to the sadness are different. Yanqiu seems to have understood this meaning. Can those who study Cheng understand this meaning? Can the audience appreciate this meaning?

There is one scene in this play that I can't quite understand, but there is no other good way to handle it. Yanqiu seems to need to find a way to arrange it to make it more perfect. After Li Jue's army returned to court, the next scene is Cao Cao sitting in his tent, and the time has passed more than ten years. Without reading the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" thoroughly, how would one know the era of Li Jue and Chang Guo and the era of Cao Cao's reign? In a movie, a subtitle could be placed in between, indicating that it was more than ten years later, but this is absolutely impossible in Peking opera. Or the scene with the maid and the two young masters could be moved in between, and then Cao Cao could appear, but I don't know if it would seem disjointed.

### The Eye-Catching Diao Ban Hua in "Yan Xijiao"

### Mei Xi's Way Out

— Liu

After Mei Xi and Xinhua argued over the ranking in advertisements, movie fans generally had different opinions. Some regretted Xinhua's abandonment of Mei Xi, while others thought that Mei Xi shouldn't have protested over such a small matter. According to well-informed sources, Mei Xi had signed a long-term contract with Yihua at the end of last year. He is one of the main characters in the already filmed "Yan Xijiao," and is currently starring in "The Biography of the Martyrs." When Li Qinian comes to Shanghai in two months, he will co-star with Li in a modern and historical drama. From this, it can be seen that Mei had already had a relationship with Yihua a long time ago, and had obtained the consent of Xinhua in advance. As for what his intentions are from now on, we can only wait for the facts to prove it.

### After Watching "Two Worlds"

— Xinggu

After performing "New Mei Luoxiang," the "Zhonglü" troupe performed "Two Worlds," written by Wu Bolao.

"Two Worlds" was once all the rage in the mainland. The plot depicts young people in two different environments doing sacred work. On the other hand, it exposes the shameless ugliness of those who have lost their souls.

Li Jingbo, who plays the unscrupulous merchant Bai Cishan, is extremely skilled in his expressions. Especially at the end, after being scolded by Bai Qinghong, the embarrassing expression that is both funny and sad is very satisfying.

Sun Jinglu, who plays Bai Qinghong, played the role of a child in "Thunderstorm," "The Arms Merchant," and "The True Story of Ah Q." It is said that this is her first time playing an adult role as Qinghong. Her performance in the play is not seen as incompetent. The tragic and passionate confession at the end is so touching. Ge Xin's Liu Jicheng is also very good. Huang He and others are competent.

### National Film News of the Three Major Theaters
After "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," Huguang will first show "Smashing the Nazi Spy Network," followed by "Guan Lingzhang, Loyalty and Righteousness for Thousands of Years," starring Yuanlong. Next, it will be followed by "Yandou Pass," starring Yuan Meiyun. Meiyun has not had any new works released for a long time, and it is expected that it will cause a great sensation.

After "Yue Fei," Jin Cheng will screen "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo." This film is from the hand of Xu Zhuodai, a "lacking in virtue" masterpiece, and the whole film is full of satirical jokes.

The mysterious girl Tan Ying makes her debut in ancient costume in "Pan Qiaoyun," and her appearance is surprisingly beautiful. Wang Yin consistently maintains a tough style, playing Shi Sanlang, who stabs the adulterous woman to death. This film has been publicly screened at the Central Theater in Hong Kong, and its first run in Shanghai will be at the Xinguang.
