Editorial

### The Rumor of France Ceding All Colonies

Yesterday there was a dispatch, said to be from London, stating that all French colonies had been ceded to Germany; the Pétain government had signed a secret treaty of this cession with Germany, in exchange for Germany's support of the Pétain regime; this was the result of France's being threatened, and was a vigorous promotion of a return to agriculture, reducing itself to an agricultural nation, and becoming a vassal of German industrialization; thereafter there would be no more industrial products to exchange with the raw materials of various colonies, and the colonies would become superfluous, and so on. This is a shocking dispatch.

France stopped resisting, admitted defeat, declared its surrender to Germany and Italy, and signed armistice agreements one after another. Whether it can continue to maintain all or part of its colonies has become a question. Assuming that it eventually cedes all of them, this is of course extremely painful for France and France's friends, but it is not an extraordinary surprise; even at the beginning of the surrender, it is not difficult to imagine that such pain may be unavoidable. In the armistice agreement, France was allowed to retain the armament of the warships it needed to maintain its overseas colonies; the significance of this does not guarantee that the peace agreement conditions will not require France to cede colonies. Now is precisely the effective period of the armistice agreement, and the peace treaty has not yet been negotiated; therefore, whether the cession of colonies should be an important part of the peace agreement is also not yet certain, unless there is, as the dispatch from yesterday said, a so-called secret agreement between France and Germany. Assuming that there is indeed such a secret agreement, then during the "secret" period of the secret agreement, France may avoid the serious international impact that could be caused by the transfer issue because the French colonies are ostensibly maintained. Only because the cession and transfer of colonies cannot be carried out in secret like other political, military, and economic issues, it will eventually be made public. On the day of the public announcement, Germany will use the French colonies as a base for multilateral contact with the international community; the international situation at that time is truly difficult to imagine at present.

Whether there is a secret agreement between Germany and France to cede all colonies is naturally impossible for outsiders to determine; but based on the general situation at present, it is better to disbelieve this news. One reason is that it seems a very unusual move for the two countries to conclude any important secret agreement during the transitional period between armistice and not yet peace. The second reason is that Germany's current urgent task is not to seize overseas resources from France first, but to strive for the overall victory of the war. The third reason is that although France has declared its surrender, all its determinations must still shift depending on the extent of the victory or defeat in the Anglo-German war, and there is currently no need to sign this secret agreement with Germany first. The fourth reason is that the so-called French colonies, assuming that a cession issue occurs, then Germany, after gaining overall victory, although has great power of speech, on one hand must take into account Italy, which is fighting together, and on the other hand must take into account the Monroe Doctrine of the United States and the joint declaration of the American countries because of the French colonies in the Americas. The fifth reason is that although colonies are related to industrialism, it does not mean that agricultural countries do not need colonies; therefore, France's advocacy of returning to agriculture today cannot be used as a counter-argument that France is determined to abandon its colonies; moreover, returning to agriculture and emphasizing industry are only relative distinctions. It would be tantamount to obliterating the nature and instinct of natural evolution to say that France or any country in the future is a purely agricultural country. Also, the large-scale measures taken by General Pétain after assuming office this time can indeed be criticized from various perspectives; the thing called "political power," even if it is tempting, often leads people astray, even to depravity; but judging from General Pétain's personality from the past to the present, he is resolute and taciturn, definitely not a glib, selfish, self-serving, power-grabbing, and opportunistic person; therefore, to say that he signed a secret agreement to cede all colonies in exchange for guaranteeing political power, we at least cannot believe it of General Pétain: moreover, the fate of political power, especially political power centered on individuals, its main foundation lies in whether it has the support of the nation and whether it is sound itself. If it fails to obtain national understanding and lightly signs a secret agreement, cutting off territories, to exchange for the support of a foreign country, then its political power foundation is like on a beach, and will be swept away by every wave and will have no guarantee at all. How could General Pétain do this.

In short, after France's armistice and surrender, its colonies and everything else at least have the danger of problems occurring; and it is expected that Germany will definitely gain something after determining its victory; but to say that Germany and France have signed a secret agreement as yesterday's dispatch said, is bizarre and cannot be immediately believed.

### US Navy Secretary to Depart Tomorrow, Inspect Pacific Defenses, to Review US Naval Exercises, First Batch of National Guard Conscripts to Receive Training

Washington: The Navy Department announced last night that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox will depart by plane this Wednesday to personally inspect US Pacific defenses. Colonel Knox will examine important US coastal naval facilities and then make a 5,000-mile transpacific flight, spending five days reviewing US naval exercises. After inspecting naval defenses in San Francisco, the Navy Secretary will fly across the Pacific in a US transport plane to Hawaii for three days to inspect Pearl Harbor and other land-based facilities. Colonel Knox will participate in naval exercises on September 9th and will fly back from Pearl Harbor on time five days later. En route home, the Navy Secretary will stop briefly in San Diego to inspect naval shipyards and naval airfields. At the same time, he will inspect dozens of outdated destroyers currently being repaired. Finally, he will fly to the naval base in San Pedro and return to Washington on September 18th.

Roosevelt Special Train: President Roosevelt yesterday issued a historic order to conscript 65,000 members of the National Guard, starting September 16th, for one year of active training to supplement the manpower of the nation's new defense structure. The President's move is based on the National Guard Enlistment Act signed last Tuesday, which authorizes the President to send the National Guard to any location in the United States, including the Philippines, for one year of military training. However, the President has not yet indicated that the National Guard will be transferred outside of the continental United States. The President also stated yesterday that the strength of the National Guard will immediately increase to 76,000. The President said that the remaining 15,500 members of the National Guard will be recruited from the public soon. National Guardsmen who are married or have obligations to support relatives can be exempted from military service within a few days, and the vacated positions will be filled by newly recruited personnel. Army officials have completed all preparations to accommodate the 60,000 National Guardsmen about to report for training. It is believed that they can not only accommodate them, but also arm and supply another one million men. This one million men can be conscripted once Congress passes the "Burke-Wadsworth" Enlistment Act. It is understood that the bill is expected to be passed by Congress this week. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)

US Congress to Adjourn in Early October, Defense Procedures to Be Completed Early

New York: This morning's newspapers all carried the news of Roosevelt's call-up of the first batch of 60,000 National Guardsmen for one year of training in large print, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of this move in peacetime. Washington dispatches hinted that Congress would complete defense procedures early so that it could adjourn in early October. The conscription bill is expected to be ready in about two weeks and signed by President Roosevelt. Although it was reported that isolationist leader Nye said in a radio debate that the United States' sale of overage destroyers to Britain would be an act of a belligerent nation, today's newspapers again prominently featured a speech by Columbia University President Butler, urging the United States to lead the fight for world freedom. According to a Los Angeles dispatch in the New York Times, General Vorian, who recently returned from Japan, urged the United States to join the war before visiting reporters, arguing that the United States should send pilots, aircraft, and smaller warships to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Roosevelt Special Train: President Roosevelt issued an order last night to mobilize 60,500 members of the US National Guard from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, and various southwestern states to begin military service for one year from September 16th. Roosevelt left Washington yesterday by train for Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he will deliver several Labor Day speeches today. According to Roosevelt's new order, all active and non-active members of the National Guard must report to designated camps. It is estimated that four divisions will report, including active and non-active military personnel. These four divisions will be divided into several teams, each with different responsibilities, mostly eight harbor defense teams, seven anti-aircraft artillery teams, three coastal artillery teams, and four reconnaissance teams. It is reported that the order was formally signed by the President at Hyde Park last Saturday. (International News Service dispatch, 2nd)

Anglo-American Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, US-Australia Joint Defense May Be Realized

Washington: Last night, it was predicted here that an agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom would inevitably be reached, allowing the United States unlimited use of British territories in the Western Hemisphere and the right to establish naval and air bases. Officials said that an announcement regarding this matter could be made at any time. It is said that Anglo-American negotiations are proceeding smoothly and very satisfactorily. It is said that the US's permission to use the British Bermuda Islands is one of the results of the negotiations. President Roosevelt stopped here last night on his way from Hyde Park, New York, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in a special train, and had a two-hour conversation with Secretary of State Hull, which is said to be related to Anglo-American negotiations. This makes it more believable that Anglo-American negotiations have reached the final stage. It is believed that the recently concluded US-Canada joint defense agreement will promote a movement to establish strong naval and air bases in the British territories in the Western Hemisphere, which will not only guarantee the safety of the Panama Canal, but also be combined with the US defense forces' bases along the Canadian and Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America. Last night, certain parties believed that the results of the negotiations between Britain and the United States on allowing the United States to use its territories in the Western Hemisphere will promote the realization of US-Australia joint defense, and said that Congress has now begun to advocate the establishment of a US-Australia joint defense agreement of the same nature as the US-Canada joint defense. Although there is a tendency for the executive branch to favor this movement, the proposal has not yet been submitted. The reason for not submitting it is only because the negotiations between Britain and the United States on territories in the Western Hemisphere have not yet concluded. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)

### US and Canada: Content of Negotiations: Six Points According to Swedish Newspaper

Swedish Capital: Stockholm's "Dagens Nyheter"'s London correspondent reports that there are six points in the former negotiations between the US and Canada: (1) The United States establishes naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, which are jointly constructed and garrisoned by the US and Canada. (2) The US Navy patrols the Canadian coast. (3) The two countries should jointly plan and exchange information on the military situation. (4) Eliminate all restrictions on the transportation of raw materials and war materials from the US to Canada. (5) Transfer US-style destroyers to Canada to compensate for the British bases it obtained in the Caribbean. (6) Restore the plan to transfer safe transportation routes to the United States, so that US military transportation can pass through British Columbia to Alaska. According to the newspaper's opinion, Britain can be free from defending Canada, and can transfer the Canadian warships and troops to other parts of the British Empire, and can send the US warships obtained by Canada to Britain.

### American Newspapers Recount War Situation, Believe British Hopes Are Higher, Praise British Bravery

New York. American newspapers mostly recount the war situation of the past year. General public opinion believes that British hopes are higher. The New York Herald Tribune stated that a year of war has shaken Hitler's victory. The New York Times stated that today's British resistance will prove the fallacy of Hitler's belief that he can conquer Europe and dominate the world. The New York Times' Berlin dispatch stated that last winter already felt difficult, and if Britain still does not succumb this winter, then Germany will be greatly disappointed. The New York Daily News translated a full page describing Hitler's secret weapons, saying they are small boats driven by remote control, carrying explosives with destructive power equivalent to twelve torpedoes.

### American Party Members Unite to Oppose Conscription Bill

Washington. News emerged today that Missouri Republican Congressman Short is currently uniting some members of the Republican and Democratic parties to oppose the conscription bill while it is being sent back to the Senate for a final vote and before it becomes law. People in Congress revealed their strategy, saying that during the debate, they will raise a point, namely that the bill will "plunge the United States into a war against totalitarian countries." Short said that high pressure is currently forcing people to give up this idea, but also said, "I fear the government will eventually be able to pass it." (2nd, International News Service)

### Japan Will Postpone Appointing Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi to Leave Washington Soon

Washington. Authoritative sources understand that the post of Japanese Ambassador to the United States will be temporarily vacant until after the US election in November, and then a decision will be made. Reliable sources say that the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi, will soon leave because the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is adjusting its foreign envoys. An authoritative source also said that Japan's southward policy has been delayed due to the increasingly tough attitude of the United States and the ban on exports. The uncertain outcome of the European war and Italy's incompetence are important reasons for Japan's indecision. It is heard that Japan did not anticipate Britain's strength, so the enthusiasm of the generally more intelligent people for the Axis countries has now diminished somewhat.

### Japanese Newspapers Again Advocate Exclusive Control of Dutch East Indies Resources, Before Arrival of Japanese Economic Delegation, US-Dutch Negotiations Proceed

Tokyo. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Kobayashi's visit to the Netherlands has no specific plan. Future negotiations, such as concluding tariff agreements or commercial treaties, will depend on the attitude of the Dutch authorities. (2nd, United Press)

Tokyo. Today, the Nichinichi Shimbun published an article on the occasion of Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi being appointed as a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies, warning Kobayashi to be wary of the "cunning" of the Dutch. The newspaper carried a special commentary from its Batavia correspondent, which warned that Kobayashi's visit to the Dutch East Indies would certainly be warmly welcomed by the Dutch authorities, but the Dutch authorities would inevitably use cunning means to avoid concluding any agreement that would satisfy Japan. The article also stated that there are more British people than Dutch people in the Dutch East Indies, and they are very hostile to the Japanese. The Dutch East Indies has already concluded various secret agreements with British colonies, and many British military officers have joined the Dutch East Indies army. For example, the landing of 600 British troops in Soembang (transliteration) on the northeast coast of Java in August is an example. The correspondent also stated that the Dutch are also trying to increase friendship with the United States. American journalists traveling in the Dutch East Indies are treated as guests of the state, and they are especially allowed to travel throughout the Dutch East Indies, but this is not the case for Japanese journalists. Japanese journalists are closely watched, as if they were spies, and are not allowed to telegraph to Japan the text published in Dutch East Indies newspapers. The correspondent's commentary urged Kobayashi not to be fooled by the "cunning" of the Dutch, and not to be satisfied with the Dutch East Indies' minor concessions regarding Japan's demands. If he compromises with the Dutch, Japan will gain nothing. The Dutch East Indies is extremely rich in all the natural resources that Japan needs today and in the future. Therefore, Japan has no reason to allow any other country to develop or retain these resources. (2nd, United Press)

London. The Dutch authorities here are waiting for the arrival of a delegation from the American oil company. The oil company personnel departed from the United States by plane, left Manila last night, and may arrive here tonight or tomorrow morning. It is said that the Dutch authorities will hold important negotiations with the American oil company authorities before the arrival of the Japanese economic delegation led by Kobayashi.

### Dutch Ambassador to the US Delivers Speech

Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Dr. Loudon, the Dutch Ambassador to the United States, was invited to speak at Harvard University. Because he was unable to attend the school in person, his entourage read his speech to the public, which stated that no matter what happens later, the Dutch overseas territories will not allow any party to provide undefended protection. This firm determination will not change in the slightest. It also stated that simple news reports from the Netherlands report that the country is broken, deaths are piled up, there are many suicides and killings. The Netherlands has become a tragic country. However, the information from Berlin, so-called Dutch official sources, and already checked letters, say the opposite. They say that the Netherlands has not suffered much damage, the number of deaths is not high, and the Dutch people are happy to cooperate with the behavior of the German leaders. We must know that the Dutch people cannot speak for themselves, and propaganda is the most powerful tool of the Nazis, so what they say cannot be lightly believed. In summary, the Netherlands will eventually rise up to regain what they cherish. (2nd, Reuters)

### German Planes Twice Attempt to Attack London Unsuccessfully, Berlin and Munich Suffer Air Raids, Germany Claims to Have Sunk Two British Warships

London. Today's air raids by British and German forces were very intense. Multiple batches of German aircraft attempted to enter the center of London, but were driven back. British bombers heavily bombed Munich. The German authorities today admitted that British aircraft had carried out an unprecedented large-scale air raid over Munich, lasting a total of eighty minutes. However, they said that the attempts of the British aircraft to reach Berlin had all been repelled. British bombers also attacked multiple German airfields in France last night. (2nd, Reuters)

A town in the Thames Estuary. This morning, British fighter planes and ground anti-aircraft guns twice repelled German aircraft attempting to attack London. At 9:00 AM today, two squadrons of German bombers, guarded by fast fighter planes, appeared over this town, attempting to break through the defenses and attack London. The first wave of attacks was repelled by terrifying anti-aircraft fire that lasted for ten minutes. Not long after this batch of aircraft left, a second wave of attackers, consisting of a total of forty bombers and fighter planes, flew to this place again, attempting to break through the air defenses again. Intense anti-aircraft fire was then fired again. Two aircraft were seen to fall to the ground with smoke. When the German aircraft approached the Thames River, multiple British fighter planes showed their prowess and fought with them. After five minutes of fierce fighting, the German aircraft suddenly retreated towards the sea. The clashes between British Spitfires and German fighter planes, and the attacks by Hurricanes on German bombers, all occurred after the anti-aircraft fire scattered the German aircraft formation. Neither of these two air raids dropped bombs. When the air battle approached the London area, London issued an air raid warning. The people of another town in the Thames River saw a German aircraft fall like a fire dragon this morning. When the aircraft was hit and the tail of the plane rotated over the town, about to fall, the crowd cheered with joy. (2nd, United Press)

Munich. Munich this morning tasted the taste of a long air raid alert amid intense anti-aircraft fire and machine gun fire. The alert began at 11:45 AM and was lifted at 2:05 PM. After the alert began, the anti-aircraft guns and machine guns were actively firing non-stop until the alert was lifted. The losses from the air raid have not yet been officially announced. (2nd, United Press)

London Citizens Calm as Usual

London. This morning, thousands of people serving in various offices suddenly encountered an air raid alert on their way to work. However, they looked calm and eventually continued to their work. The first alert was issued from 8:01 AM to 8:52 AM. When the alert was issued, these thousands of people were crowded in railway stations, buses, and trams, but the vehicles continued to run. These people still calmly went to their offices to work. (2nd, United Press)

London. Hitler launched an attack on London's strong defensive wall last night and this morning with a powerful air force. The explosion of German bombs shook the entire London area. On this anniversary of the tacit war, the city issued a total of three alerts. The three fierce attacks by German aircraft attempted to break a bloody path into the city of London. The Royal Air Force and anti-aircraft fire twice repelled the German aircraft formation, but a large group of Nazi aircraft was able to break through the defensive line of the capital and dropped bombs like rain in a certain area of the city. (2nd, United Press)

London. After a peaceful night, the London area issued its first air raid alert at 7:10 AM this morning, and the alert was lifted at 7:55 AM. According to the Ministry of Aviation, as of 1:00 PM today, British fighter planes had shot down nine German aircraft. German aircraft attempted to break through the defenses of the Thames Estuary, but were repelled by anti-aircraft fire. One of them fell with smoke, and another was also clearly heavily damaged. British fighter planes continued to intercept them, and the fierce battle lasted for fifteen minutes before it ended. The German aircraft did not drop any bombs. (2nd, Reuters)

Intense Air Battle in Southern England

London. This morning, a large number of German aircraft attacked. Intense air battles took place over southern England. According to the Ministry of Aviation, a total of eleven German aircraft were shot down by noon. Four British aircraft were missing, and the pilot of one of them had escaped safely. This afternoon, about two hundred German bombers and fighter planes flew in batches over the southeast coast. Anti-aircraft guns heavily bombarded them. Two of them quickly turned back and flew towards the French coast, seemingly hit. According to reports from observers watching the air battle on the rocks, these two aircraft had fallen into the English Channel. According to news from a nearby area, four German aircraft had been destroyed. At the same time, British fighter planes dispersed German aircraft over a city in the Thames Estuary. (2nd, Reuters)

London. Yesterday, a large number of German aircraft again attacked British and Welsh air stations and arsenals, but were ultimately repelled by the high degree of cooperation between British fighter planes and anti-aircraft fire. Londoners took shelter from German aircraft three times in one day. (2nd, International News Service)

British Air Force Heavily Attacks the Berlin Area

London. According to the Ministry of Aviation Intelligence Office, in the early morning of Sunday, British aircraft attacked Berlin and bombed important military targets. At that time, the visibility was poor, and the entire western area of Berlin was shrouded in low clouds. British pilots occasionally looked down through the gaps in the clouds and were able to determine their position after seeing a lake. Near midnight, a large aircraft engine factory northwest of Berlin was bombed. The places where the bombs landed flashed with light, and then caught fire. At the same time, other British aircraft attacked the power plant in the western part of the city. The flashes of high-explosive bombs falling in the target area were dazzling, and a large fire broke out that could be seen from thirty miles away. Other British aircraft were unable to detect targets in the Berlin area due to heavy cloud cover, so they flew to other places in Germany and the Netherlands to bomb the railway intersection in Hiltrup and the airfields in places such as Liesbüttel. The aircraft factory in Wiesling was also attacked by British heavy bombers, causing fires and explosions. British aircraft also bombed the Bayer gunpowder factory and ammunition loading factory near Cologne, but the cloud layer was low and the results of the battle could not be seen clearly. Airfields everywhere nearby were directly hit. The military factory in Spich was bombed, and fires broke out in several places. That night, British aircraft attacked the Emden shipyard in batches and continuously, dropping extremely large bombs. Although anti-aircraft fire was fierce and searchlights were dense, British aircraft were able to hit the target. According to one pilot, the number of British aircraft flying over Emden at the same time must have made the searchlight team panic. It was obvious that the searchlights could not hold any bomber for a long time to give the anti-aircraft gunners time to identify the target and bomb it. At that time, the ground in Emden was foggy, and the British aircraft's visibility was blocked, so they could not accurately see the results of the battle. The ground was obviously severely damaged. German long-range artillery positions on the French coast were suddenly attacked by a small squadron of British medium bombers. Other targets such as oil ponds near Rotterdam, the oil factories in Cologne and Meckburg, warehouses in Hamm and various industrial areas were also heavily bombed. Only two British aircraft did not return. (2nd, Reuters)

London. While the German authorities are investigating the heavy losses caused by British aircraft bombing Berlin at the end of last week, Berlin again encountered an air raid this morning. The alert was issued at 0:45 AM and was lifted at 1:32 AM. According to a Berlin correspondent for the Swedish capital Nierhets Post, although British aircraft did not appear over the center of the city, the sound of explosions could be heard in the distance. (2nd, Reuters)

Germany Announces the Results of Naval and Air Battles

Berlin. This afternoon, the German military war report stated that German submarines sank two British destroyers in the North Sea. German bombers and fighter planes attacked the British Air Force base of Stinger in southern England. The airfields and buildings in Abingdon, Kinley, Gimsand, Dedlin Hawkins and Lynn were hit by bombs and caught fire in many places. As a result of the British aircraft responding to the battle, German aircraft still had the advantage. Last night, German aircraft bombed the ports of Liverpool, Goose Haven, Bristol and Chatham. Enemy aircraft attempted to attack Berlin and other cities in Germany last night, but the German anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, and the enemy did not succeed. Although some civilian residences were destroyed, no military facilities were lost. In total, the enemy aircraft lost sixty-two aircraft yesterday, of which fifty-two were shot down in air battles and ten were destroyed on the ground. Nine German aircraft were missing. (2nd, Haitong News Agency)

Berlin. This morning, German aircraft attacked military targets in southern England, and air battles occurred. Thirteen British aircraft were shot down, and four German aircraft did not return to their original defense. This afternoon, a small team of German destroyers and fighter planes attacked England again, breaking through several air defenses along the British coast. (2nd, Haitong News Agency)

### British Air Force Launches Large-Scale Attacks on Italian Troops in North Africa, All Italian Airfields Bombed

Cairo. The British Air Force Command here stated that the British Air Force has launched an unprecedented large-scale attack on Italian military targets in North Africa. Yesterday, British bombers attacked various major Italian airfields in eastern Libya. At least four Italian aircraft were destroyed by fire at Al-Mimayr airfield. A violent explosion occurred at the Tobruk airfield, destroying one Italian aircraft. Several others may have been damaged. At the Ghazala airfield, one Italian aircraft took off to respond to the battle, but was destroyed by exploding bombs. Italian fighter planes clashed with British bombers several times, but British aircraft still dropped bombs and hit targets everywhere. After the mission was completed, they all safely returned to their defense. Elitri was bombed by British aircraft on August 30, and several buildings were hit by bombs and caught fire. The British side suffered no losses. (2nd, Reuters)

### British and German Air Force Loss Figures Announced by British Ministry of Aviation

London. According to the figures released by the British Ministry of Aviation, from August 25 to August 31, the German Air Force lost a total of 293 aircraft in air raids against Britain. The number of German aircraft that the British Ministry of Aviation bulletin indicated were almost completely damaged was almost equal to the number that were confirmed to have been destroyed. Most of the aircraft lost by the German side carried many crew members, so the loss of 293 aircraft meant the loss of more than 700 trained aviators. During the same period, Britain lost 113 fighter planes in national defense and 15 fighter planes in air raids on Germany. Sixty-nine British fighter plane personnel parachuted to safety. Therefore, the total loss of British Air Force crew members was about 110 people. Regarding the German General Command's claim that the British side lost a total of 133 aircraft on Saturday and the German side lost 32 aircraft, the London responsible party rejected this claim, saying that the correct figures for aircraft losses in the air battles on Saturday and Sunday were 86 for the German side and 37 for the British side. 25 of these 37 pilots survived unharmed. As far as pilots are concerned, the German side lost about 212 fighter and bomber pilots that day, while the British side lost only 12. The difference in the number of pilots lost by the two sides is very significant, and this is very important because Germany is now gradually feeling the difficulty of replenishing skilled pilots.

### British Children's Liner Attacked by German Submarine, All Children on Board Rescued

London. A British ship carrying evacuated British children was hit by a torpedo fired by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean on its way to Canada. However, none of the children were killed. The ship carried a total of 320 children and some other passengers. Only the ship's accountant was killed. When the children left the ship in lifeboats, they sang loudly. More than 70 of them were mostly wearing pajamas. They disembarked in a port in northern England last night, and some more children are expected to land today. The British Children Overseas Committee officially stated that details are not yet known, but it is known that the ship did not sink after being hit by a torpedo, and the children disembarked to rescue ships in an orderly manner. One of the rescue ships was a warship. The Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions, Shakespeare, welcomed the survivors, saying that their safe return was a miracle. When the group of children returned to England and disembarked yesterday, they were in high spirits as if nothing had happened. Two more batches then disembarked, also in high spirits and without fear. (2nd, Reuters)

### Romanian Crowds Hold Demonstrations Against Accepting the Vienna Award; Romanian Government Orders Restriction of Patriotic Movements; Conflict Between Romanian and Hungarian Troops in Outer Transylvania

Bucharest: Yesterday afternoon, demonstrations were held in Bucharest against accepting the Vienna Award. However, police intervened with armored vehicles and fire hoses, dispersing the crowds and arresting several people. A large police contingent was deployed to guard the large square in front of the Royal Palace, and military police patrolled the streets of the city. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

Bucharest: Interior Minister General Pobegeascu issued an order last night, stating that people are allowed to express their emotions through patriotic actions within three days. After that, all demonstrations and parades will be prohibited, and offenders will be severely punished without leniency. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

Bucharest: Yesterday, Bucharest citizens held large-scale demonstrations against the cession of Outer Transylvania to Hungary. The Romanian authorities are taking precautionary measures to prevent disturbances, almost tantamount to martial law. The Hungarian, Italian, and German embassies are guarded by soldiers and police, and police patrols are conducted in teams on the streets. Yesterday's demonstration took place in the city center and was later dispersed by police in armored vehicles, with several people arrested. During the demonstration, the area around the Royal Palace was cordoned off with ropes, disrupting traffic for several hours. The entire territory of Romania is in a state of unease and tension. Everyone is aware of the seriousness of the Vienna farce. Dr. Maniu, leader of the Peasant Party, will now go to Cluj, the ceded area, and is said to be planning to launch resistance there. Concerts and sports events originally scheduled to take place yesterday throughout Romania have all been temporarily cancelled, and the start of the school year has been postponed by one month. (Reuters, 2nd)

Bucharest: The Hungarian military commission to take over the ceded territory of Romania has arrived in Grosswardein and has decided with the Romanian delegation on the method of takeover by the Hungarian army. The Hungarian delegation is led by General Nagy, while the Romanian delegation is led by General Stanfferi. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

Cluj, Outer Transylvania Province: This morning, Romanian and Hungarian troops clashed in the Romanian-Hungarian border area of Outer Transylvania. Nine Romanian military policemen were killed or seriously injured. The incident occurred because Romanian military police refused to allow Hungarian troops to cross the border near Voitzig, while the Hungarian troops, based on the terms of the Vienna Conference that ceded most of Outer Transylvania to Hungary, were attempting to cross the border. The first group of Hungarian troops crossed the border into Outer Transylvania north of Aredia-Mare this morning. Romanian senior military officials also learned that this afternoon, or even later, Hungarian troops would cross the border to Satu Mare, 100 kilometers north of Aremi-Mare. (United Press, 2nd)

Romanas, Romanian Border: Since the Vienna Conference ruled to cede Romanian Outer Transylvania to Hungary, Romanian troops within the territory began to withdraw yesterday. At the same time, trucks carrying administrative files filled the roads. The Hungarian representative attending the mixed committee arrived here last night amidst a demonstration by thousands of people. Demonstrations also occurred elsewhere. In Timisoara, Romania's second largest city, people gathered in front of the German consulate. It is now known that 30,000 farmers demonstrated in Cluj, the capital of Outer Transylvania, smashing the windows of the consulate and planning to destroy the houses of Italians, but without success. In other parts of Outer Transylvania, actions against the territorial division have also taken place. 10,000 farmers in Brasov gathered in the square and solemnly knelt to swear that they would not cede an inch of land to the Hungarians. Shortly after, Neumann, leader of the German economic delegation, and another German official were surrounded by angry crowds. Although protected by the police and able to drive away, one swastika flag had been torn down. The German travel agency and the German consulate were both stormed by the crowd, and a picture of Hitler was torn up. The political circles in Bucharest are now very concerned about this kind of protest, fearing that the German side will take this opportunity to occupy Outer Transylvania, or even seize the Romanian mainland. (Reuters, 2nd)

Bucharest: The Romanian people have begun to recognize the harshness of the Vienna Award, and riots have occurred in many places. There are reports of protests and demonstrations. Following the large-scale demonstrations in the center of Bucharest yesterday, disturbances continued today, with armored vehicles and police being deployed to suppress them. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations Nearing Conclusion

Bucharest: Representatives from Romania and Bulgaria continued negotiations in Craiova yesterday, with two unresolved issues: (1) financial issues, and (2) the date of transfer of Southern Dobruja. Regarding the compensation for Romanian investments in the ceded area, it seems impossible to resolve, and it may be submitted to arbitration. However, the details are still unknown. It is generally expected that the negotiations will end today, and the draft will be signed no later than tomorrow. (Reuters, 2nd)

Sofia: If Romania does not accept Bulgaria's proposal regarding Southern Dobruja within a day or two, the negotiations between the two countries seem likely to break down. The news of Romania's delay in its decision has caused anxiety here. Yesterday, King Boris of Bulgaria summoned Foreign Minister Popov, and the cabinet also held a special meeting. It is expected that the result will accelerate the final stage of the negotiations. Bulgarian representatives are currently stationed in the border town of Vidim, waiting for the final meeting with the Romanian representatives. (Reuters, 2nd)

### French Forces in Equatorial Africa Respond to de Gaulle; French Colonial Minister Delivers Speech

London: Official sources announced that the French forces in Equatorial Africa have fully responded to General de Gaulle. Governor-General Maison has led the political and military authorities of the colony to stand under the flag of Free France. (Reuters, 2nd)

Vichy: French Colonial Minister Rommel addressed yesterday, commenting on the status of French colonies. He first stated that the governors of Cameroon and New Caledonia were immediately dismissed for disobeying orders. At the same time, he received a report from the French High Commissioner in Dakar, stating that order was peaceful there and that the region was determined to be loyal to the new government. Demonstrations held by French residents did not receive support from the local natives. Rommel declared that the cause of the riots in French colonies was partly due to the restrictions of the armistice agreement and partly due to the difficult economic situation, which caused French residents in the colonies to be not well-informed about the real situation in their home country. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

Stockholm: The Swedish People's Party mouthpiece, Tidningen, reported that French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon, which are no longer loyal to the Pétain government, although not wealthy colonies, are in a position of great military value to Italy's colonies. British troops can pass through them to attack Libya. Currently, Britain has not yet won in the African war. The fall of Somaliland, although not important in reality, is an undeniable loss of prestige. Therefore, it is surprising that the above-mentioned two French colonies joined hands with Britain after the fall of Somaliland. In fact, it was caused by the victory of the British air war. Therefore, this matter proves that Britain will not be defeated by the German blitzkrieg tactics as France was. At first, the above two colonies thought that Britain's failure was inevitable due to the impression of the French surrender, but now they have more confidence in Britain's resistance. The closer approach between Britain and the United States has greatly enhanced this confidence. Britain's loss of Somaliland can be compensated for by the actions of the above two colonies. It is not known whether other French colonies will follow suit. There are already many factual manifestations that not all French territories agree with the Vichy government. Germany and Italy have now accused the newspapers in French North Africa of not being loyal to the armistice agreement. The British troops in North Africa are gradually increasing their strength, and we will probably see a long period of fierce fighting in that area. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Lithuanian Representatives Leave Soviet Union and Return Home

Moscow: The delegation of the People's Committee of the Lithuanian Republic returned home yesterday after inspecting Minsk for several days. The delegation visited Minsk to study the administrative and socialist construction plans of the Belarusian Republic, and also visited factories, children's institutions, theaters, etc. (TASS, 2nd)

Moscow: According to Shaskov, Chairman of the Soviet Inland Waterway Administration Committee, "Since the liberation of Bessarabia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the Soviet Union has added new waterways, such as the vast Dniester, the Daugava River flowing into the Gulf of Riga, the West Neman River, the Embe, Narva, Zha River and Lake Peipus and Lake Pskov in the Estonian Republic. Passenger transport on the Dniester River will begin on September 15 in the Yakto-Pendeli section (200 kilometers), and the navigable distance will gradually increase to 600 kilometers in the future. In Lithuania, shipping will soon begin on the Neman and other rivers. The Estonian inland waterway route totals 600 kilometers. Soviet shipping experts will soon go to Kaunas, Riga, and Zha to inspect the new waterways." (TASS, 2nd)

### British Insurers Offer Air Raid Insurance

London: Lloyd's insurance company is now offering air raid insurance. Insured parties pay a monthly premium of one shilling, and can receive 50 pounds in the event of death or serious injury in an air raid. This plan is very popular. The method is based on large employers selling unrestricted insurance to employees. Anyone employed can be insured regardless of how dangerous their work is, but those serving active duty in the national defense army are not eligible for insurance. (Reuters, 2nd)

European War Talks (1)

### Churchill's Youthful Romance

After Churchill was captured, the natives did not want his life. However, they said to him, even though you are a journalist, we cannot let you run away. We cannot capture a noble's son every day. Thus, he was imprisoned in the prisoner-of-war camp of the National Model School, heavily guarded on all sides. Although he repeatedly said that he was a journalist and demanded release, they said that he had participated in combat and could not be released. So Churchill looked for an opportunity to escape. Fortunately, one night, while two guards were smoking and chatting, he jumped over the wall, passed through the gate, and walked boldly to the street. But this place was still 300 miles away from the neutral Portuguese territory of Delagoa Bay. At dawn, scouts would inevitably be sent out, making it difficult to hide. He was wearing a brown flannel suit, had 75 pounds and four chocolate bars in his pocket. He had neither a map nor a compass; even more impossible, he could not speak a word of Dutch or the local dialect, how could he obtain food or inquire about the route?

Churchill reconsidered what to do if he didn't leave, so he had to grope along the railway line in the dark. After walking for about two hours, he saw the lights of a train station ahead, so he stopped 200 yards away from the platform. After waiting for more than an hour, he saw a train coming. He disregarded everything, climbed onto the coupling, got on the car, and slept in the pile of coal dust all night. Before dawn the next day, he did not wait for the train to stop, but held the iron rod at the end of the car with both hands, and jumped to the ground again. He found some water to drink along the way, and felt that he had not gone wrong. Seeing that the sky was getting brighter, he had to find a clump of trees beside a valley to hide. He didn't start walking until after midnight. People were stationed on every bridge, so he had to go around, pass through bushes and wade through streams, inching forward step by step. Unfortunately, he had lacked exercise for more than a month in prison, and at this time he felt tired as soon as he moved a little.

As he staggered forward, he suddenly saw two or three lights on the left. As he walked closer, he realized that the lights were from the engine room of a coal mine, a two-story building. He first knocked on the door, but there was no response; after knocking for a while, he heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and the door was opened abruptly. This person was very tall, wearing messy clothes, with a pale complexion and a black mustache. He asked Churchill in English, "What do you want?"

Churchill narrated how he encountered danger along the way, how he was injured in a fall from the train, and how he couldn't find his friends, etc., making up a lot of stories. The man looked at him carefully, and after a moment of hesitation, he said, "Okay, come in." Churchill walked past him into the room, thinking, don't let it be a prison again. The man turned on the lamp and put the pistol he was holding in his hand on the table. After a moment of silence, he said, "I would like to hear the details of your train accident again." I replied, "I might as well tell you the truth." He took the risk and said frankly: "I am Churchill, a war correspondent for the London Morning Post. I escaped from Pretoria last night. Now I want to go to the border. Can you help me?" Everyone was silent for a while again. The man slowly stood up, went to lock the door, and then turned around and reached out his hand to him and said: "Thank God, you came here! Within these twenty miles, you would be caught anywhere except in this house. We are all members of the British League, and of course we will make you pass safely."

The next morning, the man told him that the local government had indeed searched for his trail everywhere. After another day, it gradually cooled down. He hid in the cellar for five days, and the man ran over and said to him that on the 19th, a Dutchman was going to load a batch of wool to Delagoa Bay. This Dutchman had no ill feelings towards the British. He wanted to pile up the wool bales into a gap, hide Churchill inside, and smuggle him out of the border with the car, which would be fine.

At 2:00 a.m. on the 19th, the man led Churchill out of the house, where three trucks were waiting. Churchill drilled into the pile of wool in the first car, where there was a gap large enough for him to sit and lie down, and he was also equipped with a pistol, two smoked chickens, a few pieces of meat, a long loaf of bread, a melon, and three bottles of cold tea. Although the journey was only 16 hours, there may be delays along the way, so too much food should not be prepared.

All the way, Churchill was uneasy, fearing that something might go wrong again. After one night, he arrived at Komatipoort, which was already Portuguese territory, and he did not encounter any inspection. Churchill was so happy for a while that he couldn't help but stretch his head out of the pile of wool and cheer loudly. And he fired two or three shots into the air to celebrate his escape. The car drove to the city of Lourenço Marques, and he quietly got off the car and mingled in the crowd. After walking a few streets, he arrived at a house. Churchill looked up and saw the British flag hoisted high, it turned out to be the British Consulate.

Churchill returned to Durban, the port was brightly lit, and the naval commander and the mayor went on board to shake hands with him and congratulate him. He had a very happy St. John's Night there. On June 1, 1900, four days after the British army's attack, it captured Pretoria. On the morning of the 5th, Churchill and a major rode into the city. When he arrived in front of the National Model School, Churchill raised his hat and cheered. The imprisoned British officers and soldiers inside responded to the sound, and then opened the prison door and poured out; on one side, they raised the British flag, and everyone cheered. The Boer War ended here. Churchill soon returned home, and everyone expressed great interest in his capture and escape. From then on, Churchill's name was deeply imprinted in people's minds, which was of great help to him in his political life. At this time, Churchill was 26 years old. He married in the fall of 1908, hoping to live a happy life from then on. However, there are still many troubles. (End of this article)

### First Anniversary of the European War Today; Shanghai International Settlement Remains Neutral; Continues to Maintain International Characteristics; No Disturbances Due to the War

Today marks the first anniversary of Britain's declaration of war against Germany. The state of war began at 11:00 AM British Summer Time (6:00 PM Shanghai Time), because the German government did not respond to the British government's ultimatum to withdraw German troops from Poland. The war between Germany and Poland had been going on since September 1, and many Polish cities and towns, including the capital Warsaw, had been bombed, resulting in significant loss of life.

General Response to the Declaration of War

At that time, the British wartime cabinet had just been formed, and Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In Shanghai, the first reaction to the news of the outbreak of war was gloom and depression. In the British community, there was a sense of relief because they realized that with the outbreak of war, the policy of appeasement had come to an end. France's plan for full mobilization was also completed, and French citizens between the ages of 20 and 49 registered with the French Consulate General in preparation for being called into service at any time. French reserve soldiers of the first level gathered at the French barracks.

Slight Impact on Shipping

Shipping was in a state of chaos. The French mail ship "La Bourdonnais," which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on September 1, was recalled to Hong Kong. It was generally claimed that German ships would not come to Shanghai, but British shipping companies said that the schedules would still be carried out as usual. The entire city of Shanghai was still peaceful. Only one conflict occurred between British soldiers and French residents, but there were no serious disturbances. At that time, officials from the British and French concessions declared that no special precautions would be implemented in their respective concessions as a result of the declaration of war, as they believed that this was unnecessary.

### Japanese Military Police Patrolled Western Shanghai Yesterday; American Units of the 'B' Company Shanghai Volunteer Corps Scheduled to Replace Defensive Duties

After the withdrawal of British troops, the defensive areas they left behind, including the 'D' Zone in western Shanghai, were originally scheduled to be taken over by the Japanese army, but the Japanese side has not yet taken over. However, since the afternoon of the day before yesterday, patrols by Japanese military police have suddenly been discovered in the area west of Difeng Road and the Yuyuan Road area of Jessfield Road in the 'D' Zone. Yesterday morning and afternoon, these Japanese military police teams were still patrolling back and forth. It is understood that the Japanese military police came from outside the railway line. Each squad consisted of twelve soldiers led by a squad leader. The Japanese military police patrolling in 'D' Zone yesterday totaled two times, from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM in the morning and from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM in the afternoon. According to the Pingming News Agency's inquiries with relevant parties, the American unit of the 'B' Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is scheduled to withdraw from its defensive duties at 7:00 PM tomorrow (4th) and be replaced by the British unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Subsequently, it is stipulated that the British 'A' Company, the armored car company, and the light cavalry unit will be on duty in the Hongkou West District for one week, and then the American 'B' Company will be on duty for four days. Because the number of British volunteers is larger than that of American volunteers, the British volunteers will be on duty for one week and rest for four days each time, while the American volunteers will be on duty for four days and rest for one week.

Mr. Anlitde has been in China for thirty-eight years and has made outstanding contributions to developing Sino-American trade and promoting Sino-American friendship. All sectors of Shanghai feel a sense of loss at Mr. Anlitde's retirement and return home. The six groups hosting the banquet yesterday were either Sino-American groups or purely Chinese groups.

### Two Kidnapping Cases Yesterday; One Rice Merchant Abducted; Jin Benren Was Forced into a Car; Lu Youyuan Was Not Taken

Yesterday, two kidnapping cases occurred on the boundary-crossing Bailinan Road in West Shanghai and on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. One involved Jin Benren, the owner of Renfeng Rice Mill, who was abducted into a Xiang Sheng automobile. The other involved Lu Youyuan, a wealthy merchant from Haimen, who was not taken. The bandits were all apprehended. The details of each case, as ascertained through investigations, are as follows:

Rice Merchant Abducted; Partner in a Rice Mill with Some Savings

Jin Benren is from Zhenru, 42 years old, and a rice merchant. He usually operates diligently and is skilled in business, with some savings in hand. He invested with friends to open Renfeng Rice Mill at 323 Bailinan Road and also established a Renfeng Rice Store at 502 of the same road. It has been in operation for years. His family resides in the store. Jin always personally goes to the Qinglian Pavilion Rice Market on Fuzhou Road to negotiate transactions, which is his usual practice. He also always visits the rice mill for inspection before heading east by car.

Bandits Rush Out and Force Him into a Car

At about 10:15 AM yesterday morning, Jin had just stepped out of the store, intending to go to the mill. Just as his car passed the entrance of the Lu Xuezhai Lane, no more than thirty or so storefronts away from the mill, six bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road. Two of them held pistols, aiming at Jin's chest, threatening and intimidating him, and forcibly dragged Jin into a Xiang Sheng automobile that had been pre-positioned by the roadside. The car then sped east, passing in front of the Renfeng Rice Mill and quickly driving away.

Friend Sends a Message; Eldest Daughter Reports to the Police

At that time, Qiu Shunjin, the owner of the Shun Jin Restaurant nearby, witnessed the scene (Qiu and Jin are also acquainted). He immediately rushed to the Renfeng Rice Store to report Jin's abduction. Then Jin's eldest daughter hurried to the police station to report the incident. Jin's abduction yesterday was clearly a case of kidnapping for ransom. It is reported that although Jin has partnered with others to invest in the rice mill and store, due to excessive costs and huge expenses in recent years, coupled with the continuous warfare, his family property has been depleted, and he is not a wealthy man. This abduction may be due to a misunderstanding by the bandits.

Bandits Seize a Xiang Sheng Automobile

As for the car used to abduct Jin, it was seized by the bandits beforehand. Yesterday morning, several people went to the Jiaozhou Road branch of Xiang Sheng Automobile and hired a car. The company dispatched driver to drive car number 843 to take them to a certain place. The bandits then drove the driver out of the car, and one of the bandits drove it himself. The car then headed west to Bailinan Road, kidnapped Jin Benren, and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the driver reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and requested an investigation. It is reported that the car has been found on Gordon Road.

Wealthy Merchant Escapes; Wealthy Merchant from Haimen Resides in Shanghai

At 12:35 PM yesterday, an attempted kidnapping occurred at No. 1 Avenue Albert New Village on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. According to investigations, Lu Youyuan, a gentleman from Haimen, 49 years old, originally resided in his hometown of Haimen and had a wealthy family. After the outbreak of the war, he could not stay there for long and brought his family to Shanghai, residing at No. 1 Avenue Albert New Village. At 12:35 PM yesterday, five people suddenly arrived in a black-plated car No. 385 and drove to the entrance of Avenue Albert New Village.

Four People Arrive Suddenly Seeking an Audience

Four people got out of the car, two wearing light-colored suits, one wearing a white silk long gown, and one wearing a white short shirt. They knocked on the door and said they had important matters to discuss with Mr. Lu. Lu was in the bedroom upstairs at the time. A servant went upstairs to inform him that someone was seeking an audience. Lu, knowing that the visitors were uninvited and suspecting something was amiss, instructed the servant to inquire about the details and what the matter was. The servant then went downstairs again to ask for their names one by one. Unexpectedly, the one wearing the white short shirt became impatient and, in a threatening manner, tried to go upstairs himself. Fortunately, the servant stopped him.

Maid Alertly Sneaks Out to Report to the Police

Another female servant, seeing this situation, knew that these people were definitely not good, and took the opportunity to sneak out from the back door to report to the patrolman in that alley. The patrolman, lacking firearms, feared he could not confront them and urgently reported to the patrolman stationed nearby. The patrolman immediately notified the French garrison on Fulu Li Road and requested that they call the police station. Several French soldiers rushed to the scene to assist in the search and fired two shots as a warning. The bandits inside had already seized Lu and were about to drag him downstairs when...

Detectives Gather; All Are Arrested

Suddenly hearing the gunshots, they knew they were exposed. They rushed downstairs, attempting to escape, but realizing the situation was unfavorable and that it was difficult to escape, they fled into No. 556 Avenue Albert to temporarily hide. At this time, the French police station had dispatched a large number of detectives, arriving in three armored cars, and surrounded the No. 556 house and the surrounding area. Several detectives bravely entered and searched the premises. As a result, all five bandits were captured on the spot, and the car was also taken back to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, the servant said that one of the bandits seemed to be named Shen Pengsan, who was a fellow villager of Lu, but they had not seen each other for a long time and did not know why he was leading the bandits to kidnap him.

### An Overseas Chinese Compatriot from the Philippines' Impression of Shanghai: An Open Letter to This Newspaper

Yesterday, Mr. Li Pingying, an overseas Chinese compatriot from the Philippines, sent a letter to this newspaper, expressing his immense disappointment and curses towards Shanghai. After reading it, we found that we could not deny a single sentence, because what he said was all facts. Only overseas Chinese compatriots returning from abroad can see it so clearly. Readers should chew on these candid words and be alert!

Editor of Shen Bao Newspaper, I have lived in the Philippines since I was a child, and I have always received local education. I know very little about the situation in my motherland, and I am even more unfamiliar with the Chinese language. I dare not show off my skills and make a fool of myself. However, uncontrollable emotions forced me to take this path, so I can only scribble this letter to you in black and white. Although there are no brilliant words or superb theories in this letter to satisfy you, every word and sentence is the crystallization of my bitter tears!

I have long admired the greatness and prosperity of Shanghai, and I have always wanted to see Shanghai's demeanor to fulfill my lifelong aspiration. Finally, a few days ago, I arrived in my motherland's embrace from the distant South Seas like a child, hoping to tell this mother-like homeland about the pitiful fate and miserable experiences of overseas Chinese. But I am disappointed, completely disappointed. Not only is the motherland not as kind and lovely as I imagined, but it is also like a ferocious demon, wanting to throw the lives of every compatriot into a fiery pit at all times.

Although I have only been in Shanghai for a week, all the evil phenomena in Shanghai have filled my entire mind. I cannot help but write it down as a farewell memento and my feelings about this trip.

"Dance girls and wild chickens" are more numerous than carps in the Huangpu River. What guides, halls, salted meat, and whatnot, bizarre and dazzling. The women's market seems to have become one of the most prosperous businesses in Shanghai. After asking the local elders, I learned that countless Shanghai residents rely on their daughters for a living. Although these words are too unfair to Shanghai compatriots, the manifestation of facts makes me suspicious!

"Hotels and dance halls" are everywhere. The degree of their extravagance is rarely seen in major cities around the world. Alas! The heavy calamities Shanghai has suffered in the past are still deeply etched in the hearts of every Chinese person. Moreover, Shanghai compatriots have witnessed countless martyrs shedding blood for freedom and sacrificing themselves for the nation. How should they strive to be energetic, frugal, and endure hardship to assist in the completion of the war of resistance and national reconstruction? But the reality is not so. They are infatuated with singing and dancing, moving towards destruction in a drunken stupor. How can this not be heartbreaking!

Following the advancement of extravagance is the arrival of various crimes and killings. Therefore, kidnapping and assassination incidents occur several times a day, almost turning the entire Shanghai into a terrifying slaughterhouse. In any corner, there is the possibility of encountering danger and death; especially for me, who has just returned from overseas, I have become much thinner because of it.

"Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, corpses freeze to death." This sentence can be said to be a sketch of Shanghai society. Indeed, on the one hand, Shanghai is brightly lit, with melodious singing and dancing, but in another realm, there are cries of sorrow everywhere, and starving corpses block the roads. They cannot eat when hungry, cannot wear warm clothes when cold, and their poverty is extremely miserable. Alas! They are all Chinese compatriots, but their circumstances are so different, more than heaven and earth? We can see that the guests in dance halls and hotels are so crowded and extravagant. Why are there so few people who give alms to these poor people?

Tomorrow, I want to leave Shanghai and go to the inland, because I hate everything in Shanghai. I curse Shanghai's compatriots, and I don't want to stay in this devil's cave any longer. However, the broken walls and debris in the lost areas, the bullet holes and scars, and the emaciated and starving shadows and cries on the streets will forever be active in my heart.

I am not a writer. I don't know how to modify or embellish. I can only present my naked heart to you. If you think it is worth publishing it in your newspaper, then I will be infinitely gratified. Because in this way, it can let the intoxicated compatriots in Shanghai know the curses of overseas Chinese towards them! That's all. I wish you good health. Li Pingying

September 2nd, at the Shanghai River.

### Shanghai Market: Winter Clothing Donation; Various Industries Actively Raise Funds; Individual Donations Also Very Enthusiastic

Since the National Fundraising Association promoted the fundraising of 10 million yuan for this year's winter clothing donations, all sectors of Shanghai have responded enthusiastically. It is learned that various industries have actively raised funds, referring to past practices. Factories, companies, and businesses in various industries have participated enthusiastically, and individual donations are also quite enthusiastic. It is expected that the 500,000 yuan for winter clothing donations will be raised in full as scheduled.

### Searching Pedestrians, Firing Guns to Stop Cars; There Were Japanese Military Police in the Car; Mutual Explanation Resolved the Misunderstanding

At 12:40 PM yesterday, when the patrol team of the French Concession Police Department was searching pedestrians on Avenue Albert, a car was heading towards Fulu Li Road. They immediately ordered it to stop, but the driver did not understand the intention and continued to drive forward. A patrolman fired a shot into the air to warn him. The car stopped, and it was found that there were four plainclothes Japanese military police officers in the car. After the two sides explained the misunderstanding, the matter was resolved.

### Father Jacquinot to Return to Shanghai This Month

Father Jacquinot, the person in charge of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, has been stranded in Hong Kong for two months. He has cancelled his trip back to his country and plans to return here soon. According to reliable information obtained by the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, Mr. Jacquinot is scheduled to come north by boat in the middle of this month and participate in refugee relief work at that time. Chinese and foreign friends in this city will sincerely welcome him.

### British Troop Transport Ships Without Naval Escort; All Departed Shanghai Southward Successively; Heading to Undisclosed Ports

According to the "Shanghai Times," the report that several troop transport ships carrying British troops withdrawing from Shanghai were gathering a few miles outside Wusong, waiting for British warships to arrive to escort them south, was denied by British naval officials yesterday (the 1st). It is said that the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Haosheng, Desheng, Yisheng, and Yongsheng, which carried troops leaving Shanghai, have been taken over by the British government and converted into troop transport ships. They are all sailing south independently without naval escort. The first ship sailed out on August 23rd, heading directly to an undisclosed southern port. The remaining ships are carrying troops and setting sail about every two days.

### Inter-Provincial Remittances Among Five Provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui; Can be Handled by Shanghai Branches According to Convenient Domestic Remittance Methods

The local banks of five provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui, namely Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, Anhui Local Bank, and Fujian Provincial Bank, have established the Joint Inter-Provincial Remittance Office of Local Banks of the Five Southeastern Provinces to invigorate local finance and strengthen the connection between the banks. The general office is located in Shangrao and is handled in accordance with the convenient domestic remittance methods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, each bank collects the subsidiary currency of each bank for each other. Those who remit money from Shanghai to various provinces can entrust the Shanghai branch or the Shanghai office of each bank to handle it.

### Shanghai Garbage Decreases by One-Fifth; Population Decreases by 500,000

Since the prices in Shanghai have soared, most of the poorer people have been unable to maintain their livelihoods, so they have all gone to the inland to engage in all kinds of rear-area work. According to statistics from the concession authorities, the population of Shanghai has therefore sharply decreased by 500,000. In the past year, the rental of vacant houses in the concession has been very rare, but now it is not as serious as before, and it can be freely rented. According to the French Municipal Council, the garbage collected within the boundary in July this year was 19,976 cubic meters, with an average daily cleanup of about 644 cubic meters, while in the same period last year, it was 25,135 cubic meters, with an average daily cleanup of 810 cubic meters. This further proves that the population has decreased, and the amount of garbage has also decreased proportionally.

### Industrial Safety Training Class Still Has Vacancies

For the sake of industrial safety and to instill industrial knowledge, the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council previously decided to continue to hold the "Industrial Safety and Knowledge Training Class" free of charge, and registration procedures were held at the West District Health Branch on the evening of August 30. At that time, those who went to register were quite enthusiastic. Those who were admitted included 62 foremen and coppersmiths from 27 machine and iron factories. It is learned that the class still has 20 vacancies. Iron factories that manufacture machinery that want to send their employed coppersmiths and foremen to participate in training can quickly send the names of the relevant people by letter to the Industrial Section No. 602, Municipal Council, No. 209 Jiangxi Road to register, and instruct them to go to the Health Branch at No. 435 Rue Robert (Grand Self-Ringing Bell) at 7:00 AM on September 6 to report.

### High Tide Season Has Arrived; Autumn Winds Swept Tightly Last Night; The Tail of the Hurricane Passed Anqing and Disturbed Shanghai; Wusong Dike is Feared to Collapse and Break

Outside the mouth of Wusong, the sea tide has risen high recently, and the sky is filled with dark clouds, as if there is a wind and tide phenomenon. The lighthouse of the Pao Taiwan Customs has special signals to warn navigation. Yesterday, low-lying areas such as Yizhou Tang and Zhanghua Hamlets in Wusong have been flooded by the sea tide. However, the section of Beishidong Wuyuedun in Baoshan has not been repaired for three years since the fall of Shanghai, causing a lot of damage to the wooden piles and stone masonry, and the soil has also become loose and subsided. If there is a flood, it is feared that there will be a collapse. Although Chuan Xiaoan has repeatedly sent people to investigate the dangerous situation and survey the construction, there is still no news of repair.

Wind Passes Anqing

According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Xujiahui Observatory, after the hurricane landed in Fujian, it turned north, crossed Jiangxi and entered Anhui, and had reached 31 degrees north latitude and 117 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, still advancing north, with the center within 60 nautical miles. According to the above-mentioned direction, the hurricane has passed Anqing, southwest of Nanjing. According to the Nanjing Meteorological Report at 6:00 AM yesterday, there was already a force of six winds locally, and this city also had a force of four winds, both affected by the hurricane's wind wings, causing the weather to be uncertain.

Another Hurricane

According to the Observatory report, another hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached 19 degrees north latitude and 135 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, heading northwest, with the center within 120 nautical miles. According to the hurricane's progress, if the direction remains unchanged, Shanghai will be seriously threatened again.

Navigation Resumes

This time, this city was spared from the typhoon attack yesterday. The customs office took down the black ball, the second typhoon signal, which was hung at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, at 5:30 AM yesterday. The navigation warning in this city has been lifted, and import and export ships have resumed. Taikoo's Hai (Mouth) Zhejiang, Jardine's Fusheng (the report yesterday mistakenly wrote Fousheng), and other ships have been exported yesterday. The American President Lines' President Pierce was on time to Shanghai yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 2:00 AM this morning (i.e., midnight last night) to return to the United States via Japan. It is learned that loading and unloading of goods is not enough, and it has been changed to depart at 12:30 PM today (summer time). The last small passenger boat will depart from the new customs wharf at 11:00 AM today. Java Company's new mail ship Zhizha Lianjia will arrive in port this morning and berth at the Puxi Lansancong Wharf. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yusheng and Taikoo Company's Taiyuan and Qiongzhou are expected to arrive today. The Shengjing, which came from Qingdao yesterday morning, returned to Qingdao to take shelter from the hurricane at sea and may not be able to arrive today.

Wind and Rain Attack Together

Yesterday morning, the weather in this city was affected by the hurricane wind wing that reached southwest of Nanjing. From 1:00 PM, it rained heavily until late at night. At the same time, the wind was also quite strong. From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM yesterday, the autumn tide of the Huangpu River suddenly broke out again and was lifted by the wind, so the amount of water was quite large. Low-lying roads all had tide water coming out, so the accumulated water in the rain had no way to drain away. The two combined, and the roads were flooded, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Yinghua Street, Guizhou Road, Alabast Road, and Saposai Road, all with half a foot of water. Valuation Association Sends Another Letter to Various Agencies for Group Rice Purchases

### Evaluation Increases; Public Opinion Boils Over

The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee sent letters to the relevant agencies and organizations yesterday, allowing them to forward letters to various industry associations and major factories and businesses to jointly promote group rice purchases, so as to avoid large quantities of rice from being manipulated and monopolized by speculative rice merchants. At the same time, it makes the rice on the market fresh and unpopular, and the rice stocks in the rice warehouses can also increase sharply. It not only relieves the pain of individual citizens but also stabilizes social order. It is heard that the above four agencies and organizations decided to act accordingly after receiving the letter.

Rice Prices Fall Back

The Rice Bank Tea Market opened as usual at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. The market was full of spot goods. Large households not only stopped selling but also took the opportunity to make a large profit from the rice they had hoarded. At the same time, the rice companies had weak appetite, and the customer base was also sluggish. As a result, the price fell sharply by about one yuan compared to the previous market. Except for the Saigon No. 1 rice station, which set the original price, the price of foreign rice at other stalls seems to have gradually entered the 60 yuan range. According to the Market Management Committee, it is because the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping has been confirmed to have resumed.

Evaluation and Discussion

Recently, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee consulted and decided to uniformly increase the price of various rice types by two yuan, which caused public opinion to boil over and the public to be agitated. It is generally recognized that at this time when everything is expensive, if the price of rice is increased again, the lives of citizens will be even more difficult, and the Evaluation Committee's tolerance of the price limit is unnecessary and has no solid reason. Therefore, all are eagerly looking forward to the relevant authorities to stop it and re-evaluate the price of rice to relieve the suffering of the citizens.

### Pu Lanxi Resumes Duties After Recovery

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Pu Lanxi, the Deputy Director of the Police Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, who was attacked and injured by thugs on the morning of the 27th of last month, has now fully recovered and went to the Police Department today (the 2nd) to resume his duties. According to Pu, on the 27th, he was riding in a car to the Police Department. When the car came out of the gate of his residence on Lafayette Road, he was attacked by six thugs who opened fire. Pu immediately got out of the car and returned fire, shooting and wounding one of the thugs. He himself was also wounded in two places, in the left buttocks and shoulder, and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He was discharged from the hospital a few days ago and returned home.

### Thugs Ride Without Tickets, Brandishing Weapons as Threats; Ticket Inspection and Compelled Ticket Purchase Result in Violent Assault; Glass Windows of Three Public Buses Destroyed

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," shortly after 8 PM one evening, at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road within the Shanghai Western Public Concession, sixteen thugs wielding handguns and hand grenades violently assaulted a ticket inspector of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company public bus line, and

Maliciously Smashed

the glass windows of three public buses belonging to the company, causing passengers in the vehicles to be frightened and perturbed. The thugs' violent acts lasted for approximately ten minutes. Neither Public Concession police nor "municipal police" were seen on the scene. It is reported that this area was previously within the British military's defense zone. In the past week, British troops have been successively withdrawing from Shanghai. Residents in the area deeply fear that with no British military to defend and a lack of adequate police protection, similar incidents of

Violent Behavior

will soon reoccur as they did last night.

According to eyewitnesses, the thugs initially boarded a public bus on Great Western Road going towards Columbia Road, but did not pay their fares. A ticket inspector on the bus compelled them to purchase tickets. The thugs then drew out handguns and hand grenades, ordering the bus to stop. Several of the thugs disembarked first, while the remaining ones repeatedly assaulted the ticket inspector. Fortunately, he

Did Not Suffer Serious Injuries.

After disembarking and carrying out their violence, the thugs, not satisfied, smashed the bus windows. Simultaneously, two other public buses coming from the opposite direction were also stopped and had their windows smashed by the thugs. The thugs did not rob or loot, seemingly satisfied with frightening the passengers. Finally, they brandished their handguns and hand grenades, yelling and rushing into the countryside beside the road and disappearing.

### Murder Case Occurs on Qujiang Road, Hongkou; Brothel Owner Stabbed to Death

At around 6 AM one morning, a man, approximately thirty years old, was discovered lying in a pool of blood in front of the Korean Kindergarten near the Guangdong Street railway line on Qujiang Road, Hongkou. The ground was stained with blood, and he was already dead. Upon receiving the news, Japanese Consulate police rushed to the scene. Examination revealed that his entire body, from shoulder to back, was covered with knife wounds. His clothing was soaked in blood, turning purple. There were signs of considerable resistance before his death. Investigation revealed that he was Chen Yiqing, the owner of the "San Duo Li" No. 6 brothel. His wife, Wang Xiaomei, resided at No. 1, Lane 254, Chuan Highway. Chen habitually returned home from "San Duo Li" No. 6 around 3 AM every night. On this particular night, between 3 and 4 AM, while Chen was returning home from "San Duo Li" No. 6, the murderer lay in wait and stabbed him. After achieving their objective, they immediately fled without a trace. The details of the case are currently under investigation.

### Three Robberies Occur in Hongkou District the Day Before Yesterday; Police and Robbers Engage in Gunfight on Zhoushan Road

The day before yesterday afternoon, three robberies occurred in quick succession within two hours in the Hongkou district. In one of these incidents, police engaged in a gunfight with the robbers, resulting in multiple injuries. The details of each incident are described below:

First Incident: The incident occurred at a rice shop located at No. 261 Zhoushan Road. At around 8:30 PM the previous evening, five robbers broke into the shop, each wielding a handgun, attempting to loot the premises. At that moment, someone in the shop urgently reported the incident to the responsible police station. A large number of police officers quickly arrived at the scene. The robbers, realizing the situation was unfavorable, immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The police officers immediately returned fire. Two of the robbers were struck by bullets, one seriously injured and one killed. Another one was also arrested. The remaining two robbers escaped in the confusion without a trace. Subsequently, the police officers sent the injured robber to the hospital for treatment and conducted a thorough search for the two escaped robbers. Both of the escaped robbers were also injured, so it is believed that they will be apprehended without difficulty.

Second Incident: This occurred near Hansbury Road. Shen Quanlin, a rice merchant from No. 328 Nanxun Road, was walking in the area when he was suddenly accosted by three robbers who threatened him with weapons. They robbed him of all the legal tender, $155, and Japanese military scrip, $85, that he had on his person, then left triumphantly. The victim later reported the incident to the responsible police station requesting pursuit and arrest.

Third Incident: This occurred at No. 4, Lane 423, Kunming Road, the residence of Huang Jiacheng (age 40). At around 10:30 PM the previous evening, five thugs suddenly rushed into the house, pointing handguns and forbidding any outcry. They then looted all the valuable metal jewelry, clothing, and other items from Huang's residence, totaling over ten items. The estimated value at the time was over $3,500.

### Letter

To the Editor:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Mr. Zhang Zuwang, who claims to have read the article titled "(Sugar Merchant Abandons Paramour After Seduction; Paramour Demands Support)" in the local news section of the September 2nd issue of "Shen Bao". He states that the content is inconsistent with the facts. He has never had any relationship with Miss Xi, there has never been any cohabitation, and there is no possibility of having a daughter or being pregnant. Furthermore, the statement that attorney Yu Bingwen came forward to mediate is also untrue. Miss Xi's attempt to seek mediation from the court involves false accusations and lacks factual basis, clearly intending to damage our client's reputation and motivated by ulterior motives. He requests that you send letters to various newspapers to correct the record, etc. Accordingly, we are writing to you on his behalf, requesting you to publish this letter to clarify public perception and maintain professional courtesy. Sincerely, "Shen Bao" Office, Attorneys Li Baosen and Yu Bingwen.

### Bao Da Silver Shop Privately Melting Silver Coins; Prosecuted Under Regulations on Obstructing the Currency System; Manager and Accountant Detained Pending Investigation

Bao Da Silver Shop, located at No. 46 Yongkang Lane, No. 175, Alabaster Road, is owned by Xu Changfa from Shaoxing, with Shao Qida (also known as Yongchuan) from Shaoxing serving as manager and Xue Jinfu (also known as Zhilin) as the accountant. The shop also rented a portion of the remaining space in the Yu Tai Ironworks at No. 19, Lane 725, Yu Qiaqing Road, to use as a

Melting Location.

Recently, the New Zhabei police, including Chinese detectives Xu Shutian and Gong Youwei, discovered that the shop was exclusively collecting various old-style silver coins for melting, which violates the regulations on obstructing the currency system. Accordingly, at 11 AM on the 1st of this month, they rushed to Yu Tai and found four people from Shaoxing - Yu Yusheng, Wu Rongbao, Xia Jicai, and Feng Changfu - melting silver coins. They were arrested and $91 in double and single-dime silver coins were confiscated.

Following the Interrogation,

the police went to Bao Da Silver Shop and apprehended Shao, Xue, and another silver furnace owner, Wang Changgen. They confiscated $51 in Mexican silver dollars, a total of $139.50 in five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent silver coins, and 14 silver ingots weighing a total of 218 pounds, and 7 lead ingots weighing a total of 73 pounds. They confessed that the silver dollars, etc., were melted on behalf of Yu Yonghe Silver Shop on Fujian Road. The detectives

Rushed to Investigate,

but Yu Yonghe denied it, only claiming to have entrusted them to melt over 150 taels of silver utensils, but now nothing is being melted. The owner of Bao Da, Xu Changfa, had gone to his hometown and could not be located. Yesterday morning, the police sent Shao and Xue to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court, and the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them under Article 20 of the Regulations on Obstructing the Currency System. Shao and Xue jointly hired attorney Hang Shijun to defend them. Under

Interrogation, All Defendants Jointly Confessed

that the silver ingots, etc., were melted from old silver utensils collected by the shop owner from Huzhou. The confiscated silver coins, etc., were collected to be exchanged for cash at the Central Bank. Attorney Li argued that further investigation of Yu Yonghe was necessary, so he requested permission for a postponement. After questioning by Judge Liu Yugui, the defendants were ordered to be detained pending a further hearing.

Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC list showed that the pound sterling did not move, and the US dollar continued to shrink by one-two-five, changing to five yuan one-eight-seven-five. As for the situation in the domestic market, it was mediocre and quiet. Operators were mostly observing the market, and speculators were both entering and exiting. Non-bank businesses supplied a considerable amount. Foreign firms had some transactions in rice and cotton, so the market wanted to loosen but stopped. After opening in the morning, the US dollar once rose to five yuan three-seven-five. The noon close was still flat. The after-market was initially quiet, then slightly softened. Finally, it closed steadily due to the balance of supply and demand. The gold exchange for March was three pence five-four-six-eight-seven-five, unchanged.

It is estimated that the gold exchange eased only zero-one-five-six-two-five, and the US dollar difference was only zero-three-one-two-five.

Transactions in Foreign Rice and Foreign Cotton are Still Strong

Initially in the morning, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was unchanged, and the exchange rate for Shanghai was also flat. There was no market for the exchange rate for France. The exchange rates for the Central Bank were as before. The selling prices for spot goods when banks opened in the morning were three pence five-six-two-five for gold and five yuan two-eight-one-two-five for the US dollar, which was zero-one-five-six-two-five longer for gold and zero-three-one-two-five harder for the US dollar compared to the closing price on Saturday of last week. Afterwards, South China speculators came to sell, and the market became quiet and loosened. It is estimated that non-bank businesses absorbed US dollars at a price of five yuan three-one-two-five, with the longest reaching five-three-seven-five. The HSBC list revealed that the pound sterling was unchanged, and the US dollar was tighter by one-two-five, changing to five yuan one-eight-seven-five. After this, Chinese merchants were already inclined to buy, and the potential was stable. It is estimated that American banks sold US dollars for May at five-three-one-two-five to non-bank businesses and speculators. Later, foreign firms also had some transactions in rice and cotton, and the balance between buyers and sellers meant that prices did not rise or fall significantly. It is estimated that foreign firms collected US dollars for October from Mai Jia Li at five yuan two-five, and for November at five yuan one-eight-seven-five. Near noon, American banks and non-bank businesses traded US dollars for September all announced five yuan three-one-two-five. The closing price was three pence five-six-two-five for gold and five yuan three-one-two-five for the US dollar, which was flat for the British pound and longer for the US dollar by zero-three-one-two-five compared to the morning opening.

### Profit-Taking Emerges: Gold Market Weakens

Yesterday, the spot gold market saw a sluggish and bearish trend, with price increases proving difficult to sustain. Despite fierce competition between buyers and sellers, prices fluctuated around 6,150 yuan. This was mainly due to a slight shift towards bearish sentiment, a stable foreign exchange market, and the re-emergence of rumors about peace. Traders generally sold more than they bought, leading to a price decline. The market opened at 6,160 yuan, and briefly rose by 20 yuan due to initial purchases by securities firms. However, as foreign exchange reports showed stability, gold shops and money changers took profits, causing the price to fall to 6,105 yuan. Subsequently, buying interest waned, leading to mixed price movements. The market closed at only 6,148 yuan at noon. After the close, the market showed slight strength, but sentiment weakened again in the afternoon. Despite continued buying by securities firms, which briefly pushed the price up by more than 10 yuan from 6,150 yuan, gold shops and small money lenders resumed aggressive selling, driving the price down to 6,125 yuan. However, support from retail investors allowed the market to close at 6,155 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan compared to last Saturday. Total trading volume was approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged, while customs gold prices remained stable.

Spot Gold Drops 55 Yuan

Since morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially weakened due to concerns about a strong foreign exchange market. In addition, weekend trading had already been light. Gold shops initially sold 30 taels to silver shops at 6,160 yuan. Subsequently, sudden buying by securities firms briefly triggered a rebound, with securities firms trading among themselves 20 taels at a high of 6,180 yuan. However, as foreign exchange reports continued to show stability, few buyers were willing to pay high prices. Furthermore, many bullish silver and gold shops took profits, and a certain money changer aggressively increased short positions, fueled by some negative news in the market. As a result, the price soon fell by 75 yuan, with money changers selling 20 taels to gold shops, pushing the price down to 6,105 yuan. Fortunately, short sellers covered their positions at the low price, and gold shops reversed their positions, buying instead of selling. The price soon rose again to 6,170 yuan. Later, money changers and others resumed short selling at the high price, and gold shops again sold heavily, causing the price to fall back to 6,105 yuan before the close. However, sentiment improved before the close, and silver shops resumed taking long positions, allowing the market to close at 6,148 yuan. After the close, silver shops continued to buy, with off-market trading reaching 6,170 yuan. Trading opened weakly in the afternoon, with money changers selling 10 taels to gold shops at 6,150 yuan. Subsequently, buying from securities firms and others pushed the price up to 6,165 yuan. However, selling by silver and gold shops made it easier for prices to fall, reaching a low of 6,125 yuan. Later, selling pressure eased, and silver shops began buying, with gold shops also following suit. As a result, the market closed at 6,155 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan compared to last Saturday. After the close, the market initially strengthened before stabilizing, trading at 6,165 yuan at one point. However, someone was willing to sell at 6,160 yuan at the end. The entire day saw fluctuations of 75 yuan. Current prices at cash shops were more than ten yuan higher than spot prices, while purchase prices were 30 yuan lower. Current gold prices were more than fifty yuan lower than listed prices, with few transactions taking place.

Jewelry Gold Prices Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang continued to list the price at 630 yuan per tael. Xin Tong Hang's prices were similar to the previous day, with purchase prices reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Sharp Decline in Foreign Exchange Notes

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw spot prices decline. Both British and American gold pounds fell by a small amount of one yuan each. There were still a few transactions in British gold notes, and market prices remained stable. American gold notes experienced erratic fluctuations, ultimately falling by a small amount of six cents. Hong Kong notes also fell by one cent. Demand for Japanese gold notes decreased significantly, leading to a sharp drop in market prices. The evening market retreated to 1.675 yuan, a sharp drop of 14.5 cents compared to last Saturday. Korean notes followed the downward trend, retreating to 1.08 yuan in the evening market, also a small drop of six cents compared to last Saturday.

### Food: Inferior Imported Rice Used to Supply the Market

With ample inventory and supply exceeding demand, the high price of imported rice, which had been artificially inflated, finally met resistance yesterday, despite the support of the Evaluation Committee. However, large merchants and hoarders continued to hold firm, refusing to sell. As a result, yesterday's market price for high-quality imported rice, such as No. 1 Saigon Siam rice, remained at the high level of the previous day, without any reduction. Instead, they sold inferior rice at discounts ranging from 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, hoping to deceive buyers. Rice merchants are adept at such deceptive tactics. Original bags from the British-Chinese Company have been heavily manipulated by speculators in recent days, who are engaged in so-called "scalping" and "hot potato" tactics. However, actual sales remain sluggish, and large merchants are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Without new hoarding efforts, the market cannot sustain its high prices and inevitably declines. No. 2 Siam rice, which opened at 72.5 yuan per bag including shipping and insurance last Saturday, was only 70.4 yuan yesterday. The price for rice including shipping and insurance was 70 yuan yesterday, compared to the previous opening of 72 yuan. Re-exports were priced at 69 yuan and 68.5 yuan yesterday, a sharp decrease of 2.5 yuan. Small-grain Saigon rice and broken rice remained unsold due to a lack of demand. Total cash rice transactions amounted to 7,000 to 4,000 bags, while original bags accounted for only 360 to 370 tons.

Although the arrival of Japonica and Glutinous domestic rice remained limited, prices had already been driven up sufficiently. As a result, rumors circulated that both official and unofficial markets were following the bearish trend of imported rice. With few transactions, prices fell by one yuan per shi. Changbang white Japonica was priced at 71 yuan, Wuxi Qing Japonica at 70 yuan, and Changzhou Su Kun Japonica ranged from 68-69 yuan for high-quality rice to 66-67 yuan for inferior rice. Nangang original bags of fresh early rice were priced at 69 yuan, and 65-66 yuan per hu. Jinli special-grade glutinous rice was priced at 66-67 yuan, Changdan rice at 64-65 yuan, Hong Kong special-grade glutinous rice at 66-67 yuan, and ordinary glutinous rice at 64-65 yuan. The supply of Zhoupu new Japonica remained limited to 30-40 dan, and prices were affected by other types of rice, falling by 0.5 yuan to open at 66 yuan.

### Newly Arrived American Flour Transferred to Northern and Southern Ports in Large Quantities

The price for No. 2 flour from the flour mills remained at 15 yuan, with sales mainly concentrated in the local area. The price for No. 1 flour from the flour mills also remained at 15 yuan, with sales mainly concentrated in the local area. As mooncakes became popular, various tea and food shops increased their orders. However, due to transportation difficulties, out-of-town transactions were sluggish, and the market was calm. However, the Phoenix brand of Japanese flour, which is subject to speculative interest, saw prices decline due to a drop in rice prices and a shift towards bearish sentiment, falling by 3-5 cents to 1 dime. Spot flour opened at 14.47 yuan, September flour at 14.85-14.9 yuan, and October flour at 15-15.09 yuan. Only slightly more than 5,000 bags were traded.

Furthermore, news has emerged that a large quantity of newly arrived American flour from the previous month, such as brands like Pao Tai, Double Eagle, and Rising Sun, has been re-exported to northern and southern ports. The estimated amount is no less than 100,000 bags. As a result, American flour on the local market has become relatively scarce and profitable, with prices reaching 17 yuan. Ordinary grades are priced at 16.4-16.5 yuan, with some local merchants acquiring small quantities.

The wheat market is trending towards a stalemate. Due to a recent reduction in domestic arrivals, flour sales have been relatively active. Various mills appear eager to purchase, and the Fu and Fu mills briefly lowered their prices by 0.5 yuan, purchasing 300-400 bags of wheat from nearby Kunshan and Nanxiang. This has further fueled hoarding by merchants. However, Japanese mills are focusing on purchases, acquiring 2,000-3,000 bags daily at prices around 21 yuan. The market remains difficult to expand.

### Securities: Ample Speculative Funds Make Public Debt Difficult to Sell Short

The securities gray market saw a sharp rise in the morning, followed by a gradual weakening. It is generally believed that the initial rise was due to the easing of the coastal defense situation, while the subsequent decline was due to rumors about the Shanghai concessions. However, this is not entirely the case. The recent rise in public debt has continued for a week, with prices increasing by 2-3 yuan. This inevitably led to profit-taking by bullish investors, a common tactic among speculators, and has no relation to the overall trend of public debt. Investors are holding firm, and the abundance of speculative funds, as a result of the lack of profitable opportunities in foreign exchange and the excessive rise in gold prices, is a rare phenomenon in recent months. The repeated rise in gold prices, coupled with a decline in premiums, proves the abundance of speculative funds. Public debt is still trading at 523 discount, and investments can still yield more than one point of interest. Political stability and rising market prices are still factors to consider. Therefore, this correction triggered by profit-taking has failed to push down the closing price of the previous day, demonstrating the strength of market sentiment. The market may consolidate for a day or two before reacting to other news and resuming its upward movement. Renchang Xie and Da bought aggressively yesterday morning, while Hong Da, Jiu Feng, Heng Kang, and Zhen Kang also made purchases. Market prices continued to rise, with Class C bonds reaching a high of 3.65 yuan. This triggered profit-taking by bullish investors, with Defu, Tong Kang, Xinfu, Heng Fu, and Datong selling varying amounts. The difference between high and low prices was 0.35 yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu and Heng Kang sold even more aggressively, and Hong Da also switched to selling. Lianyi also made some sales. It was cheaper to buy Class A bonds and sell Class C bonds at No. 41. Heng Fu initially sold before buying back in, pushing down market prices by a small amount of 0.02-0.03 yuan. However, buying by Lianhe, Jiufeng, Tongkang, Hu Heji, and Le Mao stabilized the market. As a result, with the exception of Class A bonds, which fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, the remaining bonds rose by 0.02-0.075 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 1.6-1.7 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 13 yuan per share.

Yesterday, the stock market was booming, thanks to stable political news over the weekend and strong performance in the New York market. Industrial stocks were strong from the beginning, with Jardine Matheson, Ewo, British American Tobacco, and Ye Guang consistently rising. Trading volume was substantial.

Rubber stocks trended downward due to unfavorable news that the transfer of profits from Singapore and Java would be subject to new regulations. It is reported that local agents have telegraphed to inquire about the situation, and it should not be difficult to verify the truth. While Singapore and Java companies should be commended for their efforts in contributing to the war effort, they must fulfill their fair share of responsibilities. However, it is hoped that their contributions will not be as substantial as rumored, as this would significantly reduce the dividends for rubber stocks compared to those paid in 1937 and 1938.

### Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Reopening of Shanghai Air Defense Line Boost Yarn Prices - Accumulated Yarn Stocks Remain a Concern

The yarn market is trending upward, with bullish sentiment emerging. However, actual transactions remain mediocre. Speculative sentiment is largely bullish, but in reality, it is driven by short-term profit-taking. However, rumors are circulating that the Shanghai air defense transportation line will be reopened, which has fueled speculative buying and pushed up the market. However, accumulated yarn stocks have exceeded 300,000 bales and continue to rise.

The spot yarn market opened with a peaceful atmosphere, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 972 yuan. This was due to a stable foreign exchange market, calm gold prices, and peaceful sentiment. However, sudden rumors of the reopening of coastal defense transportation lines caused a surge in speculative buying, pushing the market gradually up to 994 yuan. At this point, some leveraged bulls sold their positions, causing the market to fall back to 988 yuan at closing. Total daytime trading volume was 2,935 bales, with Double Horse yarn rising by 18 yuan. Yong'an Factory offered 700 bales of 20-count special Jincheng yarn at a price of 950 yuan, which was sold out in one week. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:

Traders: 2,375 bales Hong Kong: 535 bales

Domestic: 70 bales Total: 2,935 bales

Brazilian Cotton Trading Active

Spot cotton trading remains subdued, with limited demand from factories. Shenxin has made some minor purchases, but they are only a small addition. Therefore, there have been no significant price changes.

Pengjiapu: 210.00 Shenxin Purchase: 200 bales

Huo Ji Hua: 154.50 Trader Purchase: 240 bales

Da Zhong Ji: 205.00 Also: 209.00 Also: 130 bales

In other news, New York cotton futures closed higher by 2-3 points due to a lack of sellers and improved stock prices on Wall Street, as well as purchases by some traders. Indian cotton rose by more than 2 rupees, including forecasts.

Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has been relatively active in recent days. Inventory is declining, and there has been strong demand for long-staple cotton. As a result, trading in Brazilian cotton has been very active. However, the market is facing a shortage of long-staple cotton, and traders who have stocks of this type of cotton are currently reluctant to sell.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Market Transportation Resumes; Shortages Push Up Prices

Domestic Cloth: The market trend was slightly firmer yesterday, as transportation to Hong Kong resumed and freight transportation along the Shanghai-Ningbo line increased. The outflow of goods from Shanghai has become slightly more active, and confidence is growing. Prices for some short-supplied goods have increased by around 0.25 yuan per piece. Over 500 pieces of gray fabric were traded on the local market. Traders from Hong Kong purchased 200 pieces of bleached, dyed, and printed twill and coarse cloth. Traders from Zhejiang and Fujian continued to make sporadic purchases. Traders from Yunnan purchased 200 pieces of blue cloth. Merchants from Singapore and Siam purchased over 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Traders from the northern route of Yantai purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and wool cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, merchants from the northern route of Yantai purchased 300-400 bales of fine cloth such as colored balls. Due to seasonal factors, the demand for mid- and low-grade fine cloth has been gradually increasing in the local dyeing market, and the market atmosphere has become tighter. The trading of Longtou fine cloth has been particularly active since the market opened after the holidays, with the afternoon closing price at 32.75 yuan. Sijunzi Serge was priced at 0.93625 yuan.

### Oil Market: Crude Oil Rises Again; Reports of Peanut Flooding

The soybean oil and peanut oil market saw prices rise due to reports that peanut production areas had been affected by flooding. Some owners secretly took long positions, creating an optimistic atmosphere. There were more buyers than sellers in the market, and prices tightened again by 0.5-1.5 yuan. A total of 30 pieces of crude Jiaozhou oil were traded at 64 yuan, and 1,150 pieces were ordered for delivery from the first half of September to the second half of October at 62-63 yuan. 100 pieces of crude Yantai oil were traded at 62.5 yuan, and 230 barrels of crude Qingdao oil were traded at 89.5-88.5 yuan, with 170 barrels ordered for delivery from the second half of September to the first half of October at 88.5-87.5 yuan. In addition, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingdao soybean oil at 70 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at 70 yuan, 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 98.5-97 yuan, and 200 dan from Dayouyu Factory at 76.5-75 yuan.

In addition, 350 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Tianjin today.

### Sugar Market: Diao Qing Rises by One Yuan

The sugar market was flat yesterday, with limited trading. The Association's settlement price for current spot goods was 77.5 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses, and 76 yuan for March old goods. Taikoo car white B mark was slightly tighter at 77 yuan, DY mark was 73.5 yuan for September delivery, and Dutch red was 63 yuan for goods arriving on September 17. The accumulation of domestic Diao Qing sugar has been increasing, and Jianbang opened with 131 bags at 66 yuan, a rise of one yuan. It is reported that production prices are also tight, and there is currently a lack of arrivals, suggesting that the market may need to consolidate again in the future.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Expected to Rise

The price of Hainan dried longan has fallen repeatedly since the arrival of new crops due to abundant supply, falling by more than 35% compared to the initial market. According to letters from customers, production prices have tightened, and prices are expected to rebound by 10-20 yuan. Therefore, it is expected that prices will rebound in the official market today.

### Coal: Limited Outlets for Bituminous Coal Dust

Bituminous coal dust has seen limited demand recently as most factories in the city have suspended operations. Public bathhouses and tiger stoves also have access to discounted coal dust, making business difficult for local coal dealers. As a result, prices have struggled to rise. The price for Kai Ping No. 2 dust is 125 yuan per ton, Keelung dust 110 yuan, and bituminous coal dust 112 yuan. These prices are all wholesale prices for fellow dealers, with a small markup added when delivered to customers.

### Silk and Tea: Black Tea Firm, Green Tea Quiet

Yesterday, local firms such as Hong Lai and Jin Long Haoshi Men continued to purchase black tea. However, due to limited raw material inventory and insufficient supply, the market trended upward. The green tea market remained sluggish, with the export market to the United States still intermittent. The total volume of black and green tea traded throughout the city was just over 260 boxes. Black tea was sold at 285 yuan and shrimp eyes at 270 yuan. Black tea appeared to be performing better than green tea. The hardware trade has suffered significant losses in the past two days due to rain. The Benchang nails and other iron products purchased by Yantai merchants have been unable to ship out due to the continuous autumn rains. In addition, the goods ordered by local merchants have not been loaded onto vehicles. The imported nail market was initially sluggish, but has seen renewed activity in the past day or two due to purchases by Yantai merchants, with prices gradually rising. The current price for Bess nails is 48 yuan per barrel. It is reported that 600-700 barrels have been traded in the past two days. As a result, the new market is also seeing increased prices. Certain nail factories have been actively purchasing raw materials in anticipation of increased demand after the autumn season. Although there is a large inventory of Benchang nails in Shanghai, a strong sales performance would inevitably lead to a shortage, so they are taking this opportunity to acquire raw materials, causing new market prices to rise to around 50 yuan per dan.

### Medicinal Herbs: Clove Market Stable

Arrivals of cloves have been steady recently, gradually creating a situation of oversupply. The previous market price was 420 yuan. While merchants are asking for the original price for newly arrived goods, various firms are taking a wait-and-see approach and making few purchases. It is rumored that the price has fallen by a small amount of 10 yuan, but no transactions have been made.

### Knitwear: New Sanitary Shirts and Pants

As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, sanitary shirts and pants have been launched on the market and are being purchased by out-of-town merchants. However, due to increased raw material costs and manufacturing expenses, prices are 40-50% higher than in previous autumns. For example, the Zhongshi Luoxiu colored men's shirt (No. 320) produced by Wuhe Factory, which previously sold for around 20-30 yuan per dozen, is now selling for 54.5 yuan. The Jizi (No. 200) free-collar men's shirt produced by Zhenfeng Factory, which previously sold for 24-25 yuan per dozen, is now selling for 54.5 yuan for colored shirts and 57 yuan for all-white shirts. Prices for cotton-wool shirts and pants and woolen gloves have also increased.

Old News Rehashed, 76 Years Ago (495) (From the Shen Pao of the Twelfth Year of the Late Qing Dynasty)

### Opening and Closing of City Gates

Liu, Acting Provincial Administration Commissioner of Jiangsu Province, hereby issues a public notice: Shanghai is a district where people from all corners gather, and merchants are concentrated, making it easy for criminals to mingle. The opening and closing of the city gates, established for the purpose of local defense, are set at fixed times. However, due to interactions with foreigners, there are often instances of people entering and exiting the city late at night. Therefore, various government offices have established counter-tokens. Even commissioners are allowed to apply for a permit to open the city gates when they have official business. Currently, due to local unrest, strict inspections should be enforced. In the future, all city gates must be opened and closed on time. Except for counter-tokens and permits, no one shall be allowed to pass through. If there are urgent official documents from outside that cannot wait until the next day, the city defense officers shall send someone to accompany the messenger in order to ensure caution. In addition to instructing the Right Battalion to relay these instructions to all city gate officers for compliance, and ordering all commissioners to conduct strict inspections at all times, this public notice is hereby issued. All soldiers and civilians are hereby ordered to comply and not violate these special instructions!

Reconstruction of Memorial Arch

Behind the screen wall of the Shanghai County Government Office, there is a stone memorial archway dedicated to Xu Wending, a former prime minister of the Ming Dynasty. Due to years of disrepair, it is in a state of damage. This year, the area was affected by a fire, and the stone beams were burned, with temporary wooden pillars used as support. However, this area is a thoroughfare, and any unforeseen circumstances would have significant implications. His descendants have gathered and agreed that the matter concerns their ancestors and must be addressed as soon as possible. They are currently planning to assess the wealth of each clan and collect donations to rebuild the archway.

Anecdotes

### Churchill and Cigars

– Xiao Yun

On August 30, the Associated Press published a short piece of European war news in Western newspapers, stating that British Prime Minister Churchill, while inspecting an airfield on the southern coast of England the day before, happened to be attacked by German aircraft. As Churchill was about to enter an air-raid shelter, he habitually lit his usual large cigar. The local mayor saw this and rushed forward to stop him, saying, "Sir, smoking is prohibited here."

"Alright," Churchill replied, stubbing out the cigar under his foot and saying lightly, "A good cigar wasted."

Although this is a minor incident, it contains considerable meaning and lessons. This story demonstrates the British spirit of public service and law-abidingness. Even high-ranking officials can humbly obey public regulations, without looking down on the advisor because of their lower status, or becoming embarrassed and angry at being reprimanded by a subordinate.

Although this spirit of public service and law-abidingness is taken for granted, it requires considerable cultivation and a sense of humor.

Personalities

### Past Events

– Huan Jun

The burden of life has pressed down so heavily that my father, already in his sixties with white hair, has to go out to work every day, preventing him from resting for a few years. This makes me, as his son, truly feel uneasy.

Every evening, my father returns wearily, the wrinkles on his kind face seeming to deepen every day. As he drags his heavy steps past me, and I look at his stooped back, he seems much older than before, and I can't help but sigh deeply, my heart breaking.

My father's profession is indeed noble and difficult. Every day, he strains his throat and shouts with all his might, his face turning red with bulging veins, while the reward he receives is truly meager. But he is not discouraged or complaining, as if he lives for education.

Late at night, people have long gone to pursue their sweet dreams in comfort, but my father cannot sleep. He has to grade the students' compositions. My father is sloppy about anything, but when it comes to grading compositions, he is never vague. He can grade two or three books an hour if they are quick, but when the writing is poor and incomprehensible, he cannot grade one book in an hour. This is hard on the old man, who rarely gets a full night's sleep all year round. Sometimes I wake up to find my father still sitting stiffly under the dim light, working. I really can't stand it and can't help but say a few words: "Father! You should save some energy. Isn't it faster to just grade them casually? Even if the students have a day of success in the future, they won't necessarily remember your kindness."

"I don't think so. I have been a teacher for more than 30 years and have never neglected my duty for a single day. It seems that education is my second life. Unless I am dead, then I have to give up everything; otherwise, as long as I exist, I will do my best to fulfill my duties."

No one can deny what my father said, but I can't bear to see him keep doing this.

"Yes, Father! We should do that... but you are already old and can't do what young people can do. You have to take care of yourself."

My father's expression didn't change at all. He still said in a firm tone: "Indeed, I feel that my physical strength is declining, and my spirit is far from what it used to be. Sitting for too long will make my whole body ache; but I still have to hold on to these old bones, even if it exhausts my energy. I will never sell my conscience and do something that would mislead other people's children."

After he finished speaking, he continued to bury himself in work, as if he wanted to squeeze out all his brainpower to grade the students' compositions as thoroughly and carefully as possible, deliberating almost every word and every sentence, and never letting anything go lightly.

Looking at my father like this, and at the thick stack of papers on the table, I felt a surge of sadness and couldn't help but cry under my quilt.

My father taught for more than 30 years, and there must have been at least two or three thousand students. Now that my father has been dead for six years, who among those who have been taught by him can still remember the kind and dedicated teacher who once loved them?

War

### News Soldiers

— Historical Talk

Reading German war reports, no matter which photograph or anecdote, the signature P.K. is always affixed below; what does that mean? I suspect very few people know. In fact, that is the abbreviation for "Propaganda Troops."

Since the outbreak of this European war, front-line reports signed P.K. have been continuously sent back to Germany. For the German people, this has become the sole symbol of battlefield realism. Why? Because reports signed P.K. are by no means desk-bound creations. At the same time, photos marked with the two letters P.K. are definitely not forgeries retrieved from photo albums. P.K.'s works are produced amidst the war. The person writing this news is neither a journalist of the past nor a photojournalist. They are soldiers, just like their comrades fighting on the battlefield. It is not inappropriate to call them news soldiers.

The mission of these "news soldiers" is to enable diligent farmers, housewives, teachers, laborers, salaried workers, etc., in the rear to directly and concretely understand how their sons or brothers are struggling in hardship, thereby gaining their empathy and completing the nation's total war effort. Therefore, the members of P.K. all feel that they bear the aforementioned heavy responsibility.

In every combat unit, there are bound to be some propaganda troops assigned. Even in the navy, any small submarine has propaganda troops on board. They exist in the units that are attacking Paris with surprising mechanical speed, they also act in concert with the heavy artillery units that break through the strong Liège fortress, they also lurk in the submarines attacking British naval ports, and they also ride in the planes bombing London and Fada. Braving the danger of pursuer planes and anti-aircraft guns, they inspect the appearance of battle and disseminate their country's soldiers' experiences to the rear and the people. This kind of work is completely different in nature from the momentary front-line visits of military journalists from newspapers. Even if they come to the front line, newspaper reporters customarily produce those things imaginatively at the desk of the headquarters, with their backs to a warm stove. The work of the German P.K. troops cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

Today, the German propaganda troops, in essence, are a group of soldiers. They are no longer like the battlefield correspondents of the past, who were employees of a newspaper or publishing house. They do not work for employers, nor do they receive compensation from employers. They work for the country. They do not write articles or take photos for money. They are purely soldiers. Therefore, their works are not provided to newspapers or publishing houses but are sent to the Central Affairs Bureau. The Central Affairs Bureau then distinguishes the nature of various materials and distributes them to research institutions or uses them for proper propaganda. At the same time, they are also sent to newspapers and government authorities in neutral countries.

The origins of P.K. members are almost entirely journalists and news photographers with military status. From the perspective of their professional talents, they are of course able to handle the mission they bear with ease.

### Plant Infectious Diseases

— Chemical Times

There is a kind of plant, such as potatoes, tobacco, etc., that often develops an obvious disease with tan and white spots on the leaves that resemble patterns. This disease is called "Mosaic" and is infectious. Someone transplanted a diseased young sprout onto another plant, and that plant also contracted the same disease. The juice from the diseased plant was squeezed out and applied to another plant. After an incubation period of six to fifteen days, this plant also contracted the disease. Some people say this is a bacterial disease, but no organic microorganisms can be found. The juice from the diseased plant remains toxic even after clarification.

The American Tang Lai, after four years of effort, discovered a liquid in the diseased plant that has properties like protein and can become crystalline. Therefore, people know that this is not a living organism. One eight-hundred-thousandth of a gram of this liquid in a tobacco plant will also cause the disease after a few days, and it can be endlessly transmitted to other plants.

Today, some people believe that plant infectious diseases are caused by a kind of fermentative substance, but most people say it is the effect of microfungi. If heat or preservatives (such as gasifiers) are used, this source of disease can be eliminated. This has become an indistinguishable boundary between living and non-living things, which is very worthy of biologists, doctors, and bacteriologists to manipulate.

Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Six: Dangerous Experience

Hawthorne rested his right leg on his left knee, leaned back in his chair, and exhaled another puff of smoke before speaking. He said slowly, "My experience, if you want to add any comment, can be said to be dangerous, coincidental, and a failure."

I said impatiently, "Don't be headless. Explain it clearly."

Ni Jinshou also nodded secretly there, clearly expressing extreme agreement with my rebuke of Hawthorne.

Hawthorne smiled slightly and began to say, "Okay, I will speak with a head and a tail. After you followed Yu Gantang into the elevator, I continued to talk with Brother Jinshou for about two or three minutes, and then this mess happened—Bao Lang, you also have to take some responsibility for this matter. You wanted to listen to my conversation, didn't you open the glass door of the telephone room? Therefore, the sound of my conversation was transmitted outside. Inadvertently, I suddenly saw a person suddenly squatting down in that aisle, quickly raising his right hand close to his chest. Bao Lang, you always know this is the most accurate posture for firing a gun.—"

Ni Jinshou asked anxiously, "Then, did you see him firing the gun?"

Hawthorne shook his head. "No, I only saw that person in this posture. I hurriedly bent my knees and squatted straight down. With a bang, the bullet had penetrated the glass. The telephone receiver in my hand naturally slipped. There was only one shot, and he probably thought I had been hit. In fact, if his aim had been half an inch lower, or if my movement at that time had been half a second slower, I would probably be going to that not-so-interesting place at this moment, accompanying the dance queen to wait for Dr. Bai!"

I saw Ni Jinshou staring at Hawthorne without blinking. The muscles on his face seemed to be threaded with iron wires. Although I didn't have a mirror myself, my expression must not be far from Ni Jinshou's. But Hawthorne was still calm as usual, as if what he was talking about was not his own experience, but some kind of "Qi Dong Ye Yu" style story. I urged, "Did you see the person who fired the gun? Who?"

Hawthorne exhaled another long strand of smoke. "Don't be impatient. This is the danger. Now let's talk about the coincidence. This coincidence is divided into two points; first, the person who fired the gun was also encountered inadvertently. Bao Lang, do you remember when we were talking to the No. 71 room attendant on the seventh floor of the Asia East, there was a grand and pretentious bureaucrat-type guy with glasses approaching us from the east end of the aisle?"

I replied, "Very clear. That guy was very tall, wearing a dark blue robe, a brown felt hat, and had some short whiskers on his lips." (95)

Entertainment Circle

### Solitary Island Drama Talk

— Wei Wei

Gai Jiaotian is Old but Vigorous

After Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang's contracts expired, the Xin Xin Stage invited famous actors Gai Jiaotian and Shen Manhua to perform. The reporter went to see a performance on the 29th of last month. When they arrived at the theater, "Catching and Releasing Cao" was being performed on stage. The person playing Chen Gong was Gao Xing'an, who was actually Gao Jingmin, who had previously performed at the Tianchan Theater. He was full of sheepishness and had a poor voice, so there was nothing brilliant to say. After "Catching and Releasing Cao", there was Shen Manhua's "Yu Tang Chun". Shen is a proud disciple of the famous actor Jiang Miaoxiang. She comes from the old capital and has quite good skills. In general, Manhua's art is actually above Zhang Junqiu and Chen Lifang's generation. Only Manhua is a

True and Correct Qingyi

Her repertoire may not be as extensive as that of Junqiu and Lifang. However, since Chen Delin and Wu Caixia, there have been few talents in Liyuan who are true and correct Qingyi. Manhua's true and correct Qingyi can also be said to be a rare find. Her singing and recitation in "Yu Tang Chun" performed that day were excellent, and her tunes all follow Mei. Manhua once received guidance from Lanfang. When singing the "Huilong Tune" of "My Lord," Manhua supported herself on the ground with one hand, creating a beautiful figure that other actors do not have. After the trial was over, when Su San stood up, she used her hands to support her legs, feigning soreness, which was a bit too much. Judging by intent, Manhua may be able to sing but not act, but her appearance is not unpleasant either. The main show was Gai Jiaotian's "Evil Tiger Village". In recent years, Gai has performed five dramas, each with a

Lonely Peony Regret. This time, Xin Xin invited Gai to perform, borrowing the painted face Wang Fusheng from the Gong Stage and the spoken jump Xu Youtian from the Carlton. These two are both good at performing martial arts dramas. One played Wu Tianqiu and the other played Wang Liang that day, maximizing the beauty of the green leaves of the peony, adding a lot of color to the whole drama. Gai Jiaotian is old but vigorous, and his hands and feet are as agile as before. The whole drama is full of highlights. The most attractive ones are: (1) A small round arena when he comes out of Evil Tiger Village and pulls the horse back to the shop. His body matches the gong and drum beats perfectly, which is very good to look at; (2) When walking on the edge, he recites the four sentences "Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are supreme," first using "Luodi Thirteen," followed by two consecutive "flying kicks," which are neat and tidy, and wonderful to the extreme; (3) The scene of snatching the knife during the fight, and fighting against his opponent, is seamlessly connected.

Perfectly seamless

In addition, such as "Falling Luan Belt", "Showing the Bottom of the Shoes" and the "Appearances" when going up and down the stage, there are minor beauties. Nowadays, when people watch dramas, they often like to use "Beijing Style" and "Shanghai Style" as a basis. Seeing Gai Jiaotian, there is no need to make a distinction between Beijing and Shanghai styles. In fact, among the martial arts students in the old capital today, there is no one who can match Gai Jiaotian's skills. Gai Jiaotian truly raised the eyebrows and exhaled for the actors in Jiangnan.

### Impressions of "Love and Death"

— Mu Tao

Li Xiaqing Guest Stars as Aviator

In the profit-oriented Hollywood companies, they often rely on special occasions to make certain films in order to achieve business purposes. This film, "Love and Death", uses the story of an American woman who grew up in China and became a Chinese citizen falling in love with a foreign man, inserts a stubborn medical professor, and then uses some opportunities of the Chinese war of resistance to form it. There is nothing wonderful in the content, and there is a lack of justice in the meaning, so the value of this film is not as high as ideal.

Although, the technique of this film is quite weak. The director is Frank Bouchage, who directed "Till We Meet Again", "Green Jade", etc. His skills are brisk and powerful, fluent and profound, and can give people an indelible impression. Therefore, half of the success of this film must be attributed to the director. The most exciting parts of the film are several surgery scenes. The director uses the expressions on each person's face, the sound of the clock, and the blood transfusion shots to strengthen the tension in the air, which can be considered a slight success. Other aspects, such as introducing Andre's appearance, depicting Dr. Forster's harsh nature, and the progress of Andre and John's romance, also have wonderful techniques. However, the scene at the end where John is seriously injured by bullets in China has been cut out due to location and time constraints, so after John saves a Chinese refugee child, it is followed by the scene where Dr. Forster receives a letter about John's injury, which inevitably makes the audience somewhat confused and also weakens the power of the final climax.

Loretta Young plays Andre, a Chinese woman, and there are not many scenes, but she fits the personality quite well. She speaks five or six sentences in Chinese, which are still audible, but there is always a bit of a foreign accent, which is not very pleasant to the ear. The several sets of Chinese clothes she wears are also very different from the qipaos of modern Chinese girls today. Akim Tamiroff plays Dr. Forster, and his acting is skilled and can be called a success. John Howard plays John, and although the role is competent, he lacks facial expressions and has no wonderful achievements.

Li Xiaqing, a Chinese female aviator who guest stars in this film, also plays a female pilot, and there is only one shot where she only says one sentence in Chinese. In a music short film before the main film, American famous singers Les Hitester, etc. sing popular songs, which are very pleasant to listen to and worth watching.

### "Experimental" Concert

— Tan Fu

The Experimental Music Society's third and fourth concerts will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 9 pm on the 5th and 6th. This time, the choir participating in the performance has about forty or fifty people. They will sing more than twenty works from seven countries, including Farmer's Song, National Song, Iron Refining, and Spring News. The conductor is Mr. Chen Gexin. In addition to the choir program, there will also be orchestral ensemble and accompaniment, violin solos, and bass and soprano solos.

The programs for these two concerts are arranged differently; some songs are repeated, and some can only be heard once. Captain's Song, Farmer's Song, Fire Plow March, National March, Golden Floating Clouds, Shepherdess's Song, Firefly, and Lullaby will all only appear once, and it is said that after this time, the program will be completely replaced with new ones.

The Shanghai music scene is quite lonely. "Shiyin's" move is, of course, something that must be introduced to every music lover.

After "Love's First Dream", "Kirin's First Dream", "Kirin Sending a Son" and "Little Baby", the Universal child star Babe Santhie has completed "Little Sister", which is scheduled to be released at the Cathay on the 4th of this month.

### Overseas Chinese in San Francisco Build a New Radio Station

— Yangtze River

American residents in San Francisco have recently often received a strange singing music and speeches when listening to wireless broadcasts. They cannot understand these programs and are all speculating about this strange broadcast sound.

It turns out that overseas Chinese in San Francisco have built a radio station, call sign KSAN, broadcasting various programs every night. According to Mr. Dong (Mr-Sam S.S. Tong), the program director of the station, Chinese and American businessmen have shown great interest in the station's broadcast programs, and the past results have been very satisfactory.

The 20,000 overseas Chinese currently residing in San Francisco and the thousands of overseas Chinese in central California are very happy to listen. In addition, overseas Chinese in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Chicago, and the east coast of the United States can also listen to these Chinese music and speeches to slightly relieve their deep longing for their motherland.
