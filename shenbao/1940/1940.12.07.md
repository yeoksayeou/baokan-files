### New Developments in the International Situation: China Actively Prepares for General Offensive; Japan Reorganizes Army for a Desperate Southern Advance; Chinese Government Strengthening Political and Economic Institutions

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Sino-Japanese situation seems to be entering a temporary standstill, awaiting new developments in the international arena. The signing of the treaty by Japan has dispelled all hopes for peace talks between Japan and Chongqing. Although there have been repeated rumors of such talks in the past, it seems unlikely that anyone will pay attention to them in the future. Well-informed Chinese observers have expressed the opinion that when Konoe was determined to assume the premiership for the second time on July 17th of this year, his main task was to promote a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese war. Therefore, Japan launched a peace offensive at one time, but it was resolutely rejected by Chongqing. Unable to reverse its hopeless situation, Japan signed a treaty with the Nanjing government on November 30th. This move was mainly aimed at coping with the domestic situation. Since Japan has failed to resolve the China situation, it will shift its entire attention to the south. According to estimates by a senior Chinese military authority, Japan will use ten divisions for this, and has already withdrawn troops from China for reorganization and training. Seven of these divisions have been reorganized and are currently undergoing three months of training under the guidance of German experts, focusing on blitzkrieg tactics. This training is expected to be completed by early January next year. At the same time, it is reported that two divisions will be concentrated in Hainan, and at least one division can be drawn from Taiwan. It is expected that Japan's first action will likely be launched in January, occupying Cam Ranh Bay (transliteration) in Vietnam and using it as an important base for military operations in the South China Sea. The main objective will be to attack Singapore. If ten divisions are deemed insufficient, Japan will continue to withdraw troops from China. Yichang and Nanchang may be included in the withdrawal. Therefore, while it is useful for the Japanese to use these two cities as offensive bases, their use is very limited if Japan decides to temporarily adopt a defensive posture in China. Furthermore, according to qualified sources, the Chinese people's fears about the possibility of various countries turning against China or exerting pressure to force it to accept Japanese peace terms have been completely dispelled since the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union successively guaranteed to continue their aid. Currently, all Chinese people firmly believe that it is impossible for Japan to conquer China. The current question is how long China still needs to wait before the Japanese army can completely withdraw and restore peace under conditions that China deems fair and honorable. China's task today is to strengthen its internal economic and political organization, and at the same time prepare for a general offensive when a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery are transported from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and when international and remote developments are favorable to the Chinese army's counterattack against Japan. At present, general impartial observers all acknowledge the magnitude and difficulty of the Chinese government's current tasks. According to Reuters, the government is currently planning to establish a powerful organization to fundamentally solve China's various economic problems and take a firm stand on internal political events. At the same time, China is actively preparing for a large-scale counteroffensive. (Reuters, 6th)

### Fujian Provincial Government Affairs: Inspection Report

Fuzhou: The Jiangxi-Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi group of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Inspection Group, led by Jiang Tingfu, entered Fujian in June of this year for inspection. The report on Fujian Province has recently been released by the provincial government. The main points of its content are as follows: (1) Fujian Province is wealthier than Guizhou and Guangxi, but not as wealthy as Hunan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. The rural economy has been improving since the war, but the people are mostly sick. Those suffering from malaria account for 30% to 40% each year, and plague is easy to spread. The national physique is very weak. (2) The provincial government is working hard to improve governance. In recent years, there have been several new administrative measures, such as requiring civil servants below the county level to be trained and guaranteed. County government personnel do not advance or retreat with the county magistrate. This system is a major reform in China's local administration. Therefore, the basic trend of the personnel system is very proper, but attention should be paid to the abuse of those being trained relying on legal protection and not cooperating effectively with the county magistrate, or forming their own systems, mutually supporting each other and excluding dissidents. (3) The grassroots organizations in Fujian Province are quite substantial. The county and district organizations are very large, and the position of the commissioner's office is not as good as in Jiangxi. In general, there are a large number of local administrative personnel, and their treatment is not low, but the level of general knowledge is very poor. (4) The provincial government is most active in promoting provincial administration. The provincial government trusts young people, and they should be energetic and conscientious in their work. Therefore, they are making every effort to recruit and train young cadres to strengthen grassroots organizations. Political progress depends on this. (5) What best demonstrates the proactivity of the provincial administration is its commercial policy. The provincial government adheres to one principle, that is, the standard for public commerce is that wholesale is handled by the government, and retail can be done by private individuals as much as possible. The provincial government believes that this method can eliminate the monopoly of large capital, and not compete with small people for profit. It can not only regulate materials and stabilize prices, but also absorb capital and carry out various construction projects. Judging from the theory, it is in line with the Three People's Principles of Sun Yat-sen and the current world trend. Its trade organizations are still sound, and the financial and fiscal aspects can also cooperate. This core test is of great significance and deserves attention. The central government should strengthen its maintenance in order to observe success. (6th)

### Current Food and Housing Problems in Shanghai

The two major problems that Shanghai residents feel are most serious are food and housing. Food, with rice as the staple, is the greatest anxiety of the public: the japonica rice price has risen above one hundred yuan, and foreign rice has also reached eighty yuan; families of eight with monthly incomes of several tens of yuan are obviously unable to feed themselves. People are discussing and debating various methods, whether it be group rice purchases, consumer cooperation, public storage, or public sales. All practical work has its own considerable use; however, it is still far from solving the so-called food problem of Shanghai. For example, group rice purchases benefit some people, but not everyone has the opportunity to benefit. Consumer cooperation has the most convincing theory; if it can call on the public to join together, gather funds to directly purchase rice, and distribute it to members to avoid exploitation by rice merchants, it would be very good. There is already an organization of food cooperation associations in order to popularize it; however, great achievements depend on factual evidence. As for public storage, it was originally intended to prepare for famine; apportioning subscriptions is also to facilitate the gathering of things. How to purchase and store so that the increasingly expensive rice does not increase the difficulty; and how to distribute it in the future so that the benefits reach the eating households, this is also a difficult question to say; if it is to be like the late Shi Changping's intentions to use it for regulation, then the method of selling rice out requires a lot of research, and we will still inevitably be exploited by middlemen. As for public sales, it is favored by those who have always talked about the food problem, but it must have a strong and effective executive agency, and a unified method, and sufficient preparation. If we rashly organize it, I am afraid that merchants will be hesitant and close their businesses. If things become a disaster and the harm is already obvious, it is not a plan for the current food situation. I think that the greatest trouble with Shanghai's food problem today is not that the theory is not pleasing, but that there is a lack of genuine and practical strength to make a whole plan for the people's food and to take responsibility for implementation. Speaking of the source of rice, foreign rice has never been interrupted. If you want to relieve the panic of Shanghai's rice with rice produced in the interior, although it is not absolutely hopeless in today's environment, the hope is actually very limited. Therefore, the current temporary solution cannot use public power to take responsibility for the people's food; it still has to rely on merchants' transportation. What merchants value is profit. Where the profit is, they are not afraid of difficulties and dangers, and they do not avoid going to remote and near places, and compete to go there; they may also be able to use their single thought to slightly increase the supply of food; but it is also because they use the opportunity to make excessive plundering, greatly increasing the burden on the people's food. Therefore, the urgent task of the rich is how to remove their excesses, correct their mistakes, prevent manipulation, clarify the market, and allow them to operate in the right track. If there are ups and downs, it is not a matter of course. On the other hand, the two concessions should jointly plan to form a food management agency, to make overall plans for the entire food situation and give them the power to tackle both the symptoms and the root causes, in order to cope with the current panic. If rice prices are expensive, there are complex opinions and various methods, only seeing them follow after a big increase, which is useless and only crying out helplessly, how can a small well-off situation be obtained?

As for housing, the soaring situation of recent rents, transfer fees, and small rents is exactly the same as that of food. The French Concession has already revealed a draft of the real estate leasing regulations for this problem, and there is also a rumor of eliminating the bad habit of small rents in the Public Concession; in short, it is all an expression of the municipal government's attention to the lives of citizens. This newspaper had three months ago, on the severity of the housing problem in Shanghai, put forward its appropriate temporary measures; now, looking at the draft of the real estate leasing regulations, the rights and obligations of all parties can be taken into account. However, it has not paid close attention to the current difficulties of the lessee; the lessor can use various powers to increase the lessee's rent, or cancel the lease, to threaten the lessee. Recently, the renting of new and old houses is not only extremely expensive, but also greedy for small rents. Every turn costs thousands of gold. The cost of transferring houses is so huge that it is shocking, and some even exceed the cost of building the house. Try to look at the rented houses in the alleys, which are difficult to find. Houses that have been taken back and rented out also have to charge a fee or a small rent. The bad habit of eliminating small rents was banned in 1928. At that time, in addition to a very small number of foreign merchant accounting firms that still disregarded laws and regulations and often charged them, most landlords had already abandoned small rents and switched to collecting security deposits. Now, the ashes have rekindled, and it has become even worse. It is a general plan for peaceful residence. In order to prevent the housing problem from increasing its severity, (1) in addition to allowing houses that are actually dangerous and may erupt, the remaining houses, even if they have reached the expiration date for renovation, should still be allowed to be accommodated and postponed for renovation, so that the lessor cannot take the opportunity to renovate, in order to increase the rent. (2) Even if the lessee has no arrears in rent, whether or not there is a contract, they can continue to lease, and they must not force them to increase the rent or force them to move. (3) The two concessions should take the same steps to effectively handle the housing leasing problem in order to solve the current difficulty of housing. As for how thick or thin the lessor's interests are, they should be put aside for consideration at present.

### U.S. Government to Send Fleet to Visit Far East Next Year; U.S. to Supply China with War Goods as Much as Possible; Soviet Union Reaffirms Great Significance of Its China Policy

New York: According to "Newsweek", the U.S. Navy will send a fleet to visit the Far East next year, including China, the Dutch East Indies, and Singapore, etc. (Haitong, 6th)

New York: Federal Loan Administrator Jones told the chairman of the Life Insurance Association yesterday, "As you know, we are doing our best to help China." He also said, "We have ordered more than 100 million U.S. dollars worth of tungsten, tin, tung oil, and antimony from them. They may have to wait several years before they can be completely delivered, but they are delivering them ahead of schedule despite various difficulties." He also said, "The U.S. government has made every effort to help democratic countries in every way possible. The so-called assistance is to supply them with as many scarce military supplies as possible." (United Press, 6th)

Moscow: Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin recently issued a statement to the Japanese government that the Soviet Union's China policy has not changed, which is the first important announcement on Sino-Soviet relations in four months. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also made this announcement on August 1st of this year, saying that "Our relationship with the great China, which has survived since the war of resistance, is always harmonious and friendly based on the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact." The new statement issued by the Soviet Union to Japan does not contain any intention to undermine recent efforts to restore normal Soviet-Japanese relations, but it is indeed a public confirmation of the Soviet Union's friendship towards the Chinese government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Japan recently told the Soviet Union that the Japanese-Wang conditions were not aimed at the Soviet Union and did not hinder Japan's desire to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations. Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin made the above statement on Wednesday. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington: California Democratic Congressman Isaac told United Press reporters yesterday that the United States should ban the transportation of war necessities to Japan and hand over the items to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. If necessary, they should not even be charged. Congressman Isaac said, "This is a long-term method of economic assistance. If this can be done, we may be able to prevent Japan from continuing to advance south." He also advocated that in order to express America's opposition to Japan's actions, the U.S. government should send several warships to Singapore for a "friendly visit." He also said that he does not believe that the United States can use the port of Singapore as a long-term base, but he believes that if necessary, he supports taking this action. Congressman Isaac continued, "I feel that adopting British Trinidad as a naval base is the same in nature as adopting Singapore as a naval base. The President has the power to adopt any new location as an American naval base without consulting Congress." He also urged the government to provide new assistance to China and Britain. He said, "Those countries are currently preventing our enemies from reaching our backs, so we should give them as much assistance as possible." He also urged the U.S. government to accelerate the production of military industries and, where possible, adopt a 24-hour system in aircraft manufacturing. However, he reiterated that this move is quite difficult to implement because the United States does not have so many skilled workers at this time. (United Press, 6th)

### After Eight Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting, Greek Forces Occupy Santi Quaranta, Controlling the Combiajet Mountains, Italian Forces Continue to Retreat Westward

Athens – Following bloody hand-to-hand combat, Greek soldiers occupied the important Albanian seaport of Santi Quaranta yesterday. This location is a critical supply route for Italian forces. British and Greek aircraft also wiped out a fleeing Italian mechanized unit after the Greek forces occupied the city. Another Greek force is currently fiercely attacking Elbasan, which is only 24 miles from the Albanian capital, Tirana. Greek forces occupied Santi Quaranta after crossing a swamp that the Italians considered impassable. The capture of this city has caused the collapse of the Italian war effort in southern Albania. News from the Struga front indicates that Greek forces occupied a village only three kilometers from Santi Quaranta after fierce fighting north of Lake Ohrid on Wednesday. Casualties were significant on both sides in this engagement. Greek forces then opened the road across the swamp to Santi Quaranta and Delvina, encircling the port's railway in a semi-circle. With their position in danger, the Italian forces began to retreat. Greek forces entered the city yesterday morning. News from Struga indicates that in the Moschopolis region, Greek forces are only 22 kilometers northwest of Moschopolis and are continuing to advance. British and Greek aircraft again bombed Vlora yesterday, inflicting considerable damage. A government spokesman stated, "The Gamia plateau northwest of Pogradec is now in our hands." It is reported that the main Italian forces are now concentrated on the Vojussa River at Tiberini, north of Santi Quaranta. Italian forces have suffered extremely heavy losses due to bombing by British and Greek aircraft. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Athens – According to recent battle reports received here, Potoaeda has fallen into Greek hands, and Argyrokastron is also on the verge of capture. It is reported that the Greek vanguard is fiercely pursuing the Italian forces retreating eastward from Potoaeda. It is reported that Argyrokastron has been completely secured by Greek forces; they are chanting the slogan "Celebrate Christmas in Tirana." It is understood that all Italian forces, except for the rearguard forces fighting to cover the retreat, have completely withdrawn from Potoaeda. Greek sources claim that the main force of the Italian garrison at Argyrokastron has abandoned the city, and the radio in the city has been silent since Wednesday night. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)

Rome – Italian newspapers reported this morning that Italian aircraft shot down five enemy aircraft flying in Greek airspace yesterday. Recently, snow has accumulated on the roads, and Italian aircraft have taken this opportunity to strafe Greek forces traveling on the roads. As a result, large formations of Greek troops only dare to march at night. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Budapest – According to recent battle reports from Athens, Greek forces occupied Potoaeda at night and reached the outskirts of Tiberini. However, they were repelled by Italian forces after half an hour of hand grenade and bayonet fighting. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)

Athens – An official communique recently stated that British and Greek aircraft are currently bombing the highway leading to Panormos, which is filled with Italian forces fleeing from Santi Quaranta. Santi Quaranta was completely occupied by Greek forces this morning, and Greek forces have now entered the city. The communique continued that Italian forces have retreated northward from Santi Quaranta, while Greek forces are still advancing. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Rome – According to the Italian High Command, the enemy continues to advance on the Greek front, and the left flank is under considerable pressure. The enemy is reportedly transferring troops from various fronts to attack. Italian forces have counterattacked, with the Alessio and Venezia Divisions fighting very bravely. Italian air fleets are bombing enemy communication lines and concentrations of enemy troops, and strafing with machine guns. Italian aircraft have all returned to their bases. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Nanjing – According to newspaper reports, the weather on the Greek front was bad yesterday. Italian forces in the south have retreated to a new defense line from Himara to Tepeleni. Italian forces have withdrawn from Argyrokastron, and Greek forces have occupied Frasheri. Italian forces are reinforcing the north and putting up a stubborn resistance, but Greek forces have occupied the Combiajet mountain area near Polerat. Fierce fighting is currently taking place along the entire front. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Athens – According to recent news from the front lines, there was heavy snow and dense fog yesterday, and air activity was greatly reduced. Greek forces launched successive and fierce attacks with bayonets, completely clearing Italian forces from Mount Mokra. Italian forces on the northwest side were only able to retreat after suffering heavy casualties and losing a large number of weapons. Many soldiers were captured by Greek forces. Greek forces on the central front have advanced past Premeti, encircling an Italian division and capturing many heavy artillery pieces and countless soldiers. At the same time, retreating and reinforcing Italian forces were bombed by British and Greek aircraft. Yesterday, both Santi Quaranta and Argyrokastron were ablaze with light. It was that the retreating Italian forces burned military supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Italian Army Chief of Staff Replaced

Rome – Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio has submitted his resignation, which was approved today. General Cavallero has been appointed as Chief of Staff. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Milan – The new Italian Army Chief of General Staff, General Cavallero, was born in Monferrato in 1880. He studied at the Modena Military Academy. During the First World War, he served as the Director of Operations for the General Staff. After the armistice, he served as the leader of the Italian military delegation to the Allied Council in Versailles. After 1926, he served as a senator. He is the chairman of the German-Italian Military Commission. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Athens – Greek officials are paying close attention to the news today that Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio has resigned and has been succeeded by General Cavallero, considering it a public acknowledgment by the Italian side of military defeats. According to recent reports from the front, Italian vehicles on all fronts are now retreating towards the sea rather than continuing to retreat inland. Military observers generally believe that this situation is far more important than the occupation of a city or village. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Greek Forces Continue to Advance, Italian Forces Retreat Towards the Sea

Athens – Greek forces are continuing to fight bravely and have made important gains in the past few hours, especially in the northern area near Pogradec. Several more locations in that area have been occupied by Greek forces. According to recent reports from the front, Italian forces have been forced to retreat towards the sea rather than retreating to inland lines, appearing to be making a general retreat to the west. Military observers here believe that the westward retreat of the Italian forces is far more important than the occupation of small cities and towns by Greek forces. Italian forces are currently retreating as quickly as possible towards the Albanian port of Himara, 30 miles north of Santi Quaranta. There has been fierce fighting between infantry and artillery units near Argyrokastron in the past 48 hours. The British and Greek air forces have provided significant support, concentrating their bombing on enemy troop concentrations, mechanized units, and military camps. The Greek strategy seems to be to make the Italian forces flee in panic, without rest. Therefore, after capturing Pogradec, the Greek forces did not pause but continued to advance, intending to reach the source of the Skumbi River. At the same time, Greek forces are advancing west and northwest from Moscopole, so the left flank lines are all active. Greek forces, holding a belief in inevitable victory, are advancing bravely. Greek newspaper war correspondents claim that the Greek army and its organization are far superior to the Italian army, so they are constantly gaining advantages everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Fierce Fighting in the North, Italian Forces Retreat to Linzhen

Nanjing – According to news from the southern Albanian border here, the fighting was exceptionally fierce on the northern front of the Greek-Italian front on Wednesday night. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Greek forces engaged Italian forces in bayonet combat, and the Italian forces finally retreated to Linzhen. Greek forces claimed last night that there were no Italian forces to be found on Mount Gamia and Mount Mokra. Due to the heavy snowstorm on the northern front, there was no air combat. On the southern front, Italian aircraft attacked Greek positions and the city of Preveza. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Greek Forces Advance Victoriously Through Heavy Snowstorm

Athens – With biting cold winds and skin-splitting frost, snow falling from the sky, and roads mired in knee-deep mud, the Greek army, facing such difficult conditions, and in the face of fierce resistance from the Italian forces, is still attacking relentlessly without backing down. For the past eight days, the Greek forces have continued to brave the wind and rain and fight to the death with the Italian forces. This is what the Greek military spokesman told reporters today, regarding the situation on the front lines for the past eight days and the Greek forces' resolute response to the terrible pressure. The Greek military spokesman said that the Greek forces are carrying out difficult attacks ahead of the Italian lines, which are very extensive. The famous Greek Evzone soldiers, after occupying Premeti, are pressing even harder, not giving the Italian forces the slightest chance to catch their breath, and are quickly attacking Kosura. The main force of the Greek forces is fiercely fighting in the high plateaus, which are covered in thick snow. The fighting in the Argyrokastron region is still ongoing, and Greek radio is replying to Italian radio, saying, "Argyrokastron belongs to the Greeks and will continue to be occupied by the Greeks until the end of the war." The Greek military spokesman predicts that in the next 48 hours, the Greeks may occupy important positions that have never been occupied before. At present, the radio station in Argyrokastron has been occupied by the Greek forces, and the storage depots in the area have caught fire. Italian tanks and armored forces have formed another rear guard force in the Santi Quaranta area to cover the retreating troops, and are setting up defenses and building trenches at the port of Himara. Three major fires have broken out in Santi Quaranta, which is believed to be due to the retreating Italian forces burning warehouses, as they cannot carry the stored military supplies and therefore set them ablaze. According to news from the front lines, when an Italian destroyer in the waters off Santi Quaranta was bombed, it was heard that many Italian troops on board were killed or injured, as the ship was carrying a large number of Italian troops and military supplies. The Greek military spokesman also said that north of Pogradec, the Greek forces are still fiercely attacking Italian forces in the snow-covered highlands, with both sides bombarding each other with heavy artillery.

### Military Experts Review the Greek-Italian War Situation: If Greek Forces Occupy Two Key Ports, the Overall Situation Can Be Considered Settled

London – A Reuters military commentator said that the Greek campaign has dealt a major blow to the Axis powers, and the one suffered by Mussolini is a significant one. However, the overall result is not yet determined. This result has far-reaching implications and must be achieved with the greatest courage in order to reap the full rewards. Therefore, everything from now on depends on courage, in other words, the strategy of this campaign must be decided by the commander-in-chief. Should the Greek forces adopt a cautious strategy, not pursuing the enemy to the end, but reaching the sea and ending the advance after destroying the Italian forces in Albania? This seems to be the big question that the commander-in-chief must decide. The purpose of this strategy is to establish good communication lines in the rear and prevent the Italian forces from counterattacking. In theory, this strategy is safer than a deeper advance, but is it really so in practice? The Italian side will thus be able to calmly reorganize and bring in reinforcements from Italy. At that point, the Greek position may not necessarily be safer. The Italian forces can get a breather to revive their morale, and Hitler can also send heavy troops to help. Although there are many precedents of armies advancing too deeply, with supplies cut off, and ultimately collapsing when encountering a strong enemy, such as the Turkish victory over the Greeks in 1924, following precedents without regard to the vastly different circumstances of today and yesterday is not a way to win. Taking advantage of victory to pursue, advancing more and more fiercely, seizing fortresses, and annihilating the enemy are common occurrences in military history, such as Napoleon chasing the Prussian army after the Battle of Jena in the past, capturing Berlin in a few weeks. In this war, the German army pursued the French army all the way to Bordeaux, not allowing the French army to make use of its new base in time. On the other hand, adhering to the idea of not pursuing a desperate enemy, losing the meaning of killing the enemy and achieving results, allowing the enemy to revive their flames, and losing all previous achievements, are also innumerable in military history. For example, after Wellington's great victories at Salamanca and Vitoria, because he did not pursue the defeated troops with sufficient strength, the French side was able to make a comeback, causing the British army to lose many of the gains it had made. The situation in Albania today is more suitable for the Greek forces' fierce pursuit. Although communication lines are not without difficulties and there is a lack of railways, advancing rapidly towards important strongholds should not cause excessive difficulties in transportation. The British and Greek fleets should be able to attack the ports of Vlora and Durazzo with their highly effective coordination when the Greek army approaches. If the Greek forces occupy these two ports, then as far as the Albanian campaign is concerned, the overall situation can be said to be settled. At that point, most of the Italian forces will either surrender or die. Even if a small number escape north, they will not be a threat. Mussolini, although he speaks grandly, only has one port left in the northern corner of Albania. Even if he wants to send reinforcements to Albania to restore his fate, it is impossible. The Greek army, holding Lake Ohrid in the east and relying on the coast in the west, is in a better position to deal with everything. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Shipping Route Opens Between Soviet and Romanian Ports

Bucharest – Official sources recently stated that the European economic situation has been completely changed by recent events. Our authorities are now striving to adapt to this new situation and must lay a new foundation for the country's economic life.

### Turkey and Bulgaria Improve Relations, Turkish Newspapers Welcome Bulgarian Foreign Minister's Speech

Ankara – According to the Turkish government mouthpiece Ulas newspaper yesterday, the Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Shabov's, speech in the parliament was welcomed by Turkey. The previous Turkish suspicion of Bulgaria has now been swept away, and there is no obstacle to Turkish-Bulgarian cooperation. The improvement of Turkish-Bulgarian relations has greatly eased the tense political situation in Turkey. Since German Ambassador Papen returned to Turkey, it is clear that the localization of the Greek-Italian war has also improved the Turkish political situation. The talks between British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and Turkish President Ismet Inonu are unlikely to tempt Turkey. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

### Fourth Anniversary of the Stalin Constitution

Commentary from Pravda

Moscow – Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the Stalin Constitution. Pravda commented, "The Stalin Constitution has promoted the entire development of the Soviet state. The construction of Soviet socialism, the elimination of exploitation, and the development of Soviet democracy are all reflected in the Constitution. The Soviet people are united by indestructible friendship, so the Soviet system is extremely solid. The Stalin Constitution has given the Soviet working masses great rights, such as the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to material security in old age and illness. In short, the Soviet people are all proud to enjoy these rights. In all socialist construction work, we feel the life force that the Stalin Constitution gives us. We have witnessed countless achievements, and production is also increasing. At a time when the scourge of war is spreading, the Soviet people can still remain outside the situation. This is thanks to the wise Stalin's policy of peace. In 1938, 170 million people celebrated the Stalin Constitution. Last year, it increased to 183 million (including Western Ukraine and Western Belarus). This year, the number of celebrants has increased even further to 193 million, including Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina. Since the people of the Baltic republics gained the right to express their opinions freely, they have unanimously agreed to join the great Soviet Union. As for the political activities and joyous situation of the people of these countries, it can be verified by the words of Kagunisko, a teacher from Bessarabia. Kagunisko said, "We, on behalf of all the liberated people, assure you that we will soon be able to work in the manner of the Stakhanovites and protect our freedom and happiness in the manner of Stalin."

### It Is Reported That Germany Is Enticing Turkey to Propose a Peace Plan to Greece, Turkish Foreign Minister Will Meet with Greek Prime Minister

Capital of Yugoslavia – The Truth newspaper here carries a dispatch from Istanbul, stating that Turkey is willing to mediate the Greek-Italian war, if it can be sure that the peace proposal can be effective. It is said that the mission of German Ambassador Papen, who recently went to Turkey, was to entice Turkey to engage in mediation, and the step will be for the Turkish Foreign Minister to visit Greece to visit Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Budapest – According to well-informed diplomatic circles here, the German proposal to end the Greek-Italian war was handed over by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas at a secret meeting in Thessaloniki. It is reported that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen handed over the German peace plan to Saracoğlu in Ankara a few days ago and suggested to Greece the German mediation method and certain concessions to Greece. Greek and Turkish political circles here have neither confirmed nor denied this news. However, the Greek side pointed out that Greece and Germany will continue to maintain relations. Diplomatic circles also said that since Germany recently wooed Bulgaria to join the Axis powers, the pressure from Germany to force Greece to accept peace was not unexpected. The same source said that, according to news at the time, Germany allowed Bulgaria to satisfy its demands on Greece and Turkey, and promised to provide military assistance to Italy. If Turkey assisted Greece, Germany would also invade Turkey. However, this plan was suddenly thwarted because Soviet Russia quickly warned Bulgaria not to join the Axis, and adopted a strong position to resist the German army's attack on the Dardanelles and other important areas connecting to the Soviet Union. It is said that the German plan was unsuccessful and the position of the Axis powers deteriorated further due to Italy's disastrous defeat in Greece. Therefore, it was decided to quickly end the Greek-Italian war, because this war did not follow the procedures set by Berlin and Rome from the beginning. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)

Washington – Political circles here yesterday denied any peace proposal involving President Roosevelt, the Roman Pope, and Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, saying that they had absolutely no knowledge of it. It was previously rumored from the Vichy side that Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar was probing the President of the United States and others about peace. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### British House of Commons Rejects Peace Proposal by a Vote of 341 to 4

London - The Axis powers' peace proposal was destined to fail. The British left-wing movement, demanding an end to the war, was rejected by an absolute majority in the House of Commons yesterday. The motion, initiated by the radical elements of the Independent Labour Party and supported by Gallagher, the sole Communist member of Parliament, was rejected by 341 votes to 4, setting a new record for House of Commons votes. (International Telegram, 6th)

Stockholm - During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, the peace proposal put forward by three Independent Labour Party members received only six votes, including the proposers. The other three votes came from two Labour Party members and Gallagher, the sole Communist member. The proposer, McGovern, stated that if the war does not end, the nation's industrial areas will face the same fate as Coventry. Chamberlain's appeasement policy, regardless, is better than war. He urged members not to be deceived by declarations of fighting for freedom and democracy. He argued that now is the time to establish peace based on justice and equality. Militarily, Britain and Germany are evenly matched, with Germany having a military advantage, but the wealth of the British Empire and material aid from America can offset this. The second proposer, Stephen, stated that it is time for Britain to show the world its moral position, allowing the other side to propose peace based on justice for all nations. The basic condition is restoring the freedom of all countries and combining the material resources of Britain and Germany to build a new world civilization. Subsequently, Labour leader Griffiths spoke, stating that everyone welcomes genuine peace but does not wish to choose surrender. He hoped the British government would announce its peace objectives. Then, Liberal and Conservative members spoke, either in favor or against. Finally, Lord Privy Seal Major Attlee, representing the government, refuted the peace proposal, stating that the British government's aim is to establish a peaceful world and free humanity.

### German Planes Raid England, Repelled by the British Air Force; British and German Long-Range Guns Exchange Fire Across the Channel

London - Several formations of German Messerschmitt fighters flew over the southeastern coast of England yesterday and were heavily attacked by Spitfire fighters, scattering and fleeing. British planes pursued them across the Channel before returning. Bombs fell on one city, causing no significant damage. German planes also attempted to bomb several small ships in the Channel, but the ships returned fire and repelled the German planes. Last night, British and German long-range guns heavily exchanged fire across the Strait of Dover, shaking coastal towns along the Channel. The bombardment continued for an hour. (Reuters, 6th)

London - Yesterday and this morning, British planes and anti-aircraft batteries again repelled group air raids by German planes on southern English ports. It is reported that in the past thirty-six hours, Britain has gained far more than it has lost on both offense and defense. The German air force is clearly weakening. It is reported that German planes first dropped flares to illuminate the southern ports before launching a fierce attack. The Ministry of Aviation announced that concentrated Nazi bomber formations appeared over the port, but intense anti-aircraft fire forced them to stay at high altitude. British fighter squadrons eventually drove off all the raiders. Last night, air raid sirens sounded twice in London, but German planes only appeared near London, dropping a few bombs in the suburbs. Before dawn today, large gun batteries along the Channel continued a furious exchange of fire across the Channel. (International Telegram, 6th)

Berlin - The German High Command announced this morning that large formations of German planes carried out group air raids on London and a key port in southern England early today.

A few bombs fell in the London area, but damage was minimal. Yesterday, fourteen German planes were shot down over Britain. Two British fighters went missing, but the pilot of one plane escaped safely. (Reuters, 6th)

### British Air Force Launches Long Night Raid on Düsseldorf; Turin, Italy, Also Heavily Attacked

London - The British Air Force launched attacks on Wednesday night and day, with its main targets being the Mannesmann and Rheinmetall-Borsig arms factories in the Düsseldorf area (6,000 workers), railway yards, wharves along the Rhine River, docks, coal plants, and gas plants. There was dense cloud cover that night, but the first British planes arriving in Düsseldorf found gaps in the clouds and dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs, causing immediate explosions and fires in more than ten locations. Other British planes continued to attack Düsseldorf for twelve hours. One pilot saw fifteen to twenty large fires inside and outside the city's railway yard, with intense flames and the edges of the clouds glowing red, indicating that the area had been heavily damaged. Turin in Italy was also attacked by the British Air Force, with the main target being its many arms factories. Large bombs were dropped, causing heavy damage in order to reduce the production of cannons, tanks, and other military equipment. The attacking British planes first encountered dense clouds, but the weather suddenly cleared over the Alps, providing excellent visibility when they reached Turin. After completing the mission, they all returned safely. According to the Ministry of Aviation Intelligence, Britain received the first report of the attack from a pilot who radioed, "Attack successful, weather clear." Several hours later, the first British plane returned. One British bomber dropped several bombs on the FIAT factory en route, but most British planes concentrated on bombing the Royal Arsenal, causing immediate explosions and fires, with dense smoke billowing up two to three thousand feet. Other British bombers arrived subsequently and dropped bombs, continuously bombarding the arsenal from 9 PM for two hours. One pilot said that the target area was covered in fires and explosions, and that minutes after the last British planes left the area, another explosion like thunder was heard, with flames shooting high, visible from fifty miles away. The FIAT factory was hit by two bombs, causing explosions and fires. An affiliated factory that produced motors for aircraft engines was also attacked, with two bombs exploding in the main factory buildings, causing internal fires. (Reuters, 6th)

A Painful History of the European War (4)

### Daladier-Reynaud: The Inside Story of a Romantic Misguided Nation

Gamelin continued, "This may just be a trick, but Goering's speech yesterday predicted a major development in the war. Judging by his consistent style, he doesn't seem to be lying. Perhaps the German general offensive is imminent."

His calm demeanor, waiting for the enemy's strike, reassured people and privately praised him as another calm and unperturbed Joffre. However, Reynaud did not agree.

Reynaud often asked, "Why should there be two commanders-in-chief? If Chief of Staff General Georges is responsible for commanding the army, why not let Gamelin be Chief of Staff and Minister of National Defense?"

Reynaud and Gamelin were at odds, not only because of their different personalities, but because of the conflict between two military doctrines. Since the beginning of the war, Gamelin advocated a defensive posture, waiting for the right moment to act, while Reynaud was known for advocating offensive warfare.

Reynaud said, "A general who only defends and does not attack will inevitably lose every battle."

He had been allowed to step up the leadership of the war and come to power, so he naturally had to adopt a decisive plan. However, his possibilities were quite limited. From the time he visited London, he firmly advocated that Britain should lay mines in Norwegian territorial waters. Later, he found a proposal in the Foreign Office archives to establish an Anglo-French agreement that neither side could make peace alone. Daladier had always refused to recognize this, but Reynaud brought it up again. Then he raised the issue of Belgium, arguing that troops should be sent not after the Belgian government asked for help, but when they forced Belgium to state its position.

He asked the Belgian cabinet, "Are you in favor of us, or against us? If you are in favor of us, of course, you should quickly cooperate and strengthen the defense of the two countries' borders. If you are against us..."

Gamelin strongly disagreed, saying that such a method would be tantamount to driving fish into the deep, causing the Belgian army of twenty-five divisions to go over to the enemy. The two clashed fiercely. If it hadn't been for Minister of War Daladier's insistence on resigning, Reynaud would have replaced Gamelin with General Georges as early as mid-April. Although Reynaud did not dare to take this risk lightly and let Daladier resign, his personal position seemed to have been strengthened compared to before. The British action in Norwegian territorial waters and the victory in the Battle of Narvik made the French rejoice, and Reynaud's prestige also increased sharply.

On April 20th, he declared in the Chamber of Deputies, "The enemy's railway lines for transporting iron have been effectively cut off." A few days earlier, he had won by only one vote, but this time he gained unanimous support from the Chamber of Deputies. I felt relieved when I heard the news, but that night I met a senator who told me that this meant nothing.

He said gloomily, "You don't know the tricks of the parliament. Reynaud's unanimous support was due to the efforts of his opponents. If he could win a majority, it would be his personal victory, but unanimity expresses deep patriotism and concern for the country, not for him."

The next day I met with Reynaud himself. He was pacing back and forth in the Foreign Office residence, with his hands in his pockets. When he saw me coming, he loudly told me about what he had found after he came to power, which made me very shocked.

He said, "The tanks only exist on paper. The domestic order is even more chaotic. The army needs cannons and machine guns, which are still hidden in the armories. The Germans have two hundred divisions, or perhaps two hundred and forty divisions, but our army has less than one hundred divisions. Daladier is procrastinating and obstructing all reform plans, making the government powerless."

I said, "Even so, Daladier is still a patriot! When he broadcasts on the radio, he is eloquent and his words touch people's hearts."

Reynaud said, "Yes, I believe he wants France to win, but he wants my failure even more."

This surprising comment may not be entirely appropriate, but it came from the heart, and the depth of their resentment can be seen.

### All Shanghai Municipal Council Staff Receive Pay Raise; Living Allowance Increased to 150 Percent; Rice Allowance Calculation Standard Adjusted and Will Also Be Increased; Allowances for Chinese Constables Implemented Since Last Month

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced yesterday the approval of increases in allowances for Chinese constables and staff. The announcement stated that the Council felt it was necessary to consider the salary issue for all staff as a matter of urgency, especially the salaries of Chinese constables. Upon investigation, Chinese constables expressed dissatisfaction with their current salaries, leading to unrest. The Council believes that this is a sign of dissatisfaction among all staff regarding their treatment. The Police Department has special issues in some respects, which distinguishes police personnel from those in other departments. However, to maintain a good administrative structure, the Council believes that all staff should receive treatment that is in line with the current situation.

Living Allowances Increased Across the Board

The Council had originally intended to postpone this issue pending the report of the Economic Committee, but this was not possible in reality, and the public also deeply hoped that the Council would take immediate action. The Council first considered the salaries of Chinese staff not holding contracts and decided to increase the current temporary cost of living allowance from 85 percent to 150 percent, with a minimum amount of 40 yuan. This minimum amount, calculated based on the lowest-paid Chinese staff, means that the amount of allowance received is more than 150 percent. As for the rice allowance, the minimum amount was changed to 15 yuan. The calculation method is based on a rice price of 35 yuan per picul. The difference between the standard price and the rice price will be subsidized by the Council for half.

Chinese Constable Treatment Now Superior

Currently, each single Chinese constable receives about 69 yuan per month, including the recently approved increase in housing allowance. Chinese constables with families receive about 75 yuan per month. Under the new method, each single constable will receive at least 109 yuan per month, and constables with families will receive 130 yuan per month. (The above figures include the special labor allowance for constables, which is 15 yuan for single constables and 30 yuan for those with families.) At the same time, the amount of rice allowance, calculated based on the current rice price, can still be increased.

Senior Staff Also Benefit

The Council also considered the treatment of Chinese and foreign staff holding contracts. The Council has always been aware that the staff salary system was not satisfactory, but whenever it intended to increase salaries, it often tried to reduce the increase rate for the sake of saving expenses. Today, it feels it is necessary to increase salaries again in order to maintain administrative efficiency. This year, 170 such staff members have submitted resignations to the Council, and more resignations are likely to follow. They are all doing this because they are dissatisfied with the Council's current salary system, which has a significant impact on the Council's administration. After repeated deliberation, the Council decided to increase the temporary cost of living allowance as follows: (1) A cost of living allowance of 150 percent will be given for the first 500 yuan of their total salary. (2) A cost of living allowance of 125 percent will be given for the portion of their salary from 501 yuan to 1,000 yuan. (3) A cost of living allowance of 100 percent will be given for the portion of their salary above 1,000 yuan. The above methods apply equally to Chinese and foreign staff, regardless of their salary amount. In addition, the current 12 percent "subsistence" allowance is abolished. The methods for increasing allowances for Chinese constables and Chinese staff not holding contracts will be implemented from November.

Comparison Table of Chinese Constable Salaries and Allowances

New Method (Implemented from November)

"Single Constable" "Constable with Family"

Basic Salary 21 yuan 21 yuan

Minimum Living Allowance 40 yuan 40 yuan

Housing Allowance 18 yuan 24 yuan

Minimum Rice Allowance 15 yuan 15 yuan

Special Labor Allowance 15 yuan 30 yuan

Total 109 yuan Total 130 yuan

October Method

"Single Constable" "Constable with Family"

Basic Salary 21 yuan 21 yuan

Minimum Living Allowance 20 yuan 20 yuan

Approximate Rice Allowance 11 yuan 10 yuan

Total 61 yuan Total 63.50 yuan

"Notes" (1) As can be seen from the above table, a single constable who received 61 yuan in October will receive at least 109 yuan from November. A constable with a family who received 63.50 yuan in October will receive at least 130 yuan from December.

(2) The calculation of the rice allowance is based on a standard price of 35 yuan per picul for No. 2 Saigon rice. If the rice price rises to 80 yuan, the rice allowance should be 22.5 yuan. If the rice price rises to 90 yuan, the rice allowance should be 27.5 yuan. If the rice price rises to 100 yuan, the rice allowance should be 32.5 yuan.

### U.S. Military and Political Leaders in Shanghai Held Important Meeting Yesterday Related to the Current Situation in the Concession and Closely Monitoring Japanese Movements

According to reliable sources in foreign diplomatic circles in this city, U.S. Defense Force Commander in Shanghai, Colonel Baker, and U.S. Yangtze River Fleet Commander, Glassford, visited the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road yesterday at around 11:00 AM to hold an important meeting with U.S. Consul General Lockhead. The meeting adjourned at noon. It is understood that important U.S. military and political leaders in Shanghai have not convened meetings for some time. However, there have been two meetings this week, the first taking place on Monday morning, and the second being yesterday's meeting. It is widely believed that the meetings are related to the current situation in the concession. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, although Admiral Lockhead is currently away from Shanghai, spending the winter in the Philippines, important U.S. naval officers stationed in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, are maintaining close contact with Admiral Lockhead via telegrams. U.S. Consul General Lockhead is also in frequent contact with authorities in Washington. A foreign diplomatic source told a reporter from the Pingming News Agency that the United States is closely monitoring all aspects of the situation in Shanghai, paying particular attention to all movements of the Japanese, regardless of their significance.

U.S. Gunboat Guam Scheduled to Sail to Hankou

Installation and relocation fees have also been revised to 25 yuan for single-line or intercom lines, 10 yuan for extensions, and 2.5 yuan per line for switchboards, calculated based on the switchboard's capacity. Public telephone service calls within the city will cost one jiao per call, and copper tokens will also be changed to one jiao. Starting today, telephone charges at hotels will be uniformly set at 1 jiao 5 fen, according to a notice from the Hotel Association.

### Rickshaw Owners Seeking Monopoly Privileges Suggesting the Municipal Council Establish a Rickshaw Company

The English-language Da Mei Bao reports that a number of rickshaw pullers have jointly submitted a proposal to the Municipal Council to establish a rickshaw company, aiming to obtain exclusive rickshaw privileges within the Public Concession. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated this morning (the 6th) that the Council will study the proposal soon and approve it. The specific details of the proposal have not been disclosed. It is generally believed that the proposal's general conditions aim to create a situation that is more suitable for rickshaw pullers and the authorities managing rickshaws.

### Japanese Merchants Operating Buses in Western Shanghai Infringing on British Merchants' Rights the Municipal Council Will Soon File a Protest It is Rumored that the Japanese Side Has Been Planning This for a Long Time

Regarding the case of Japanese merchants operating buses along Yuyuan Road in the western Shanghai sealed-off area without permission, both the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company and the Public Tramway Company lodged protests with the Municipal Council yesterday. The manager of the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company, Mr. Currie, told reporters that the Japanese action clearly infringes on the company's rights, and that the company has lodged a strong protest with the authorities. Meanwhile, an employee of the Tramway Company revealed that the company has also lodged a protest with the British Consul General George. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated that the Council is considering the protests from both companies and may file a protest with the Japanese authorities. He added that the Japanese operating buses without the Municipal Council's permission directly infringes on the Council's interests. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declined to comment on the matter, stating that a statement may be made at a press conference.

Hope and Prayer Speak Volumes

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that Japanese-operated buses entered Yidingpan Road, adjacent to the sealed-off area, yesterday (the 5th). Regarding this matter, a reporter recently met with a spokesperson for the Municipal Council, who was asked what steps the Council will take to oppose the Japanese action. The spokesperson replied that the Municipal Council will "hope and pray" for the British-owned Public Omnibus Company's exclusive operating rights in the western district. When the reporter asked if the Municipal Council would invite a choir to sing hymns to assist with this special prayer, the spokesperson declined to comment further.

Five Buses Still Operating Yesterday

Meanwhile, Japanese-operated buses continued to infringe on the British-owned Public Omnibus Company's exclusive rights this morning, dispatching several buses to operate on Yuyuan Road. The British-owned Public Omnibus Company has not yet filed a protest but indicated that a protest will be lodged soon. Currently, there are five Japanese-operated buses operating in the western district, charging a uniform fare of two jiao. Some people fear that the appearance of Japanese-operated buses in the western district will usurp the British-owned company's exclusive rights, as has happened in the Hongkou district. However, an employee of the British-owned Public Omnibus Company stated that the company will take various measures to prevent this from happening.

Japanese Actions Meticulously Planned

A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, believing that the operation of "Japanese-operated buses" on roads beyond the settlement boundary in the western district is a significant matter, specifically inquired about this with a Chinese employee of the British-owned China Public Omnibus Company. According to the employee, the company has lost over 30,000 yuan during the six days of the blockade, with daily losses exceeding 5,000 yuan. The company has exclusive operating rights for buses within the Public Concession, and it appears that there is no way to compensate for these unexpected losses. It is rumored that the Japanese side has been plotting to seize these rights in the area for a long time and is simply taking advantage of the opportunity to profit. The company's management and the responsible authorities in the concession are maintaining close contact every day, but it is unknown whether they have filed a protest with the Japanese side. According to another reliable source, the so-called "Shanghai Western District Public Buses" have been prepared for some time, with route signs and tickets already printed in large quantities. From this perspective, it is clearly not a temporary attempt to profit.

### Conditions at the Western Shanghai Blockade Line Yesterday

All Luggage and Food Subject to Search

The situation at the Western Shanghai blockade yesterday was not significantly different from the previous day. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency entered Yuyuan Road from Jisi Fei Road Qianjia Lane (Qianjia Lane is opposite Yuguang Village), where the number of people entering and leaving was extremely high. The barbed wire had been removed, and five or six hired policemen were stationed there, inspecting luggage and belongings. Continuing west along Yuyuan Road, apart from a few private cars and "public buses," there were very few other vehicles on the road. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, a barbed wire fence was placed in the middle of the blockade line, with two openings on either side for pedestrians and vehicles to pass through. A Japanese military policeman and five or six hired policemen were stationed there. The blockade line on Yidingpan Road (at the Yuyuan Road intersection) was tightly closed with barbed wire, and no Chinese or foreigners were allowed to enter or exit.

Food Panic

The reporter then entered Yidingpan Road from a small alley on Yuyuan Road and observed that all alley entrances on the east side of the section from Yuyuan Road to Daxilu (including the Jialong Lane, the location of the Sasaki assassination incident) were heavily sealed off with barbed wire. No one was allowed to enter or exit. This area is considered by the Japanese side to be a hiding place for terrorists and must be thoroughly searched to eliminate the source of trouble. It is understood that several searches have been conducted, but the perpetrator has not been found. Rumors circulating in the area suggest that the assassin of Sasaki was a Japanese anti-war element. Although this claim is not considered reliable, it is widely circulated. Within this area, there is widespread panic about food and other supplies. Some residents have used "ingenious methods" to sneak out, but the number is very small. The inspection at the Yidingpan Road Daxilu intersection blockade line is also very strict.

### Statistics on Imported Rice Sales Prove That a Rice Shortage is Impossible Based on Customs Records and Reports from Various Warehouses

Although the rice reserves in this city are very plentiful, the exact amount is still a matter of concern for the general public. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency has learned that an economic statistics agency estimates that the city's rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing, making a rice shortage impossible. It is hoped that citizens will not easily believe rumors and cause themselves unnecessary anxiety. There are three bases for this conclusion:

Arrival and Sales Statistics

(1) According to customs records, from January to October of this year, a total of 5.6 million metric tons of imported rice arrived (compared to 2.7 million metric tons in the same period last year). After deducting over 32,000 metric tons for export, the net import was over 5.5 million metric tons. If this is divided equally over ten months, the monthly import is 550,000 metric tons, equivalent to 1.1 million city dan or 700,000 shi. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing's estimate, the city's daily consumption of rice is 9,000 shi, or 270,000 shi per month. Therefore, after deducting consumption, there is a net surplus of 400,000 shi per month, meaning a surplus of 4 million shi since October. Domestic rice sources and private imports are not included in this calculation. (2) According to reports from 30 warehouses on their regular rice reserves, the amount was 74,000 bags at the end of last year, 101,000 bags at the end of June this year, and 142,000 bags at the beginning of November. Although this is only a partial survey, it is sufficient to show that the reserves are trending upwards. (3) The recent number of imported rice arrivals shows that rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing. Considering the last four days, 16,549 bags arrived on December 2nd, over 10,000 bags arrived on the 3rd, over 10,000 bags arrived on the 4th, and over 2,000 bags arrived on the 5th. In addition, there are several thousand to tens of thousands of bags arriving every day. A review of economic news reports will make this clear. Since rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing and the supply is continuous, it is clear that the crux of the city's food problem lies purely in the hoarding and manipulation of speculators. This statistics is worthy of serious attention and should reassure those who are concerned about the people's livelihood.

### The Japanese Side is Again Coveting Silver Bars and Copper Ingots Owned by American Merchants Claiming They Belong to the Chinese Side in an Attempt to Seize Them American Merchants Deny Storing Gold and Silver

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday morning (the 6th) that the Japanese authorities here are planning to "confiscate" silver bars and copper ingots worth 6 million yuan stored at No. 178, Lane 1, Dushanfu Road (owned by the American trading firm, Mow Sun). The reason given is that "the Japanese side has obtained evidence proving that these silver bars belong to Chongqing."

Police Detectives Stationed for Protection

Yesterday morning, French Concession police detectives were seen stationed around Mow Sun's Dushanfu Road property. It is confirmed that the property was previously used as a dormitory for rickshaw pullers and was later taken over by Mow Sun. It is reported that the silver bars and copper ingots are all packed in boxes and sealed by the Chinese mint. The French Concession police acknowledged that they have dispatched personnel to guard Mow Sun's property on Dushanfu Road, stating that the police learned that a large quantity of silver and copper was stored there, hence the deployment of police detectives.

American Business Authorities Forcefully Deny It

Mow Sun's Deputy Manager, Mr. Klein, denied that the property contained silver bars, stating that he was unaware that any gold or silver was stored there. He claimed that there were only some old iron goods and that the rumors of silver storage were untrue, so there would be no unusual incidents. Although the French Concession police are observing the property, just as they observe other warehouses, it is quite strange that Mow Sun has not requested police protection.

Japanese Side Reportedly Filed a Protest

It is understood that the Japanese authorities have filed a protest with the American authorities here regarding these silver and copper, but yesterday the official spokesman made no comments. One account stated that Mow Sun has been managing the Dushanfu Road property and the silver and copper inside for over two years, and that the silver bars worth 6 million yuan are mostly stored in the old building formerly used as a rickshaw puller dormitory.

2 Million Yuan in Copper Already Seized

Previously, 2 million yuan worth of copper owned by Mow Sun and stored in the American-owned Ruifeng Transfer Company's warehouse was stolen. Subsequently, the Japanese authorities announced that the copper ingots had been confiscated. The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai filed a protest with the Japanese Consulate, hoping to have the goods returned to their rightful owner.

### Shelter Housing Partially Completed All Necessary Supplies Prepared Small-Sum Relief Loans Available with Guarantee

The construction of the beggar shelter, which began nearly a week ago, is one-third complete. It is expected that the entire project will be completed in three weeks at the latest. The Municipal Council donated 15 mu of vacant land at the intersection of Hed Road and Xingjiapo Road to build 24 wooden sheds. Seven of the sheds have already been completed, each with 20 double-decker beds, accommodating 100 people. The total capacity of the shelter is expected to be 2,000 people.

Entire Project to Be Completed by Year-End

According to Salvation Army Lieutenant Colonel Ma Ruishan, he hopes that the shelter can be officially established by Christmas Day, so that on the day everyone celebrates Christmas, the homeless and foodless beggars can find a place to stay. However, the construction project may not be completed before Christmas Day, but it should be completed by the end of this year at the latest. A Chinese person has been hired as the director of the shelter, and all plans for the shelter have been decided.

Donations from All Sectors Daily Necessities

Cotton clothing, quilts, bowls, chopsticks, and all daily necessities required for the beggar shelter have been ordered by the Salvation Army. Many people from all sectors have also made generous donations. One Chinese person donated all the gifts and items given by relatives and friends for their birthday to the beggar shelter. The Municipal Council also donated 100,000 yuan to cover the full construction costs.

Assisting Released Prisoners to Return Home

In addition to providing small-sum relief loans and distributing rice tickets, the Salvation Army is also very concerned about prisoners who have just been released from prison. The organization sends representatives to visit prisons in Hongkou and the French Concession every day. The Salvation Army provides assistance to return to their hometowns for prisoners who have been released but have nowhere to turn. Currently, the organization has sent over 750 people home. Over 100 people have applied for small-sum relief loans, but applicants must have a reliable guarantor. The loan amount is limited to 30 yuan.

### Baoli Steamer Returns to Shanghai Yesterday After Being Detained in Shipu for a Month

The Baoli steamer, which was detained in Shipu, returned to Shanghai yesterday. The ship sailed from Shanghai to Haimen in the middle of last month. After being denied entry, it changed course to Shipu and was allowed to enter. After the ship, another ship, the Jiangding, also entered Shipu. The Jiangding arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, but the Baoli stayed in Shipu, leading to speculation about the ship's movements. The speculation ended with its return to Shanghai yesterday. The ship did not carry passengers on its return trip and only carried a small amount of local produce. It is expected to dock in Shanghai and will not sail for the time being.

### Shanghai's Chinese-Owned Silk Mills Enter Shutdown State

The silk reeling industry in this city has recently declined due to a sharp decrease in silk exports, leading to business slump. Factories are closing down one after another. At its peak in the previous year, there were as many as 34 Chinese-owned factories in the two concessions. In addition, there were more than ten Japanese and British-owned factories. By June of this year, only 11 Chinese-owned silk mills remained. Recently, they have all completely shut down.

### Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bond Lottery Highly Admired Principal and Interest Not Suspended Due to Shanghai's Fall

In November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued 6 million yuan of Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Public Bonds to repair roads, bridges, and ditches in the disaster area, and to handle other post-disaster reconstruction and relief matters. The designated source of funds for repayment of principal and interest was the Shanghai Municipal Pier Donation Income. Principal and interest were paid in two installments each year, on June 15th and December 15th. The 16th installment of principal repayment was drawn at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) the other day. Two lottery numbers were drawn: No. 55 and No. 57, for a total repayment of 120,000 yuan. The principal and interest of the 16th installment will be paid starting December 15th by HSBC. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to maintain creditworthiness, is continuing to repay the principal and interest on the maturing disaster area reconstruction public bonds, and is not suspending payments due to Shanghai's fall. The bonds were underwritten by the British firm of Lih An at 80% of face value. Most of the bondholders are foreign businessmen. It is reported that the bondholders deeply admire the Chinese government's maintenance of creditworthiness.

### First New Ship of American President Lines Circles the World Passing Through Shanghai Arrives on the 11th and Does Not Accept Tours the Ship's Interior is Exceptionally New and Luxurious

American President Lines is a leading shipping company on the Pacific routes. Its predecessor was the Da Lai Steamship Company. After the outbreak of war in the East in the autumn of 1938, the routes were temporarily suspended. The company was reorganized in mid-October of that year, and the ships resumed sailing. At that time, the company's general manager, Mr. Heechung, announced that due to the loss of the President Hoover in the Far East, the company would temporarily not call at Shanghai and declared that he would do everything possible to call at Shanghai again as soon as possible. The company resumed shipping operations in Shanghai on January 19 of the following year. The first ship to call at Shanghai after the resumption of service was the President Adams. However, apart from the President Coolidge, the routes have not yet been restored to their pre-incident state.

First Ship President Jackson

Since the company's reorganization and resumption of service, it has been working hard to innovate and has allocated 10 million U.S. dollars to build several new ships, including seven world-class liners, three of the same type as the President Coolidge, and four Pacific liners. The first new ship to be built was a world-class liner named President Jackson, which was launched on June 7th of this year at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company. The ship has a displacement of 16,900 tons, a gross tonnage of 9,400 tons, and a speed of 19 knots per hour.

Interior Equipment Excellent in Every Way

It has 96 passenger berths, all of which are first class. There are no second, third, or fourth classes. All cabins are located on both sides of the ship, with ample ventilation. Each cabin has a bathroom and toilet. There is also a dining room, lounge, outdoor swimming pool, and other amenities. The interior temperature is regulated by scientific methods, and the cabin can be kept cool in the summer and warm in the winter without using fans or radiators. All work on the ship is mechanized to reduce manpower. The old ship had 135 crew members, but the new ship has only 110. Loading and unloading cargo is very efficient, with 18 cranes and a capacity for 60,000 cubic feet of refrigerated cargo. The engine has 85,000 horsepower and can travel 19 knots per hour.

Circling the World, Arrives Next Week

The new ships can shorten the world trip by 14 days (formerly 94 days, now only 84 days). The ship is already on its way and is expected to arrive on the 11th of this month, docking at buoys 10, 12, and 13. The company originally planned to host tours for all sectors after the ship arrived in Shanghai, but due to the current extraordinary circumstances, the company has been ordered by headquarters to cancel the tours. The ship will not stay in Shanghai for long, only stopping for one night. The next day (the 12th), it will leave Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Xinggang, Xiaoluzong, and various ports in Southeast Asia. It will then pass through the Cape of Good Hope to return to New York.

Second Ship Also to Set Sail

A total of seven world-class liners of the same design and equipment are being built. The second ship, the President Monroe, was launched on August 7th of this year at the same shipyard. It is currently being outfitted and painted and will set sail for the Far East in February of next year.

President Jackson

The President Jackson is the first completed of the seven new world-class liners. It has a displacement of 16,900 tons and a speed of 19 knots per hour. All passenger berths are first class. The air is regulated by scientific methods, eliminating the need for radiators and fans, keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer.

### Killing Worthless Son Sentenced to Imprisonment

Zhu Zhu, an old Jiangbei woman living in a flat in Haizhou Road, Yangshupu, murdered her 26-year-old son, Zhu Yongxiang, because he did not engage in honest work, was a habitual vagrant, and had recently become addicted to heroin. Lacking money, he specialized in stealing and forcibly extorting money from his older brother, Zhu Yongcheng, and even prostituted his niece, among other things. His mother and brother hated him deeply. They drove him out, and he lived in a makeshift shack on vacant land on Tengyue Road. At 4:30 AM on the 22nd of last month, the mother and brother, along with the son-in-law, Dong Yuanfa, sneaked into Yongxiang's shack and strangled him to death with a hemp rope while he was asleep. The case was discovered, and Western and Chinese detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station arrested Zhu Zhu, her son Yongcheng, and son-in-law Dong Yuanfa and brought them before the First Special Court for interrogation. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over a trial in the First Criminal Court and sentenced Dong Yuanfa, Zhu Zhu, and Zhu Yongcheng to five years in prison for joint homicide. The hemp rope was confiscated.

### Young Girl Marries a Mute Man: Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law in Legal Dispute at Public Court; Daughter-in-Law Accuses Mother-in-Law of Failing to Provide Living and Clothing Expenses; Judge Adjourns Case to Re-examine Mute Husband

Shi Xiangrong, a grain merchant from Chongming residing in Shanghai at No. 1002, Avenue Edward VII, aged 49, was recently sued by his daughter-in-law, Shi Tuyan, at the Civil Division of the First Special District Court. Represented by lawyers Lu Qi and Peng Qi, Shi Tuyan filed a lawsuit against her husband for failing to provide living expenses. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Tao in the First Civil Division. The defendant, Shi Xiangrong, was represented by lawyer Zhang Shibin. Lawyer Lu Qi, representing the plaintiff Shi Tuyan, stated the case, claiming that the plaintiff is 18 years old, from Hunan, and currently residing at No. 44, Xinshi Market, Jing'an Temple Road.

She followed her parents away from her hometown in her youth.

Her father was an instructor at the Central Military Academy, but due to the expansion of the war, her father retreated with the army. The plaintiff and her mother were displaced to Shanghai. As her mother worked for the Xinxiang family, the two women depended on each other. In August of the year before last, the defendant, Shi Xiangrong, asked the plaintiff's mother to read his fortune, and the plaintiff accompanied her. The defendant, admiring the plaintiff's beauty, immediately sent a matchmaker the next day to discuss with the plaintiff's mother, saying that the defendant owned many factories and stores in Shanghai and was a wealthy merchant. The defendant decided that his son was quite talented and wanted to marry the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff's mother, misled by the matchmaker's words, agreed to the engagement on behalf of the plaintiff. From then on, the defendant often visited the plaintiff's home. Later, the

matchmaker delivered the wedding invitation,

stating that the wedding was scheduled for October 17th at the Tiantian Hotel. However, the defendant's first son had already passed away, and the plaintiff was now betrothed to the defendant's eldest son, Shi Zhihe (21 years old this year). At the same time, it was also stated that the defendant's eldest son was mute. At that time, the plaintiff and her mother both objected, but the matchmaker said that the defendant had enormous wealth and was willing to guarantee that the plaintiff would have no financial difficulties in her life. Later, the defendant indeed signed a guarantee, and the plaintiff and her mother agreed. The defendant also stated that he would support the plaintiff's mother for life and provide for her funeral. Unexpectedly, on the

second day of the plaintiff's marriage,

the defendant forbade the plaintiff and her husband from entering the house and rented a room for them in Xujiahui. In the beginning, the defendant provided the plaintiff and her husband with 50 yuan per month for living expenses, and the defendant also paid for firewood, rice, and rent. Later, the defendant did not fulfill his promise, and since December of last year, the defendant has not given a single penny. In February of this year, the defendant forced the plaintiff's husband to the Chongming occupied area. The plaintiff gave birth a few days ago, and the defendant and the plaintiff's husband have ignored the plaintiff's childbirth and medical expenses. Now, she has no choice but to request the court to order the defendant to

hand over the plaintiff's husband,

and order the defendant to pay 1,300 yuan for living expenses from December 15th of last year to December 24th of last year, 85 yuan for medical expenses, 152 yuan for clothing expenses, and 300 yuan for childbirth and baby clothes, and to pay 120 yuan per month for the plaintiff and the child's living expenses starting from next month. Lawyer Zhang Shibin stated that the plaintiff's husband, the defendant's eldest son, Shi Zhihe, although mute, is a photographer. He is now a photographer in Chongming. The living expenses claimed by the plaintiff should be negotiated with Shi Zhihe. The court verified the statements and instructed the defendant's lawyer to notify the defendant to first find a way to raise some childbirth expenses for the plaintiff. The case was adjourned to 3:00 PM on January 6th of next year, pending the summons of Shi Zhihe for further questioning.

They are strong and well-coordinated. In the charity challenge basketball game, they lost to the Paramount by only one point, showing their fighting spirit and cooperation. The latter has new players from the United States this year, making their military appearance magnificent. They showed their prowess in the game last week, and a fierce battle is expected tonight.

In tonight's game against the military officers, they will definitely represent the team to help out to clear up the misunderstanding.

### Food: Foreign Rice Breaks the Three-Day Limit Again; Glutinous Rice Also Sold for 100 Yuan per Stone; Saigon No. 1 Original Packages Even More Hoarded

In the rice market these days, although public announcements have strictly prohibited illegal buying and selling, most speculative merchants are accustomed to it and regard it as mere formality, openly violating it in secret. Yesterday's rice price exceeded the morning market price of three days ago by more than one yuan. These people use the excuse that Saigon orders have no ships to load and that Hong Kong prohibits rice exports as a pretext for major manipulation, benefiting a small number of wholesalers and plunging millions of people into desperation. Therefore, chaos was seen at the opening of the early market, with large households and speculators competing to buy. Those with goods benefited, and the shouting soared all the way up until the market closed, exceeding the three-day limit. Saigon No. 1 opened at 88 yuan, medium at 85 yuan, No. 2 at 81 yuan and a half, and finally settled at 79 yuan and 80 cents. Fire-milled rice opened at 85 yuan and a half, and finally settled at 82 yuan and 70 cents. No. 2 Siamese rice opened at 79 yuan and 80 cents to 79 yuan, small-milled rice opened at 79 yuan to 78 yuan and 80 cents, Tokyo Bojian opened at 78 yuan to 76 yuan and 70 cents, rice chaff opened at 70 yuan and 80 cents to 70 yuan, broken rice opened at 68 yuan and a half to 66 yuan and 40 cents, and Wujian opened at 77 yuan to 76 yuan. and Saigon No. 1 original package, sold by Yinghua, was hoarded and few sold, opening at 96 yuan, December at 94 yuan, small milled at 89 yuan and a half, all about one yuan higher than the previous day. Yinghua's chips were still dry, with only 400-500 tons traded, while spot goods reached 15,000 bags when customers competed to buy them in the warehouses.

The source of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice continues to be stagnant, but the sales market is still retreating due to high prices, and transactions are limited. Therefore, the market is flat. Kunshan special japonica is seen at 99 yuan per dan, large market at 97 yuan and 20 cents, thin rice original package at 94.5 yuan, and dan at 91 yuan to 89 yuan.

As the source of japonica glutinous rice has been cut off for a long time, and the market stock is also decreasing day by day, and it happens to be the season for sales, supply is not enough for distribution, and rare goods are expensive, so it has soared by three to five yuan. Li Yuan opened at 100 yuan, and Hong Kong Bai Yuan also increased by about two yuan, opening at 87 yuan to 84 yuan.

### Australian Flour Continues to Open at 19 Yuan 78 Cents

Flour: Yesterday's market was slightly uneven. According to the inquiries from the flour mills, the market price was still 18 yuan. More than 8,000 bags were allocated at fixed quotas by the Fu and Fu factories at parity prices, and the market was as calm as usual. However, the market transactions were mainly based on foreign flour, but the price varied greatly due to the quality and brand. The most common brands on the market are Bell Tower and Flower and Bird, which are the latest arrivals of Australian flour. Yesterday, it was heard that Australian spot flour opened at 19 yuan and 70 cents, and the market price rose to 80 cents, with 6,000-7,000 bags handled by the local brokers. The road cargo transaction is temporarily in a state of abandonment, because the sellers are shouting high, so there is no formal transaction.

Wheat: Yesterday's transaction was as quiet as usual. Japanese factories paid attention to collecting forward wheat, and Chinese factories were waiting for the supply of foreign wheat, resulting in almost no trade in the market. It was heard that the price of Japanese factories was about 28 yuan, and the price of goods in the concession was shouting at 30 yuan, but there was no actual buyer, and the market is afraid that it will be difficult to open up for a while.

### Gold Market Turns Stable

Yesterday, the spot gold market's black market fluctuations were narrow. Both buyers and sellers held back, mainly because of little change in foreign exchange rates. Overall, the market slightly trended upward. In the afternoon, gold firms and money exchangers bought in, reaching 5,770 yuan. Later, banks and securities firms searched for more, pushing the price to 5,775 yuan. However, due to the exchange rate firming up in the evening, the market eventually retreated, ending with a gain of 18 yuan, closing at 5,748 yuan. The day's trading was very active, with over 7,000 taels traded. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Slightly Trends Upward

In the early morning, the foreign exchange market was quiet, but there were still buyers in the market. The opening price was raised by 10 yuan, with banks and money exchangers buying 20 taels at 5,740 yuan. Soon after, money exchangers continued to buy 30 taels at 5,750 yuan. At this time, gold and silver firms sold a little, causing a pullback of over 10 yuan, with gold firms selling 10 taels to money exchangers at 5,735 yuan. However, soon after, both gold firms and money exchangers bought in, keeping the price very stable. Banks traded 30 taels among themselves, pushing the price up to 5,760 yuan. However, securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, slightly lower by 10 yuan at 5,750 yuan. Eventually, due to the foreign exchange market turning firm, there was an undercurrent of bullish sentiment, and buyers were eager, pushing the price up again. Banks sold 30 taels to gold firms, reaching 5,770 yuan. Until the noon close, banks sold 30 taels to securities firms at 5,764 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with very high confidence. Banks traded 10 taels among themselves at 5,760 yuan. With banks and securities firms searching for more, the price rose to 5,775 yuan, with gold firms buying 30 taels from securities firms. Later, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate was hardening, speculators came to the market to sell, and another bank also dumped, pushing the price down by over 30 yuan. Banks sold 20 taels to money exchangers at 5,740 yuan. The market managed to hold its ground in the evening, closing at 5,748 yuan, an increase of 18 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The daily range was 40 yuan. The spot gold price quoted by gold firms was over 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the quoted gold price, with no trading.

Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in gold shops has not changed. Da Tong Heng quoted 590 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar, with the buying price around 30 yuan lower.

US Dollar Exchange Rate Fluctuates

Yesterday, the foreign currency market situation followed the spot gold market, eventually trending slightly upward. The British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by 5 jiao. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price was stable. The US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, but the change was very small, eventually rising by 5 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes resumed trending upward, with the evening price at 4 yuan and 2 fen. Japanese yen notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable. Korean won notes were in increasing demand, and the market price continued to rise, with the evening price at 1 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen.

Discount Rate Suddenly Rises Again

The discount rate for exchange bills, which is about to disappear, suddenly rose slightly yesterday. The discount rate rose to 1.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, with the discount at 1 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The money changers' association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged, quoted at 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities - Domestic Debt and Foreign Stocks See the Same Downturn - Shanghai Woolen Mill Stock Offering Announced

The securities black market weakened yesterday as banks and money firms released a considerable amount of certificated shares for cash delivery, triggering a general release from floating investors. The market price thus universally retreated slightly, and buyer interest was not strong enough to balance the market, leading to slightly flagging confidence. Throughout yesterday morning, Lianhe bought aggressively, totaling 500,000 to 600,000 [yuan], while Hengkang Yitai also had significant demand. Others such as Renchang and the Sixteenth Company also bought, while Lianyi, Xinfu, Shengda, and Runli sold, with Lianyi being the most active, creating a relatively balanced situation. At the noon close, the price was slightly down by two to three jiao. In the afternoon, Lianyi, Xinfu, Shengda, and Runli continued to sell, and buyer interest gradually waned. Zhongyi also sold aggressively, while the Sixteenth Company and Lianhe released slightly. Buyer interest from Xiexing, Yuanshun, Renchang, Hengfu, Jiufeng, Yiqin, and so on was not strong, and the market price continued to weaken. Type E shares were stable, but the result was a uniform pullback of one to two jiao, up to eight jiao. The turnover was 2,300,000 to 2,400,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---|

Stock Trading: 500 shares of Hanyeping Company stock were traded at a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao.

Also, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was quite quiet in the early morning. This was because trading this week was sluggish, and both buyers and sellers lacked the need for large positions to settle accounts. However, near the close, selling suddenly intensified, and long-held shares declined rapidly, mostly falling to recently unseen levels. Aside from many unconfirmed rumors, there was no way to deduce the reason for this downturn.

The Shanghai Woolen Mill's offering of new shares by a British company has been detailed in this newspaper. The publicly offered subscription was over forty times oversubscribed (yesterday's report omitted the character "ten," resulting in "four times oversubscribed," and the subheading made the same mistake). The allocation method was publicly announced by Luen Yick & Co. yesterday, with 15 shares allocated to those applying for 500 shares, 25 shares for 1,000 shares, 40 shares for 1,500 shares, and 55 shares for 2,000 shares. 85 shares were allocated to those applying for 3,000 shares. The above shares are scheduled to be auctioned at the Shanghai Stock Exchange next week. (Mao)

London, 5th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern commercial company stocks. Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, and only bank stocks in the Far East stocks showed a slight improvement. There were more gains than losses, and the general trend was mostly steady, with only the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's original continuing loan rising by another £1, priced at £15. There were no other changes. Bank stocks: Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £7 10 shillings; HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose £3, priced at £75; Hong Kong-registered shares also rose £2, priced at £78, with quoted prices but no trades. Mercantile Bank shares alone fell 7 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £10 7 shillings and 6 pence, with the rest unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton - Major Players Selling Off - Cotton Yarn Inventory Slightly Loosens

The yarn market has been fluctuating, but is entering a quiet phase. This is because current sales are sporadic, and transactions are still supporting the market. The selling price of 32-count single yarn remains firm. As for foreign exchange, it is also hovering, so the attitude of the remaining groups is also changing and they are beginning to buy. As a result, although major players are selling off, their sales are being absorbed, and the market is thus turning upward. Yesterday, 1,370 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma brand and Nongkai brand yarn demand is firm and rising. Because the market turned upward the day before, everyone in the market is on the buying side. The opening price was 1,232 yuan. Once this price opened, buying continued strongly, rising directly to 1,236 yuan. Unexpectedly, major players sold off one after another. However, the situation remained in this price range for a long time, showing a strong stance. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was fluctuating at 0.3125, which had no major impact on the overall situation. Due to slightly looser inventory, it fell back to 1,231 yuan a few times. However, the bullish camp was very solid. Part of the profit-taking occurred midway, with low prices reaching 1,227 yuan. However, buyers did not disappear, and the price gradually rose back to 1,233-1,234 yuan at the close. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 5,160 bales, and the market for 20-count Shuangma brand was flat. The amounts bought by each group are listed below:

Spot Cotton Demand is Active

Spot cotton trading is slightly sluggish, but the market is strong. This is because yarn factories have demand, so confidence is strong.

In other news, foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to speculative buying, but later fell back due to selling by spot traders and profit-taking by some bulls. As a result, the closing price was 3-4 pound notes higher than the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by a huge 6-7 rupees yesterday.

Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has gradually become more active recently, but is limited to weavers. Both Chinese and Japanese factories have been buying, and traders' optimism is also increasing, so there is a lot of trading. However, the selling price is certainly not good.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Mill Prices Increase Again

Mill cloth prices continued to rise yesterday, due to the recent surge in plain and fine cloth from eastern piece goods, boosting confidence. Traders and dyers were relentlessly searching for supplies. Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang mill's bleached and printed cloth prices increased again by 0.5-1 [yuan]. Selling prices for various cloths: coarse cloth and twill increased by 0.1-0.25 yuan per piece, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and dyed cloth increased by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Velvet was priced according to demand. Shortages in various grades caused an increase of about 0.5 yuan per piece. Trading on the street was very active, with over 1,300 pieces traded, Guangdong and Hong Kong traders bought over 300 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth, Zhejiang and Fujian traders bought over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill bleached cloth, and traders from Yantai in northern China bought over 100 pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth.

Eastern cloth, white goods, and inland dyed goods continue to sell well. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan per piece. Over 700 pieces were traded on the street. Longtou fine cloth reached a high of 36.1 yuan in the after-market, but closed slightly lower at 35.49 yuan. Sijunzi serge was 1.095 yuan.

Exported cotton cloth: yesterday, 551 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

Purchasing Power Gradually Declining - Discounted Woolens Have a Wide Market

The woolen market was in good spirits yesterday, but due to the warm weather, actual sales seemed slightly weaker than the previous week. For standard goods, the selling prices of thick goods and overcoat woolens, regardless of quality, also rose sharply. On the one hand, this gave people the impression that they were unable to afford to buy them. Looking at the inquiries from traders and tailors who have a close relationship, business is worse than in previous years. Aware of this, merchants have found that discounted woolens, which are lower grade and have less wool, are being produced and sold in greater quantities, because they are very suitable for the tastes of ordinary people with limited budgets. Business is very prosperous, and shipments have been increased repeatedly. This is also a phenomenon of adapting to the environment. Yesterday, Zhanghua 918 plain serge was wholesaled at 11.5 yuan per yard, Continental Han Limeng was wholesaled at 13.5 yuan, American Lun Santa Claus Helix was 9.75 yuan, Gongda striped plain wool board was sold at 12.5 yuan, Hualun uniform cloth was 8.25 yuan, Daya discounted straight wool was 1.2 yuan, American Xin discounted shoe cloth was 5.6 yuan, and Yousheng double-sided discounted camel wool was 2.4 yuan.

### Oil Cake - Japanese Traders Sell Off - Oil Market Plummets

Yesterday, the futures vegetable oil market trading remained active. Because most rice speculators had achieved their goals in the rice market, they wanted to show their prowess in the oil market as well. Therefore, after the market opened, they continued to aggressively buy, pushing prices up sharply by about two yuan. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese trading firm suddenly offered a large quantity of crude oil, which immediately reversed market sentiment. Short sellers were greatly encouraged, and selling overwhelmed buying, causing the market to plummet rapidly. As a result, futures prices fell back, while spot prices fluctuated slightly, generally without major changes compared to the previous day. A total of 3,000 barrels of Qingdao crude oil for December delivery and nearly 1,000 barrels for February delivery were traded. Spot transactions included 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 150 pieces of Yantai crude oil, and 20 barrels of Qingdao crude oil.

Yesterday, 1,510 cans of crude oil were shipped from Yantai, and 4,600 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong. Today (7th), 500 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai.

### North and South Goods - Vermicelli and Dried Goods Tight

Vermicelli and dried goods have become scarce recently, and winter sales are more active, leading to further price increases. Longkou vermicelli has reached 150 yuan, Qingdao vermicelli is 135 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli is cheaper, still selling for 90 yuan. The market is stable.

### Sugar Market - Coarse and Refined White Sugar Loosen

The sugar market continued to soften as the foreign exchange rate loosened. The association's clearing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 73 yuan at the wooden pier, down 0.05 yuan, and 72.5 yuan at the foreign pier, down 0.02 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar was 56.1 yuan and 0.2 yuan, unchanged. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was 73.5 yuan at the western pier, down 0.5 yuan, DY mark was 68.8 yuan, HX mark was 68.6 yuan, down 0.4 yuan at the western pier, 68.3 yuan at the eastern pier, winter mist green was 57 yuan, bowl green was 96 yuan. Also, yesterday 150 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Seafood - Stocks of Old Dried Jellyfish Exhausted

Old dried jellyfish is considered the best quality, with a crisp texture and excellent flavor. This year's production was reduced, and stocks of old goods have been exhausted, so the selling price of new goods has risen again. Currently, jellyfish skin is selling for 115 yuan, and jellyfish heads are 85 yuan, up 5 yuan from before.

### Cuttlefish Stocks Gradually Thin

Cuttlefish has been continuously sold to customers recently, and stocks have gradually thinned. Also, the source of supply is sparse, so the market is very tight. Currently, Ningbo goods are selling for 100 yuan, Zhoushan goods are 140 yuan, and Yantai cuttlefish is 145 yuan, an increase of 5-10 yuan.

### Both Chinese and Western Dried Mussels are Expensive

Supplies of dried mussels, such as those from Ningbo, are intermittent, and top-quality goods are perceived as lacking. Therefore, Grade 3 and 4 mussels have risen to 440 yuan, Ningzi mussels are 410 yuan, and North Road mussels, which are mostly used for digestion, are 390 yuan, an increase of 50-60 yuan compared to the previous market. Other imported goods: Siamese small mussels are selling for 180 yuan, medium mussels are 190 yuan, large mussels are 200 yuan, and exported goods are 220 yuan. Recently, these have also increased by 10 yuan.

### Fish Maw Prices Have Reached Their Peak

Fish maw prices are at their peak due to the small amount of production this year, so they are sold as soon as they arrive, with no accumulation of inventory. Recently sold goods, such as diao pian, cost 590 yuan, gong pian 500 yuan, ti pian 670 yuan, and chang jiao 300 yuan. Looking at the current situation, prices have reached their peak.

### Silk and Tea - New York Raw Silk Imports Increase

According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, the New York raw silk inventory and sales statistics report showed that US raw silk imports in November were 48,407 bales, an increase of 4,686 bales compared to October. However, US raw silk sales this month were not high, totaling 36,370 bales, a difference of 3,503 bales compared to October, and a sharp decrease of about 1,000 bales compared to the same month last year. Therefore, silk prices fell that day. New York near-term prices fell from 2.61 yuan to 2.48 yuan, and far-term prices fell from 2.60 yuan to 2.51 yuan. Penang spot prices fell from 1,375 yuan to the support price of 1,350 yuan, and far-term prices fell from 1,385 yuan to 1,366 yuan. As for inventory, it increased, with this month's inventory at 60,330 bales, an increase of 12,033 bales compared to October. The market conditions for various silk products in the US market are listed below.

Yesterday, 67 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong, and today (7th), 400 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin.

### Metals: Limited Sales of Binding Wire, Prices of Galvanized Iron Sheets Rise Steadily

Recent trading of binding wire has been sluggish due to stagnant demand from out-of-town merchants in areas like Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao. Sales rely solely on small purchases from local iron factories and construction companies, resulting in limited actual sales. Consequently, prices have remained stable without significant increases, with yesterday's price at fifty-two yuan per dan (a unit of weight), and approximately two hundred dan were traded.

Six and seven-foot galvanized iron sheets are experiencing rising prices due to a shortage of raw materials, resulting in limited production. Additionally, local stove factories, galvanized iron workshops, and construction companies are constantly seeking these materials, leading dealers with small amounts of stock to hold out for higher prices, quoting prices two to three jiao higher than before. Seven-foot sheets are priced at nine yuan and three jiao, and six-foot sheets at eight yuan and three jiao.

### The Need for Daycare Centers

By Mu Zhen

Women with higher education often hope to continue working in society after marriage. However, reality often disappoints them. Once they have children, there is a lack of caregivers at home. Should they entrust the children to servants? They are somewhat uneasy because servants are mostly uneducated and their childcare methods may be unreasonable. If they don't give the children to servants, what should they do? After all, children are their own. Sending children to kindergarten is an option, but kindergarten dismissal times are too early, conflicting with work hours. Moreover, kindergartens generally do not accept children under four years old. So, how should children under four be cared for? This is a major problem for modern women, especially those who rely on dual incomes to support their families.

Many highly educated female university graduates, with rich knowledge, end up burying their decade-plus of education in a small sphere—a household—fulfilling their natural duties. Indeed, they have fulfilled their responsibilities as virtuous wives and good mothers, but they are ultimately confined to a small circle, making their vast knowledge somewhat wasted! Now, to solve the problem of childcare for women serving society, we cannot do without daycare centers. Daycare centers can provide children with appropriate care and natural development. Only then can women serving society work with peace of mind in their careers, while their children receive reasonable care and upbringing.

In the past, there were daycare centers established in Shanghai, but they were small in scale and lacked comprehensive organization, causing parents to feel uneasy. However, establishing a better daycare center requires substantial funds. This is because daycare centers are not profit-making institutions but are intended to benefit the public. Furthermore, competent management is equally important. Therefore, I ultimately hope that people from all walks of life will jointly raise funds to operate daycare centers, benefiting the community by solving the childcare problem for women serving society and securing proper and reasonable care for children.

Editor's Note: In previous discussions in this column on the issue of women's career paths, many authors have raised the need for daycare centers. Addressing the concerns of working women about their families is indeed something that must be addressed. Recently, it was reported that the YWCA is actively planning to establish two daycare centers, which is undoubtedly good news. It is said that a charity sale will be held tomorrow (December 8th) from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM at 323 Muir Road (intersection of Jing'an Temple Road), organized by the YWCA, with the aim of raising funds for daycare center expenses. We hope that enthusiastic men and women will strive to help them to ensure the success of this endeavor.

### Female Load Carriers

— Yi Nai

Last autumn, I traveled from Shanghai to Shaoguan. When I passed through Hong Kong's Kowloon and arrived at Shayuchong on the edge of Guangdong, I couldn't help but develop a novel and profound impression of Guangdong women. Along the road between Shayuchong and Danshui, I saw thousands upon thousands of load carriers lined up, carrying large boxes of kerosene, cigarettes, matches, various merchandise brought in from Hong Kong, and native products such as paper, tea, and mushrooms exported from the mainland. Among these load carriers coming and going, women made up the majority. I then took a sedan chair from Danshui to Huiyang. While waiting for a boat to Laolong on the Jiang River in Huiyang, the porters, carrying shoulder poles, bustling, scrambling, and pushing like ants to get onto the boat, were also two-thirds women. Some were as old as forty or fifty, some as young as fifteen or sixteen. All were barefoot, with their heads wrapped in square cloths, skin dark and yellow, and bodies so upright. Carrying luggage weighing hundreds of pounds, they walked faster than the unburdened gentlemen and young masters. And as the sun set in the west, they might even sing mountain songs. At this time, looking at their strong and healthy backs from behind and listening to their clear and loud singing, a beautiful picture unfolded before your eyes by the mountains and waters covered in rosy clouds, and the people in the picture were also beautiful. At this time, you, ah, might temporarily forget your lover with permed hair and high heels who remains in your mind!

Some of these female load carriers rely on carrying loads for a living, while others treat it as a side job, aiming to earn extra money to supplement their household income. However, the price of their labor is extremely low. Before the war, carrying a load of luggage from the dock to the hotel only cost one haozi (less than one jiao of national currency). Since the outbreak of the war, partly because prices have soared and partly because of the increase in travelers to the mainland, their asking prices have gradually increased. Each load now requires one jiao to four jiao of national currency. Long-distance carrying, calculated by the mile, costs five jiao per mile. It is said that a load carrier can earn an average of one and a half yuan per day because they can walk seventy to eighty miles a day. However, this kind of business is not available every day. Moreover, in addition to carrying loads, they also have to bear all other labor-intensive tasks at home and raise their children! Some of them have lost their husbands, some have husbands with low incomes, and some have husbands who have gone abroad, so their income is almost entirely used to support their families. With the price of rice soaring to seventy or eighty yuan today, the austerity of their lives can be imagined.

These female load carriers are not only strong but also quite courageous. The work of carrying loads at the front lines is also mostly carried out by them. During intense work, their wide-brimmed straw hats are sometimes hit by one or two bullets, but their attitude is very calm. In their eyes, bullets are like small stones, not worth paying attention to. From their work achievements and their large, intelligent eyes, we can also know that they are not only strong and brave but also have high innate abilities. Unfortunately, they lack educational opportunities, and almost ten out of ten are illiterate, so they labor like cattle and horses all year round, living lives similar to cattle and horses.

Seeing the female load carriers of Guangdong, I can't help but think of the issue of women's employment. In cities, aren't there still some gentlemen and young masters who oppose women's employment? Even last year, the post office had a controversy over a decision not to recruit female employees. The reason they hold is, of course, nothing more than the principle of men managing external affairs and women managing internal affairs. However, these female load carriers can freely engage in carrying loads as a profession in the countryside, and no one opposes them. What is the reason for this? Here, it can only be left to the gentlemen and young masters to answer themselves.

### (1) Rowing with Women

The Veranda of the Hanging Rainbow is a famous scenic spot outside the East Gate of Songling. In springtime, the beautiful scenery is like a painting. On the embankment, willow catkins flutter in the wind like smoke or mist, reflecting the verdant spring water. Everything above and below is a jade green, dotted with the crimson blossoms of peach trees and the delicate white flowers of plum trees. One cannot help but feel the brilliance and richness, as if Heaven deliberately exhibits its creative power, developing the beauty of spring and embroidering this bright scene on the earth, allowing the scholars and maidens who cherish the spring scenery to feast their eyes, broaden their minds, and delight their senses. Even the little birds in the forest are flying up and down, chirping endlessly, singing the praises of the earth's springtime colors. The sun has already passed noon. On the river, there is a painted boat with cassia oars and magnolia paddles, gently floating on the green waves. The boatman is poling, and the boat girl is rowing, both wearing joyful expressions on their faces. In the front cabin, exquisite and delicate betel nut wooden chairs are lined up on both sides, and several women and young servants are sitting on them, watching the people in the middle cabin, as if they are attending to them. In the middle cabin, several men and women are sitting, laughing and cheerfully drinking wine and composing poems. In the center sits a scholar over fifty years old, wearing a scholar's cap and gown, with a short beard on his chin and a spirited and handsome appearance, waving a gilded paper fan with a spring breeze on his face. Beside him sit a pair of flower-like sisters. The one on the left is about eighteen or nineteen years old, with cloud-like hair, bright eyes, and white teeth, possessing an oval face, which is very well-proportioned and fair, with cheeks as dazzling as peach blossoms, glowing with light. She wears a light red shirt, and has curved eyebrows and a small waist, slender and graceful, like a person in a painting. The one on the right is still young, but she also has eyebrows like spring mountains and eyes like autumn waves, revealing gentleness, charm, intelligence, and nothing vulgar. On the table are many fine wines and delicious dishes. The scholar sitting in the middle, stroking his short beard with one hand and waving his folding fan with the other, said to the two with a smile, "The ancients said: 'If you don't do useless things, how can you spend your finite life?' I live in seclusion in this countryside, where flowers and birds delight the heart, and music cultivates the mind. I don't want to go back to the officialdom to mingle again. Life is only a hundred years long, so when will one need wealth and honor? Why should I be with oxen and horses in the same stable, and chickens and ducks scrambling for food? The most precious things in the world are heroic figures, famous scholars, and beautiful women. I know that although I don't have the talent to assist a king, my pen is no less capable than Jiang Lang, who once had a dream that made his pen produce flowers. In the years since I retired from public life, I have only been composing poems to entertain myself. Although I cannot achieve the joy of Wangchuan, I know that among the famous scholars of Songling, who else is there but me? What is gratifying is that you, the talented and beautiful, green and red-hearted Liu sisters, are often by my side,娇憨linghui, like little birds clinging to people, no different from flowers that understand words and grass that relieves worries. Whenever I see your beautiful faces, all my worries immediately disappear. I imagine that the two Qiaos of Jiangdong back then could not monopolize the heavens at the beginning. They can be called peerless beauties. How could this be accidental?" The younger one listened and giggled, saying, "We are all mediocre people, fortunate to meet Master Zhang who does not abandon our humble status, teaching us to read and write, and to compose poetry. To have such a good teacher is truly rare." The scholar smiled and said, "Jiang Zi, although you are young, you are very diligent. Although you are not as good as your sister in calligraphy and poetry, you are also a promising talent, whose future cannot be limited. I will look for a good young man to be your matchmaker, okay?" After saying that, he laughed heartily, revealing a very pleased look. (2)

### The Story of the Great Man "Edison"

— Paul

Thomas Edison spent his childhood in hardship and entered adulthood, but difficulties and obstacles still did not leave him. When he left Boston and arrived in New York, he was experiencing the pain of bankruptcy. He carried a package of books between his less-than-tidy clothes, which even aroused the suspicion of the police and caused them to fire a warning shot.

He arrived in New York to work at his Uncle Byers' place, but he was not a talent for sweeping the office, so whenever he had a chance, he would pick up his beloved books and study them, and in his spare time, he would conduct electrical experiments.

He was determined to see Mr. Teager, the director of the Gold Indicator Bureau. He was repeatedly embarrassed by being turned away. The opportunity finally came one day. When the price of gold was fluctuating, the machine unexpectedly broke down. When no one could repair it and everyone was in a panic, Edison stepped forward and immediately repaired the machine. In the meeting with Qin Jiade and General Bao Hui'er, he obtained their agreement to start manufacturing a more perfect gold reporting machine.

On his first day of work, he happened to encounter a great storm. When he arrived at the entrance of the Western Union Factory, he encountered a beautiful young woman—Miss Mary Stilwell. Her umbrella was turned inside out by Edison, so his first job was to repair the umbrella.

Because the young woman's workplace was on the floor above Edison's factory, she worked at the Cash Dong Telegraph Chain Plate Factory and understood Morse code. When he repaired the umbrella and returned it to its owner, he could not help but be imprinted with her beautiful and lovely image. However, he had no money, so he could not accept her request to go out for dinner together. However, they ended up meeting in a restaurant. Edison only ate an apple pie and a glass of fresh milk, but Mary ate a full meal. As a result, the only dime in Edison's pocket was not enough to pay the bill. Fortunately, Mary adapted to the situation and threw a gold coin from her purse, pretending that Edison had dropped it. This small loan was repaid by Edison when he received his first month's salary. After that, they began to interact with each other, and their love gradually grew.

With day and night efforts and the cooperation of various workers, the desired machine was finally successful. Edison received a reward of forty thousand yuan. He returned to the factory and used an iron pipe that he usually used to send a Morse telegram to his lover. The telegram was so explosive that his colleagues listened intently with bated breath.

"Forty thousand yuan, I want to set up my own factory."

That reply said, "I knew you would do that, Tom." Unexpectedly, he then sent the code "Will you marry me?" and the response was not unexpected. So a cooperative man and woman embraced in front of many colleagues.

The experimental laboratory in Menlo Park was then established, and Edison also enjoyed a beautiful family life in his spare time from work. In his laboratory, he invented more than a thousand things, but he also experienced several emergencies that brought him to the brink of bankruptcy. When he had no other choice, he had to retreat to a hiding place.

Before the invention of the light bulb, when he was in financial straits, he even had to dismiss all the workers, but they were still willing to work, which unintentionally gave him the inspiration to manufacture the phonograph. On a certain evening, his voice was released from the wax disc.

Among Edison's various inventions, the light bulb is the greatest, requiring the most time and energy, and suffering the most failures. In the end, he was successful. The first light bulb continued to burn for forty hours, and many workers excitedly waited to see the light that had never existed in the world.

The difficulties had not been completely overcome. Qin Jiade was also a powerful opponent because he owned many gas stocks. However, no matter how difficult things were, with strong perseverance, he was eventually able to succeed. Edison also laid the electrical wires for the entire city of New York within the limited time of six months and set up a perfect power plant. Before the lighting ceremony, there was also an accident that caused damage. As a result, at 3:00 PM on Monday, September 4, 1882, the light shone on the entire city of New York. Mr. Teager's face was also hit by an overly excited person and covered with a hat.

### Impressions of the Film "Young Edison" Essay Contest "Young Edison" Youth Group First Place

— Ju Zichun

I feel very fortunate that I was able to see the childhood life of the great inventor Edison on the screen.

Edison grew up in a family that was not economically wealthy. Although he had a loving mother and a lively and lovely younger sister who sympathized with him, his father was so rude and strict. Because he liked to use chemical medicines as toys, he often caused trouble; when his father found out, he would be beaten or severely scolded. Later, he was even expelled from school for causing trouble. After that, his father hated him even more, not giving him money to buy books, nor sending him to school. However, Edison was not disappointed. He enlarged his courage and struggled with the environment. He relied on his own efforts and finally obtained the permission of the stationmaster of the railway station to start his telegraph business in a small place on the train.

Edison worked hard. He copied and arranged the news he heard, quickly printed it into newspapers and sold them, and the sales were not bad. He earned some money from this, and he used these hard-earned rewards to buy books to read. Therefore, after each spring flower and autumn wind, after each long summer and severe winter, there would always be a few new books added to his bookshelf. Although he could not go to school, this did not obliterate his spirit of reading.

While Edison was working as a news vendor, he continued his experimental work. Once, he mixed a kind of explosive, almost causing a fire in the train. The stationmaster was furious and threw away all his medicines and gave him a slap in the face, driving him off the train.

Poor Edison failed again. His most beloved medicines were thrown away, his ears were deafened, and he was trapped in a difficult environment. People did not give him sympathy or pity. On the contrary, batches of sarcasm and ridicule, like cold arrows, were thrown at him mercilessly. But our great inventor did not give up at all, and struggled forward. The more difficult the environment, the more determined his mind, making him more motivated, carrying a happy heart to complete his wish.

"Young Edison" is really too moving for me. It not only made me shed tears of sympathy, but also gave me courage and enthusiasm. I deeply feel that: if we want to break out a bright road from a bad surrounding, we will definitely suffer many tortures. We must break through difficulties and rely on our own efforts. We must have the determination to improve and the spirit of struggle. If things fail, we should not be sad or discouraged in vain. We must continue to persevere and struggle with the environment, then success often follows failure. Finally, we must also have a warm hope and a happy mood. Without hope, we will not work hard at all; without happiness, we cannot create everything.

When I write this article under the light of the electric lamp, I cannot help but think of the gifts given to us by this great inventor; his success has changed the lives of all mankind. However, let us not forget that this great inventor was tempered by hardship. Today, when we commemorate him, the most important thing is that we should learn from him the spirit of self-reliance and work hard to create a great cause for the benefit of the country and the people!

### Reading "Young Edison" Essay Manuscript

— Xu Baiyi

Although the prize for the "Young Edison" essay contest has a profound meaning, it cannot be said to be very generous. It is indeed a difficult task to be selected within the top ten among thousands of people. However, there are still many brave young men and women and modern parents among the readers of Shen Bao who resolutely and enthusiastically participated in this competition. This courage and spirit are very admirable; at the same time, it also shows the positive impact of this competition on society.

A total of 4,543 manuscripts were received, including 2,232 from the parents' group. Because it is necessary to watch the film first before writing, there are such results under such an invisible and unavoidable restriction, which is already very successful.

Edison's childhood is indeed worthy of praise. If there were no various encounters in his childhood, he would never be able to endure the repeated failures in his adulthood; if there were no perseverance developed in his childhood, he would never have produced his rich achievements in his adulthood.

From the essay manuscripts, I have experienced the outpouring of true feelings, the boiling of enthusiasm, and the resonance of the soul: I have observed beautiful writing, sincere sentences, and firm will. The lazy young people regret their past and start their efforts in the future; strict fathers despise their masks and show a lovely smile; loving mothers celebrate their sincere love and unwavering beliefs; and the general public believes that "Young Edison" is a beautiful work with a great impact on society, and places ardent expectations on the Chinese film industry.

Undoubtedly, every participant has sympathized with Edison's childhood circumstances and shed hot tears. The deep impression is no different from a milestone worth commemorating on everyone's life journey. Looking at a large pile of letters, it is like watching a large group of hopeful young people who have received the correct enlightenment and are advancing towards a bright future. How can one not be excited and moved!

In general, every essay manuscript is excellent. However, due to the limitation of the number of awards, a selection process had to be carried out. However, while the winners are worthy of joy, the losers do not have to be disappointed. In fact, young people with the spirit of Edison should not know the word disappointment. Because the greatest motivation for this essay is to promote and carry forward the spirit of Edison, to make modern youth as the basis for self-cultivation, the basic service to society, and to enable modern parents to adopt the correct methods to nurture the talents of the country. The setting of prizes is nothing more than to enliven the market.

If Mr. Edison were still alive, he would definitely approve of this essay contest.

### Second Place in the Essay Contest (Youth Group)

— Huang Zixiang

I haven't been to the cinema for a long time. This time, it was Fen's treat. She bought the tickets in advance, giving me the opportunity to go to the magnificent and splendid Dahua to see "Young Edison."

When we came out, Fen walked with me, heading west along Jing'an Temple Road.

"Xiang, you are Tom, and I am Danny. We are all on the same path."

"Really? Am I worthy? - The great Edison, I am only worthy of worshiping him."

"Isn't that so? - Edison said to his sister on the road that he wanted to be Washington and Franklin? Haven't you told me that before? Xiang, I see that you seem a little颓唐 lately, so I specially invited you to watch this film. 'Shun is a man, and I am also a man;' Edison is certainly worthy of our worship, but even more worthy of our emulation. To be honest, his environment at the time was not better than yours now: he was expelled from school, beaten by his father, ridiculed and abused by the people of the whole town, and even considered mentally deranged, behaving abnormally - a madman. However, although he felt severe mental pain, he still pursued knowledge everywhere to satisfy his innate curiosity. He resolutely struggled with the environment, doing hard work and being a vendor - when I saw him flattering and giving cigarettes and newspapers to the guests in the train, while buying books one by one, I was so moved that I shed tears."

"Yes, I also shed tears. My several old books and pirated books were almost bought in this way."

"That's right, so I said you are Tom. Although what you like is literature. Furthermore, I learned that the reason why Edison was able to succeed as a great scientist who contributed to human culture is not entirely due to his heavy curiosity and agile thinking, but mostly due to his broad human love. People ridiculed him, laughed at him, and beat him, but what he answered to people was always sincere service and a pure and innocent love. When the telegraph operator at the station disliked his restlessness and drove him away, he risked his own life to save a girl who was in the care of the operator from under the train. When the Civil War broke out, he published a newspaper to support Lincoln, who was fighting for justice. When the people of the whole town refused to give him work and instead laughed at him and scolded him, he volunteered to use the train's whistle to save a train of passengers who were about to be killed, most of whom were relatives and friends of those who laughed at him and scolded him. Without this kind of human love that repays evil with good, there would be no great figures in the world. Xiang, you often tell me stories about Tolstoy's novels, and you should definitely see this point more clearly than I do."

"Oh - but you forgot another point."

"What?" Fen looked at me suspiciously, and her footsteps almost stopped.

"I think that most of Edison's human love was given to him by his mother. If there were no such discerning and loving mother to comfort him in his pain and encourage him in his despair, I doubt whether we would have the fortune to enjoy the gifts of this great scientist today. Motherly love is great, as great as the great achievements of the great scientist. However -"

"However, you have lost your mother, so you feel that life is lonely? Xiang, we -"

Fen didn't go on, but her eyes turned red.

At this time, we had reached the trolley station at the intersection of Seymour Road, and everyone stopped. I took Fen's hand, smiled warmly, and said:

"Fen, don't worry, I have a Danny, and that's enough. I haven't wavered, I'll listen to you, I want to be Tom. - Thank you for inviting me to watch this film -"

I said goodbye to Fen in excitement. In the car, I was lost in thought. When the kind and respectful image of the mother appeared in my mind, I unconsciously took off the hat on my head, and at the same time, I almost heard a burst of warm applause.

### "Young Edison" Essay Contest Parent Group First Place

— Shen Zhaohua

The MGM Company's "Young Edison" film gives us a lot of enlightenment on parental education.

First: Parents should center on children's interests, cultivate them as much as possible, and develop their strengths. Edison liked to study natural science since he was a child. Although his father treated him very strictly, he still allowed him to have many bottles and jars and chemical medicines in a small room downstairs. Edison could concentrate on playing his favorite scientific tricks in the room without being interfered by adults. His later contributions to mankind may not have originated from this.

Second, parents should encourage children to live independently. When Edison was in his teens, he left home and sold newspapers and candies on the train alone. His parents were actually willing to let this young son stay away from their knees. This point is very worthy of attention. We should not treat our children as private property and forever confine them within the family. On the contrary, we should cultivate children's independent personality and gradually develop their interests outside the family. When they grow up, they can devote themselves to society and not suffer from leaving home.

Third: Children's grades in school can only represent a superficial evaluation. Edison's grades in school were very bad. The teacher even thought he was unpromising. His father was also very disappointed because of this. But in fact, Edison was not only not stupid as his teacher said, but he was an extremely clever genius. It can be seen that there are many reasons for children's failure in school, and stupidity is not the only factor. Therefore, if the children's grades are not good, parents do not have to be discouraged, let alone angry. They should further study the reasons why the grades are not good and then take appropriate measures.

Fourth: To change children's habits, scolding is not an effective method. Edison liked to put his hands in his pockets, but his father didn't like this, so he was repeatedly scolded. But Edison's habit was never changed. Here, the director of the "Young Edison" film pointed out a common and most ineffective disease that parents easily commit.

Fifth: Children's thoughts are sometimes more precise and reasonable than adults. Edison came up with the method of using mirrors to reflect and increase the light, and he also came up with the method of using steam whistles to send telegrams. These were all problems that adults could not solve at the time. Edison breathed a sigh of relief for many children. Therefore, although children's ages are naive, their opinions are worthy of respect and should not be ignored.

Sixth: It seems that "kindness" is more important than "strictness" for parents to treat their children. Edison's father was a typical "strict father". Edison did not dare to look his father in the eye at ordinary times, nor did he dare to say a word more in front of his father. Later, he even ran away privately. How unfortunate this is. If his father could treat his son with the attitude of a "loving mother", wouldn't the harmonious family life be more tasteful?

Seventh: Although Edison's father was a little too strict, when he learned that Edison had saved the lives of the entire train, he realized the mistake of his past observations and changed his attitude. This spirit of daring to correct mistakes is also worthy of every parent to emulate. In general, people often hold the view that "there are no wrong parents in the world", and their prejudices are deep, persistent to the end, and absolutely unwilling to admit their mistakes in front of their children. This is really the biggest mistake.

### Editor's Note

"Young Edison" and "Great Man Edison" are not only of great significance for education, but also have a great relationship for the promotion of family and social happiness. This newspaper has jointly organized the essay contest with MGM and Dahua Cinema. The results are good, which shows that this move is valued by all walks of life and is really valuable to hold. It is hoped that in the future, our domestic film companies will produce equally great products to the world, and this newspaper is also happy to cooperate to contribute. In addition, today's newspaper will suspend "Entertainment Circle" for one issue due to space reasons. Hope readers pay attention.

□Notice The second place in the essay contest "Parents' Group" will be published in the next issue.

### Edison Anecdotes

— Humorous

The great inventor Edison invited guests to visit his new home. The house was for summer use, and the architecture was very exquisite. All kinds of equipment that could save manpower were also complete. However, there was a revolving gate that was very clumsy and had to be pushed hard to open. After the guests pushed the door in one by one, one guest suddenly asked: "All the equipment in your house is very good, but why is that strange gate alone like this?" The host looked around and said with a smile: "Thank you all, whoever can turn this door will have drawn eight gallons of water for me and stored it in my rooftop pool!"
