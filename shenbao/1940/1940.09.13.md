### Fierce Battles in Southern Shanxi and Northern Henan; Chinese Forces Achieve Major Victories; The Situation of the Japanese Army on the Side of the Tongpu Railway Becomes More Difficult; Baiche Town in Northern Henan Captured by Chinese Forces

Luoyang: In the past week of fighting in Shanxi and Henan, the Chinese forces have repeatedly achieved major victories. The Japanese army in Shanxi province, in particular, is feeling the difficulties. The Chinese forces are densely deployed on both sides of the Tongpu Railway, launching a pincer attack on the railway line, making it difficult for the Japanese army to ensure transportation. The Chinese forces active in the triangle area are sweeping and mopping up in various locations east of Wenxi and Xiaxian, and Fuzhia Xie,斬獲數百, and have taken swift action to resolutely annihilate the Japanese on the Zhangmao Main Road. The Chinese forces' offensive will become more and more smooth. The battle situation is also fierce on the line of Fushan and Yicheng on the east side of Linfen. The Chinese army is intensifying its sweeps in the Lingchuan area, yielding great results. There is still fierce fighting at the northern end of Tongpu and the western section of Zhengtai. The fighting in Henan Province is most intense in northern Henan. The Chinese army has been in contact with the Japanese army south of Tangyin and in the western section of Daoqing for several days, and has launched fierce attacks on various strongholds, including Qinbo, a vital stronghold of the Japanese army. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. In summary, the situation of the Japanese army in the Shanxi-Henan battlefield is gradually becoming difficult, and it is completely in a passive position. The time of victory for the Chinese army is getting closer and closer. (12th dispatch)

Luoyang: Since the Zhengtai railway was cut off by the Chinese, and at the same time, all the strongholds in southern Shanxi were fiercely attacked by the Chinese everywhere, the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses and feels unable to cope. Now it is carrying out small-scale mobile disturbances and is spreading rumors of reinforcements in order to confuse the Chinese army. On the evening of the 4th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on various strongholds outside Xiaxian, north and south of the mountain base. Another unit carried out sabotage of communications in the Shangfeng Village area southeast of Wenxi, with great gains. (12th dispatch)

Luoyang: The battle situation in northern Henan is fierce. The Chinese army has repeatedly achieved victories north of Qinyang. On the morning of the 11th, it captured Lanche Town (north of Qinyang) in one fell swoop, annihilating all the Japanese troops there. At the same time, it also recovered the strongholds of Shuikui and Yidaotou one after another. It is now actively advancing toward the Qinbo Highway. A train on the Daoqing Railway was traveling from east to west at Shiziying on the evening of the 1st when it hit a Chinese mine, and was completely destroyed, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. (12th dispatch)

It has been posted on the streets of major cities and published in large print in various newspapers. The notice stated that Sichuan has a bumper harvest, and there is no shortage of rice at present.

At the same time, Lu Zuofu, Vice Minister of Transportation and Director of the National Food Administration, convened a meeting of Sichuan leaders in Chengdu, and stipulated October 15 as the deadline for the sale of stored rice. After this date, the government will confiscate hoarded rice and fine hoarders twice the value of the stored rice.

Editorial

### Speculation on Soviet-Japanese Diplomacy

Yesterday's commentary on Japan's appointment of Ambassador Tatekawa Yoshitsugu to the Soviet Union explained that Japanese diplomacy is seeking a way out in a state of anxiety and restlessness; it has both extravagant hopes and deep suspicions of the Soviet Union; and the Soviet Union, although it believes that it may not be impossible to coexist peacefully with Japan, does not trust Japan; the situation is turbulent, and the competition between the United States and Japan in Soviet diplomacy seems to have begun. Tokyo newspapers also discussed this issue extensively yesterday, expressing their desire to cooperate with the Soviet Union on the one hand, and pointing out that the problems between the two countries, such as the coal and kerosene issues in northern Sakhalin and commercial border issues, have not been resolved; however, they also believe that now is the best time to overcome difficulties and solve problems.

The most contradictory focus between the Soviet Union and Japan lies in the East Asian continent; in recent years, the Soviet Union and China have established good friendship, while Japan is carrying out its large-scale aggression against China; this further highlights the deep contradiction and sharp opposition between the Soviet Union and Japan. Under such circumstances, talking about improving Soviet-Japanese relations, and even the Soviet-Japanese friendship that Tokyo newspapers are blowing, must be based on eliminating contradictions and easing opposition. However, the Soviet Union has its consistent policy, namely, it will never sacrifice its friendship with China; what Japan urgently needs is to ask the Soviet Union to passively stop aiding China, so that it can actively complete its aggression. From this point alone, it can be inferred that no matter how Japan and the Soviet Union maneuver diplomatically, no matter how close they get to the unresolved issues, their achievements will inevitably have their limits. To put it bluntly, unless China's war of resistance achieves victory in terms of sovereign territorial integrity, and unless China becomes an independent and strong country between imperialist Japan and communist Soviet Union, acting as a buffer, the opposition and contradictions between the Soviet Union and Japan cannot be resolved. If, at present, it is said that the Soviet Union is not afraid of the serious threat to it after Japan's aggression against China succeeds, and that it is not worried about the rise of anti-Soviet sentiment in the Far East, and that it will encourage the aggressor and make a comprehensive compromise with it, this is absolutely impossible. If it is said that Japan, in view of this, abandons its aggression against China in order to relieve the Soviet Union's worries, and shakes hands with the Soviet Union in peace, this is also impossible, at least at present.

Soviet-Japanese cordiality may be possible, then wait for future, perhaps drastic changes. One is when the Soviet Union must participate in the European war, and the other is when Japan engages in the Pacific War. By that time, one of the Soviet Union and Japan will have to make concessions and drastically change the opposition and contradiction, in order to promote a short-term reconciliation between the two countries. We do not necessarily assert that this day will never come, but it is definitely not today. As far as the Soviet Union's view of the European situation is concerned, because of Germany's gradual victory on the European continent, the estrangement and friction between the Soviet Union and Britain have been reduced in fact to almost zero; therefore, the various accusations and indignant remarks that the Soviet Union made against Britain after August and September last year, which seemed irreconcilable, no longer exist. As for the Near East and India, perhaps some new actions by the Soviet Union may lead to the deterioration of British-Soviet relations; but because of the various potential disputes between the Soviet Union and Italy in the Balkans, and because of the potential opposition between the Soviet Union and Germany in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union is unwilling to launch any new actions. Moreover, if Germany and Italy achieve a definite victory in Europe, then even if the Soviet Union takes any action in the Near East and India, it will still feel that the expected gains are unstable. In short, as far as the current situation is concerned, it is unimaginable for the Soviet Union to participate in the European war in order to deal with Britain. Conversely, if a serious conflict occurs between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy, then it will not be the time for the Soviet Union to seek compromise from Japan, but the time for Japan to exert its oppression on the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union must seek alliances at that time, and Japan is definitely not its choice.

As for Japan engaging in the Pacific War, it is the inevitable risk that Japan will encounter in its efforts to advance southward. For the sake of the Pacific War, it must compromise with the Soviet Union; but at present, it cannot be said that Japan is willing to make any major concessions to the Soviet Union in advance in order to prepare for the Pacific War. Taking the Soviet-German agreement in August last year as an example, it is conceivable that a Soviet-Japanese compromise could be reached before Japan goes to war in the Pacific; however, the conditions are very different and cannot be compared. The establishment of the Soviet-German agreement was promoted by the reactionary attitude of Britain on the one hand, but there is no attitude in the Far East that stimulates the Soviet Union in this way; on the other hand, Germany has the determination to fight against Britain, but Japan is only a smokescreen for diplomatic manipulation and has no determination to go to war. Taking a step back, Japan has to fight in the Pacific, and the Soviet-Japanese compromise is established before or after the outbreak of the Pacific War, but the content of the compromise is at most that the Soviet Union will provide Japan with a guarantee of non-aggression, and will never tolerate Japan completing its anti-Soviet camp on the East Asian continent while fighting in the Pacific. This point alone is far from the Soviet-Japanese friendship that Japan yearns for today.

Looking at the Soviet Union's policy, it still hopes for an international balance of power, not for any hegemony to be established outside its borders. In fact, this policy, apart from hegemonic countries, is the basic principle of any country. However, the Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia and needs to cope with both the East and the West, making it even more necessary to adhere to this policy. Assuming that the observation is not mistaken, since the outcome of the European war will be beyond pre-war expectations, and to say that the Soviet Union will now rashly befriend Japan in the Far East without avoiding encouragement, is this reasonable!

### Hong Kong Newspapers Widely Report That the US Has Agreed to Lend China a Huge Amount of Money; The Loan Amount is US$135 Million; Song Ziwen is Scheduled to Return to China from the US in Mid-October

Hong Kong: According to opinions from various circles in this port close to the Chinese government's Ministry of Finance, although there is no confirmation from Washington regarding Song Ziwen's US$135,000,000 loan, it is widely believed to be true. The Hong Kong Star, run by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, reported that the loan is very reliable. The Chinese Evening News, which is close to the Chinese financial community, also widely reported on the matter. Other news sources said that the US loan was US$100,000,000. According to the half-official Chongqing news, Song Ziwen's loan from the United States was based on the following full text: Song Ziwen, who has a secret mission from the Chinese government, has completed his scheduled plan in the United States and is scheduled to return to China in mid-October. After arriving in the United States, Song Ziwen has maintained constant contact with the Chinese government. Through Song Ziwen's efforts, both official and non-official circles in the United States are willing to provide assistance to the Chinese government in diplomacy and economy. It is reported that half of the US loan is in cash and half is in the form of credit, totaling US$135 million. It is heard that the Chinese government's collateral has also been approved by the US side. After Song Ziwen returns to China, the Stabilization Fund Committee may be revived, and US financial personnel will participate in the committee to study plans to stabilize finances. At the same time, the Chinese government will take effective measures against speculators to ensure that supply and demand correspond. (12th International News Agency dispatch)

Hong Kong: Circles in this area close to the Chinese government have firmly denied the rumors of misunderstandings between Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen recently. It is said that these two financial leaders have cooperated very well in stabilizing the legal currency and maintaining China's wartime economic policies in recent years. However, Kong Xiangxi's body is weak, and the government and Kong Xiangxi have strongly urged Song Ziwen to succeed him. It is generally believed that Song Ziwen will not refuse again this time, given the importance of his responsibilities and the government's expectations. Observers believe that Song Ziwen's appointment as Minister of Finance will greatly excite Chinese and foreign financiers. (12th International News Agency dispatch)

### Vietnam Appeals to the US, Hull Says He Has Not Heard of It; The Far East Situation is Indeed Noticed by the State Department; The US Will Expand the Ban on the Export of War Materials to Japan

New York: Washington was quite interested yesterday when it heard the news from London that the French-Japanese negotiations had broken down. It is believed here that the French and Japanese have different understandings of the agreement that has been reached. The French believe that the transportation of troops by rail is a normal business on the railway, while the Japanese seem to believe that this is a transfer of the railway, and that it is the second South Manchuria Railway before Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces of China, that is, a transportation line that enjoys extraterritorial rights. It is heard that the Vietnamese authorities firmly refused to allow the Japanese to establish air bases in Vietnam. Regarding the rumor that the Governor of Vietnam sent three telegrams to the US government in Singapore yesterday to make an appeal, Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he had not heard of it. The Far East is currently of great concern to the State Department, because Japan's new actions in diplomacy have in many ways undermined the status quo that Washington has repeatedly stated it wishes to preserve. At the same time, close attention is also being paid to the progress of commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. Yesterday, unconfirmed news spread throughout Washington that the United States will soon expand its ban on the export of war materials to Japan. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Hanoi: Since US Secretary of State Hull reiterated his determination to maintain the status quo in the Far East, the French in this area have had many hopes for the United States. Although the French-Japanese conference has been temporarily suspended, General Decoux, Governor of Vietnam, still dined with Nishihara, the head of the Japanese delegation, last night. The delegation is waiting for new instructions from Tokyo. A naval officer of the Japanese delegation commented on the US attitude towards the situation in Vietnam, saying, "Since the United States has recognized its freedom of action or speech in the Western Hemisphere, why interfere with Japan's freedom in the East? This is the opinion of the Japanese Navy, and the whole country is the same." The officer also said that at the Hanoi conference, the Japanese Navy advocated obtaining bases for naval and air forces. Moreover, French newspapers published news about the Chinese destroying bridges on the Yunnan Railway, with many criticisms. (12th United Press dispatch)

Vichy: French radio announced today that the negotiations between the Governor-General of French Vietnam and the Japanese representatives fully comply with the instructions of the Vichy government and are not under pressure. (12th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

He supports the platform of the People's Party passed in Chicago, "We will not participate in overseas wars, and will not send land, sea, or air forces to fight overseas, unless we are attacked. We must put an end to compromises." The people of the Americas all know that the best defense against the current violent forces in the world is the strongest preparation.

### Air Battle Over London: British and German Air Forces Clash - Germany's Most Elite Squadron Participates in Air Raid - Unprecedented Intensity of Anti-Aircraft Fire

London, late on the 11th. As fires raged in London, it was apparent Germany was swiftly retaliating for the bombing of Berlin in the past two days. Therefore, it dispatched bombers in batches to London's skies, launching fierce attacks. Many believe this was the largest air raid since the start of the war. British fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns were prepared for battle. Spitfires and Hurricanes swarmed like bees, engaging the incoming waves of bombers head-on. Ground artillery batteries also roared in unison. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. As of 1:00 AM this morning (10:00 AM Shanghai time), large-scale aerial combat was still underway in the city. At times, the roar of artillery was drowned out by the engines of the dense swarm of aircraft overhead. By 2:00 PM, no detailed reports on the outcome of the air battle were available, as the scale of the battle was vast. Only fragments of information about the results are known at this time. Reports of damage first came from three districts in southern London and one in the west, stating that incendiary bombs had been dropped there. The air combat began before midnight and grew increasingly fierce, turning London into a major battlefield. The sounds of explosions were incessant. London residents watching the battle could only see a chaotic scene, mostly inferring the state of the battle from the sounds they heard. Anti-aircraft guns around London continuously fired upon aircraft marked with swastikas illuminated by searchlights. According to aviation experts, the tactics used by the attacking German aircraft were completely different from those used in previous nights. The attacking German aircraft arrived in waves, and anti-aircraft guns fired in unison, rumbling like thunder. Searchlights intermittently swept across the sky. Observers suddenly saw sparks erupt in mid-air, followed by the whine of engines. An aircraft crashed to the ground with a thunderous roar, followed by three or four weaker explosions. A plume of thick smoke rose into the clouds. Judging by the sound of artillery, a new anti-aircraft battery was engaging. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin. Last night, German aircraft conducted their fifth raid on the London docklands area, reportedly achieving another victory. German circles claim that the commercial heart of the British Empire has been further wounded by the new bombing, and that this intense bombing will continue until it is completely destroyed. The high command stated that German aircrews returning from England reported even more large fires occurring on both banks of the Thames near London. (International Telegraph, 12th)

London. German aircraft employed a new tactic in last night's air raid, first dropping incendiary bombs on low buildings to set them ablaze. To prevent the fires from being extinguished, they added more incendiary bombs. Once the fire was bright enough to illuminate taller buildings that had not yet caught fire, they launched heavy bombing raids. A "Molotov breadbasket" bomb landed on an oil storage depot in a certain London district. The fire spread with the ignited oil but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. Two houses near the depot were destroyed, but the occupants escaped injury by taking refuge in the basement. A four-story building was blasted, creating a crater three to four feet deep. The windows of buildings in the park opposite the building were completely destroyed, and tree branches were also broken by the blast. (United Press, 12th)

London. St. Paul's Cathedral was nearly destroyed today because a time bomb was found nearby. (Associated Press, 12th)

London. Today, an unexploded bomb was found in a corner of the garden of St. Paul's Cathedral. The surrounding area was closed off to traffic until the bomb was removed. According to officials, the anti-aircraft fire network used in the London defense last night was based on a new targeting method. The general public believes this new method has been successful and hopes that further improvements will follow. (Reuters, 12th)

London. In this morning's air raid, the offices of the "Daily News" were bombed, and the machinery was severely damaged. However, the newspaper is still publishing as usual. (Associated Press, 12th)

Berlin. German aircraft bombed England yesterday, hitting the iron foundry of the armament factory in the Hull area. At that time, smoke and flames shot straight upward, reaching hundreds of yards in height. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

### Intense Anti-Aircraft Fire - German Aircraft Eventually Dispersed

London. In the afternoon of the 11th, British fighter planes engaged a large formation of attacking German bombers in a large-scale air battle, a rare occurrence since the start of the war. The German aircraft were eventually dispersed, preventing London from suffering another brutal retaliatory attack. Yesterday, German aircraft repeatedly attempted to reach the London area, suffering heavy losses. According to official announcements, as of 6:30 PM, British fighter planes had shot down 73 German aircraft. The British side lost 17 aircraft, but the pilots of three of them were rescued. Yesterday's major air battle occurred during the second German incursion. It is believed that the elite German "Yellow Nose" squadron, treasured by Göring, was among the attacking German aircraft. They were immediately met with tens of thousands of rounds of anti-aircraft fire. The intensity of the artillery fire was unheard of in London since the start of the war. German bombers entered London in waves, dropping bombs, while a terrifying aerial battle unfolded. A Reuters reporter stated that amidst the flashes of exploding artillery shells, German aircraft could only be occasionally seen performing aerial maneuvers high above central London, evading the artillery fire. The sound of artillery fire was deafening. Spitfire and Hurricane fighters bravely engaged and broke up the German aircraft formation. Several German aircraft were seen plunging to the ground, while the remaining aircraft fled in panic. London lifted the alert at 3:40 PM. Just after 5:00 PM, the alarm sounded again as German aircraft began their third raid of the day, but it did not develop. The alarm was lifted at 5:22 PM. At 7:37 PM, the fourth alarm sounded again. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Officials Announce - 90 German Aircraft Destroyed

London. German aircraft paid a very high price for their attempt to reach London yesterday. According to official announcements, a total of 90 German aircraft were destroyed. 24 British aircraft are missing, but seven pilots have been rescued safely. The number of casualties from yesterday's air raid has not yet been determined, but it is currently known that there were 18 deaths and 280 injuries. (Reuters, 12th)

London. An Air Ministry communiqué states that more detailed reports have been received regarding enemy aircraft activity over the London area last night. It is learned that although there was considerable property damage, the losses were lighter than in previous nights, and the number of casualties was also greatly reduced. Incendiary bombs caused numerous fires, but only one large fire occurred, and all were extinguished. The work of the fire brigades is beyond praise. Details of deaths and injuries are not yet available, but it is known that 18 people have died and 280 have been injured. A town on the south bank of the Thames was also attacked last night, with several houses destroyed and some deaths. It is now known that during the night raid on the 9th, approximately 1,400 people were injured and 400 were killed. A primary school in London's East End, used as a temporary shelter for civilians whose homes had been destroyed, collapsed after being hit, resulting in many deaths. A town on the south bank was also attacked, with bombs reportedly causing several deaths and injuries. (Reuters, 12th)

### German Long-Range Artillery Bombards the Dover Area

London. Last night, the Dover area suffered its largest attack, with several deaths and injuries. The Germans first sent aircraft to bomb intermittently for several hours, then six salvos of shells were fired by German long-range artillery on the French coast, across the sunlit channel. Bombardment continued intermittently until last night. The air raid alarm sounded along the Kent coast after Dover was shelled for several minutes. Twelve German heavy bombers flew from the sea towards the west of Dover at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet. As they reached the altitude of the barrage balloons, anti-aircraft guns opened fire. German Messerschmitt fighters circled above and below the bombers, and shells exploded around them, filling the air with thick smoke. One German aircraft was then seen exploding in the air. As the German bombers flew over Dover, they dropped a batch of bombs, one of which destroyed a house. (Reuters, 12th)

London. Yesterday afternoon, British coastal patrols sighted an enemy convoy of at least twelve large ships heading towards Boulogne near Gris. The German bombardment of Dover appeared to be intended to cover the movement of the convoy. British heavy artillery also returned fire. Soon after, a large formation of British Air Force bombers flew across the southeast coast towards the French and Belgian coasts. It is believed that the British aircraft will drop bombs on the port of Calais. (Reuters, 12th)

Rome. The Turin newspaper "Stampa" reported today that the long-range artillery duel along the English Channel will begin the real war for England. Once the British coastal defense batteries are destroyed, a crossing of the sea will be possible. If the attack is successful, the air force controlling the English Channel and breaking into the British Isles must be in German hands. Britain has now lost the Port of London because the British Admiralty has ordered ships bound for ports in the English Channel to divert to other ports. "Sera" newspaper stated that the bombing of military targets in London is one of the major plans to destroy all British centers of resistance. Britain's provocative behavior has accelerated Germany's preparations for attack. In short, after the bombing of the British capital, decisive steps will be taken. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

### Britain Uses New Weapons to Strengthen Defenses

London. Today, Britain began to use new weapons on land, sea, and air, and to strengthen its forces, to prevent the expected imminent German invasion. British officials tacitly acknowledge that the British Air Force has repeatedly concentrated on bombing the Dutch coast, but has so far failed to disperse the increasing number of German troops. This large contingent of German troops is said to be stationed along the coast, waiting for the order to "depart." Therefore, British military circles say that new strategies must be adopted to deal with it. British warships and coastal artillery cooperate to bombard German troops and supply ships on the opposite shore. At the same time, hundreds of secretly installed, largest-caliber anti-aircraft guns suddenly roared in London last night, tightly protecting London and allowing it to safely pass the fifth German aerial night raid. From all night yesterday until this morning, a thick fire net was spread over London. Only a few German aircraft managed to penetrate into the city center. Aviation experts said, "More exploding shells went upward than downward." The alert lasted for nine hours and one minute, and was only lifted at 5:36 this morning. The speed of the German aircraft could be discerned from the sound of their engines, indicating that they were traveling faster. However, British communiqués stated that 92 German aircraft were shot down during the group attack on London. The fierce and dense artillery fire from below caused great distress to the German pilots. A British Admiralty communiqué stated that the British Navy is also conducting offensive operations around the British Isles. British aircraft have again flown to the Norwegian coast to bomb, where it is reported that German troops are concentrating in large numbers. Twelve German troop transport ships are lurking off the coast of Boulogne and have been bombarded by British coastal artillery and warships. It is said that various facilities in the German port have suffered heavy damage. As for the news from Budapest that German troops have landed in Northern Ireland, the authorities here have dismissed it as "nonsense." (International Telegram, 12th)

### German War Report

Berlin. This afternoon's German war report stated that British aircraft continued to bomb residential areas in northern Germany, Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin, and other places last night with incendiary and high-explosive bombs, causing heavier damage to residential areas and workers' housing. 14 people were killed and 41 injured. Thanks to the thoroughness of the air defense organization in Berlin and other places, no major losses were suffered. German aircraft continued to bomb London day and night yesterday. Docks, power plants, and armament factories were hit and caught fire in many places. The bombing of the aircraft factory in Southampton destroyed an aircraft hangar. Night raids on Liverpool and England, the west coast, and various ports on the coasts were quite successful. Air battles occurred during the attack on London, with 67 British aircraft shot down during the day and 6 shot down at night. In total, 80 British aircraft were lost yesterday, and 21 German aircraft are missing. Submarines commanded by Captain Ginishi of the Navy sank a total of 40,000 tons of British shipping. Another submarine sank 7,000 tons of British shipping. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

### British Light Fleet Takes Offensive

London. A British Admiralty communiqué stated that the British Navy's light fleet is now taking a vigorous offensive against German shipping activities, causing damage to the enemy, and damaging the port facilities necessary for the enemy's invasion of England. Details will be announced later to avoid leaking information that can be used by the enemy. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Bomber Squadrons Launch Another Large-Scale Night Raid on Berlin - Dropping Large Numbers of Bombs on Railway Stations and Airports - Hamburg and Bremen Also Bombed and Set on Fire

London. Last night, British Air Force squadrons launched another large-scale air raid on Berlin, dropping large numbers of giant and incendiary bombs on the large railway yard south of the Potsdam train station. British bombers braved the searchlights and anti-aircraft fire network to bomb the Anhalter and New Potsdam train stations. Bombs hit the Tiergarten. Another group of British aircraft turned south, dropping multiple high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the Tempelhof Airport in Berlin. All British aircraft returned safely to their bases. (12th)

Stockholm. The Berlin correspondent of the "Aftonbladet" reports that during last night's air raid, the sound of Berlin's anti-aircraft guns and alarms went off simultaneously. Judging by the sound of the aircraft, the number of attacking British aircraft must have been large. Explosions were soon heard, and fires broke out in many places in central and northwestern Berlin, which were extinguished several hours later. According to a communiqué issued by the German High Command, British aircraft dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs in residential areas of several cities in northern Germany last night (including Hamburg, Bremen, and Berlin), causing numerous fires. 15 people were killed and 41 injured. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin. At dawn today, British bombers broke through the German outer defense lines and flew to Berlin again. The authorities did not conceal the impact of the bombing, admitting that flames were raging in the Tegel district, extending to residential buildings. "British Air Force bombed several non-military targets, but the damage was slight. The enemy was soon driven back." The air raid was still continuing at 12:45 AM this morning, and was not lifted until 2:15 AM. (Berlin Telegraph, 12th)

London. One of the British Air Force bombers that attacked Berlin successfully attacked through intense anti-aircraft fire. On the return journey, it ran out of fuel before reaching its base and crashed into the sea. The four crew members escaped in a rubber dinghy, drifting at sea for twelve hours until they were finally found by a seaplane last night. The seaplane repeatedly flew low to guide the lifeboat to rescue the crew, who were all uninjured. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin. The people of Berlin are flocking to the city center to inspect the results of the air raid, with particularly large crowds gathering near the Brandenburg Gate and St. Hedwig's Hospital. Near the Brandenburg Gate, there is a crater from a 500 kg bomb, presumably targeting the German Parliament. Six bombs also landed on the grounds of the US Embassy. The offices of the representatives of various countries in Germany were also damaged by shrapnel. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

Berlin. Three formations of British aircraft soared over Berlin again early this morning, attacking residential areas and historical areas in the city center. In addition, several British aircraft bombed Hamburg and Bremen. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Continuous British Bombing of German Shipping Concentration Points - Preparations for Invasion of England Severely Damaged

London. British Air Force aircraft launched continuous attacks on the night of the 10th and the morning of the 11th, fiercely bombing ships in shipyards and ports concentrated on the coasts of Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, dealing a crushing blow to Hitler's long-standing preparations for the invasion of England. According to the Air Ministry, although British aircraft encountered poor visibility and fierce resistance from searchlights and anti-aircraft guns, all attacks were effective. At the same time, the Potsdam train station in Berlin was bombed and caught fire. The Focke-Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen and the naval barracks in Wilhelmshaven were also hit. The docks in Calais were the first to bear the brunt of the British aircraft attacks. At dusk, the port of Calais was first bombed by a batch of British aircraft. Over the next three hours, the port's docks and ships were subjected to fierce bombing. A long line of ships clustered on the eastern side of the basin was hit by high-explosive bombs, sending debris flying and flames soaring. As the British aircraft flew away, explosions could still be heard. One pilot reported that all but three of the bombs he dropped landed in the fleet in Basin No. 6. An observer saw a large merchant ship suddenly catch fire, with flames raging so intensely that the ship's ribs were exposed, indicating it had been destroyed. Ostend was bombed from 8:00 PM on the 10th until 4:00 AM the next morning. Ships in the port were repeatedly hit by giant bombs. German ships in the port of Boulogne were also bombed. In addition, the Air Ministry Intelligence Office reported that during the attack on Calais, the Carnot basin was heavily bombed, and most of the dock area was engulfed in flames. A large fire spread at least 200 yards when the tide rose. The artillery batteries around the port were silent, and the searchlights were also dimmed. (Reuters, 12th)

### Churchill Warns the Nation to Guard Against German Invasion - Germany's Quest for Air Supremacy Has Clearly Failed - Britain's Strength Is Sufficient to Overcome the Enemy

London. British Prime Minister Churchill stated in a broadcast to the nation tonight that Germany's efforts to achieve air supremacy have clearly failed. However, the people must know that Hitler is still continuing his large-scale preparations to invade Britain. Ships are currently being assembled from Hamburg to Brest, and large numbers of German troops are awaiting orders to invade England. We must know that the next one or two weeks will be a very important period in our history. I recently told the House of Commons that enemy air raids in September may be three times greater than in August. This statement, of course, does not refer to barbarous attacks on civilians, but to the great air battle between our fighters and the enemy air force. You will know that whenever the weather is suitable, German bombers arrive in formations like surging waves, protected by fighters. Each time, three or four hundred aircraft invade this island, especially the Kent area, in an attempt to attack military and other targets during the day. Our squadrons intercept them, and they are almost always dispersed. On average, the enemy loses three aircraft for every one of ours, and six pilots for every one of ours. Germany's efforts to gain air superiority over England during the day are certainly the high point of the entire war. As it stands now, this

effort has clearly failed, the price they paid is very high, and we feel stronger than we did in July. Hitler is now gradually depleting his air force strength at a very high rate. If this continues for several more weeks, Hitler will have destroyed the most important part of his air force. This will give us a great advantage. If Hitler attempts to invade our country without gaining air superiority, it would be a very dangerous move. However, preparations for a large-scale invasion of England are currently underway. Hundreds of self-propelled flat-bottomed ships are currently traveling along the European coast from German and Dutch ports to northern France, from Dunkirk to various points on Brest, and beyond Brest to French ports in the Bay of Biscay. In addition, dozens of convoys are traversing the Strait of Dover, traveling between ports under the protection of new German-built fortresses on the French coast. From Hamburg to Brest, ships are concentrated in German, Dutch, Belgian, and French ports. Germany is also preparing to send ships from Norwegian ports to transport troops. Not only are many ships gathered, but large numbers of German troops are also waiting to embark. When they will depart, we cannot say. Whether they will depart at all, we cannot say either. However, Germany is currently using its meticulous methods,

to prepare for a large-scale attack on the British Isles, which may attack England, Scotland, or Ireland, or all three islands simultaneously. This is what we must be aware of. If Germany intends to attempt its invasion, it seems that this cannot be delayed for long, because a long delay may make the weather unfavorable, and it will be difficult to keep a large number of ships waiting indefinitely when our aircraft are bombing every night and British warships are constantly shelling. Therefore, everyone in our country must prepare, and perform their duties with exceptional pride and prudence. Our fleet is numerous and strong, and our air force has reached an unprecedented peak of strength. The number of aircraft is gradually gaining an advantage, and the aircraft and aircrew are superior to those of the enemy. Our coastal defenses are strong and manned by a more numerous and better-equipped army than ever before, ready to defend the enemy. Behind the army is a Home Guard of 1.5 million men, who are no different from the regular army, and are determined to defend the homeland. I speak with the firmest conviction, saying

God defend the right. The brutal German bombing of London is certainly part of Hitler's plan to invade England. He hopes that by indiscriminately bombing civilians, women, and children, he can intimidate the people of this great city and make them a burden on the government, so that the government will divert its attention from the preparations he is making for the attack. In fact, Hitler does not understand the spirit of the British nation or the resilience of the people of London. The resilience of the British people has long been manifested in the establishment of the parliamentary system. The British are born to value freedom more than life. Now, this evil man, consumed by the hatred of destroying souls, and a monstrous product of past crimes and shameful acts, has decided to shatter our renowned British spirit by means of indiscriminate killing and destruction. It must be known that what he is doing is kindling a fire in the hearts of the British people. This fire, even after all traces of the great fires caused by Hitler in London are gone, will rekindle, until its inextinguishable flames

burn away the last vestiges of Nazi tyranny, wiping it out completely from Europe, so that the old and new worlds can join hands to rebuild the temple of human freedom and human dignity on an unshakable foundation, and only then will it be over. The present is the time when everyone should unite and rally together as they are now. I greatly admire the excellent way in which the London air raid defense organizations, such as the fire brigades, perform their duties, which are both arduous and dangerous. People around the world who still enjoy freedom are amazed by the calm and resilience displayed by the people of London in dealing with the hardships they have encountered. When these hardships may end, or to what extent they may go, cannot yet be foreseen. Our soldiers on the sea, in the air, and on the defensive lines will be thrilled to hear of the calm and resilience of the people at home, and will dedicate themselves to striving for the final victory that is not only beneficial to us but also beneficial to the world as a whole, not only beneficial to the present but also beneficial to the future.

### Random Notes on the European War (5) The Day Paris Fell

Major H firmly insisted that we must complete our mission. If we can't get it done tonight, we have to do it by tomorrow morning at the latest, because our army commander has ordered that we enter Paris at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. This time cannot be changed under any circumstances. The order has already been prepared and will be transmitted to all units tonight. With the principle decided, we had to temporarily turn back, sending a wireless message to the Paris garrison commander to protest the shooting incident, and telegraphing our supreme military authorities for instructions. We found our army's forward outpost, located in Ecouen, north of Saint-Denis. At midnight, we received definite news that the French army had decided not to defend Paris, and they had declared Paris an undefended city. Therefore, we did not need to go forward to urge them to surrender; they had voluntarily offered the city. The next morning, a French military envoy came to Ecouen to discuss the terms of surrender with our side.

On June 14th, the morning was hazy and foggy. We gathered at the headquarters of the East Prussian Reconnaissance Regiment to await the arrival of the French military envoy. The house was grand and tall, facing the Avenue de Paris. We had already cleaned up a large room to serve as the negotiation site. Originally, it was a music room, and there was even a grand piano inside. Because it was early dawn and there was fog, the small candlesticks on the table had been lit. Outside the window, reconnaissance regiment tanks were patrolling, disguised with branches and leaves.

As 6:00 AM approached, I went to the nearest observation post to speak with headquarters by telephone and receive final instructions. Upon my return, the French military envoy had arrived. A car with a white flag was parked outside the regiment gate. A French guard captain stood on the steps, his broad face showing a slightly humble smile, and his salute was very solemn. At this time, negotiations in the music room had already begun. Major H and Captain H sat opposite the plenipotentiary of the Paris garrison commander, a short, humble staff officer, and an adjutant who served as a translator.

The so-called conditions, in fact, had nothing to discuss. The conditions put forward by the German commander were very clear: to make Paris a demilitarized zone. The remaining conditions were very brief. Major H read the clauses aloud slowly, translating each sentence into French. The French representative leaned slightly to the side, listening attentively. After listening to each sentence, he nodded, and there was always a short, complete silence, with only the faint crackling of the burning candle wicks and the occasional sound of guards walking past the window.

The sky was slowly brightening. The French side accepted all the conditions without exception. There was only one point on which the two sides could not fully agree: the scope of the "Paris" area. The German side believed that it referred to Paris and its suburbs, while the French side said that it was limited to the city area. They said that the power of the Paris garrison commander could not extend beyond the urban area. Therefore, Major H stood up and said that the negotiations could not proceed any further. This was the only time he raised his voice during the meeting, and it was also the only indication of the military seriousness of the situation. The French side was clearly defeated, and they were at a loss and very discouraged. They only said that the French army was no longer resisting at all, and that even the southern suburbs of Paris were the same.

This stalemate could only be referred to a higher authority. Major H left his seat and spoke to his superior, General M, by telephone. If he could not return within an hour, then the ceasefire negotiations would be broken. At that time, the German air force would launch a large-scale bombing of Paris at 9:00 AM, and the army would also concentrate its attack. The German heavy artillery had already aimed at Paris. Major H had made this situation very clear to the French representative before leaving the room. They remained silently seated there. After a while, we knew they were talking casually and everyone was smoking. We talked about how beautiful and fertile the French land was, how advanced the Parisian art was, and how charming the villas and gardens everywhere were.

Before long, the sky gradually brightened, and the German tanks had begun to move. The first one had already driven past the window, but it had not yet been decided whether to drive into the city peacefully with the windows open or to close the windows tightly in preparation for war. But in any case, as soon as the order was received, they would move out immediately! Half an hour passed, forty minutes passed. Major H had not yet returned. The French representatives kept looking at their watches; they seemed a little restless. The engine of the tank outside the window was starting, and they felt even more surprised. Everything about them was revealed on their faces, and they were very worried about everything in Paris. And everything in Paris would affect the whole of France.

With five minutes left, Major H finally returned. The French representatives also signed the document.

This was at 7:30 AM on June 14, 1940. The French surrendered their capital, formerly the greatest fortress in the world, the city of Paris, to the German army. This was an unconditional surrender. The French military envoy signed the document, and everything was very quiet. The candles were still burning.

"Paris has surrendered!" The messenger ran into the garden and shouted loudly. He put his arms around a soldier on a tank, almost uncontrollably. Suddenly, everyone danced and cheered, and the soldiers in the tank team all ran over, almost throwing their military caps into the clouds. All that could be heard was the sound of "Paris has surrendered!" They then prepared their equipment and entered Paris.

### Finance – Rumors Abound – Gold Market Rises and Falls Sharply

Yesterday's spot gold trading in the unofficial market saw dramatic rises and falls, which was quite exciting. The operators' interest increased, and buying and selling were fairly balanced, but due to numerous rumors, people were uneasy from morning to night. However, news of peace negotiations, both domestic and foreign, was regarded as a negative factor, leading to enthusiastic selling. As a result, the price fell from a high of 6,320 yuan in the midday session to close at 6,120 yuan, which was still considered stable. The market opened unchanged, but soon a startling rumor spread within the market, triggering a wave of selling, and the price plummeted to 6,100 yuan. It finally closed at 6,155 yuan, a drop of 75 yuan compared to yesterday's settlement. Trading volume was still strong throughout the day, at around 3,000 taels. Jewelry shops reduced their prices by 10 yuan, while customs duties remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Drops 75 Yuan

At the start of the morning session, buying sentiment was strong. Gold firms sold 20 taels to silver shops at a price of 6,235 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. As the foreign exchange rate was tight, silver shops and money changers aggressively entered the market, immediately breaking through the 6,300 yuan mark. Gold firms issued securities to brokers for 10 taels at 6,320 yuan. Subsequently, after some fluctuations, a rumor spread, and securities firms, gold firms, and silver shops all sold, causing the price to fall sharply by 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 10 taels to money changers at 6,120 yuan. However, the appearance of low prices prompted money changers to buy, and other retail investors also purchased, so by the noon close, the price had rebounded to above the 6,200 yuan mark. Gold firms took in 20 taels from silver shops at 6,205 yuan, the closing price for the midday session. The afternoon session started well, with silver shops trading 10 taels at 6,210 yuan. Gold and silver firms further pushed up the price, and it was quite stable. Silver shops bought 20 taels from securities brokers at 6,220 yuan. Unexpectedly, another rumor arrived, and gold firms reversed from buying to selling, and silver shops and money changers also sold, pushing the price down to a low of 6,140 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money changers at this price. Subsequently, the price rebounded by several tens of yuan due to support from silver shop brokers. Silver shops took in 10 taels from gold firms at 6,160 yuan. However, selling pressure remained, and the price continued to fall. Money changers sold 20 taels to gold firms, causing the price to drop to 6,100 yuan. In the evening, there was a slight rebound, and silver shops took in 10 taels from securities brokers at a price of 6,155 yuan, the closing price for the evening session, a drop of 75 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. Trading volume was about 3,000 taels, with a daily fluctuation of 135 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was more than ten yuan higher than the settlement price, and the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The price of standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Prices Are Unstable

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at the start of the day was still 640 yuan at the Ta Tong Hang, increased by ten yuan at 10:20 AM, decreased by ten yuan at 11:30 AM, then fell by another ten yuan at noon. It increased by ten yuan at 2:00 PM, then fell by ten yuan at 3:00 PM, and finally decreased by ten yuan. In the end, the Ta Tong Hang changed to 630 yuan. The price at Xin Tong Hang was the same, and the buying price was about thirty yuan lower.

### Foreign Exchange Market – A World of Rumors

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. Although the unofficial market for British and US exchange rates was in the midst of intense rumors, it remained stable, with minimal fluctuations. The midday session was initially stable but then loosened, as traders considered domestic and international turmoil to be a negative factor and leaned towards selling, causing the price to rise slightly. Also, the expectation of peace in Europe caused speculators to follow suit. The US dollar also softened, with the October rate only settling at 5.1875 yuan, and the current month rate at 5.21875 yuan. Unexpectedly, at noon, a US bank showed some supply interest, and rumors of negative factors arose, such as US involvement in the war and German troops landing in England. It was also heard that Japanese troops landing in Vietnam had been surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops, and that there was some kind of understanding between China and Japan, causing speculators to dump their holdings. The US dollar alone saw a rebound. In the afternoon, Reuters also carried a rumor. Amidst the chaos, Chinese merchants sold US dollars for 5.34375 yuan. Importers bought on the cheap, and the price recovered slightly. At the close, the British pound had hardened to 3 shillings 515625, and the US dollar to 5.28125 yuan. The British pound was up 0.015625, and the US dollar was unchanged. Trading volume was quite strong throughout the day.

Negative Factors Predominate

At the start of the morning session, the London long-term rate fell 0.0625, the forward rate was unchanged, the New York silver price was unchanged, the London raw gold price remained stable. The exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar and Shanghai remained unchanged, the US dollar rose slightly against the British pound and fell slightly against Shanghai, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 484375 for the British pound and 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the previous day's closing prices, the British pound was up 0.015625, and the US dollar was unchanged. After opening, there was an offer to sell British shillings at HSBC's price of 3 shillings and a half, and the market was stable. Subsequently, Chinese banks also had selling interest, but foreign banks and British banks had strong demand, and the price rose again. The September US dollar rate was traded at 5.25 and 5.21875 yuan, and then speculators followed and bought, and the market was still soft. Speculators bought the September US dollar rate from foreign banks at 5.21875 yuan, and the October US dollar rate at 5.1875 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 0.25%. After that, rumors were rampant in the market, and various domestic and international rumors were complex. In general, negative news was stronger, so Chinese and Japanese banks suddenly sold, and the price rebounded. Chinese and Japanese banks sold the September US dollar rate to foreign banks from 5.25 yuan back to 5.28125 yuan. Near noon, speculators sold the October US dollar rate to American banks, also reaching 5.28125 yuan. The closing prices were 3 shillings 484375 for the British pound and 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the morning opening.

Settlements Before the Close

The afternoon session opened with a looser market, and American banks had an offer for the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan. At that time, the rumors about China and Japan had a great impact on people's sentiment, and speculators sold the current month's US dollar at 5.34375 yuan. However, later, due to strong demand for settlements from foreign firms, the price softened again. Foreign firms bought the November US dollar rate at 5.25 yuan. Chinese merchants also bought in shortly afterwards, with the current month's US dollar at 5.3125 yuan. The market was extremely stable at the close, with the British pound at 3 shillings 515625 and the US dollar at 5.28125 yuan. The October British pound was at 3 shillings and a half, and the US dollar at 5.25 yuan. Compared to the previous day, the spot and forward prices of the British pound were slightly up 0.015625, and the US dollar was unchanged.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall

There were few buyers of British pound notes, and note holders were unwilling to sell at a discount, so the market price only fell by 5 jiao. US dollar notes initially rose to around 19 yuan. The news reported in the afternoon was increasingly unfavorable to buyers, so the price once retreated to 18.45 yuan, and finally settled at 18.65 yuan, a drop of 0.17 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were slightly in demand, and the price rose by 2 fen. Japanese yen notes rose and then fell again, eventually falling by 1 fen, retreating to 1.53 yuan in the evening session.

### Securities – Situation Improves – Domestic Bonds Want to Fall But Stop – Foreign Stocks Hard to Reverse Decline

Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw extremely violent fluctuations in the morning. The price plummeted by 1.35 yuan, and at one time, many long positions exited and speculators shorted, taking advantage of the opportunity. The market was quite soft, and most short positions were unwilling to cover. This kind of decline was expected, entirely due to the excessive crowding of long positions, and many were superficial. A slight rebound the day before caused panic, resulting in this excessive decline. In the afternoon, positive rumors suddenly arose, initially saying that the United States was mediating the Vietnam issue, leading to an atmosphere of peace. Then it was heard that the battle of Longzhou was extremely smooth, so the market price suddenly improved in the afternoon, rebounding strongly, improving by 0.7 to 0.9 yuan. After the close, the market price was particularly firm, improving by another 0.2 to 0.3 yuan in the dark, and the situation was excellent, with the possibility of triggering a second round of gains. Throughout the day, the 24th was the most active in buying, absorbing continuously. Sheng Da also bought in the morning and afternoon. Hengfu Hongda had new shares, and Xinhua Lianyi Yongfeng Hu He Fei all had considerable demand. Le Mao sold the most in the morning, and Yu Zexiu Feng Xinfu Gong Mao Ren Chang Run Li Zhong Yi and others sold, selling more and more vigorously. Selling decreased sharply in the afternoon, with only Ji Ji Lian He and Jiu Feng supplying more, and the rest being scattered retail investors, while the market price still moved forward. The overall result was only a slight decrease of 0.35 yuan, with a turnover of 1.6 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Dasheng First Factory stock were traded at a price of 15.5 yuan.

Also, the Public Stock Exchange reported that the seriousness of the situation in London made it difficult for the stock market to maintain its firm trend. The market was even softer in the afternoon, and the strength of the multi-party maintenance was sometimes lacking. China Ken Zhi shares saw the most turnover, and the decline was also the most severe. The price had been raised to a high of 28 yuan after the morning opening, and closed as low as 26.25 yuan in the evening. Jardine Matheson fell by 3 yuan, and British Union retreated by 2 yuan. The stocks of various trust companies, except for Yangzi, were pressured down by one yuan due to numerous short sales, and the rest were still stable. Rubber stocks followed the downstream of real estate stocks. As this weekend will be a three-day holiday, and the news received now is so disturbing, the market may continue to soften, although credit is still loose, and confidence is still there, it will be temporarily discounted.

London, 11th (Wednesday) - Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks were stable and unchanged.

### Grain – Speculative Atmosphere Envelops Rice Market – Rising Two Yuan on Vietnam Issue – Japonica and Indica Follow Foreign Rice Step by Step

Yesterday's spot foreign rice market was rumored to be tight first and then weak, and in the end, it rose by 1.5 to 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Since it had softened once before, the general shorts were eager to take advantage of the cheap price to cover their positions, and the bulls used the renewed tension in the Vietnam situation as a weapon to raise prices. Large traders also reversed from selling to defending. Under this dual environment, the chaotic old state of the black market reappeared, and the unofficial market soared, rising by as much as two yuan, reaching the previous level. However, actual sales were sparse, and it was finally felt that speculation was powerless. Moreover, the price was too high, so there was some caution, and it quickly weakened again. Therefore, although the unofficial market for No. 1 Chen Saigon was 70 yuan, the selling price was heard to be 69 yuan, Huowen 68 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 65 yuan, 64.5 yuan, No. 2 Xianluo and Xiaowen 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan, Tokyo Jingjian 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan, Milu 53-4 yuan. In short, foreign rice is still fluctuating in the black market and unofficial market. The market has been surrounded by speculation, and it is difficult to introduce it into a straight path in the short term. The original Huaying Company received the No. 2 Saigon again at a new high price of 77.35 yuan in the early market rise, selling more than 200 tons. However, the spot rice market weakened in the midday session, and the market also weakened and lacked inquiries. There were still purchases of spot rice by hoarders, with a transaction volume of about 7,000 bags.

Glutinous rice, whether domestic or foreign, was scarce and sold well, and the price was raised by one yuan. Kaikin Lizteyuan was 72.5 yuan, 72 yuan, and Chang Dan goods 71 yuan, 70 yuan. The selling price of Hong Kong white yuan was the highest and the second highest, the same as domestic goods.

For japonica and indica domestic rice, about 1,200 to 1,300 bags of new and old goods arrived yesterday. As for explicit and implicit transactions, sales followed the smooth sales of foreign rice. Therefore, seeing the scarcity of goods, the owners raised prices again abnormally, with selling prices rising by 1 to 2 yuan. It was rumored that Chang Bang Gao Jing had reached 80 yuan, Wuchang Sukun Jing 79 yuan, followed by 76 yuan, Nangang original bag early rice 76 yuan, grain 74 yuan, 73.5 yuan, Wuhu Chen Jian 63.5 yuan, 64 yuan, Zhoupu Xin Jing 74.5 yuan, 74 yuan, Taicang Xin Yangjian original bag 66-7 yuan, grain 64 yuan.

### Bull Positions Exit - Japanese Factory Futures Flour Turns Down

Flour: The market trend yesterday was flat and weak. The board price of the No. 2 flour factory was still 15.5 yuan, and the factory sold more than 6,000 bags. There were no changes in the market, and sales to customers were temporarily quiet, because a large number of foreign flour were being transshipped. However, trading in futures flour of the Japanese Phoenix Pi brand was quite active, because speculators intervened in the market. The September opening price loosened from 15.4 yuan to 0.3 yuan, and the October entry and exit were both large. The initial opening price of 15.821 increased to 0.86 yuan, and then the market loosened as bull positions exited. The closing price was 15.67 yuan, and both September and October were 0.7 yuan smaller than the previous day. Spot goods were 15.35 yuan, also 0.5 yuan smaller. The total transaction volume for the day was a huge 45,000 bags.

Wheat: The market continued to maintain a weak position, because the domestic transportation permits have been temporarily suspended recently, and the source of new wheat is very scarce. Sellers are thinking of tightening the price, but the Japanese factory suppresses the price very strictly, limiting the board to only 21.12 yuan. It is heard that the grain merchants have delivered nearly 10,000 bags to the Sanxin factory in recent days, which have been suppressed and priced at 21.1 yuan. The sellers all endured the pain and sold, so they are temporarily unwilling to ship again. As for the Chinese factories, it is futile to lower prices because it is difficult to receive goods, so the market remains calm.

### Oil Market - Domestic Sales Active - Prices Are Increasing Again

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market saw another roundabout surge, because the domestic sales markets in Xichang and other places, in addition to direct shipments from Japanese merchants, transportation by brokers has also become more frequent, resulting in the owners of the 2,000 barrels of soybean oil not wanting to sell cheaply, and the forward raw oil has been tightened again and again, so the potential trend has turned to be both peaceful and strong. As a result, the price rose by half a yuan. The Hong Kong brokers heard that 400 tons of Yantai raw oil had been shipped, priced at 93 yuan. The domestic brokers traded 50 pieces of Yantai basket raw oil, priced at 64 yuan. 230 pieces of Jiaozhou spot raw oil were priced at 63.5 yuan to 64 yuan. 350 pieces were traded in late September, priced at 63.5 yuan to 64 yuan. 250 pieces were traded in early October, priced at 64 yuan to 64.5 yuan. 300 pieces were traded in late October, priced at 65 yuan to 65.5 yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were priced at 70 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao spot raw oil were priced at 90 yuan to 90.05 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 97 yuan, and 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil were priced at 77 yuan to 77.5 yuan. A new warehouse order.

Also, 1,900 tons and 300 pieces of raw oil arrived from Yantai yesterday, and 800 pieces of soybean oil arrived from Qingdao. As for export oil, 1,500 tons of raw oil and 300 bags of raw kernels were returned to Hong Kong today.

### Cotton Yarn: Difficult Outlet, Stagnant Yarn Market

The yarn market is calm, with actual sales. Hong Kong merchants still make sporadic purchases, so the price of cotton yarn that they need remains firm. The prices of other brands with no transactions are relatively weak. Some people in the market are pessimistic because inventories are increasing daily and finding outlets is difficult. In addition, the situation in Vietnam is increasingly urgent. However, those who hold inventory generally insist on not giving up, so the market is stagnant. However, the most important thing is to consider the relationship between supply and demand.

The yarn market opened this morning. Because of reports of battles on the Vietnamese-Guangxi border, most people were bearish. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was priced at $980, rising slightly to $972. At this time, Tianjin merchants bought a few bales with speculative intentions. Suddenly, news came of foreign exchange controls and high gold prices, and the market tightened suddenly, with buying interest picking up slightly, rising to $984 step by step. After the close, there were rumors, and many people who had accumulated stocks sold them off, causing the price to fall back to $975. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 2,955 bales. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by $2. Today, 50 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 150 bales to Yantai. The amount of purchases made by various merchants is listed below:

Fellow merchants: 1,980 bales Hong Kong: 955 bales

Xiamen: 22 bales Total: 2,957 bales

### Cotton Market Lifeless

The current cotton situation is completely stagnant. This is because the yarn market is weak, and the overseas cotton market is dull, so people lack enthusiasm. It is said that only 100 bales of Pingguo cotton were sold at a price of $140. There are no other news reports.

Another report on foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market is relatively active. Due to purchases by Southern merchants and some reactionaries, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 1-2 pound tones. The Indian market is flat.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been very quiet recently. The yarn market is sluggish, and there are many rumors, so all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. There were no transactions of even one bale of cotton all day.

### Piece Goods: Stagnant Cloth Sales, Lower Sales Prices

Domestic Cloth: The market fluctuated yesterday, and sentiment was relaxed because the actual outlets were unlikely to be smooth and the situation of cloth was complicated. Speculators in the past suffered losses from buying and selling, so new purchases by non-industry speculators have become rare. The imbalance between production and consumption is becoming increasingly serious, so sales prices are uniformly lowered. Cloth factories are having great difficulty in maintaining costs and barely managing turnover. The market price is sluggish, with some colored cloth and fine cloth falling by about 25 cents yesterday, and coarse cloth remaining flat. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, etc. Fujian merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. Merchants from the Wen and Tai areas of Zhejiang purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored twill, etc. Wholesale shops in this street saw large shipments to the inland areas blocked, so they only had small-volume and retail business. Yesterday's transactions amounted to more than 300 pieces.

Eastern Cloth: Prices rose first and then fell, and the market atmosphere turned weak. The morning market was very active because of the rise in gold prices and the dragon head fine cloth market was particularly strong. The peak reached 32.8 yuan. Then, rumors suddenly arose, and after the gold price reversed, the after-market fell to 32.2 yuan. At the close, it rebounded slightly to 32.3 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge was priced at 91.25 cents.

Exports: 225 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai today, and 20 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Flannel and Overcoating

Tianjin Merchants Come to Shanghai to Purchase. High-Priced Woolens See Little Activity.

The woolen market is active in both retail and wholesale. The demand in this street is particularly strong, and Western-style clothing merchants are buying more. Merchants from other areas are unable to transport goods due to obstructed routes, and they are all regretting not being able to purchase. Merchants from Tianjin in North China have recently come to purchase some goods, and transactions in autumn flannel and winter overcoating have continued. Except for a few who manage to transport goods by truck, most of them are sent by postal parcel. Among these merchants, Li Tongyi, Zhou Hechang, Yuantai, and Yutai made more purchases. It is said that most of them had to apply for permission in advance before being able to come to Shanghai to purchase. However, looking back at previous years, purchases have decreased by two-thirds, which shows the difficulty of exporting woolens.

Also, the overall market atmosphere has remained stable recently, and all goods are similar to before. The actual sales of autumn goods are strong, and the outlets have become smooth and active. However, the market is flooded with goods from local factories, resulting in a balance of supply and demand. Prices are stable, and sales are smooth. Goods priced around 20 yuan per yard are being purchased vigorously, while those priced above 30 yuan see sluggish transactions. In recent times, customers have complained that the cost of living is high, and very few can afford high-priced woolens. The various shops and Western-style clothing stores, aware of this, have had to cater to customer psychology and purchase ordinary goods at lower prices. At present, most of the affordable goods are domestic products woven in Shanghai and goods from local factories of British and Japanese merchants. High-quality Western woolens are difficult to obtain, and merchants continue to hoard them, unwilling to lower prices.

### Silk and Tea: New York Silk Sales Showing Improvement

New York raw silk statistics: Imports last month increased by 12,621 piculs compared to the previous month, sales increased by 7,423 piculs, and inventory increased by 3,687 piculs. The general situation is more lively than in recent months. This is due to seasonal factors. The table is as follows:

Yesterday, the New York near-term price was $2.545, and the far-term price was $1.51. The spot market was inactive. The Yokohama spot price was 1390 yuan, the near-term price was 1399 yuan, and the far-term price was 1422 yuan, down about 10 yuan from the previous day.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Firms

Yesterday, the sugar market was less active than before because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, and most people wanted to trade after the festival. The guild's quoted price for new 24-grade coarse white sugar was 78.7 yuan, up 20 cents; goods arriving on June 9 were 78 yuan; Dutch cotton white KD mark was 73.9 yuan, up 10 cents; Dutch red spot was 63.2 yuan, up 20 cents; and road goods also rose 20 cents to 62.7 yuan. Taikoo B mark opened at 76.5 yuan and continued to 76.9 yuan, up 40 cents; DY mark was 73.5 yuan, also rising 20 cents.

### Metals: Native Iron Wire Nails Continue to Rise

The native iron wire nail market has become active since Tianjin merchants began purchasing. Although the situation in Vietnam is tense and sales are interrupted, domestic demand has been activated, and North China merchants are also seen making purchases from time to time. Construction merchants and retail buyers in this street also occasionally make purchases, so the market is still hot. As a result, market prices have continued to increase, rising by about 2 yuan from before. Currently, each barrel of Bessemer steel is priced at 52 yuan, which has also boosted the new iron wire market. After the outlet of foreign nails is smooth, local nail factories in Shanghai have been purchasing iron wire in large quantities as raw materials, so the iron wire market has tightened temporarily. Those in this industry have regained enthusiasm. Yesterday's price was about 50 yuan per picul.

### Shanghai Unanimously Attaches Importance to the September 18th Anniversary; The Public Enthusiastically Responds to the Donation Movement; The Concession Authorities Step Up Armed Preparations

Since the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Federation, the Thrift Movement Committee, and other groups initiated the "September 18th" donation movement, all sectors of Shanghai have unanimously responded, deciding to donate the day's income to strengthen the government's war of resistance efforts. At the same time, they are actively establishing thrift and national construction savings groups and promoting the winter clothing donation movement. The details of each situation are explored below:

Unified Mobilization, Enthusiastic Donation

Every time the National Humiliation Memorial Day arrives, all sectors of Shanghai solemnly commemorate it and carry out enthusiastic patriotic movements. Because the Shanghai environment is deteriorating day by day, the "September 18th" National Humiliation Memorial, which is about to arrive, cannot be held as desired. After the leaders of all sectors of Shanghai and various industry groups stipulated the memorial method, "donate one day's salary on September 18th to the government," they notified all sectors yesterday to unify mobilization and enthusiastically donate. All businesses and citizens of Shanghai, after receiving this notice, can deeply understand their own responsibilities and decide to use all the income of the day as donations to strengthen the economic fortress and strive for victory in the war of resistance.

Thrift Savings, Active Promotion

Since the National Government promulgated the Thrift and National Construction Savings Regulations and implementing rules, all sectors of Shanghai have responded enthusiastically and are actively planning to establish savings groups to start work in the near future. If Shanghai's four million compatriots can save one yuan per month, there will be four million yuan per month to be used for construction projects that are beneficial to the country. Therefore, all sectors of Shanghai are determined to actively promote this in this special environment, benefiting both themselves and the country, why not do it?

### Shanghai will Become an Armed Fortress

The authorities of the two concessions have decided to continue to take all precautionary measures within the boundaries until after "September 18th," the ninth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, and then remove them depending on the situation at that time. In view of the remarkable effectiveness of past precautions in maintaining public order, they will implement strict large-scale special precautions before and after the memorial day. At that time, all police officers, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, and the defense forces of various countries will be mobilized, and this port will form an armed fortress, ensuring that there will be no other worries about public security.

Police and Defense Forces, Mobile Patrol

The Public Concession Police Department, in order to curb the activities of criminals and maintain good order within the concession, has specially dispatched six Chinese police officers led by one patrol chief to patrol the main roads in the Edward Road area and selectively check pedestrians. This kind of mobile police patrol is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of unexpected events. In addition, several platoons of the French Concession Defense Forces, each with nine people, have also been dispatched to take on precautions for several days. The security forces of the two concessions have been further strengthened.

Tense Situation in Western Shanghai

Although the Japanese army in the "Ding" district of the Public Concession, that is, the section of the road built across the boundary in western Shanghai, has denied that it has been stationed, Japanese military police in the area are patrolling frequently, and the atmosphere has not eased. Yesterday (12th) at 9:50 AM, three Japanese military police and five police officers from a certain party blocked all pedestrians passing by on the eastern side of Yuyuan Road, Qi Defeng Road, and forcibly checked them. The packages they were carrying were also opened and inspected. Many passing cars were searched. At about 3:00 PM, six or seven armed Japanese military police in yellow uniforms patrolled the Yuyuan Road and Kaixuan Road area, and from time to time stopped pedestrians for interrogation. The Japanese soldiers stationed at the original post in front of the old site of the Broadway Association at No. 864 Yuyuan Road have been reduced to one.

### Getting Rid of the Shackles of Hoarding and Manipulation; Advocating Group Purchase of Rice; The Unstable Situation Provides an Opportunity for Rice Weevils to Spread Rumors; It is Rumored that Huge Amounts of Foreign Rice are Awaiting Sale

Recently, those who hoard rice have taken advantage of the unfavorable coastal defense situation to manipulate prices on a large scale, disregarding the price limits. The People's Food Regulation Committee, in view of this, is stepping up its purchase of foreign rice, and in order to facilitate subscribers, has improved the work of ordering foreign rice: (1) Accelerate the speed of each batch of foreign rice (about one batch every three weeks); (2) After each batch of ordered rice arrives in Shanghai and the order payment is cleared, the committee can deliver it to the address of each entrusted subscriber. If the foreign rice ordered by the subscriber is jointly ordered by multiple households, they can also specify to the committee when paying the balance, and the committee can deliver it to the addresses separately. A reporter from Pingming News Agency also learned that after the 21st batch of foreign rice was sold out, the 22nd batch has begun to be ordered. Recently, those who entrusted orders have been very enthusiastic, including China National Products Company, Wang Shengji Woodware Store, China Enamel Factory, and other companies, each ordering several hundred bags, reaching about 2,000 bags. This batch of orders will still be entrusted to British merchant Harmony Foreign Company or French Oriental Exchange Company on about the 20th of this month to order from Saigon. It is found that the shipping between Shanghai and Saigon is very smooth, and there is no problem for foreign rice to come to Shanghai. Various rumors are purely speculative rice merchants making waves.

Market Chaos

After the rice merchant tea market opened as usual at 7:30 AM yesterday, speculative rice weevils rubbed their hands and massively absorbed spot goods from the market, so the market situation became tight again and the order was chaotic. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee was unable to enforce the agreed price limit, and the speculative rice merchants regarded all notices as mere formalities. The committee is scheduled to convene another committee meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. All citizens of the city are eagerly awaiting it. As for the rumor that a large merchant is hoarding hundreds of thousands of bags of rice, waiting for a good price to sell, it is currently being thoroughly investigated.

Group Purchase of Rice

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations yesterday, stating that it recently received a letter from the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, stating that the rice price has recently shown an upward trend again. Although the committee is trying to stabilize the rice price by evaluating the method, this is ultimately a symptomatic treatment rather than a radical cure. To seek a radical cure, it is still the best policy for each industry to "promote group purchase of rice." According to the initial establishment of the committee, it sent a letter to your association to persuade various industries to promote the group purchase of rice movement. It was duly notified to various industry associations, but since February, the effect has not been significant. It is requested that your association continue to advocate, so that grain reserves will be abundant, the rice price will be stable, and the people's livelihood and public security will both benefit.

### Shanghai Port Navigation as Usual; Believing that Rumors of Another Suspension of Navigation are Untrue

It is rumored that shipping between Hong Kong and Haiphong is still difficult, and there is a saying that shipping to Shanghai will be suspended. It is said that the local British shipping company authorities will re-schedule the ships sailing between Shanghai and Haiphong. A reporter recently inquired about this matter from the shipping industry. Both Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies have not heard of this. Taikoo's Suzhou ship was the first to resume sailing to Haiphong this time. The ship sailed on the 8th and has not yet received any telegram here that it cannot continue sailing to Haiphong. Jardine Matheson's Minsheng ship sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong at 8:00 AM yesterday. South China shipping is all normal and has not changed. The Taisheng ship will continue to sail the Shanghai-Haiphong route after returning to Shanghai from Tianjin and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai on the 18th. The Yisheng ship will join the original Shanghai-Haiphong shipping after arriving in Shanghai on the 16th. According to the British shipping company, it has never received any telegrams here that shipping to Haiphong cannot be carried out. Various rumors are absolutely unbelievable.

Song and Ao Routes

Shanghai-Wenzhou Route: Since the Japanese side re-prohibited navigation to Aojiang, which is still in the non-prohibited navigation area, the foreign ships sailing to Wenzhou from this port have changed their route to Gutaotou, so that passengers and goods can be transferred to Wenzhou. Later, the place was bombed, and the Japanese warships blocked the foreign ships sailing to Ao again, causing the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to be interrupted again. According to the investigation yesterday, the Baoli ship of the Italian merchant Huayi Foreign Company, which has been berthed in Shanghai for more than a month, set sail for Aojiang last night. The ship sailing today is the British merchant Leighton Muller ship. Therefore, after the two ships test the navigation of the Aojiang route, there may be hope for recovery. The Songmen route is still very smooth. The Moufu ship has arrived safely there. The British merchant Manley Muller ship sailed yesterday morning. After the Golden ship returns to the port from Song, it will continue to sail to Songmen. The Haiyi ship is scheduled to set sail from the Bund of Wuma Road at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

Fuqing Route

Since the Xinanna ship of the British merchant Fuzheng Company successfully returned to Shanghai after test sailing to Fuqing, it was originally planned to sail to Fujian the week before, but due to the water foot problem, a dispute occurred with the Fujian merchant, which delayed the sailing schedule. It is now learned that this problem has been partially resolved, and the company has agreed to make a slight concession, so the ship is scheduled to set sail from Longmaozhan in Pudong today to Fuqing. The company's Xinanli ship will also continue to sail.

### The Municipal Council Convened a Meeting of Police Chiefs Yesterday; The Details of the Meeting Cannot be Learned for the Time Being; However, it is Known that Meetings will Continue Soon

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the police chiefs of the Public Concession Municipal Council, the French Concession Municipal Council, and Zhuan Xiaoan had lunch together at the Municipal Council Building at 12:15 PM today (12th) for an informal meeting to engage in preliminary discussions aimed at establishing a more harmonious relationship between the three parties and cracking down on illegal crimes in the city. This meeting was invited by Major Bowen, the Police Chief of the Municipal Council Police Department. Those present included Faber, the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council Police Department, Lu Ying, Captain Hayashi of the Japanese Military Police, and Hattori, the Police Chief of the Japanese Consulate. There is no detail available on today's meeting, but it is reported that a follow-up meeting was arranged during the session to achieve concrete results in cracking down on the surge in illegal crimes in the city.

Police Cooperation Once Discussed

The issue of police cooperation has been discussed in writing by the Municipal Council and the Consular Body. Fei Lipu, the Director of the Municipal Council, invited Japanese Consul General Miura, French Consul General Eugene, and Bradem, the Chairman of the French Concession Municipal Council, and Zhuan Xiaoan to hold a meeting in the Municipal Council Conference Room at 3:00 PM on the 27th. The French side did not attend that day, and only sent personnel to listen. The meeting discussed how the police authorities in the port should expand mutual cooperation so that armed criminal behavior can be curbed. After Major Bowen of the Public Concession Municipal Council returned to Shanghai and resumed his duties, the plan tended to be proactive.

First Joint Action Taken

Yesterday's platform was the first step taken by the police authorities in the port to take joint action. In the past, the police actions of the parties were carried out independently, with only slight cooperation between the police departments of the British and French concessions. Until the wind of assassination suddenly arose, such as the murder of two Russian detectives from the French Concession Police Department, the assassination of Mantsila, the leader of the White Russians in the port, the martyrdom of the famous reporter Zhang Sixu, and the simultaneous murder of the Polish僑 Karaxun. The Municipal Council then requested the cooperation of the Consular Body in the port to crack down on the criminal cases here. When the Consular Body requested the Municipal Council Conference Room, it was generally expected that the Consular Body would urge the closure of all roads leading into the Public Concession from the criminals, advance the time of the curfew, and grant the Municipal Council special powers. However, the resolution of the Consular Body, in addition to condemning the growth of crime, recommended closer cooperation between the police authorities in the various districts, and the meeting of police chiefs yesterday was based on the recommendation of the Consular Body.

### US Minesweeper Arrives in Shanghai this Morning

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the US Asian Fleet minesweeper Heron is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 13th. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive here today (12th), but encountered a hurricane on the way south from Qingdao, causing a slight delay. The duration of the ship's stay in Shanghai has not been announced, but it is expected that it will not stay in Shanghai for long.

### Preventing the Circulation of Counterfeit Bills; Issuing Old Bills

In order to prevent the counterfeiting of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance has decided on concrete measures: the four banks will prevent the transfer of new legal tender notes into the occupied areas, and prepare more old notes for issuance in the branches near the occupied areas, so that all those circulating in the occupied areas are old notes, then it is not easy for fake tickets to be confused with the real ones. No matter where there is collection, transportation, or use of counterfeit legal tender, after verification or reporting and confirmation, it shall be severely punished in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 10 of the revised Punishment Regulations or Article 4 of the revised Punishment Regulations for Harming the National Currency, depending on the circumstances of the crime. Those who report will be given bonuses by the issuing banks.

### Seventy British Residents in Shanghai Enlist in Homeland Army, to be Dispatched to India and Malaya; Ten French Residents Go to England to Serve Under Tagore

The Shanghai Times reports that seventy British residents in Shanghai, responding to the call to arms from their homeland, will soon leave Shanghai for India and Malaya to serve in the British Army in the Far East and serve their country. These British residents were originally scheduled to depart next Monday on a British company mail ship, but it is now reported that their departure date has been postponed. Separately, ten French residents in the city will accompany these British volunteers. It is reported that the ten French residents are going to London to serve in the French Army under the command of General Tagore, hoping to continue the war effort. It is noted that a group of about fifteen British youths left Shanghai to join the military two weeks ago. However, since the outbreak of the European war last year, this group is the largest number of British residents leaving Shanghai to join the military. Among them, most have resided in Shanghai for quite some time, and about twenty-five will go to India for five months of training, after which they will receive officer ranks and be assigned to the army stationed in India. One of them told a reporter that they likely would not need to be deployed outside India or the Near East. A fortunate few may return to England to participate in the war, but most will have to fill vacancies at all levels in the army stationed in India. The remaining forty-odd will disembark in Singapore to serve in Malaya and the Straits Settlements. It is reported that the British company mail ship carrying these volunteers will only stop in Singapore and Bombay to allow the British volunteers to disembark separately, and then transport the ten French residents serving under General Tagore directly to England. It is also reported that British residents in the city who have registered to enlist in the army have been called up, and a small team of naval volunteers was transferred to Hong Kong several months ago. However, those who registered to enlist in the British Air Force have not yet received official call-up notices, so many have returned to England on their own to join the Air Force.

He once worked in the British press in his home country and then worked for Reuters in Shanghai. Mr. Hu will now accompany eight other British youths, waiting for a ship to Hong Kong and then to Malaya, abandoning his pen to pursue a military life.

### Jing'an Temple Road Race Club Not Closing

According to a report in yesterday's Japanese-language "Continental News," the Jing'an Temple Road Race Club might close because some British people feel that such entertainment is inappropriate while the British-German war is raging.

### French Concession Night Soil Carriers' Strike Resolved; All Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; French Municipal Council Issued Emergency Announcement; Labor-Management Consultation Results Satisfactory

The French Concession night soil carriers' strike, which had lasted for nearly a week, was not resolved despite vigorous mediation by the French Concession Police Political Department. Many sewers and corners became places for dumping night soil, causing foul odors to spread. In view of this, the French Municipal Council issued an emergency announcement, notifying both labor and management to resolve everything before 5:00 PM yesterday, otherwise the Bureau would directly hire workers. As a result of frank consultations between the Qingfang representatives, the contracting office requested the Municipal Council to agree to change the previously proposed condition, namely the wage, to an increase of four and a half yuan per person per month. As for the management's subsidy to the union's operating expenses of 400 yuan per month, it was not established. However, the management agreed to request the health department to issue free treatment certificates for the planned hospital. The consultation lasted for two hours, and both parties felt satisfied and declared a resolution. All 700 night soil carriers resumed work yesterday morning.

They then began to search and rob, taking away over 40,000 yuan in cash and fleeing without a trace.

### Zhou Fu-jiu Descendants' Inheritance Dispute Case

The case of a lawsuit filed by the descendants of the late salt merchant Zhou Fu-jiu over disputed inheritance has attracted considerable attention from the public. The case has been heard by the court and will be heard again tomorrow. According to investigations from related parties, Zhou Fu-jiu made a profit of about ten million yuan through business, but it has been privately borrowed and used up by various branches. After Zhou's death, there was little left of the estate after repaying various debts. Subsequently, because each branch had debts to the outside world, lawsuits arose one after another. In the years 1934 and 1935, Zhou Wu-chang-tang was completely bankrupt. Therefore, the creditors were asked to settle at a discount. In order to preserve the face of Wu-chang-tang, they never formally applied for bankruptcy.

### Fu Feng Flour Mill Owner's Young Son, Sun Yi-chen, Kidnapped Yesterday; Sun Yi-chen and Four Younger Siblings Encounter Danger on Way to School; Kidnapped Along With Car Without Trace; Gangsters Crash Car Into Elderly Woman While Speeding

A kidnapping case occurred on Moxianshan Road and Tokyo Road in western Shanghai yesterday morning. The kidnapped person was Sun Yi-chen, the son of the elder of the Fu Feng Machinery Flour Mill. When the gangsters drove to the intersection of Roberts Road, they crashed into an elderly woman on the side of the road due to excessive speed, fired a shot, and continued to speed south. When the nearby patrol officers suddenly heard the gunshot and chased to Binlang Road, the kidnappers had already escaped. The details are recorded below:

Four Siblings Go to School in Same Car

The Fu Feng Machinery Flour Mill is located at No. 126 Moganshan Road. It was established many years ago and has a thriving business. It also has a distribution office at No. 97 Renji Road. The general manager is Sun Zhongli from Anhui, and the factory affairs are managed by his cousin Boqun. Their families all live in the factory. Sun Zhongli's eldest son, Yi-chen, is 21 years old and is a freshman at Datong University on Xinzha Road. He just entered the school this year. At about 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Yi-chen and his four younger siblings took their Dodge car (number 4981) to school.

Kidnappers Crash Car Into Elderly Woman

The car was usually driven by chauffeur Wang Gengsheng (from Wuxi). Unexpectedly, when driving through the intersection of Moganshan Road and Tokyo Road, four kidnappers ambushed on the side of the road, blocking the way with handguns. They first threatened the chauffeur and three younger siblings to get out of the car, leaving only Yi-chen in the car. The gangsters swarmed in, driven by a gangster, and sped away. When they reached the vicinity of Xiaoshadu Road and Dabazhong on Roberts Road, an elderly woman was spying in the middle of the road and was knocked to the ground, fortunately without injury. The location was bustling, and the people on the road were surrounded by spectators, blocking the way. The gangsters, seeing the situation, were very frightened and immediately fired a shot into the sky, and the pedestrians dispersed.

Tracking and Pursuit Fail

Nearby patrol officers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, catching a glimpse of the car speeding south. The police immediately tracked it to the intersection of Binlang Road at the southern end, but were unable to catch it. Afterwards, Sun's chauffeur returned to the factory and reported the information to the owner, who immediately reported it to the Putuo Road police station for rescue. On one hand, Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate the scene. Because the chauffeur Wang Gengsheng was newly hired, he was not without suspicion and was taken to the police station for strict investigation. It is reported that the owner's father, Boqun, used to be an engineer on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. Because of his excellent knowledge and ability, he was hired as the factory director several years ago.

### Latest Map of Europe Published

Map expert Ma Zhongyao believes that the situation in Europe has changed drastically in recent years, and the political boundaries of various countries have been repeatedly changed. General maps in the market are not up to date and are insufficient for those who care about the international situation and for geography departments in various schools. Therefore, based on the latest Chinese and foreign magazines and newspaper materials, he carefully drew a map of Europe, named the Latest European Terrain Map, printed in five colors, and has been published by the Zhulin Bookstore in Ren'anli, Guling Road, priced at eight corners. The new and old boundaries of various countries are clearly depicted in the map, and the important cities and places listed number more than 4,000. A small booklet with a Chinese-Western comparative gazetteer is attached for easy reference.

### Resident on Dicui Road Has Infant Kidnapped

Guo Rongqing, a resident of No. 1318 Dicui Road, Hongkou, who is in the business of yellow sand and gravel, has a son named Changming, who is only three years old. At about 8:00 PM last night, three gangsters suddenly appeared, two of them holding handguns, and kidnapped Changming, and their whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the family reported to the police station to request an investigation.

### Ticket Inspector and Ticket Seller Clash

At about 5:40 PM yesterday, a No. 171 Route 18 trolleybus, traveling south, passed through the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road. Recently, several ticket inspectors were specially dispatched to check tickets there. At that time, it is not known how, but the ticket seller on the bus suddenly clashed with the ticket inspector, and then they wrestled into a group. At the time, another No. 168 Route 18 trolleybus was closely following behind and stopped upon seeing the situation. A ticket seller from that car also got off to help. Then, the police took them all to the police station. As a result, the No. 172 trolleybus had no ticket seller and was stopped on the side of the road. The cars behind were all blocked from moving forward, and there were more than a dozen cars at one time.

### Xin Da Xiang Silk and Satin Shop Sues for 80% Rent Increase; Tenant Rightfully Refuses, Requests Dismissal; Judge Advises Mediation, Reschedules

The property of Xin Da Xiang Silk, Satin, and Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 614, east end of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, including the two- and three-story buildings, is rented by Dehe Foreign Firm. When Xin Da Xiang leased from Dehe, it was agreed that the monthly rent, including water fees, would total 1,900 yuan in national currency per month. After Xin Da Xiang leased the property, in addition to the storefront on the ground floor for its own use and part of the building upstairs for its own use,

the remaining space was sublet to thirteen households, including the Jinling Typing Vocational School. However, after the lease between Xin Da Xiang and Dehe expired on May 15 of this year, Dehe, seeing that Xin Da Xiang's business was thriving, notified them to increase the rent to 3,000 yuan per month, and the water fee must also be borne by the tenants. As a result, Xin Da Xiang renewed the lease according to Dehe's method. As a result, Xin Da Xiang's rent burden increased by 1,100 yuan per month, and it also had to bear a water fee of about 440 yuan per month. The Municipal Council's donation fee also increased by 50%, and the monthly donation was 810 yuan. In total, the expenditure on the house reached 4,250 yuan, an increase of 89.5% compared to before. Therefore, Xin Da Xiang notified the sublet households in the building that each household would also have to increase the rent by 80% starting from May of this year. The tenants refused to accept such a huge rent increase, breaking the rent increase record, and there has been no solution to this problem every month. Xin Da Xiang then hired lawyer Wang Zhengshao to file a lawsuit against three tenants, Jinling Typing School, Meiduo Radio Research Institute, and Jinji Co., for an 80% rent increase and declared provisional execution. The reason is that the rent increase was caused by the rent increase by the landlord. Although the defendant bears 80%, the actual plaintiff bears 90%, which is not an unreasonable rent increase. The case was heard in the afternoon by Judge Ni Wei'ao in the Third Civil Court. The defendant entrusted lawyers Wei Weiqing and Xuan Zhendong to appear in court and stated that the defendant did not know how the plaintiff negotiated with Dehe. However, it is important to know that Taichang Ginseng Co., which has the same status as Xin Da Xiang, rents a house of 750 square feet from Dehe Foreign Firm and pays a monthly rent of 570 yuan. The plaintiff occupies a position of 5,200 square feet. Compared with Taichang, the cost of the plaintiff's occupied position should be 4,283 yuan. Moreover, the plaintiff also occupies a part of the second and third floors, which is already excessive use. The rent paid by the defendant, more than 500 yuan, is an extra profit. Although Taichang has also increased the rent recently, it is only 10%. Why is the plaintiff's increase so huge? As for the water fee, the defendants are all offices and do not use much water at all. The plaintiff has many partners and has to cook 26 tables of meals each time, so the defendant accounts for only one-twenty-fifth of the calculated water consumption.

Based on the above reasons, the plaintiff's lawsuit has no reason and should be dismissed by the court. The rent payable by the defendant has been deposited with the court, and the plaintiff will definitely not suffer any loss of compensation, so the request for provisional execution should also be dismissed. After Judge Ni verified the report, he ordered a change of date for both parties to conduct a public prosecution to try to reconcile, as reconciliation is the best solution in this case.

### Only Son Run Over and Killed by Car

Collecting Tickets Causes Accident; Driver Not at Fault; Corpse Relatives Sue for Compensation

Zhu Liansheng, a Yongbo native who lives at No. 429, Tiebangpu Bobert Road and runs a printing business, had a seven-year-old only son named Caixing, who was adopted by both families. At 1:45 PM on August 27, while picking up discarded tickets thrown on the ground by passengers at the public bus stop at the intersection of Bobert Road and Belle Road with three or five neighboring children, the wind blew a ticket into the middle of the road. Caixing rushed to pick it up, and a No. 96 bus No. 824 of the French Tram Company driven by driver Ma Canwen came along. Caixing could not avoid it and was knocked down and had his skull crushed, and he died instantly. The police took the body to the mortuary, summoned the corpse relatives, reported to the court for personnel to verify, and ordered the corpse to be claimed by the corpse father Zhu Liansheng. The defendant was released by the police. The details have been recorded in previous reports. After investigation by the police, it was found that the fault lay in the deceased's carelessness and that the car driver was not at fault, so the defendant was not prosecuted. The French Tram Company also refused to compensate the corpse relatives for damages. It is now heard that the corpse father Zhu Liansheng, because his beloved son was tragically run over and killed and was not understood and compensated by the company, was unwilling and has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court against the driver for negligent homicide, requesting that he be punished as he deserves and requesting that the defendant and the company jointly compensate for damages.

### Lost and Found Fountain Pen

Dear Editor, on the 11th (at about 3:00 PM), I went to the Jiangxi Road Central Savings Association and found a Parker fountain pen at the membership office. I immediately handed it over to Mr. Xia (or Mr. Hua), the cashier there. The pen has a name engraved on it. I hope the loser will go to the association to claim it. If no one claims it, please call me at 61051, and I can accompany you to retrieve it. Please publish this letter in your newspaper for public convenience. With best wishes, Zhang Yugong, September 12.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern, today your newspaper's "Social News" column carried a report that our bank employee He Shiyao et al. embezzled bank funds. This is not consistent with the facts. He Shiyao et al. did not embezzle bank funds. This case is purely a private debt dispute and has nothing to do with the bank. We hereby inform you of this and kindly request that you correct it accordingly. Sincerely, China Reclamation Bank, Xiafei Road Branch, September 12.

### Ministry of Education Stipulates Student Quotas for Normal Colleges in Various Provinces and Cities This Year; Totaling 1,186 People

(Chongqing Aviation News) The establishment of normal colleges is intended to train sound teachers for secondary schools in various provinces and cities. Therefore, when recruiting students, the needs of secondary school teachers in various provinces and cities should be taken into account. In April of this year, when the Ministry of Education convened the Second Higher Normal Education Conference, it specifically proposed the principles for enrolling students in normal colleges and the allocation of quotas for various provinces and cities. The conference decided as follows:

(A) Principles (1) The allocation of annual new student quotas for normal colleges in various provinces and cities should be based on population, with additions and subtractions based on the number of secondary schools and normal college classes in each province and city. The quotas will be determined separately by the Ministry of Education. (2) The number of students admitted to each department of normal colleges is temporarily set at 30 per class. (3) The prescribed quotas for various provinces and cities account for 70% of the number of students to be recruited, and the remaining 30% is not divided by province or city. (4) The prescribed quotas for various provinces and cities are temporarily allocated across the board, calculated based on the total number of students in all colleges, without specifying that a certain college should accommodate a certain number of students from a certain province or city, but attention should be paid to their examination area during the unified enrollment and distribution. (5) The prescribed quotas for various provinces and cities are still distributed by the unified enrollment committee through examinations. (6) If the prescribed quotas for various provinces and cities cannot be filled due to insufficient scores, students with good scores from other provinces and cities may be used to supplement them. However, the quotas for the supplementing provinces and cities should be reduced accordingly in the following year, and the quotas for the insufficient provinces and cities should be increased accordingly. (7) If the scores of examinees from various provinces and cities do not meet the admission standards but are not too poor, they may be given priority to be assigned to preparatory classes for remedial studies when the quotas of the provinces and cities are insufficient.

(B) Allocation of Quotas for Various Provinces and Cities: Sichuan 110, Yunnan 50, Guizhou 40, Guangdong 85, Shandong (including Qingdao) 60, Shanxi 35, Jiangsu (including Shanghai and Nanjing) 120, Fujian 50, Hebei (including Tianjin and Peiping) 95, Zhejiang 45, Anhui 45, Hunan 65, Hubei 35, Henan 55, Jiangxi 55, Guangxi 50, Shaanxi 40, Xikang 14, Liaoning 20, Gansu 25, Jilin 14, Heilongjiang 14, Rehe 14, Ningxia 8, Chahar 8, Qinghai 8, Suiyuan 8, Xinjiang 8.

### 57 Teams Participate in This Year's Western League Football Tournament. Shanghai Western Football Club Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday. Lieutenant Elected as President. New Staff Members Selected.

The 1940-1941 Annual General Meeting of the Seven Seas Football Club was held at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Seafarers' Association Building of HSBC Building. Because of the large number of new teams registering to participate, more than a hundred representatives attended the annual meeting, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. The meeting was chaired by President Breakey. After his speech, Secretary Spike read the report on the club's affairs for the previous year, the names of the champions and runners-up of each group, and the accounts for the fiscal year ending July 31 this year. The results were passed without objection. Then, the election of new staff members began. Someone temporarily proposed that the term of office of the president be changed to two years to avoid monopolizing the club's affairs. It was passed by a majority. The vote continued. As President Breakey had announced his intention to resign, Lieutenant Li De received the most votes and was elected as the new president for this term. Then, the vice president, executive committee members, and appeals committee members were elected in turn. The third item was the review of new and old member teams. As a result, there were as many as 57 teams registering to participate this time. Since the number of teams was large and the review took time, it was handed over to the new executive committee for handling as usual. The names of all participating teams were also kept strictly secret yesterday and refused to be disclosed, so the list could not be obtained. The date of the first meeting of the new executive committee was also not fixed yesterday. It will probably be held next week or on the 17th or 19th. The last motion proposed only one case, that is, the competition time for the reserve and B and C groups in this session. Some people proposed to change it to 90 minutes per game. The result was still to maintain the original method of 35 minutes per half. The new teams participating in this session reached as many as 24 teams, which broke the highest record in history. According to the registration results of this session, there are 9 teams participating in Group A, the same for the Reserve Group, 11 teams for Group B, and 28 teams for Group C. Now Group A and the Reserve Group are certainly not a problem. It is difficult to accommodate such a large number in Group C. How to select them depends on the actions of the new executive committee next week. The results of yesterday's election are recorded below.

President Lieutenant Li De, Vice Presidents Aitcheson, Compriss, Corwatt, Marshall, Executive Committee Members Pan Tuo, Ya Xu, Breakey, Forbes, Lei Yanshi (the president and vice president are ex officio members), Appeals Committee Members Hu Xiansheng, Gaines, Clifford, Mache, Hamkes, League Committee Members Breakey, Cohout, Marshall, Pesoes, (Group A Portuguese Chamber of Commerce) Jin Bo, (Group B Rowing Club) Fleis, (Group C Junior Club) Secretary Spike, Treasurer Jiasheng Accounting Firm.

### Haunted by Ghosts

Outside the Sufeng Gate of Suzhou, there are more than twenty deserted houses. According to legend, ghosts haunt them. Those who live in them hear doors opening and closing, or hear slapping tables, or hear the sound of boots discarded to one side, or hear the sound of pots and pans clanging. People nearby warn each other not to enter these rooms. As a result, they have been empty for many years, covered in dust and cobwebs. The landlord planned to demolish and rebuild them, but suddenly a wandering Taoist claimed that he could use magic spells to drive away demons. The landlord immediately invited him into the empty house and asked what supplies he needed. The Taoist asked for very little, only ordering to prepare several large cats and lock them in a room. The Taoist went out in the morning and returned in the evening, without casting spells or chanting incantations. After three or five days, he reported to the landlord that the monsters had been completely eliminated. The landlord went to see and saw hundreds of dead rats, the larger ones weighing more than a pound each. The Taoist smiled and said, "These are the so-called ghosts that have been haunting the place for years."

### Passing the Holiday

— Liu Jiagan

The calendar flies by, page by page, and a bright red number jumps into view. Time really flies. The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming again. A sentimental sigh echoes in people's mouths.

As usual, in the week before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the newspapers are filled with advertisements from various companies, sugar food stores, cigarette companies, and other goods that can be used as gifts. These lively activities show that it is now a season of "gift-giving and socializing." Many pedestrians on the road are carrying packages of gifts, and the colorful wrapping paper and colorful paper boxes add a lot of joy. But do people like to do this? I doubt the possibility of "liking" it. The following facts can prove that my doubt is largely correct.

Mr. Zhang said to Mrs. Zhang: "We have to give this gift generously. Mr. Li may feel indebted and recommend me for a job." Old Liu muttered to himself: "I must make this year's gift very outstanding. I'm still afraid the manager won't give me a 'promotion'! Haha!" Mr. Sun: "Mr. Feng thought with a smiling face: "How can I miss this opportunity to be attentive? I must buy some gifts to make Miss Li happy. Alas, what does she like the most?"..."

In short, so-called "gift-giving" is nothing more than a means to achieve each person's goals. There is no sincerity or emotion involved. I began to have endless hatred for this season full of deception and hypocrisy. Why do we have to do this?

### Chatting About Salesmen

— Junmei

Salesmen in the business world proudly or self-deprecatingly use the mantra "immortal, tiger, dog." The so-called "immortal, tiger, dog" is the salesmen's daily confession: when they are free from work, they are as carefree as immortals; when dealing with subordinates or bargaining for goods, they are as majestic and powerful as tigers; but when they encounter customers, they have to wag their tails and fawn like dogs to please them. Although this is a common situation that ordinary businessmen are likely to encounter, salesmen especially deeply appreciate the flavor of "immortal, tiger, dog."

The only technique that salesmen rely on for existence is completely built on their "mouth." As long as they are "eloquent," they can talk about things in a fantastical way, making the quality of the goods a secondary factor in the transaction. Therefore, they are also skilled in the art of flattery and praise, making every purchasing agent or customer feel happy, even unable to stop. Thus, the salesman's skills are exhausted and the salesman's task is completed.

Therefore, the lives of salesmen are completely unregulated. Apart from a portion of transaction time, they spend every day in idle talk and meaningless activities: playing cards, listening to operas, visiting prostitutes, and opening hotels are common occurrences. In order to entertain customers, they sometimes inevitably run to the General Assembly, and even engage in various improper activities. The more proficient they are in this way, the more they will spend. The more successful the salesman will be. Therefore, those who maintain their integrity will inevitably go with the flow over time.

However, salesmen, on the other hand, have their own unspeakable grievances. Although the status of salesmen in stores seems to be relatively high and the income seems to be relatively generous, their expenses are considerable. The extravagance of entertainment accounts for a large portion of each salesman's expenses, and the need for neat clothing and ceremonial expenses for weddings and funerals are an additional, unpredictable expense. Considering that an average salesman has a monthly income of one hundred and dozens of yuan, it is conceivable how painful it is to cope with these expenses and still have to support a family!

There are three levels of salesmen: the first is employed salesmen, who have a fixed salary income, ranging from a dozen yuan to several hundred yuan per month. But if business is good, everyone is friendly and harmonious. If there is no business, the situation is quite embarrassing. Under the long sighs of the manager or boss, they feel a little restless and unable to eat. The second is commission salesmen, who earn money based on their ability to attract business. The average commission is "one point." They earn one yuan commission for every one hundred yuan of transaction. To have an income of one thousand yuan a year, they have to do ten thousand yuan of business. Although the price of goods is high, how easy is it to achieve this huge number. The third is broker salesmen, who also take commissions, but they do not have a fixed place of business. They gain trust in people based on their own credit, and move goods from store A to store B, and from store B to store C. When opportunities are good, earning dozens of yuan a day is nothing. When business is sluggish, brokers have no way to start, and can even only hide at home hatching bean sprouts, not much different from the unemployed. The truth about salesmen is self-evident!

Moreover, in recent years, the price of goods has been rising, the purchasing power has been sharply reduced, and customer sales have been cut off. At the same time, the use of advertising by commercial operators is gradually taking away the position of salesmen. The salesman's profession was already quite superficial, and now it is showing these bleak shadows. Here, the author can not help but hope that the salesman from now on improve their lives, abandon the past "business first" incorrect optimistic attitude, and strive for permanent survival.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7 "Arrest Him"

When I returned to my original seat, I saw Hawthorne looking at the small piece of paper I gave him. Ni Jinshou seemed to have noticed my movements and was watching Hawthorne. Lu Jiansheng, however, was wholeheartedly preparing to answer, showing that he did not suspect me.

Hawthorne continued: "Then, what has been the situation of your relationship over the past year?"

Lu Jiansheng hesitated again and slowly said: "Of course, it was very good at first. Recently, she seems to have made friends with a! A gigolo, and she is wasting a lot of money. However, I have not obtained any real evidence. Recently, she—seems—"

"What—seems what?"

"She seems to be even more restless." He lowered his head and pondered for a moment, then showed a determined look. "I believe that her death this time may have been due to her restlessness."

Hawthorne asked attentively: "What's going on? Explain it clearly."

Lu Jiansheng nodded. "Okay, she has recently become acquainted with another person. I don't know his name, but I only know that his surname is Zhao. He is a young man. He is very tall, but you can't say he is handsome. I don't know how Li Lan could fall in love with him. He is only younger than me." As he spoke, his eyes were filled with power, clearly indicating that the fiery jealousy in his heart could not be suppressed.

Hawthorne still said lightly: "Being young is certainly an important factor. But how do you know that she and he have reached the level of what you call 'love'?"

"There is evidence. I will never wrong her."

"Give me some examples, okay?"

Lu Jiansheng still said angrily: "The first time, I happened to go to the Guangming Ballroom and saw Li Lan and this young man dancing. Li Lan also introduced him to me, saying that his surname was Zhao and that he was a former neighbor whom she happened to meet. I didn't suspect anything. The second time, I accompanied a friend to see a movie at the Shanghai Cinema. Suddenly, I saw Li Lan and a man sitting in the row in front of me, whispering intimately. The scene was very ugly. I couldn't help but call out Li Lan. She was so startled that she turned around to look at me and couldn't even speak. The man pretended to be calm. After a while, he didn't finish watching the movie and quietly slipped away. Even though it was dark, I could still recognize that he was the Zhao rogue."

Hawthorne saw that he had stopped speaking and urged him: "At that time, you must have questioned Li Lan, and she must have replied as usual that she met him by chance. Is that right?" (105)

### A Discussion on the Beggar Problem

— Yu Huo

After reading the article "Beggars and Newsboys" published in this newspaper on the 9th, I felt quite a bit of sentiment and wanted to say something.

First of all, regarding Mr. Huanjun's unique view recorded about someone: instead of giving alms to idle beggars, it is better to give newsboys who strive for independence more "money." In principle, I wholeheartedly agree.

However, here I feel it is worth discussing: are "beggars" simply a group of social parasites who do not work for their gains? At the same time, to clearly understand what caused them to become social parasites, should we recognize that it is due to their inherent "lazy bones" or "lowly fate," or is it our society, our system?

Mr. Huanjun's article does not explain this point, but from the text, it seems that he believes that this group of social "parasites" is beyond teaching and not even worthy of alms!

But I deeply feel that this so-called "beggar" problem is not only found in Shanghai. In any province, county, or township, we can always see groups begging from door to door and sleeping in the open. Therefore, from its wide occurrence, it can be seen that the origin is definitely not rooted in an individual's laziness or lowliness, willingly making a living by begging; rather, the selfishness of this society and the unequal system are the main factors that cause them to fall into social parasitism.

Indeed, they are parasitic on people's compassion and do nothing. In fact, this does not indicate that they like to "gain without labor," but rather that they "want to work but cannot!" Look, in our industry and commerce, there is already a state of "overstaffing," and the terror of unemployment can strike at any time for those who are employed. Naturally, it is even more unnecessary to mention employment opportunities for this group of powerless and uninfluential social parasites. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to regard them as inherently "lazy" or "lowly," willingly falling into begging.

At the same time, because we see them as untrainable (in fact, no one is engaged in teaching them), we feel that they are not worthy of alms and allow them to drift. How is this a solution? Perhaps in reality, everyone has not paid attention to this solution, but only added various dislikes!

However, the thefts, robberies, and pickpocketing that occur every day in this city may originate from our indifference and disregard for problems such as beggary.

Accordingly, using normal or charitable means to partially solve our beggar problem may not be without benefit to the maintenance of social order and stability. I remember some time ago, enthusiastic people in this city had a proposal to establish a Beggar Children's Training Institute, attempting to rescue them from the dark bottom layer. This is indeed an essential move. Here, I not only hope it becomes a reality, but I also deeply hope that adult and even old and disabled beggars can have the opportunity to be rescued and trained one day. (Although the solution to the whole problem still depends on the improvement of the entire social system in the future!)

### Stereoscopic Films to Appear in the Soviet Union

— Hong Sheng

The invention of film has only been around for just over fifty years, and its progress can be described as rapid. From silent films to sound films, from black and white to color, film has been making great strides almost every day. This newspaper has previously disclosed news of the invention of smell-o-vision; recently, Soviet newspapers reported the new news of the success of stereoscopic films. Stereoscopic films have been rumored for a long time, and there are many researchers. There used to be stereoscopic films viewed with red and green glasses, and the audience was very interested in this, but they were even more eager for real stereoscopic films. Now that the news has come, stereoscopic films will meet the world, which will also make the audience cheer and cause a revolution in film?

According to Soviet newspapers: director Antlavsky and many of his comrades are going to Yalta to make the first stereoscopic film in history, with the title already set as "Youth Continent." This first stereoscopic film will also be in color. If so, the audience will be able to see the roaring waves outside the screen, and ripe apples will fall from the trees to the audience's feet. Things like this are enough to make the audience close their eyes and imagine the fun.

In Moscow, the required silver screens and all equipment have been prepared, and a special cinema has been built to show this new type of three-dimensional film.

The opening date of this film will be before the end of this year.

### Snippets of the Pear Garden

— Shan

(Seven)

Last year, Shang Xiaoyun accepted the Kun opera actress Li Huijun as a disciple. During the apprenticeship ceremony, Huijun performed the kneeling ceremony according to the grand etiquette, kneeling to Shang's relatives and friends for two hours, kowtowing more than two hundred times. Some guests shouted "Kowtowing Insect," and the whole audience roared with laughter.

(Eight)

Kun opera expert Wu Mei, with his singing and playing, "can complete a tune without the help of a second person," has the reputation of a "sage of opera." However, he rarely performed on stage in his life. In the winter of the seventh year of the Republic, the Capital Appreciation Society held a meeting at the Jiangxi Guild Hall. Wu got drunk after drinking, and with the encouragement of friends, he played the old woman in Lü Mengzheng's Porridge Pouring, with a face full of black beard like halberds, without makeup, causing an uproar in the audience.

(Nine)

Du Wenlin is the only fat person in the opera world. In a certain year, he weighed 325 pounds. Du is the descendant of the famous young male actor Du Dieyun, a family of opera officials. He loves drinking and dancing. Where is he now?

(Ten)

In the early years of the Republic, the first stage in the capital performed patriotic operas. Yang Xiaolou played Lu Wenlong in Eight Hammers, Wenlong being sixteen years old at the time. Before the show, Liu Zongyang played Xue Dingshan in the Fen River Bay, Dingshan being seventeen years old at the time. The audience laughed and said, "The grandson is older than the grandfather!"

(Eleven)

Tan Fuying once arranged a purely battle-themed opera performance, with the plays being Ji Yanfen's Battle of Jinshan, Lin Qiuwen's Battle of Puguan, Yang Shengchun's Battle of Jizhou, and Fuying's Battle of Taiping. The date was July 1st last year, and the location was the Jixiang Garden in the capital.

(Twelve)

When Xun Huisheng sings, his head moves, and his mouth movements are very beautiful. Shang Xiaoyun's singing is most mysterious with a smile. Although Cheng Yanqiu has gained weight, his nose is very seductive. Zhang Junqiu is not very tall himself, but he does not appear short after makeup. Although Song Dezhu is petite, her appearance is graceful and charming.

### Gu Lanjun Participates in the Performance of "Hero of the Seas"

— Qing He

The sensation of "Ge Nen Niang" was the result of the efforts of the playwright, director, and actors. The "New Arts Troupe" was established based on these three, dedicating itself to the performance of "Hero of the Seas."

"Hero of the Seas" is the story of Zheng Chenggong going to Taiwan to launch an uprising after his departure in the first act of "Ge Nen Niang." The entire play is divided into four acts. According to sources, the content is as follows: The first act is the divergence of opinions in the court; the second act is Bolo's search for Zheng Zhilong; the third act is Zheng Chenggong's farewell to his wife and children; the fourth act is the Taiwan uprising.

Zheng Chenggong's role is very important and is still played by Liu Qiong. His righteous and awe-inspiring wife, Ms. Dong, is also a very important figure in the play. Now, the playwrights Wei Ruhui and Wu Yonggang have obtained Gu Lanjun's consent to guest star in the role. Other actors are as stated in various newspapers. As for the location and date of the premiere, the location is probably no problem at the Carlton, and the date is still under discussion.

### After Watching "The Female Emperor"

— Jin Ge

"The Female Emperor" writes about the historical events of the Hun invasion of the Jin Dynasty. The story is about A Lan, the daughter of Li Gang, the commander-in-chief of Luoyang, who is given to the Great Chanyu Liu Cong as an adopted daughter, and later returns to the country with the army, capturing her own father, Li Gang. She explains the importance of turning against the enemy to the loyal father. The film then describes A Lan's romance with Zong Han. The writing technique is still relatively complete. In the end, Liu Cong escapes death, which indicates that A Lan's reasons for stopping the execution were due to her gratitude for being raised by him. However, having such forgiveness when dealing with evildoers creates a huge problem. The author only focuses on the heroic deeds of a few important figures but does not depict the true power of each national revolutionary war: the people. In general, the director handles it well, although the war scenes at the beginning of the film are compact but lack realism.

Li Qinian grasped the character of A Lan well, and her acting skills were also very proficient. If she continues to work hard, she will give us better achievements in Liang Hongyu or other films. Zhang Yi's calmness and steadiness should be the most outstanding performance in the whole film.

Zheng Zhong utilizes eye and finger movements. He Bin's recklessness, Xi Meng's Liu Cong, and Yan Hua's Langya King are all competent.

Fan Xuepeng guest stars as Li Ma here, and she has grasped the emotion, but her movements are a bit rigid. All in all, this is Yi Hua's wonderful work this year and is worth seeing.

The "Karma Mirror Stand," which is being shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater, has a moving plot and a strong cast. The picture shows the rebellious son Louis Hayward flirting with his stepmother Madeleine Carroll.

### Bai Yang Will Not Return to Shanghai; Her Determination is Quite Firm

— Xing

Colleagues from Chongqing's "China Electric" asked Bai Yang if she would return to Shanghai. She said: "Someone from Shanghai invited me before. For the sake of friendship, I didn't completely refuse, but I didn't agree either. Will I go to Shanghai? No." Finally, she said: "During this period, suffering is necessary. I will never leave Chongqing for the sake of generous salaries and a comfortable life!"

### A Record of Yin Guifang

— Ruo

Yin Guifang, a female Yue opera performer, is a native of Xinchang, Shaoxing. She is twenty-one years old. She learned the role of young male from Yang at an early age. After graduating, she was recruited by the Ningbo Dong Theater. Her new voice was first tried and was well-known in Siming. She was only fifteen years old at that time. In the 27th year of the Republic, she came to Shanghai and performed successively at Yongle, Huiquan, and Nanyang. Now she belongs to Tongle and is the headliner. There are many fans supporting her. It is said that the Zhenshe, run by Shanghai gentleman Huang Zenshi, has recently been supporting Yin Ling's performance, with sixty guests booked every night, which has lasted for a week, which shows that the actress's appeal is not weak.
