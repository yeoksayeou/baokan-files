### President Roosevelt Announces US Loan of $100 Million to China, Half of Which Will Be Used to Protect Chinese Currency; A Forceful Reply to Japan's Recognition of the Wang Regime

WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt officially announced yesterday evening that the United States has extended a credit of $50 million to China. The President also stated that the government is considering continuing loans to China to reach a total of $100 million. This announcement was made immediately after indirectly receiving news that the Japanese-Wang "Agreement" had been signed in Nanjing. President Roosevelt stated in his official announcement regarding the loan, "Economic cooperation talks between the Chinese and American authorities have made progress. The US government is considering extending a credit loan of $100 million US dollars to China, of which $50 million US dollars for the purchase of ordinary goods has been decided by the US government." The President further stated, "The US government is currently seeking to ensure that the remaining $50 million loan can be completed as soon as possible. This other $50 million is to be used to protect Chinese legal tender, thereby maintaining the currency balance between China and the United States. This type of fund is currently being discussed by the Congressional Budget Committee." President Roosevelt issued a formal statement saying the government is working to get another $50 million in loans implemented soon to stabilize Chinese legal tender. This loan brings the total amount the United States has loaned to China since 1932, including loans already made and those to be made, to $245 million US dollars. In the past two years, the United States has only loaned China $16 million. Before the new loan announced yesterday, the United States had loaned China a total of $85 million, of which China has repaid $9 million. Yesterday's loan, together with subsequent loans, totals $160 million US dollars.

President Roosevelt reported that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will attend a joint meeting of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Committee on Weights and Measures on Monday to report on the currently proposed $50 million expansion of credit loans. Diplomatic and international circles believe that the loan at this time is of great significance. Many believe that the United States is trying to offset any serious impact from Japan's recognition of the Wang Jingwei regime. Observers recall that the United States has taken several steps to benefit Chongqing whenever Japan has taken actions that harm the Chongqing Chinese National Government. When Hankou fell, the United States provided China with a large amount of loans for the first time. When the Burma Road was blocked, the United States imposed an embargo on Japan on several essential materials. Recently, when Japan was about to join the Axis powers, the United States announced that it would give China a new loan. Now that China is encountering a favorable situation, the United States is once again providing this assistance. China's favorable factors include (1) the strengthening of the US military power in the Pacific, (2) the defense talks between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia regarding Singapore and other Pacific regions, and (3) the strengthening of the British naval position in the Mediterranean. British Prime Minister Churchill said that this move is sufficient to affect Britain's power in other remote parts of the world. It is reported that this new loan between China and the United States was negotiated by the Chinese Ambassador to Washington, Hu Shi, and Song Ziwen. Song Ziwen is the Chairman of the Bank of China and the former Minister of Finance of China. It is also reported that the majority of this new aid, of which $60 million US dollars is said to be not in the nature of a loan, but a kind of trade arrangement for goods shipped from China to the United States at market price. This shows that the United States is willing to maintain commercial contact with China and can rely on China's main raw materials to enhance the defense position of the United States. (United Press International)

The White House simultaneously released a letter from Jesse Jones, Administrator of the Federal Loan Agency, to President Roosevelt, regarding the purchase of military raw materials from China, stating, "Regarding the purchase of military raw materials that are extremely important in the US national defense program, the Metals Reserve Company, an affiliate of the Federal Loan Administration, is now continuing to order tungsten, antimony, tin, and other materials worth $60 million from the Chinese Resources Committee. The goods will be delivered at market prices suitable for loan repayments in the coming years. In order to assist China in dealing with its current financial problems, the United States Export-Import Bank has agreed to lend another $50 million to the Chinese government, guaranteed by the Central Bank of China, and the above-mentioned order of metals will be used to offset the loan." This letter stated that the US Treasury Department had granted the same loan, so that China would be provided with a new loan of $100 million. It then stated that China had paid the United States on schedule with tung oil and tin, fulfilling its obligation to sell these necessities to the United States to pay off previous debts, which the President was pleased to hear. (Reuters)

NEW YORK - The New York Times reported today that the United States' loan to China is President Roosevelt's first important diplomatic action after being elected for his third term. This move by the United States not only hopes to consolidate China's strength to resist Japan, but also encourages the Soviet Union to continue to aid China. (Reuters)

### Chongqing Welcomes US Loan

CHONGQING - Official circles here heard the news of the US loan of $50 million to China and were very welcoming, saying that this move by the United States is sufficient to counter the economic and military treaty signed yesterday in Nanjing. Officials said that this new loan is the United States' political and moral support for China's war of resistance and should not be regarded as a relief for China's urgent needs, because the second loan from the United States has not yet been fully used, and the third loan has not been used at all. (United Press International)

Hull Declares Policy Unchanged, Continues to Recognize Chongqing Government

Secretary of State Hull commented on the Japanese-Wang treaty at a press conference yesterday, saying that the United States will of course continue to recognize the Chongqing government. He said, "On March 30, I made a broad statement of basic principles, which can be applied to any stage of the Sino-Japanese incident. I think it is best for you to review it." Hull's previous remarks were made when the Wang regime was established. They stated, "This is another step in the process of a country imposing itself on its neighbors by force and obstructing its normal political and economic relations with other countries in the world. Japan hopes to establish a system in which Japan has a unique advantage and deprives the United States and other third countries of the right to equal and fair treatment that they have long enjoyed. The circumstances of the establishment of the Wang regime are not consistent with Japan's claim that it will respect China's political independence. The Chongqing government has the support and approval of the majority of the Chinese people. The US policy remains unchanged."

In general, people here say that Wang Jingwei's telegram to Chongqing is just a formality and is not worth answering. The Japanese-Wang treaty signed yesterday, as transmitted by Chinese news agencies, clearly states that Japan has no intention of withdrawing Japanese troops from China at any time. Because neither Wang Jingwei nor the Japanese can defeat the Chongqing government, the so-called withdrawal of troops two years after the complete restoration of peace in all parts of China is a distant prospect, far beyond reasonable expectations. People here also say that Japan is now actively trying to shake hands with Moscow, the center of the Communist Party. If the plan succeeds, Japan will also shake hands with the communist army in China, which Japan calls its interests and ideas are the same as those of Moscow's communism. In that case, why does Japan want an anti-communist zone to station troops in North China? (Reuters)

### United States Actively Builds Two-Ocean Navy to Resist Any Joint Attack; Navy Releases Annual Report

WASHINGTON - Acting Secretary of the Navy Kenden declared in the Navy's annual report yesterday that President Roosevelt believes that the US policy is to arm itself rapidly to meet the needs of national defense on both oceans. Kenden quoted the President as saying, "The United States should complete its naval defense needs as quickly as possible so that it can resist any joint attack on both oceans." The report stated that the United States should have enough troops to be able to take action freely in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, while at the same time ensuring the safety of defense in another ocean. The report expressed satisfaction with the current US warships and their progress, believing that the fleet still has room for improvement. The report said that there has been a serious shortage of naval personnel recently, but this shortage has been greatly reduced due to the employment of veterans and reservists. As of June 30 this year, the United States' combat power included 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 18 heavy cruisers, 19 light cruisers, 197 destroyers, 44 old destroyers not in service, 101 submarines, as well as countless auxiliary ships and minesweepers. There are 10 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 17 light cruisers, 61 destroyers, and several shallow-water ships under construction. (United Press International)

### Japan Plans to Continue Negotiations with the Dutch East Indies; Sawada Appointed Chief Representative

TOKYO - Officials here announced that former Japanese Foreign Minister Sawada has been appointed as the leader of the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies. Sawada told reporters yesterday that he is determined to complete his mission, although this mission is not an easy task. Sawada expressed regret that relations between Japan and the Netherlands had failed to develop in a friendly direction, but said that his goal was to normalize these relations. (Haitong Telegraph)

TOKYO - Japan's newly appointed special envoy to the Dutch East Indies, Sawada, told reporters that his mission to the Dutch East Indies was not to hold diplomatic talks, but to negotiate a commercial agreement. Japan and the Dutch East Indies are both within the "Greater East Asia" sphere, and both sides know that the current relationship is not satisfactory and should promote mutual understanding. (Haitong Telegraph)

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Solemn Statement Regarding Nanjing Treaty Signing

CHONGQING - The reaction here to the signing of the treaty between Wang and Japan in Nanjing yesterday was to warn other countries that recognizing this organization would be considered an unfriendly act. This warning appeared in a statement issued by Foreign Minister Wang last night. The full text is as follows: "The signing of the so-called treaty between Japan and the Nanjing puppet organization is a further stage in Japan's aggression, aimed at destroying all laws and order in China and the entire Pacific. Japan has already created a puppet organization to achieve its desires, and now it is signing a treaty with it to help its policy of hegemony and aggression. In fact, this organization is nothing more than a department of the Tokyo government, placed on Chinese territory, and is a tool for Japan to implement its policies. The National Government of the Republic of China has repeatedly declared its attitude, and now solemnly declares again that the Nanjing puppet regime is an illegal organization, and its actions, regardless of their nature, are completely invalid for the entire Chinese people and any foreign country. The treaty it signed is also illegal and has no binding force. If any foreign country recognizes this puppet organization, the Chinese government and people will regard it as the most unfriendly action and will have to sever normal relations with that country. China is determined to fight until the final victory. China is confident that it will definitely win, and that freedom, law, and justice will surely defeat everything." (Reuters)

TOKYO - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared yesterday that the agreement signed between Japan and Wang Jingwei and "Manchukuo" is not a peace treaty. This "agreement" only stipulates Sino-Japanese relations in principle. China's peace depends on Chongqing's cessation of resistance. Therefore, the issue of the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops from China cannot be considered at present. (Haitong Telegraph)

Editorial

### New Phase of the Far East Crisis

In recent days, those concerned about the fate of the Far East have been watching the possible developments with a tense mood. It is as if everything directed in the shadows will have a surprising posture and influence on the separation period. But until the dark curtain is opened, what is presented to the eyes is nothing but familiar clichés. Looking at the form, it is impossible to understand what the people in it have in mind and how they can explain themselves.

The issue between China and Japan has its internal causes and its inevitable trend. Due to the natural and man-made conditions, China's independence and liberation and Japan's continental policy happen to be directly opposed to each other and cannot coexist. That is, the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war became inevitable in Japan's continental policy. This is a historical tragedy and a historical necessity. Indeed, unless the attempts of aggression and enslavement disappear in the Far East, there can be no peace between them. Therefore, in the process where the Sino-Japanese war has long existed, even if there are various kinds of interludes to embellish it, the result cannot shake the mainstream of the war, nor can it change the essence of the relationship between the two countries. It is inevitable that it will be labor and no function and become a laughing stock.

However, in this general inevitability, there are also strange contradictions. According to the statement of the Japanese Foreign Ministry the day before yesterday, the "agreement" signed by it is not a "peace condition", but only stipulates the "Chinese" and Japanese relations in principle. Then, the Japanese side's evaluation of this agreement is obviously not too high, and even in the agreement itself, it affirms the necessity of continuing the war. Then, why is it that the Imperial Decision, the Privy Council review, and the respect of the former cabinet premier are involved in traveling back and forth across the ocean to promote this document that does not change the reality? Is this to help the war of aggression against China, or to help Japan's current difficulties? In terms of peace, it is still in an unknowable future, and in terms of practical effect, it cannot exceed the area controlled by the Japanese army. In addition to the Twenty-One Demands, it only leaves a deeper and greater stain on Japan's diplomatic history, and it is also felt that the Japanese authorities have not become smarter due to countless experiences and lessons. As for the great difference between what it shows in reality and what has been seen in the past, there is no need to point it out in detail.

When the Japanese side's peace offensive once sprouted not long ago, although the general public fundamentally questioned the original intention of the Japanese side, they did not expect it to be able to be more accurate and out of awareness and repentance. The Japanese side's situation has now reached the end of its road. There is only a difference in thought between destruction and transcendence. If it has a healthy rationality and common sense, it will be able to be aware of this kind of gambling on the national fortune, which is similar to madness. When the Matsuoka plan was exposed, the unpleasant scene in Moling was already being directed at the same time. In less than 20 days before and after, the steps from the convening of the Imperial Conference and the Privy Council to Abe's arrival in China again with his secret strategy were closely followed, without hesitation to indicate that he was still expecting the effect of the peace offensive. This is enough to prove that everything Matsuoka said is only like smoke, not from the heart, and everything that is currently realized is where the Japanese side's original intention lies. This kind of dazed and flustered peace offensive and the diplomatic offensive that complements it should now be permanently cut off, and can no longer be used to confuse the internal and external vision, and there is no longer the possibility of cooperating with military actions to seek success.

The words of the Four Parts and Nineteen Articles, although they cannot have new meanings and functions in fact, confirm the truth of another similar proclamation ten months ago. At the same time, it can be seen that Japan's attempt to destroy China has been consistent before and after, and has never changed due to time and environment. The serious nature hidden under the implicit and flexible terms cannot be concealed by the existence of a few other grand terms. This fact will not only cast a heavy shadow on the psychology of the Chinese people regarding the Far East issue, confirming that the success of the war of resistance is the only way out, but also stimulate international listening and cause serious repercussions. Within one day yesterday, in addition to the formal statements of the British and American governments, the United States also announced the establishment of a huge loan of 100 million US dollars to China. The nature of this loan has obviously progressed from commercial loans to the scope of political loans, which is undoubtedly caused by Japan's new actions against China. Japan may have been prepared to bet on one thing and no longer care about all this, but if it is for its own actual interests, I am afraid it will not feel at ease! On the other hand, it is fussy about the so-called anti-communist and garrison troops in Mongolia, which shows that its Soviet policy has not made any progress so far, so it cannot relax its anti-Soviet deployment. However, although Japan today is struggling, its recent deployments have proved that its southward movement is already on the string. If it is said that its active direction of the recent scene against China also has its active intention, that is to establish the "legal" status and specific measures for its rule and exploitation of the occupied areas of China, so as to use China's economic potential to transfer military power in China and launch new adventures in other directions. Look at its special emphasis on economic resources, financial enterprises, trade and transportation, and it is not tired of detailed definition. It can be seen where its great desire lies, and the guarantee of this plunder can naturally only be achieved under Japan's consolidation of its control.

Recent events have shown that Japan's new adventure has actually begun. Although the actual damage it can cause to China cannot exceed the scope of its military activities and the extent that has already been achieved, it has issued a common and well-known warning to the Far East, and even to the whole world.

### Thailand Prepares to Attack Vietnam: Large Army Concentrated Along the Mekong River; Eastern Cambodia States Loyalty to France

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Major General Phibunsongkhram recently declared in a public statement that Thai aircraft are prepared for a large-scale bombing of Eastern Cambodia and Laos in Vietnam. The Thai army is also prepared to attack Vietnam because the French troops in Thakhek still use machine guns and rifles to shoot at Thai civilians on the banks of the Mekong River. This declaration by the Thai Prime Minister is sufficient to indicate that the border war between Thailand and Vietnam has already begun. Furthermore, the Thai military high command has reaffirmed the news of Thailand's victory on Friday, which was published in large-character headlines throughout Bangkok. (United Press International dispatch, 1st)

Hanoi: Official sources stated that Thai bombers once again raided Thakhek on Friday, flying very low. Two people were killed and two were injured.

### Romanian Army Issues General Mobilization Order; Romanian Civil War on the Verge of Eruption; Iron Guard Continues to Cause Disturbances Everywhere; Romanian Young King Under German Guard

Bucharest: Yesterday evening, the Romanian army issued a general mobilization order. War has broken out between the Romanian army loyal to Propescu and the Iron Guard, which may turn into a civil war. Last night, everyone expected that fighting would continue after the state funeral of the late Iron Guard leader Codreanu. It is believed that many people were killed in the battle of Propescu. It is reported that the fighting is still continuing this morning. Similar battles have also occurred elsewhere, and it is reported that the Iron Guard, disregarding the army, has occupied several public buildings. The Iron Guard's actions have been suppressed for many years by previous political leaders, so this time they are eager for revenge. General Antonescu, the Prime Minister, has declared general mobilization and martial law nationwide as a last resort. Although Antonescu's measures are very rapid, general opinion still recognizes that they came too late. Prince Sturdza, the Romanian Foreign Minister, has returned to Bucharest from Berlin. It is rumored that Sturdza brought new instructions from the Nazi leader, stating that the Iron Guard must be brought under control immediately. So far, Deputy Prime Minister Sima, an influential leader of the Iron Guard, has appealed to the Iron Guard to stop assassinations, but to no effect. At the same time, last night, the Romanian army occupied all railways for the exclusive use of transporting troops to the areas where the civil war has erupted. (International dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: The political situation has caused a great uproar after the Romanian fascist Iron Guard massacred a large number of politicians. Although normalcy has been restored here today, the general situation remains extremely tense. Regarding the reorganization of the cabinet, political figures here predict that although the Iron Guard has expressed opposition, this matter is almost inevitable. The Romanian army has consistently supported Prime Minister General Antonescu and has made every effort to restore domestic order. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Budapest: It is reported that the regular army in Ploiești, Romania, repelled the Iron Guard and engaged in street fighting with the group when it attempted to occupy public buildings, resulting in several deaths and injuries. Reserve forces are now being deployed from Bucharest to Ploiești. German troops are currently guarding the oil fields there and preventing any incidents. It is reported that Soviet planes flew over the province of Moldavia and dropped leaflets denouncing fascism and the corruption of Romanian politics, and attacking Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Lyon: The Times recently commented on the Romanian political situation, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the arrogance of the Iron Guard. The article stated, "In a totalitarian state, where all power is concentrated in the hands of the head of state, it is intolerable if certain unrestrained forces persist in their own way, doing whatever they want, leading to fierce opposition from the people and even undermining the responsible government's work of reconstruction. Therefore, if the country wants to avoid the catastrophe of civil war, it is time to maintain the necessary authority of the state." (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Budapest: It is rumored that elite German troops began guarding the new Romanian King Michael yesterday to prevent any disturbances by the Iron Guard. Diplomatic circles say that the German troops may be holding the Romanian King to command Antonescu, so that it is not necessary to use harsh measures to deal with the Iron Guard. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: The funeral of Codreanu, leader of the Romanian Iron Guard, and his thirteen assassinated comrades was held yesterday morning at the Iron Guard headquarters, the Green House. All the remains were moved from the crypt of the Jilava prison a few days ago. The funeral began with a religious service. After Prime Minister Antonescu arrived, Schura, the leader of the German Youth League, presented a wreath on behalf of Hitler. Belli presented flowers on behalf of Party Representative Hess. The Italian Ambassador represented Mussolini, and the fascist party also had representatives participating. Other important attendees included Iron Guard leader Sima, the German ambassador, the Spanish and Japanese chargés d'affaires, representatives of the German army, and representatives of various countries of the diplomatic corps. After the ceremony, the funeral procession marched through the city. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: According to official sources here, everything is calm in Romania, and the Iron Guard is strictly observing discipline. The news about German troops maintaining order is also denied here. According to official announcements, the German troops in Romania are strictly abiding by their instructions and are not acting improperly. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: The funeral of the late Romanian Iron Guard leader Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and thirteen of his followers was held yesterday. They were buried with other Iron Guard martyrs outside the city. The funeral procession was five miles long, starting from the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in the city center and ending at the cemetery. There were 10,000 spectators along the way. All business in Bucharest was suspended. The cathedral was filled with members of the Iron Guard. Priests held the most solemn Mass. The German delegation arrived and paid their respects. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: Romania was quite quiet yesterday. The funeral of Iron Guard leader Codreanu went smoothly without any incidents. The ceremony was quite solemn. Memorial services were also held in various provinces. The funeral procession was protected by the army, with priests leading the way. Codreanu's coffin was covered with the national flag. Behind the coffin were wreaths presented by dignitaries from various countries. At the Arc de Triomphe, the Prime Minister and foreign guests reviewed the representatives of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party, the Romanian army, and the Iron Guard. The entire city was decorated with flags, and the church bells rang. All fourteen coffins were buried in the Iron Guard headquarters. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)

Bucharest: The funeral of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, leader of the Iron Guard, and thirteen members who were killed two years ago was held in Bucharest. German and Romanian troops, armed with bayonets, were on guard everywhere to prevent new incidents from erupting after the funeral. While German and Romanian troops were on guard in Bucharest, fierce street fighting broke out again in several cities in the provinces of Romania last night. A major conflict in Bucharest can be prevented because heavy troops are stationed there, but Antonescu's dictatorial new regime is already shaky, so it is expected that other disturbances will occur soon. Young King Michael is still living in the palace, under close protection to prevent assassination. The young king is nominally "under protection" in the palace, but in reality, he is under house arrest. He has been in this situation for four days. Michael's mother recently left Romania. It is rumored that Michael tried to leave the country with his mother, but failed. Foreign news says that the young king has actually escaped, but this has not been confirmed in Bucharest today. It is also learned that Germany no longer trusts Antonescu. The reason for this is that it is rumored that Michael may personally take over the dictatorship. When Codreanu was buried, 100,000 members of the Iron Guard held the ropes to show their grief. (International News Agency dispatch, 1st)

### Soviet Chairman Calls on People to Increase Military Strength and Remain Vigilant; Axis New Order Based on Aggression; Soviet Union and Turkey Resolve to Refuse to Engage With It

Moscow: Soviet Federation Chairman Kalinin said in a speech to the masses today that the Soviet Union is a fortress besieged by irreconcilable enemies. Kalinin called on all Soviet people to remain vigilant, increase their military strength, and improve their legal system. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Sofia: The Ankara radio station in Turkey reported that Turkey is determined to refuse to engage with the "New Order" of the three Axis countries. The "New Order" is entirely based on military force. The Soviet Union has already refused to join because the Soviet Union knows that this system will ultimately be harmful to itself. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Lyon: According to "The Times," Italian public opinion has recently undergone a significant change in its attitude towards the Soviet government. For example, the Fascist Critique newspaper recently published an article entitled "The Unchanged Nature of Bolshevism," arguing that the Soviet authorities have recently been considering revising some of the basic principles on which Bolshevism is based. The various important decrees issued by Moscow in recent months are clear evidence of this. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### Circumstances of the Death of the High Commissioner of Syria; French Government to Issue a Decree of Commendation

Vichy: It was rumored that the new French High Commissioner to Syria, Chiappe, had died on the 28th of this month. This was recently confirmed by an official public announcement. Chiappe boarded a plane at a certain French airfield on the morning of the 27th to go to Beirut, the capital of Syria, to take office. He planned to land in Tunis, North Africa, but while flying over the sky between Sardinia and North Africa in the Mediterranean Sea, he was suddenly attacked by military aircraft with machine guns. It has not yet been determined whether this aircraft was British or Italian. The circumstances at the time are also unclear, but according to reliable sources, it is only known that the plane Chiappe was on had flown over two aircraft carriers at the time. It is not known what happened to those on the same plane as Chiappe. Chiappe served as the Director-General of the Paris Police from 1928 until February 1934, when he was dismissed by Prime Minister Daladier due to riots in Paris. He was later elected as a Paris city councilor. After the fall of Paris in June of this year, he remained in Paris. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### English Channel Skies: Major Battle Between British and German Aircraft Fleets; Three German Bombers Shot Down; Southampton Heavily Bombed

London – Several German bombers, attempting to attack the crippled HMS Javelin destroyer in the English Channel, were shot down by the Royal Air Force. The first engagement occurred off Cornwall at 11:00 AM. A Spitfire fighter escorting the destroyer spotted a suspicious aircraft. Upon identifying it as a Dornier Do 17 bomber, the Spitfire turned to engage, maneuvering through cloud layers between 2,500 and 6,500 feet, firing upon it. The enemy aircraft was riddled with bullets and crashed into the sea. Of the five crew members, one jumped out and died in the water. Shortly after, a Junkers Ju 88 bomber approached the HMS Javelin and was intercepted by another Spitfire, also crashing into the sea. In the afternoon, a Dornier Do 17 bomber arrived and was shot down by British aircraft. Finally, a Junkers Ju 88 attempted a fourth attack, but was met by two Spitfires. The enemy aircraft retreated into the clouds, making it impossible to determine if it sustained damage. (Reuters, 1st)

Berlin – According to DNB, German aircraft continued to attack London, Liverpool, and Burghead late on the 28th and throughout the 29th. Burghead was bombed on the night of the 28th. Hundreds of German aircraft concentrated their bombing raids. On the night of the 29th, German aircraft attacked a British convoy near Lizard Point, destroying a ship. Long-range artillery also continued to shell Dover on the 29th. On the night of the 20th, British aircraft hit several civilian houses and a small factory. (DNB, 1st)

London – Following the daylight raid on London by 200 German aircraft yesterday, the Luftwaffe heavily attacked the south coast and Wales last night and this morning. Today, the Air Ministry announced that an unnamed city on the south coast was subjected to intense bombing. (This city is believed to be Southampton.) The Luftwaffe appears to be executing a methodical and organized plan to turn the cities around London into scorched earth, isolating the capital, so that the German invasion force can advance unhindered. Yesterday's daylight raid on London was a swift retaliation for the RAF's heavy bombing of Cologne, Bremen, and Berlin. It is believed that Italian aircraft participated in the bombing of London. Meanwhile, the Admiralty today confirmed that the destroyer HMS Javelin has been lost. (International, 1st)

Berlin – According to DNB, German aircraft heavily bombed London on the night of the 28th, causing fires to break out everywhere. A major fire erupted in the Finsbury district. German aircraft also attacked Liverpool, Birmingham, and the docks and stations of Ipswich. (DNB, 1st)

Berlin – According to German pilots, while attacking Southampton last night, over twenty fires were visible. German aircraft continued to drop bombs, increasing the number of fires, turning the entire city into a sea of flames. (DNB, 1st)

Berlin – After a day of "powerful strikes" on London by the Luftwaffe, Southampton was attacked last night using "Coventry"-style tactics. This major British port of Southampton is well-known to countless world travelers. It is believed that this bombing of the city was the largest in scale to date. At 7:30 PM yesterday, German light and heavy bombers dropped countless bombs of various calibers, causing eight major fires. German aircraft employed night attack tactics, initially dropping incendiary bombs to guide German aircraft carrying high-explosive bombs. Nazi pilots patrolling British airspace reported after inspecting the damage caused by previous raids on Britain that the major fire in Manchester three days ago was still burning last night. (International, 1st)

London – After wreaking havoc on London Friday night and Saturday morning, German aircraft launched another attack last night. But after midnight and into this morning, the German offensive eased, and London reports calm today. The German raiders apparently attempted to destroy all transport links by densely dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs on London. The heavy destruction and carnage last night were concentrated in the nearest districts surrounding the capital. More flares were dropped than previously. Many people were caught in large buildings that were nearly completely destroyed by direct hits. While in previous weeks, Sundays have often been days of respite from air raids, heavy fog in the English Channel and northern France may also have contributed to the reduction in German activity. The eleventh air raid in three days consisted of a heavy bombing of a southwestern town for several hours, with intense anti-aircraft fire finally driving away the German aircraft. The town was also attacked three times during the day yesterday. At 5:50 PM on Saturday afternoon, three bombs landed in a London district, marking the beginning of the night raid. The bombs destroyed several houses but caused no deaths or injuries. Air raids were also reported in a town in East Anglia and western England. (Associated Press, 11th)

Greek Forces’ Lure Works

Washington – American military experts here revealed that, prior to the outbreak of the Greco-Italian war, the Greeks had deliberately feigned timidity to lure the Italian forces, encouraging their arrogance and making them believe that the Greek forces were no match for them. The powerful Italian forces believed they could march straight into Greece upon arrival, with the Greek forces surrendering without a fight, as the Greeks viewed their opposition to the Italian forces as akin to throwing eggs against rocks. Experts here also said that the Greeks used their "sixth column" to cleverly defeat the Italian "fifth column". The Italian forces are now trapped in the mountains of Albania because of the Greek ploy to lure the enemy before the war. Citing reliable overseas information, American military experts stated that the Greeks believe the most effective way to deal with modern Trojan Horse tactics is through counter-espionage. The fifth column was deceived into encouraging Mussolini to launch an attack on Greece. (International, 1st)

### New President of Mexico Inaugurated Yesterday; Communist Plot Exposed; Capital Under Strict Security

Mexico City – Mexican authorities have uncovered a foreign-instigated plot to stage an uprising on the inauguration day of the new President, General Camacho. The authorities have taken decisive action. On Friday night, the Communist headquarters were raided by police, arresting 50 people. Simultaneously, military police searched another suspicious residence, believed to be a meeting place for subversive elements. A gun battle ensued, marking the second such clash between police and insurgents. Police sources say that there were multiple foreign-instigated plots aimed at assassinating General Camacho. During the police raid on the Communist headquarters, one senior officer was killed and fifty-five people were arrested, including five women. Due to strict censorship, the exact number of casualties in the gun battle is unknown, but current reports indicate that sixteen people were injured. Reporters who visited the Communist headquarters afterward saw a written order instructing all members to "be on standby at designated locations at 8:00 AM on Sunday" and to "maintain vigilance at assigned locations between December 1st and 6th."

### Bitter Disappointment for Hitler

Why did the German army, after defeating France, waste two months of precious time, failing to take advantage of the victory to invade the British Isles directly? Military experts from various countries are still studying this question. This article is an observation by Demaree Bess, the European correspondent for the American "Saturday Evening Post." He remained in Paris before and after the German army entered, and had a clear view of the situation behind the German lines. The following is a translation of his wireless report to the newspaper:

From mid-June to mid-August of this year, for two months, the German army's campaign to invade England virtually stalled. In terms of weather, these two months were the most suitable period for bomber operations, and in this life-or-death struggle, the outcome might have been decided. However, the German army let time slip away and did not take the opportunity to carry out a blitzkrieg against England. Why?

Military strategists have offered many tactical explanations for the German army's temporary inactivity, but according to those who have witnessed the evolution of everything in France under German occupation, these tactical explanations are still insufficient. The German High Command was willing to sacrifice these precious eight weeks, actually for two major reasons. First, they misjudged England. Second, Germany is employing a method of "circus training wild animals" on the European continent. Anyone with experience knows that capturing wild animals is not very difficult, but taming them and making them available for human use is not an easy task!

In mid-June, shortly after France requested an armistice, a German newsreel showed Hitler receiving the French request on the front lines. Surrounded by officers, the dictator walked with light, dancing steps, and exclaimed with elation, "The situation is settled!"

What was the meaning of this inner thought from Hitler's mouth, we may never know. He boasted that he had the foresight to observe history a thousand years later, so he wouldn't have said that his empire had been created and completed from now on! Moreover, he loved to read the history of ancient empires and must have known that the great task of building an empire is an endless undertaking.

But it is somewhat close to saying that Hitler believed that the collapse of France meant the end of the Western Front, at least that was the feeling of the German soldiers in the occupied area of France. They had planned to hold a grand victory parade on July 14, the French Democratic Memorial Day, and Paris became the center of preparations at that time.

The citizens of Paris all heard the news of the parade. The first order of the occupying army was to remove sandbag barricades along the parade route and restore the fountains along the streets to enhance the spectacle. Military bands practiced performing, and aircraft practiced formations in the Paris sky. All hotels were requisitioned, and hotel managers were told that as many as 50,000 Germans would come to France for sightseeing.

The small hotel where we were staying was also occupied by a German team at this time, and the commander was quite polite and allowed us to stay in it temporarily.

His adjutant, who spoke English fluently, said that Miss Morgan and the staff of her relief organization had to move out. He asked my wife to inspect the room before they moved in.

He said, "We want you to check the items in the room, and we hope you will not hesitate to check again when we leave, and tell Miss Morgan that nothing is missing."

We asked him, "How long will it take you to leave?"

He told us, "It won't be long, the war is almost over."

But on French Democratic Memorial Day, there was no victory parade, and nothing happened in the weeks that followed. Military bands and performing aircraft were rarely seen, and news of Germans coming to France for sightseeing was no longer mentioned. Many of the requisitioned hotels have been returned. The number of German troops in Paris has also gradually decreased.

What exactly happened? It is said that Germany had proposed peace terms to England, but they were rejected by England shortly after. Regarding the German proposal, a German staff officer later told us roughly. He said that Germany must have absolute control over the European continent, and England should no longer interfere in European affairs. As for outside of Europe, Germany asked for the return of the former German colonies in Africa and a narrow strip across central Africa, and nothing else.

In the minds of Germans, these conditions were obviously very generous and reasonable, and they could not help but be surprised that England rejected them. This was the second time they had been wrong about the British. They can often estimate others very accurately, but the British always make them unpredictable. In 1914, they did not expect Britain to participate in the war. When they invaded Poland in 1939, they did not expect Britain to declare war on Germany. This summer, when they proposed peace, they did not expect Britain to ignore them at all.

A month after France surrendered, Germany finally realized that Britain was determined to continue fighting. At this time, they had to deal with two difficulties at the same time: on the one hand, they had to continue to attack the British Isles, and on the other hand, they had to consolidate the occupied territories on the European continent. If there is any negligence, all efforts will be in vain.

It is not an exaggeration to say that the German army had to deal with more than a dozen battles at the same time. In every occupied country—especially France—the Germans encountered complex internal strife, which was actually brewing into civil unrest, only not yet manifested. The Germans knew very well that they should not only prevent private fighting from becoming open strife, but also ensure that pro-German factions were in the upper hand everywhere. This was a difficult task, so the Germans had to exhaust their efforts in the precious months of June, July, and August to consolidate the rear.

The internal strife in France and other places was not caused by the German invasion, they only intensified the civil unrest. All kinds of conflicts between classes and classes, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals have been brewing for a long time. France suffered a tragic disaster because it could not eliminate the dispute within the wall in the face of a great enemy, which led to the irretrievable situation. The chaos of the French army and government was largely caused by this. Of course, during the war, this kind of civil unrest could help the German army a lot, but after France surrendered, it became a hidden danger for Germany and could not be ignored.

Since June, due to strict inspections and traffic congestion, there have been few rumors about the internal strife in France. Even most French people do not know its important developments. Only by comparing and pondering information from all parties and talking to key figures in the situation can they get a general idea.

The boundaries of the internal strife in France are not clear. Some people think that this is a struggle between conservatives and progressives, a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, a struggle between communism and fascism, a struggle between the fifth column and patriotic patriots. The core of the dispute is not the question of whether to love the country or not, but the question of opinion. (To be continued)

### Chinese Constables Resumed Work Yesterday; Demands to Be Made Today; Bureau to Convene Board Meeting to Discuss, Sympathy Expressed in Principle

Yesterday morning, more than a thousand Chinese constables from the Central and Old Zhabei police stations of the Public Concession went on strike due to dissatisfaction with the Bureau's method of increasing housing allowance subsidies and demanding improved treatment. The security of the central district was temporarily left unattended, and the situation was very tense. When Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing heard the news and rushed to the scene, he earnestly persuaded them with Yao Huimo, the Chinese Deputy Director of the Police Department, and guaranteed a satisfactory solution. The disturbance came to an end, and they all returned to their posts at noon, and order was restored. It is reported that regarding this incident, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Bowen, and Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing had a meeting at the Municipal Council on the afternoon of the previous day. The Bureau expressed that it agreed in principle with the demands of the Chinese constables, but wished that both parties would discuss the matter frankly and sincerely. Before a solution could be reached, they hoped that the Chinese constables would understand the difficult times, be at ease in their duties, and avoid unexpected problems.

Chinese Constables Committee Begins Work

In addition to the patrol constables of the Central and Old Zhabei police stations on the previous day, although the patrol constables of other police stations did not go on strike, they had reached a consensus on the opinion of improving treatment. Currently, the Chinese constables of the eight police stations in the Public Concession have elected sixteen representatives to organize the "Chinese Constables Committee" to carry out all matters. It has been recognized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing and the police authorities, and it was working inside the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road yesterday. All expenses are provided by the authorities. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, representatives of the Chinese constables from various police stations gathered there to hold a meeting to discuss the content of the conditions for improving treatment to be submitted to the Municipal Council. It was decided to send the following document to the authorities:

Sincere Document Requesting Improved Treatment

Submitted to earnestly request an increase in salary and allowances. Due to the soaring prices of various goods at present, the original salaries of the constables are very difficult to maintain the current living standards. Forced by circumstances, we hereby request that the original salaries be appropriately increased to compensate for the deficit and avoid starvation. It is a matter of virtue and convenience. The requested items are listed as follows: (Clauses omitted). Respectfully submitted by the Chinese Constables Representatives Committee, December 2, 1940.

Comprehensive Planning and Discussion to Resolve

After formulating the above conditions, all the Chinese constable representatives have decided to send a representative with this document to Yao Huimo, the Chief Inspector of Chinese Constables of the Police Department, at 2:00 p.m. today, and then the Police Department will forward it to the highest authorities for approval. The Chinese constables also request a response no later than the morning of the 5th. It is reported that the Municipal Council has decided to convene a board meeting on the 3rd or 4th to discuss solutions because this matter involves financial revenue and expenditure and requires comprehensive planning.

Maintaining Law and Order is a Heavy Responsibility

The reporter from Da Zhong News Agency met with Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing last night to inquire about the development of this matter. According to him, it is gratifying that the Chinese constables, after being persuaded by him, have taken the overall situation into consideration and will soon resume their loyal duties. He believes that patrol constables are not comparable to factory workers. They are public officials and bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining law and order. Therefore, requesting improved treatment is one thing, and serving is another. They must not abandon their duties in order to achieve the goal of improving treatment, and disregard law and order. Fortunately, they all understand the importance of the situation and have returned to their posts to await a solution. The origin of this disturbance lies in the fact that after adding a twelve yuan housing allowance subsidy, the Bureau reduced the rice subsidy by two yuan, which led to a misunderstanding. Now the Bureau has understood the situation and can give careful consideration to the demands of the Chinese constables. On the part of the Chinese constables, they should also make reasonable and acceptable demands. Changing the demand to improve treatment means that conditions involving political nature do not need to be raised. It is not true that the Municipal Council Board of Directors will hold an emergency meeting today. It is necessary to wait for the Chinese constables to submit their demands before considering and discussing them. As far as he knows, the Municipal Council has not convened a meeting in one or two days.

Silk Industry Association, etc. Solicit

Winter Relief Shelter Expenses

In order to accommodate the poverty-stricken people suffering from hunger and cold, the Disaster Relief Association has specially built a simple shed in Yan's residence to set up a winter relief shelter. Personnel have already been sent to survey the location, which requires 120,000 yuan. The Silk Industry Association and leaders from all walks of life have solicited donations.

### Unstable Rice Prices Lead to Social Unrest; Rice Market Must Be Rectified; Yu Qiaqing Discusses Methods to Suppress Rice Prices; Citizens Should Quickly Participate in Group Rice Purchases

Since the illegal surge in the city's rice market, rumors have been endless. The people's food and social security have been severely affected. Recently, the Chinese constables in the central district also demanded improved treatment due to the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods. Although it was very brief, it has caused panic and unrest in all circles. The cold winter has arrived, and it is the time when bandits and thieves are rampant.

Three Key Points for Reforming the Market

According to a gentleman who is familiar with the rice market, there are the following points that need to be reformed in the current rice market: (1) Strictly limit entry to the market. Unless they are sellers, merchants, or rice dealers who purchase rice, others should be strictly prohibited. (2) The method of setting a time limit for delivery, although repeatedly discussed and announced by the rice industry groups, has become a dead letter to this day. Most of the transactions in the market are selling short and buying short, which gives speculators an opportunity. (3) Shorten the trading time to reduce the effect of speculators spreading rumors in the market and avoid the sudden rise in market prices. It is especially important to ban afternoon trading at present. If certain people's usual tricks in the morning fail to sell, they will continue to implement them in the afternoon until they achieve their goals. Therefore, stopping afternoon trading is also a way to prevent rumors.

Should Quickly Continue to Hold Price Controls

Handling broken rice at controlled prices can passively relieve the poor who cannot afford to buy expensive rice, and it is even more significant in the active aspect. If the poor can buy rice at controlled prices, they can reduce the actual sales of rice and grain every day, so that speculators have fewer opportunities to raise prices. This can be observed from the situation after previous price controls. Every time after price controls are implemented, the price of rice in the market will fall. After the suspension of price controls, the price rises again. The situation of continuous price increases after the end of the seventh period of this year is the most obvious. It is reported that the Shanghai Price Control Association will postpone the opening of the eighth period, which will last for about one month, until December of the lunar calendar due to funding issues. This is not only something that the civilians of this city cannot wait for, but it also has a great impact on the entire rice market. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can provide strong assistance as soon as possible so that the eighth phase of price controls can be opened as soon as possible.

Price Evaluation Meeting Postponed

In response to the frequent rise in rice prices, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon of the previous day, believing that the rise in rice prices was due to the spread of unfounded rumors in the market. In addition to announcing a strict crackdown on illegal transactions in the market, the rice and grain price evaluation committee meeting scheduled to be held in this city today will be postponed. The original text of its announcement to the market is as follows: "It has been found that the price of rice and grain is becoming more and more expensive today, and the people's livelihood and security are in a worrying state. The key to the problem, although complex, is also a major factor in the spread of rumors and people's nervousness. According to the investigation, the source of foreign rice is still unblocked, and the two production areas in Myanmar can still continue to place orders as much as possible. Various external rumors are unfounded and unbelievable. As for the purpose, it is still to increase the stock of grain, and we hope that colleagues will do their best to continue to order, and we hope that citizens will actively participate in group rice purchases, so that there will be preparations for emergencies and to maintain the people's food. In addition, colleagues must be warned that market transactions must strictly abide by the rules of buying and selling and must not overstep the boundaries. The Market Management Committee is now closely monitoring and strictly cracking down. No matter whether it is within or outside the industry, if there is any hoarding, manipulation, reselling, or raising prices for profit, once discovered, it will be immediately reported to the authorities for severe punishment. If there are large entrustments outside the industry, they should all be rejected, otherwise they will also be punished. This is a special announcement to the market, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it. This is very important."

Yu Qiaqing Talks About Price Control Methods

Regarding the food problem, due to the unscrupulous elements in a few rice businesses, there is stirring up trouble and repeatedly raising market prices, resulting in a difficult situation for the people to seek food. Although the media has repeatedly criticized it and requested the authorities to quickly plan and remedy the situation, it has been of little effect. According to Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing's talk to the reporter of Da Zhong News Agency, he has given in-depth consideration to this serious food problem and has prepared the most effective method to suppress rice prices. He will formally send a letter to the Municipal Council within one or two days to negotiate and proceed, and intends to invite the banking industry and the rice industry to raise 15 million yuan to store 200,000 bags of foreign rice for sale at controlled prices.

### The Entire Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area Is Almost Completely Blockaded; Except for Japanese, All Others Are Prohibited from Passing; The Tense Situation Is Unprecedented; Japanese Troops Search Everywhere with Handguns and Sabers

At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, Japanese military police and "municipal police" set up barbed wire fences at the intersections of Yu Yuan Road, Di Feng Road, Da Xi Road, and Yi Ding Pan Road in western Shanghai, cutting off traffic. Except for Japanese, people of any nationality were prohibited from passing.

Chinese and Foreign Residents Suffer Misfortune Again

The English-language "Great American Daily" newspaper said that the situation in the western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area today (the 1st) is very bad for the unfortunate Chinese and foreign residents living within the area around Da Xi Road, Haig Road, Jessfield Road, and Zhaofeng Park. All traffic within the former British defense zone has now been stopped, and entry and exit are prohibited. Although some people have repeatedly requested accommodation, very few have been able to achieve their goals.

No Reason Given for Preventing Entry and Exit

Since the afternoon of yesterday (the 30th), after a Japanese military policeman was sniped on Da Xi Road, the obstacles set up there are now managed by the Japanese army and "municipal police." The Japanese troops carry handguns, sabers, and rifles. Some of the hired police also carry rifles with bayonets. They seem to have orders to continue to prevent the majority of people who want to leave but cannot, without explaining the reasons to them, cutting off all traffic in the area. Since yesterday afternoon, public buses have only been running to Jing'an Temple Station, and cars are not allowed to pass, except for those driven by Japanese government officials and some foreigners.

Roads Closed and Searches Continue

Yesterday's shooting incident caused the planned parade to be suspended. Yesterday morning, a group of fanatics holding paper flags and paste pots were busy pasting these unwelcome decorations on public buses, rickshaws, and other vehicles. Until the afternoon, after one of the three members of the Japanese military police patrol team was shot and wounded by a thug in Lane 52 of Da Xi Road, the situation in the area changed suddenly. In an instant, the streets were deserted due to the search. This search is still ongoing, and there are still no results as of today's deadline.

Wounded Japanese Soldier May Not Survive

At that time, the assassin knocked down the platoon leader of the conscripted military police and fled quickly. According to unofficial sources, the wounded Japanese military policeman may not survive. When the assassin and the Japanese military police exchanged fire, only a tailor standing next to him was injured. Since then, traffic in the alleys of Da Xi Road has been blocked. At the same time, the same steps were taken at Haig Road, Di Feng Road, Jessfield Road, Yi Ding Pan Road, and other key exits in the Extra-Settlement Area, as if to cut off the assassin's escape route.

Settlement Police Nowhere to Be Seen

The Extra-Settlement Area is in the area of ​​the Public Concession's Extra-Settlement Roads and is one of the most densely populated areas, also due to low rents. When foreign residents try to force their way into the area, unpleasant incidents often occur. People are forced to surrender with their spears and bayonets. Therefore, the Extra-Settlement Area has become a huge concentration camp for tens of thousands of worried and helpless residents. Last night, the patrol police of the Public Concession were nowhere to be seen in the area. Investigators and armed patrols from the Jing'an Temple Police Station were blocked in the Extra-Settlement Area by the Japanese army and reserve police. As for the ambulance dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, it was not allowed to perform its duties.

### New US Loan to China Announced; Legal Tender Gains Strength; Public Morale Boosted and Rumors Completely Eliminated

Since the US President announced another loan of 100 million US dollars to China, the morale of the financial market in Shanghai has been greatly boosted. Yesterday was Sunday, and all financial markets such as securities, gold, and foreign exchange were closed as usual. Therefore, there must be a good performance after the market opens on Monday today. The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the financial circles yesterday that half of the 100 million US dollars loaned to China by the United States is used to maintain Chinese currency and stabilize foreign exchange. China is determined to maintain the spirit of the past in its legal tender policy and will do its best to maintain it. Now that it has been blessed by the United States, its momentum is stronger. As for the Stabilization Fund Management Committee, its fund base is sufficient, and there is no problem in maintaining the fixed foreign exchange rate. The government will approve as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential necessities. The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai will also be stabilized. The rumors spread by speculators in the market before that China's foreign exchange fund had dried up have now been completely eliminated.

Foreigners' Restrictions Slightly Loosened

Today, a large number of curious Chinese people gathered at the corners bordering the Extra-Settlement Area, and were often rejected by the Japanese military police to open traffic, starving and freezing, and unable to return home. Until late at night, the restrictions began to loosen slightly. Foreigners with their own cars were allowed to pass. Other foreigners traveling by car on business had to get out of the car and walk home, and were repeatedly questioned and occasionally attempted to be searched along the way. As for the unfortunate Chinese people, they were searched one by one and blocked at the intersection concentration points. Most people were released until late at night.

### Envoys of Various Countries Reside in the Provisional Capital to Discuss Assistance to China; Ambassadors Bear Heavy Responsibilities

Since the ambassadors of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, gathered in Chongqing, their contacts with the Chinese government have been very frequent recently because assistance to China from countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is becoming more and more active. According to sources from the embassies of various countries in this city, British Ambassador Kerr originally planned to come to Shanghai at the end of this month to visit his wife and spend the Christmas holidays, but due to the current tense situation in the Far East, he temporarily intends to stay in the provisional capital to maintain close contact. US Ambassador Johnson is also planning to spend the year in Chongqing because US aid to China is becoming more and more active and many matters need to be planned and negotiated by the ambassador. As for French Ambassador Cosme, after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu, there has been no preparation to come to Shanghai. The affairs of the Shanghai Embassy are entrusted to the Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Marcie, for nearby agency. Also, Italian Ambassador Marquis, after returning to Shanghai from the south, is still residing in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. Recently, in addition to frequent contacts with the overseas Chinese, he stays at home and rarely moves.

### Houses in Ningbo Plague Area

### Carried out Destruction by Burning

The Ningbo plague has been extinguished. In order to prevent recurrence, the Ningbo local authorities have carried out the burning of houses in the area from Kaiming Bridge to Donghou Street in the city today. The above-mentioned houses are the area where the plague occurred, so it was decided to burn them to eradicate the roots. When the burning was carried out, all fire brigades and guards were dispatched.

### US Naval Young Men's Christian Association Expands Activities; US Secretary of War Orders Assistance from Local Garrison

Recently, the American "Time" magazine published an article saying that US Secretary of War Adams recently ordered all Naval and Army Young Men's Christian Associations to change their status to help the troops in the cities near each location. Adams highly praised the service work of the Young Men's Christian Association and urged the army officers to cooperate with it and work together harmoniously. The Navy Young Men's Christian Association (commonly known as "Navy Y") in this city issued an article the other day, saying that during the last war, the 29 service locations of the Young Men's Christian Association were in a chaotic situation due to assisting military affairs. The work of the Young Men's Christian Association is to seek human happiness, and this kind of activity should be continuous and expanded.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Train Bombing Case: The Truth Gradually Emerges; Japanese Newspaper Reports Death of Chinese Platoon Leader; Conflicting Reports on Casualties

The bombing of the Shanghai-Nanjing train by Chinese mobile units has been a frequent occurrence, but none as severe as this recent incident. Japanese newspapers initially made no mention of it, but yesterday it appeared in the *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun*. According to the report, "On the 29th of last month, at 8:50 AM, the Shanghai-bound No. 7 train, a third-class train, encountered a landmine explosion at 10:55 AM, five miles east of Suzhou station. The tracks were blown several dozen feet away, and the locomotive and four carriages overturned. Seventy-four passengers were killed (52 men, 5 boys, 12 women, 4 girls), 100 were seriously injured (70 men, 4 boys, 26 women), and 2 were slightly injured."

Wounded and Dead Piled Up, a Horrific Sight

In total, 176 people were killed or injured. Among the dead was one Japanese, Mr. Matsuda, 26 years old, an instructor on the locomotive. Two Japanese, railway guards, were injured. The scene was described as a living hell, a horrific sight. The Suzhou Japanese garrison received the alarm and immediately dispatched a joint force of Japanese military police, special service units, and military doctors to the scene. The dead were moved to a location about four or five miles north of the railway, and the wounded were taken to Suzhou Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, a thorough search was conducted around the site, and the railway was repaired, reopening to traffic at 7:00 PM.

Three Landmines Detonated as the Train Arrived

After the incident, two people were found loitering in the railway security area.

Japanese security forces suspected them of being responsible for the bombing and opened fire, killing one on the spot and the other escaping without a trace.

A search of the dead man's body revealed him to be Meng Shaoguang, a lieutenant in the Chinese army, captain of the transportation team of the Loyalty and Patriotic Army General Headquarters of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee. He had departed from near Yixing on November 2nd, leading 17 team members, carrying 10 rifles, 220 rounds of ammunition, 10 handguns, 450 rounds of ammunition, 50 hand grenades, 191 wats of explosives, 6 detonators, 5 rolls of fuse, several storage batteries, and demolition tools, with the intention of infiltrating the area near Suzhou to sabotage the railway. On the 29th of last month, they finally carried out their plan. Meng led three men to bury three landmines the day before. When the No. 7 train was approaching, they ignited the fuse and fled. At that time, they were spotted by Japanese soldier Sukegawa, who gave chase. Meng fought back with two handguns, firing over twenty shots, but was eventually shot and killed.

Another Account of the Casualties

According to a Chinese traveler from Suzhou, speaking to a reporter from the Heiminsha (Common People's Society) yesterday, the incident occurred in Yangqi, outside Guakuatang, east of Suzhou. At around 10:00 AM, a Shanghai-bound train, reportedly a special train, exploded as it entered Yangqi, outside Guakuatang. The blast was powerful, shaking houses in Guakuatang town violently. The electric train, a special train of 13 carriages and one locomotive, was severely damaged. The engine and chimney were twisted and shattered. The driver and stoker, along with five or six others, were killed. Four passenger carriages were completely destroyed. The dead, numbering over two hundred, were laid out in seventeen or eighteen tents set up along the railway tracks. Many were dismembered and difficult to identify. The injured numbered over three hundred, most of whom were seriously wounded.

Eyewitness Account

According to a Mr. Xi, a Chinese traveler from Dongting East Mountain in Suzhou, who personally witnessed the scene at Suzhou Station, the train that was bombed was indeed the "Tianma Express" (formerly the Feikuai Express). The train was scheduled to depart as the third northbound train of the day, and had never had an accident before. Passengers generally considered it to be a relatively safe train. However, on that day, the train was carrying a large number of Chinese and foreign passengers, and it was rumored that the third carriage was occupied by Japanese military police. Therefore, it was targeted by the Chinese guerrilla forces in a well-planned attack. Mr. Xi had traveled from Dongshan to Suzhou that morning, taking a southbound train to Shanghai. Upon arriving at the station, he found it under special security. All passengers were detained and questioned, and anyone suspected was arrested. After about three hours, they were released, and at that time, the dead and wounded from the bombing were being transported from Guakuatang to Suzhou for burial or treatment. The bodies were dismembered, with severed limbs and heads, numbering over two hundred. The injured were covered in blood and gore, with missing limbs, many moaning and awaiting death, numbering three to four hundred. In total, the number of dead and wounded was much higher than reported, a truly horrific sight. Along the way, a severed woman's finger was found, the nail still painted with bright red nail polish. Mr. Xi was released at Suzhou Station, but with no trains available, he could not return to Dongshan. Unable to find accommodation without a local guarantor, he spent the night at a barber shop. In the evening, he saw flames rising from the Guakuatang area, illuminating the scene as if it were daylight. He learned that a large number of Japanese military police had been dispatched to the scene and were conducting house-to-house searches in nearby villages, setting fire to vacant houses with kerosene.

To prevent maritime accidents, all British and French ships no longer announce their schedules. According to reliable sources from the *Xinsheng She* (New Voice News Agency), the ship, which was originally scheduled to depart

From Hong Kong to Shanghai

On November 30th, and which was scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, heading to London and San Francisco via ports in Canada and Australia, and on which the Shanghai Post Office had loaded a large amount of mail and New Year's cards bound for Europe, was temporarily seized for military use by the British Far East Naval Command upon arriving in Hong Kong.

### Apprentice Killed in Yangzhen Ginseng Shop Robbery; Sun Bo-xiang and Yan Zhong-min Hide on the Ground; Western Police Mistake Them for Robbers and Shoot Them Dead

The Yangzhen Ginseng Shop (養眞參號) at No. 403, West Section of Zhengli, Fada Road, was robbed by bandits at 7:15 PM on the 30th of last month (the day before yesterday). A shop assistant ran out, and a detective mistook him for a robber, shooting him dead. Details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that there were

Two People Killed by Mistake

The following are further details of the incident. The Yangzhen Ginseng Shop was originally located on Guazi Street in the Nanshi area. After the August 13th incident, it moved to its branch location and the business flourished. This attracted the attention of robbers. At 7:15 PM on the 30th of last month, the shop had just finished dinner when four robbers suddenly appeared. One robber stood guard at the main entrance with a handgun, while the other two searched the shop. They opened the drawer of the accounting desk and robbed over 600 yuan in cash from the sale of goods.

As they were fleeing with the loot

A patrol officer on the street became aware of the robbery and reported it to the French police station. Detectives were immediately dispatched in patrol cars to intercept the robbers. Sun Bo-xiang (22 years old), a shop assistant from Ningbo, fearing that the detectives would engage in a gunfight with the robbers and cause further harm, ran out of the shop and hid on the ground inside the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop (源順祥磁器店) at No. 391, five doors to the east. Yan Zhong-min (28 years old), a shop assistant from Hubei at the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop, seeing Sun running into his shop and

Hiding on the Ground

Also squatted down with Sun. Unexpectedly, a Western policeman passed by on a motorcycle, heard of the robbery, saw Sun Bo-xiang running into the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop and squatting down, and saw Yan following him and squatting down. Mistaking Sun and Yan for robbers, he stopped his motorcycle, drew his service handgun, ran inside, and fired several shots at Sun and Yan, all hitting vital organs. They were rushed to Guangci Hospital, but died shortly after. The four robbers, seeing the Chinese and Western detectives arriving, fled into the crowd of pedestrians with the loot and

Escaped Without a Trace

Yesterday, the police sent the bodies of Sun and Yan to the mortuary on Terrace Road for examination. The families of the deceased were notified to claim the bodies for burial. Meanwhile, the police department ordered all detectives to rigorously pursue the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice. It is also reported that the families of the deceased are aggrieved that their loved ones were innocently and tragically killed and may file a protest.

After months of research, they have determined that daycare centers for working mothers are extremely important, especially for working-class families. They are piloting two daycare centers: (1) at No. 323, Muirhead Road, for children of working mothers, who will be sent to the center in the morning and picked up in the evening. (2) at the Tongren Hospital on Route Ghisi, for children whose parents work and cannot provide them with proper care, or for orphans with no one to care for them. Services will be completely free. Preparations are underway, with the goal of opening in January of next year. However, the initial and operating expenses are substantial. The YWCA welcomes any individual in society who is interested in childcare and willing to provide financial or material assistance (such as cribs, bedding, tents, desk lamps, and all kinds of children's equipment). To raise funds for the daycare center, the YWCA will hold a charity sale on December 8th. Details have been published in previous newspapers. The charity sale will feature a wide variety of items. Those who wish to purchase tickets should do so as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity.

### Expansion of Sincere Company Department Store

Sincere Company, Limited, on Nanjing Road, is known for its policy of low profits. The company's management, finding that the existing space was insufficient, allocated a large sum of money six months ago to actively create a new department store, remodel the hair salon, and add a catering department to meet the demand. The project has now been completed and the grand opening is scheduled for December 3rd.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I have read your news report of December 1st, regarding the general strike of the dyeing industry and the authorities' efforts to mediate the situation. This does not conform to the facts. Our Association received a letter from the Shanghai Dyeing Industry Association, stating that the dyeing prices were chaotic and needed to be rectified. In order to unify the charges, they refused to accept dyeing, and asked for cooperation with our Association. The workers' alcohol money was low. It remained at the old price of 30 cents per pack, which was set in the 1927 agreement. This was increased by one fold to 60 cents per pack. Although this increase is less compared to the current environment and prices, our Association complied with the employer's orders and signed an agreement with them. On October 11th, the new price for alcohol money was implemented. The issue of rectifying the unified dyeing price for dyeing factories and silk cloth merchants is a separate matter. The dispute involving Chen Xiqin and others was caused by the factory dyeing without the customer's permission and the general shutdown period. This has nothing to do with our Association's increase in alcohol money. Our association's workers stop and start dyeing according to the will of the dyeing factory owners. It is not a joint strike by dye workers, as they are passively stopping work. I am reporting the facts and hope that you will correct the record and ensure accuracy.

Sincerely,

Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Friendship Association

### Catholicism in China: Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings (4)

The Beitang Library does not have a large number of books in terms of quantity. Newly published books are rare. However, the value of the books is very high. The library currently has about 5,400 ancient Western books. Among the rare books are over twenty of the original possessions of the Nantang and the famous works of Father Clavius, Matteo Ricci's mathematics teacher. One of the books contains the original author's autograph given to Matteo Ricci.

There are also hundreds of books with the Society of Jesus emblem printed on the back. These were gifts from Pope Paul V (during the Wanli period) to Yu Nigao (按卽號稱七千部西來圖書之一部份, 按卽號稱七千部西來圖書之一部份 means approximately "part of what's known as the seven thousand books from the West"). There are also books originally possessed by the Xitang and donated by Archbishop Carlo. Carlo was sent by Pope Clement XI in 1715 (Kangxi 55th year) as a special envoy to China to resolve the Chinese Rites Controversy. There are also books originally possessed by the Beitang, stamped with the seal of King Louis XIV of France and the seals of famous French officials and dignitaries. Other books are the original texts of famous scientific and religious works translated by famous scholars among the missionaries and Catholics of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, such as Tang Ruowang, Nan Huairen, Xu Guangqi, and Li Zhizao. There are also several types of manuscripts, all of which have been preserved to this day. There is a rich collection of theological books published at that time. There is also a considerable collection of books on European science, art, literature, law, history, medicine, and biology from that period. However, the most treasured book is Father Sande's *Study of the Envoys Sent by Japan to the Holy See*, printed by the Jesuits in Macau in 1590. It is also the first European book printed in the Far East. In addition to the Beitang, only the British Royal Library has a copy. The oldest European-printed book is from 1479 (Ming Hongzhi 7th year). There are 80,000 Chinese books. A portion of these are imperial gifts from Qing emperors, and are quite valuable. Among the rare books are Song and Ming editions, old manuscript gazetteers, and works from the Wuyingdian Juchen Edition (武央殿聚珍本業書).

Although the Beitang Library's collection is extremely valuable, it is not managed by experts. Therefore, while the priests in the church can borrow books freely, access is restricted for outsiders. After the founding of the Republic of China, scholars such as Ma Xiangbo, Ying Lianzhi, Chen Yuan'an, and Xu Runnong, as well as French scholars Paul Pelliot and Henri Bernard, were introduced and were able to view the collection. Thus, the original edition of the Mingli Tan Zhi (名理探之), a Japanese catechism book from the 16th century, and Pedrini's famous compositions were discovered. Scholars around the world were amazed and felt the need for reorganization. The church partnered with Dr. John Leighton Stuart, president of Yenching University in Peiping, Dr. Henry Houghton, president of Peking Union Medical College, and William Pettus, principal of the Chinese Language School, in addition to the assistance of Bev F. Goertz, head of the Psychology Department of Fu Jen Catholic University, and C.D. Lyon, secretary of the US Embassy, to obtain a special grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to repair and catalogue the collection. Father Lu of Fu Jen Catholic University and Father Hui, the librarian, are currently leading the work of converting to steel shelving and cataloguing the collection. They plan to photograph the title pages of each rare book and send a complete set, along with catalogue cards and a book inventory, to the Vatican Library, the Library of Congress in the United States, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The catalogue cards will also be distributed to a few libraries.

### Soviet Union Establishes Numerous Teacher Training Institutes

(TASS Moscow, 1st) The Soviet Union has over one million primary and secondary school teachers. They have a strong desire for knowledge and often engage in research after class to improve their knowledge. Teacher improvement institutes have been established in fifty major cities such as Moscow, where experts in various fields lead primary and secondary school teachers in discussions of various issues during holidays and spare time. It is reported that 19,000 teachers nationwide have received training in the improvement institutes this year.

### Chinese Benevolent Children's Association Actively Solicits Winter Clothing, Appealing to All Sectors to Contribute

Since the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association began soliciting winter clothing for impoverished children in the city on the 20th of last month, it has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. It has already received over 6,500 yuan in donations and over 300 pieces of new and used winter clothing. Currently, work is being intensified to actively solicit more. Since the sudden cold snap this winter, the number of homeless street children freezing to death in the city has been increasing daily. If rescue measures are not taken promptly as the cold worsens, this tragic phenomenon will become unimaginable. The association earnestly hopes that all sectors will contribute quickly, so that winter clothing can be manufactured and distributed as soon as possible to benefit impoverished children. Anyone willing to donate new or used winter clothing or a winter clothing allowance (6 yuan per set) can call 82273. The association will dispatch a special messenger with a receipt to collect the donation. Furthermore, the association has formulated regulations for this winter clothing campaign, including solicitation rewards and distribution methods.

### Yesterday's North China Daily News Cup Preliminary Round: Yu You Crushes Weituoning, Leaving the Enemy with a Clean Sweep of 5-0; Rising Star Hua Lian Suffers Defeat in First Round

Following the opening of the North China Daily News Cup football tournament the day before yesterday, three more matches were held yesterday. At the Race Club, Su Ke'er lost to Aosimeng 0-1, a remarkable upset. At Route de Ghisi, Hua Lian, a rising force in Chinese football, also lost to mediocre First-Class Zeng 1-3. In the previous乙组(Second Division), First-Class lost all ten matches, conceding over 130 goals and scoring only one. This year, they were relegated to丙组(Third Division), and their record remains lackluster. Compared to Hua Lian, they are worlds apart. Although First-Class had other star players assisting yesterday, they were merely like a wren nesting in the forest, occupying only a single branch. Liao Hua's vanguard ultimately lacked merit. It is a pity that Hua Lian was too eager to win, resulting in the opposite outcome. Since First-Class had resigned themselves to losing, their actions were uninhibited, and under this reverse psychology, they created a major upset, eliminating Hua Lian with a 3-1 victory and advancing to the second week. In another match at Jiaozhou Park, Yu You faced Weituoning. Because admission was free, there was a large audience. Yu You's strength is inherently formidable. Recently, with the addition of Zheng Tongyu as goalkeeper, Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao as defenders, the former glory of Lido has reappeared today, making their strength even more valiant. After the kickoff, Weituoning had no room to maneuver. The entire 70-minute match was dominated by Yu You, who controlled the situation meticulously. Before long, Yu You's central midfielder Wang Caigao received a brilliant pass from Ge Xizuo and opened the scoring (1-0). Not long after, Wang Caigao struck again (2-0). At halftime, Yu You was already ahead 2-0. After the break, Cao Qinfang scored first (3-0). Xu Jinda followed suit, earning thunderous applause (4-0). Soon after, Wang Caigao completed a hat-trick, scoring three goals in a row (5-0). The enemy was dumbfounded and attempted to come back, but Yu You's defense was impenetrable, and the cooperation between central midfielders Hu Wang and Tao was extremely effective. Although Weituoning harbored ambitions of breaking the cauldron and fighting with their backs to the wall, the situation was completely controlled by Yu You, forcing them to exclaim "Heaven has forsaken us!" Before long, the final whistle blew, and Weituoning's grand ambition of conquering the Central Plains vanished with the sound of the whistle. Yu You advanced to the third week of the North China Daily News Cup with a 5-0 victory. Currently, the teams that have advanced to the second week of the North China Daily News Cup, besides Yu You, First-Class, and Aosimeng from yesterday, also include the French Army, who defeated Rowing Club the day before yesterday, and Mikebie, who eliminated the French Navy, as well as the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, Russian Army, and Yousheng Society, who had a bye in the first week, totaling eight teams. The results and Yu You's lineup from yesterday are as follows:

North China Daily News Cup Preliminary Round Results:

Yu You defeated Weituoning (First Round) 5-0

First-Class defeated Hua Lian (First Round) 3-1

Aosimeng defeated Su Ke'er (First Round) 1-0

### First Division League: French Business Ties with North West Child, St. Francis Luckily Wins Against Jewish Association

In yesterday's Western Union Football League, there were three matches. In the preliminary round, St. Francis lost to Portuguese Business 2-3. In the two First Division matches, St. Francis' match against the Jewish Association was a close call. The two teams' points in the standings were far apart, with St. Francis only behind Donghua, ranked second, while the Jewish Association was far outside the top five. Logically, the situation should have been one-sided, but yesterday's match saw St. Francis consistently at a disadvantage, almost being taken advantage of by the Jewish Association. Although they ultimately won 5-4, the victory was precarious. In another First Division match, French Business faced North West Child at the Race Club. North West Child led 1-0 in the first half, and the final result was a 3-3 draw.

### The Knowledge Those Anesthetized by Foreign Stocks Should Have

— Kang Sha

Recently, for various reasons, Shanghai's money market has become increasingly loose, the exchange discount has gradually disappeared, and the interbank lending rate offered by the Money Trade Association has been only seven or eight percent per day. Banks have been actively lowering deposit interest rates. On the one hand, this may seem like a good phenomenon. But on the other hand, crises are lurking, hidden worries are not yet over, and the future of the market is full of thorns, with pessimistic elements far outweighing optimistic ones. At present, many speculative funds are wandering aimlessly, and everywhere, people have laid down nets to wait for you to fall into the trap. Only a moment of carelessness can cause you to fall in, making it impossible to recover.

For the past year, buying and selling foreign stocks has become the most fashionable form of speculation or investment. Brokers in the stock exchange are all smiles, and their doors are crowded. A broker's seat can be bought for 1,000 pounds sterling, and still be hard to come by. Daily trading volume is at least two or three hundred thousand shares, and often seven or eight hundred thousand shares; weekly trading volume often reaches around forty to fifty million yuan. Huge commissions flow into their pockets, while the market price fluctuates wildly, and countless Chinese people and ladies, blindly following the trend, have been ruined.

When money is tight, speculators are more cautious; but when money is loose, it is the best opportunity for speculators and manipulators to become active. At the same time, clever Jews repeatedly take advantage of this opportunity to raise new capital and absorb Chinese funds. Following Xinhe Spinning Mill and others, Ewo Spinning Mill has also announced the issuance of 337,500 new shares, priced at 24 yuan per share (an premium of 19 yuan on the par value of 5 taels), with every four old shares entitled to subscribe for one new share. Following this, the Shanghai Woolen Mill will also publicly issue over 400,000 new shares between 10:00 and 10:30 AM on December 5th, with a par value of 5 yuan and a selling price of 5.5 yuan per share. The purpose of this capital increase is said to be to purchase a 23-mu piece of land from Sassoon for 11,500 pounds sterling, and to build factory buildings, etc. Buying land in Shanghai must be done in pounds sterling, and only Sassoon's land is suitable. This is irrelevant to foreign involvement and need not be mentioned. However, according to their advertisement, the commission paid to subscribers of the new shares is 131,000 yuan, and another 150,000 yuan is paid as remuneration to the promoters, which is nothing more than adding another burden to the future new shareholders.

People who like to buy foreign stocks often do so because the company pays generous dividends, has a thriving business, is well-managed, or has competent leadership. True, setting aside the standpoint of national economy, purely from an investment point of view, some company stocks are indeed worth buying at a reasonable price. But this is only for investors, not for speculators. Many people operating blindly are manipulated, buying when prices are irrationally high and selling when prices are irrationally low, invariably falling into traps and ending up in a mess.

Now, let's try to describe the distribution of foreign stocks in Shanghai.

Although there are many types of stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, they can be broadly classified into just a few groups. The larger groups are listed below:

Sassoon Group (including Allied Group): Includes International Trust, Yangtze Trust, Zhonghe, British & Chinese Corporation, Shanghai Brewery, Cathay Land, Public Omnibus, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, etc.

Wheelock Marden Group: Includes Wheelock, Steel Works, China Estates & Finance, etc.

McBain Group: Includes Shanghai Banking Corporation, China Land & Finance, Lanquitz, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, etc.

Starr Group: Includes Heng Yeh, Sze Hai, American Asiatic Underwriters, Tai An Insurance, etc.

Jardine Matheson Group: Includes Ewo Spinning Mill, Jardine Brewery, Kung Ho Hsiang, etc.

祥茂(Cheung Mao) Group: Includes Anglo-French Land Investment Co., and Rubber Plantation Companies, Plantations Consolidated, Tolimein, Kotabahru Rubber Estates, Padang Rubber Estates, Glenshiel Rubber Estates, Bahru Rubber Estates, Senggar Desley, Tenamaram etc.

惠通(Hui Tong) Group: Rubber Plantation Companies, Alma, Indra, Ingcha-wah, Batu Anam, Chiam Chen Shi, Chava Kangsa, Capayang, Krowah, Lipai, Rubber Sing Kee, Semagaga, Siemens-Bruch, Schina Wang, Malay, Schiellanbaum, Shaw Manchus, Tepong Rubber, etc.

Now that the groups are clear, let's move on to discuss the issue of people. The development and stability of a company depend entirely on whether it has competent leadership. Those who have the right people prosper, and those who do not perish. In general, Shanghai's foreign companies have many shrewd and capable leaders with outstanding reputations. However, one person's energy is limited, and handling the affairs of two or three companies may be more than enough. If one person has to oversee the affairs of many companies, it is somewhat forced. If one is just going through the motions and acting as a "Yes man" everywhere, it is not showing respect to the shareholders and may even arouse the concerns of outsiders. Many people often cite the example of wealthy Chinese people holding dozens of positions as a topic of conversation, but who knew that Shanghai's foreign entrepreneurs are not letting wealthy Chinese people have all the glory. If you don't believe me, take a look at the following individuals:

Dawey (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, International, Yangtze, Wheelock, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Zong Guang Ho, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Steel Works, Shanghai Brewery, Public Omnibus, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Tug & Lighter, etc.

Arnhold, H.E. (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Zhonghe, Sze Hai, International, Yangtze, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Public Omnibus, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, etc.

Meager (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, Yangtze, International, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Brewery, Public Omnibus, etc.

Ovadia (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, Allied, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Brewery, etc.

Mardon (Wheelock Marden Group) serves as director of the following companies: Wheelock, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Tug & Lighter, China Estates & Finance, Steel Works, International, Yangtze, China Land & Finance, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, Xinhe, Sze Hai, Shanghai Woolen Mill, Heng Yeh, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, etc.

McBain (McBain Group) serves as director of the following companies: Shanghai Banking Corporation, International, Yangtze, Lanquitz, China Land & Finance, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Public Omnibus, etc.

In addition, the Kadocrie father and son and Welch of the Hui Tong Group and Rubber Plantation companies, Brand and Meller of the Xiang Mao Group and Rubber Plantation companies serve as directors, which is of course not to be excluded. In short, no matter how big Shanghai is and how many types of foreign stocks there are, most cannot escape the grasp of these foreign entrepreneurs.

The management of foreign companies affects shareholders differently due to different policies. For example, the Shanghai Waterworks Company first issued sterling bonds. Before August 13th, the company's management, concerned that the exchange rate might change, resolutely redeemed them and reissued silver dollar bonds. To this day, shareholders have benefited greatly; otherwise, not only would dividends be uncertain, but consumers' burdens would have increased even more than they are now. This is a good example. Conversely, Cathay Land, in 1936, converted its debt of over 9 million national currency owed to Sassoon Bank into 598,600 pounds sterling. It is said that the purpose of the conversion was to reduce the interest rate from 6% to 5% to alleviate the company's burden. However, at the end of last year, this sterling loan was listed on its report as 30,854,013 yuan. In order to save 1% interest, a debt of over 20 million yuan was created out of thin air. Given the current situation, not only will shareholders' capital be lost, but even the security of bondholders will be jeopardized. Such unexpected losses were probably not anticipated by those who invested in the past.

Shareholders should, in theory, have the opportunity to inquire about the company's operations, but this is not the case in foreign companies. Their directors are pre-selected and not elected by shareholders, and the same is true for important matters of reform in the company. The annual shareholders' meeting is just a formality, and it is often held during business hours, such as at 11:30 AM, making it impossible for many shareholders to attend.

In short, investing in foreign stocks is not impossible, but you must have a real understanding of the nature of the stock and have a strong grasp of the company's business before you can get involved. Whether the interest rate is worthwhile is closely related to whether the investment is worthwhile. For example, public utility stocks, such as telephone stocks, are certainly stable and reliable, but if you insist on raising the price to 40 or 50 yuan to buy shares with a par value of 10 yuan, no matter how much the telephone charges increase, the legal income will not exceed 8% of the par value, so it is self-evident whether it is worth it or not.

Finally, China needs a large amount of capital, and many high-profit enterprises in the mainland are waiting for Shanghai's funds to develop. In addition, many well-performing Chinese company shares, government bonds, and national construction savings certificates are all good investment destinations. I sincerely hope that those who are anesthetized by foreign stocks will wake up soon!

### On China's Rural Economic Construction

— Tang Xiaoyun

The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for three and a half years. During this long period of resistance, China has lost vast territories, a dozen important cities, and incalculable lives and property. However, China has not only not collapsed but has become stronger as it fights. If we want to explore the cause and effect of this great resistance, which foreigners marvel at as a "miracle," then in addition to political and military reasons, China's national economy—more precisely, the resilient Chinese rural economy—is undoubtedly the most powerful factor that has enabled China to resist for so long.

Since China's ability to sustain the war is due to the resilience of the rural economy's self-sufficiency, then, in order to strengthen the economic power of the resistance, to solve the people's livelihood problems during the war, and to expand and improve agricultural production, actively promoting rural economic construction is, at this stage, an urgent task.

Before discussing the main topic of China's rural economic construction, let's briefly examine how the Chinese rural economy has changed due to the impact of the war.

Changes in China's Rural Economy After the War

Generally speaking, the changes that have occurred in China's rural economy after the war are significant. Now, let's discuss the rural economy in the occupied areas and the rural economy in the free areas.

A. Rural Economy in Occupied Areas In the occupied areas such as North China and Central China, due to the war, the rural economy has suffered enormous damage and destruction. Countless rural people have fled and migrated. Rural houses have been burned down by artillery fire. Farmland crops have been trampled and devastated, especially the bombing of the Yellow River dikes. The surging Yellow River has submerged millions of rural fields and destroyed countless lives and property.

Taking Central China as an example, according to estimates by the Continental Daily, in the area along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway alone, there are more than ten million farmers who are hungry, cold, and on the verge of starvation. In North China, according to a Reuters dispatch on March 27 of this year, in central Hebei Province, there are six million farmers on the verge of desperation, and in eastern Hebei Province, at least four million farmers are about to starve to death. These farmers are using tree bark and grass roots to fill their stomachs. All cats and dogs have been eaten. In some areas where wheat seedlings are just growing, farmers who have no food have taken the seedlings to fill their stomachs. In addition, farmers using aquatic plants, sawdust, dead stalks, cotton wadding, and chaff to fill their stomachs are everywhere. The number of families committing suicide due to lack of food is increasing day by day. Judging from the miserable lives of these farmers, it is confirmed how serious the bankruptcy of the rural economy in the occupied areas is!

Of course, the occupied areas are not entirely like this now. With the development of guerrilla warfare and the establishment of guerrilla base areas, especially due to the active rural economic construction in some areas and the implementation of cooperation between the military and civilians, such as soldiers assisting farmers in planting, herding cattle, weeding, and harvesting during the busy farming season, and soldiers helping farmers raise pigs, herd cattle, raise sheep, and grow vegetables in their spare time, the new rural economy is rapidly growing and prospering in these areas.

B. Rural Economy in Free Areas In the free areas not occupied by Japan, at the beginning of the war, due to the blockade along the Yangtze River and the coast, and the occupation of many large cities, the rural economy once showed a sluggish state due to the widespread stagnation of agricultural products and the interruption of rural financial circulation. However, it soon recovered and gradually turned to prosperity. The increasing prosperity of the rural economy in the free areas can be proven by the statistics made by the customs. For example, in Longzhou, Guangxi, the total import in 1938 was 2.73 million yuan, and the export was 4.25 million yuan. In 1939, the total import was 36.439 million yuan, and the export was 57.602 million yuan, with a trade surplus of 21.163 million yuan, almost twice the import. In Mengzi, Yunnan, the customs situation was similar. In Mengzi in 1938, the import was 11.465 million yuan, and the export was 40.718 million yuan, with a trade surplus of 29.253 million yuan, with exports almost four times the imports. In addition to Longzhou and Mengzi, the trade of various customs in free areas such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Liuzhou also had trade surpluses, and almost all of the exports were agricultural products.

Why are the rural economy in the guerrilla base areas in the occupied areas and the rural economy in the free areas becoming increasingly developed and prosperous? In our opinion, this is not accidental, but has many objective factors.

First, because the transportation lines along the Yangtze River and the coast were blockaded by Japan, and many large cities were successively occupied, the suction tubes of foreign capital extending into China's vast rural areas were cut off. The roads for British and American goods to flow into China's rural areas were blocked. Second, due to the severe damage to China's national industry, and the inability of Japanese goods to pour in on a large scale without hindrance due to China's implementation of economic counter-blockade, the vast people in the rural areas of the free areas and guerrilla base areas still had a demand for industrial products. Under such circumstances, it naturally created extremely favorable conditions for the re-emergence of rural handicrafts and the prosperity of the rural economy.

Premises for Promoting Rural Economic Construction

The changes in China's rural economy after the war have been described above. But how should we take advantage of these favorable conditions to promote rural economic construction and enrich the economic power of long-term resistance? This is the most important and most pressing issue. Of course, we cannot deny that in the past three years of the war, due to the government's active coordination and supervision, and the efforts of the financial community and the vast people, the rural economy in the free areas has achieved considerable results. However, in order to make rural economic construction able to solve the problem more quickly and effectively, it is necessary to:

1. Land Issue The land issue can be said to be the most central and complex issue in China's rural economic construction. Although the land owned by China is extremely vast, due to the uneven distribution of China's population (such as in some places, there are too many people and too little land, while in some places, the land is so barren that no one cultivates it) and the fact that most of the land ownership is concentrated in the hands of landlords, China's agricultural productivity cannot be strongly developed. Although the government has paid attention to this after the war, in reality, there has not been much change. We believe that to promote rural economic construction at present, we must first solve the land issue. This not only requires the planned relocation of refugees from the war zones and people from densely populated areas to the border areas to expand the reclamation movement, but also requires all provinces to try their best to reclaim all wasteland to increase the production of food and other goods. In addition, the government should, in accordance with the Prime Minister's advocacy of "equal land rights," further restrict the concentration of land in the hands of landlords, such as confiscating land exceeding a certain area owned by farmers and distributing this land and ownerless wasteland to landless or land-poor farmers and tenant farmers for use.

2. Rural Financial Issues Whether rural production can be increased is closely related to the financial abundance of farmers. The income of Chinese farmers is generally very meager due to the limited cultivated land. Each farm family relies on only a few acres of land to live on. Even without floods or droughts, it is extremely difficult for their income to maintain the lives of a "family of five." Due to the poverty of farmers in normal times, many are unable to store seeds for the following year. When the new grain is harvested, it is immediately sold to repay old debts, and their subsequent lives must be sustained by high-interest loans. As a result, they bear a heavier burden, and the farmers' economy becomes increasingly difficult.

After the war, the burden on farmers in the free areas has undeniably increased considerably, and the burden on farmers in the occupied areas has become even heavier. Although the Ministry of Finance has announced the abolition of all exorbitant taxes and levies in order to reduce the burden on the people during the war, such as the complete abolition of taxes and levies in the occupied areas, and the postponement or reduction of various taxes and levies in the war zones, in reality, this order has not been widely implemented except in one or two provinces. Many farmers in the occupied areas are not only cruelly exploited by exorbitant taxes and levies from a certain party, but some guerrilla forces even illegally impose levies on farmers without authorization. What is even more important is that the various super-economic exploitation of farmers by general landlords and the bone-sucking exploitation of high-interest loans have plunged countless farmers into a miserable situation! Although banks have successively moved inland after the war, and banks in various places are competing to make rural loans, due to poor management, most of the low-interest loans are absorbed by landlords and usurers in the countryside, who lend them to farmers at high interest, so that farmers cannot benefit. Therefore, to promote rural economic construction at present, we must first seek the development of rural finance, thoroughly and universally abolish exorbitant taxes and levies, reduce rents and interest, and the government should stipulate the maximum interest rate for loans and strictly crack down on the heavy exploitation of high-interest loans. The principal and interest of old debts owed by farmers should also be temporarily suspended during the war.

3. Improvement of Agricultural Production Technology The methods of agricultural management, cultivation techniques, and tools in China have mostly followed the old methods for thousands of years, with very little improvement. Chinese farmers in general do not know how to select and improve seeds and fertilizers, nor do they know how to prevent and control pests. What is even more important is water conservancy. China has not only not actively built water conservancy projects to benefit farmland, but has allowed it to overflow and cause disasters. The continuous water and drought disasters in China over the years have damaged the rural economy to an extent that is in fact no less than the aggression of the capital of the great powers. It is precisely because of the above reasons that China's agricultural productivity has never been able to develop. In the future, to promote rural economic construction and develop agricultural productivity, we must actively improve agricultural production technology, such as preventing and controlling pests to increase agricultural output, improving fertilizers, changing the soil, turning barren land into fertile fields, building water conservancy projects, planting forests to protect farmland from drought and floods, encouraging spring plowing, and promoting production competitions, so that production movements surge in all provinces, counties, towns, and villages to increase the production of food and other goods and consolidate the economic foundation of the resistance war. Otherwise, agricultural productivity can never be developed and expanded.

4. Reform of Rural Institutions The main reason why China's rural economic construction after the war has not achieved satisfactory results to date is the unsoundness of rural political institutions. The "Baobabia system" currently implemented in rural areas is mostly controlled by local bullies and rascals. Not only can it not be used as a foundation for uniting the people and promoting rural economic construction, but it has become the best tool for these elements to oppress and exploit farmers. The agricultural cooperative movement promoted in rural areas in recent years is also mostly controlled by these elements, making it impossible for most poor farmers to participate in cooperatives and work hard to produce. Therefore, to promote rural economic construction in the future, we must actively reform rural political institutions. If the administrative institutions below the county level can be thoroughly reformed, so that the party, government, army, and people are united and cooperate closely, it will not be difficult to eliminate the evil forces that hinder rural economic construction, and rural economic construction will surely be rapidly promoted.

Rural economic construction is the most important link in the entire national economic construction movement. The development of China's rural economic construction is also the gradual realization of the highest ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood.

### Financial Review (Continued)

— Sheng Kaiqiong

After the United States granted China a third loan of US$25 million on September 27, rumors spread that the United States would actively provide China with economic assistance and was conducting negotiations with Mr. Song Ziwen. Reuters also reported that Mr. Jones of the United States said that China could accept credit loans from the United States, and that the United States was considering purchasing new raw materials from China, including some important minerals and certain items that had not been purchased from China in the loan terms. Since then, news of loans has continued, but there has been no definite development. In the past two days, news from Washington has indicated that the United States is about to grant China another large loan, and a relatively definite decision has been made. Mr. Jones stated: "The more difficult China's situation becomes, the more we hope to do our best to help it." Reuters reported on the 29th that the new loan to China may be established tomorrow. If it is delayed, the United States may take other measures, which may involve further embargoes against Japan to protest Japan's recognition of the "Nanjing government."

Due to the undying ambition of Japanese aggression, the United States and Japan have become acutely opposed to each other. Recently, due to Japan's active advance southward, the United States and Japan may have a war in the South Pacific at any time. In terms of interests, in order to maintain its rights and interests in the Far East, the United States naturally has no choice but to do its best to economically aid China before a US-Japan war breaks out in order to contain Japan's aggression in the South Pacific. Therefore, there is no doubt that the United States will grant China a new loan.

China's debt repayment ability has been greatly enhanced since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Highway on October 18. The average daily amount of tung oil transported from Chongqing to Rangoon is as high as 100 tons. According to the statistics of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the amount of tung oil exported from Cheqing or via Chongqing in September was 5,553.75 quintals, and in October it was 9,098.43 quintals, an increase of 3,540 quintals. According to the report of the Sichuan Tung Oil Trading Company, the purchasing agency of the Reconstruction Trade Company of the Ministry of Finance, 12,000 tons of tung oil were purchased from June to October of this year, and it is expected that the number will reach 15,000 tons by the end of this year. Mr. Jones pointed out that the previous transactions between China and the United States were extremely satisfactory, and China is continuing to fulfill its obligations to export tung oil, tin, and other goods. Given China's good creditworthiness and strong ability to repay debts, why has this new loan been delayed? The focus of the problem is on: (1) the United States is considering some new raw materials, such as important minerals, that have not been purchased; (2) how the United States can find a way to purchase a large amount of goods from China within one or two years. The author firmly believes that after these two points are satisfactorily resolved, the new loan will definitely be announced at the most appropriate time. (The End)

Snuff (1)

Among the tobaccos, the only one that is not burned with fire and is not inhaled through the mouth is snuff. As the name suggests, it is known that it is inhaled through the nose.

Snuff is a brownish-yellow powder. According to legend, in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (16th century), when Italian priests such as Matteo Ricci came to China, it was used as a tribute and began to become popular. This is indeed possible. It is said that the production of snuff is mostly the amateur work of priests in monasteries, and their methods are kept secret. Therefore, the snuff produced by each monastery has its own differences. Snuff, of course, is made from tobacco leaves, but its ingredients are sometimes mixed with grape wine, and sometimes mixed with rose dew. Various flower dews and fruit wines are used to make snuffs with different colors and fragrances. It is said that the method of making it is to first soak the tobacco leaves in flower dew, place them in a jar, and bury them underground. After a certain period of time, they are taken out to make snuff. Then they are evaluated against each other. The good ones are not easy to find, and they are famous for a while.

Snuff is not only loved by officials and gentry in China, but also in ancient France and other countries, when entering university, one must learn to snuff. This shows that it is necessary for social interaction in the upper class. Snuff is a finished product of tobacco leaves and flower dew, so it does not get rid of the sour and spicy smell. Even a sour taste is considered to be the best. Although the way to snuff is the same using the nose, the techniques of Chinese and Westerners are different. Westerners snuff by taking a pinch of snuff and drawing it into the nose. Chinese people snuff by gently dipping the snuff with their fingers, pressing it against the nostrils, and inhaling it slightly. At the moment of this slight inhalation, they close their eyes and contemplate, holding their breath and carefully distinguishing the sour and spicy taste of the snuff, and judging its quality accordingly.

Because snuff was favored by gentry and officials, it became a trend, which led to peddlers and servants to imitate it. Mr. Zhu once said to me: You can tell the degree of their snuff by looking at the hand gestures they use with their fingers. Experts mostly use the ring finger; those who are not used to snuffing often use the little finger to dip the snuff. In addition, those who use the thumb can tell at a glance that they are not refined people. Their snuff must be inferior, so the amount they take is large. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Clothes and Prison Uniforms

— Anpin

Poverty is not one's own sin, except when it results from one's own depravity. Helping the poor naturally involves a little benevolence, rising up to provide relief. However, some do it to seek merit, plant seeds of good fortune, using tangible wealth to seek intangible blessings. As for those who handle the work of helping the poor—such as charitable organizations—they don't necessarily contribute money or goods; they merely exert effort. Yet, many act presumptuously, as if they were great benefactors and philanthropists, forgetting the saying, "Greedy for great merit, thinking it is already theirs," which is inauspicious.

Distributing cotton-padded clothes is originally to pity the poor who are freezing to death, so providing a set to ward off the cold is well-intentioned. However, how to distribute cotton-padded clothes is not difficult in rural societies, but in the most mobile cities, it's not easy to do well. You may think of the poor begging on the streets, but forget that many, though no less poor, are huddled in shacks. Moreover, there are many hidden poor living in houses, crying out for food without rice, lamenting the cold without clothes. Let's not talk about them today.

Nowadays, most great philanthropists fear losing sight of the purpose of helping against the cold. They also fear that opium addicts on the streets, who consume red pills and white flour, will take a set of clothes, pawn it for opium money, and continue to beg. Therefore, they seek ways to prevent this misuse. They devised a method of making the clothes in two colors. The cotton-padded jackets have the body and sleeves, and the cotton-padded pants have the legs and crotch, all divided into gray and black to distinguish them, with a stamp added to the clothes to prohibit pawning. Adding a stamp to prohibit pawning is an old method, but no matter how the stamp is applied, pawnbrokers will still pawn them. If they won't accept them, sellers won't buy them. Thus, those giving the clothes originally want the recipients to wear them, and the recipients have no way to convert them. Who knew that the gentlemen of the charitable organization, probably having managed prisons for years, are used to seeing prisoners' clothes in two colors, also divided into two colors. This strange and peculiar clothing, meant to be recognized at a glance as donated clothes, is somewhat unkind. Especially Buddhism, which emphasizes equality and compassion, ironically separates people into classes like Brahmanism. With this ingrained discrimination, if the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas knew, would they not say, "Excellent, excellent!"?

A sense of shame and aversion is inherent in everyone. Wearing donated clothes, except for those who know no shame, will always cause some discomfort. If the recipient feels bad, does the giver feel good? If they do feel good, then it's not the intention of a benevolent person! I hope that those who run charities will respect the dignity of those being helped. People are always people. Don't fawn obsequiously over wealthy donors, while arbitrarily insulting the pitiful poor. That would be much better than burning incense and chanting Buddha's name!

### Regarding Essay Topics

— Wang Shui

Whenever there are essay contests, I always participate eagerly, viewing it as an opportunity to practice my writing skills. I feel that the seven or eight compositions assigned each semester in school are not enough to satisfy a young person's "desire to write."

I was delighted to find in the newspaper the

Soap Scholarship essay topic. At the same time, I also felt ashamed, as a senior high school student, I'm not qualified to write this article because I don't even understand [the topic]. For days, I've asked nearly a hundred classmates about this topic, and believe it or not, only a few could answer.

Although essay contests have various purposes, the universal goal is to develop young people's thinking and encourage students' writing. Since there's a common goal, I don't understand why some people always like to quote one or two famous passages from classical texts to mock young people's ideas.

### Other People's Affairs

— Dai Niao

After finishing today's last meal, I leisurely began to chat. However, since the speakers were an elementary school teacher and myself, an office worker, entertainment was naturally out of the question. Talking about life? How could that be "comfortable"? It's better to be sensible and talk about other people's affairs. The elementary school teacher mentioned the phone rate increase.

Is the phone rate increase someone else's business? Yes, that's right. The person who raised the question continued, "The people at the stock exchange don't care about these few cents."

"I only answer the phone; I don't need to spend money. Even for personal matters, I can skim off the company's expenses." Saying this, I felt too despicable.

The elementary school teacher chuckled, "Probably because you're skimming too often, that's why the rates are increasing."

Although somewhat embarrassed, a counterattack was unavoidable. "Since we pay a monthly fee, there shouldn't be limits. Besides, business is so booming that they're overwhelmed. It's impossible to even get a phone installed. This rate increase is really unreasonable!"

"Idiot!" he lectured me. "Why don't you bring out the big hat of 'public utilities'? They calculate in 'US dollars'. Streetcars, buses, tap water, and heating have all increased in price; phones naturally can't be exempt!" After a pause, "Besides, their staff and workers are constantly clamoring for pay raises!"

Reasonable, I admired him secretly.

"Actually, when else are they going to make money if not now?" he said excitedly. "Those rice weevils and profiteers are scolded incessantly, yet they still do whatever they want. Isn't it all for money? Ultimately, it's the poor guys like us who suffer. With this rate increase and that rate increase, they say the rent will increase again tomorrow, and rice will rise to one hundred dollars a dan." This was followed by a sigh.

Rice, rent, like a bolt from the blue, I couldn't say a word. I silently climbed into bed, blaming myself for why talking about other people's affairs led to talking about my own! ...

The Detective Stories of Hawthorne

### The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12: Report and Explanation

That sigh deeply affected me. I felt that while material civilization can certainly improve the enjoyment of life, it also serves as the primary cause of humans fighting and killing each other. For thousands of years, traditional Chinese thought has adopted an attitude of suppression and disdain towards material aspects. Confucius said, "A scholar who is devoted to the Way and ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with." This statement can represent everything. As a result of this thinking, while we may not have achieved much in the material sphere, the phenomenon of social disputes and killings has perhaps been relatively reduced. Since our door was knocked open, this country has been lagging behind materially. However, once our material desires are ignited by this temptation, they cannot be simultaneously reduced because we cannot produce them ourselves. Therefore, the eyes of ordinary people in urban society are focused on readily available enjoyments. As a result, society has become more chaotic, and national strength has been eroded day by day!

Ni Jinshou didn't feel anything. He continued to urge Hawthorne, "Now that the old man is dead, his actions can no longer be confirmed. I can only ask you to explain." Hawthorne said, "His actions are also very simple. I believe my one-sided guess is not far from the truth. On the seventeenth night, after persuading his son to return to his room, he knew the situation had reached a deadlock. In order to salvage the situation, he may have made the decision to murder. When he sent his son out yesterday morning, he probably quietly bought this knife, planning to find an opportunity to strike. Situationally, he couldn't stay in the Li Lan's home for much longer, so the opportunity to strike couldn't be delayed; it had to be implemented quickly. When he returned yesterday morning, he heard Yu Gantang threatening over the phone, and he thought he could frame little Yu, a great opportunity, so he decided to take action last night."

"Last night, after he read the newspaper and went upstairs, it rained. He must have thought this was another best coincidence. After going upstairs, he certainly couldn't sleep. His room was next to Jin Mei's bedroom. After Jin Mei turned off the lights and fell asleep, he quietly went downstairs to prepare. He went to the first floor and pushed open Li Lan's bedroom. You all know her door isn't locked. He must have entered and exited her room several times, seeing a pair of leather shoes in the closet. He took Lu Jiansheng's leather shoes, perhaps bringing them upstairs, or perhaps leaving them near the stairs, waiting for temporary use." (183)

### The Medicine of Tomorrow

— Ding Huikang

——Public Understanding Required——

Medicine is not a charitable enterprise. The more advanced medicine is, the more excellent the nation and the more advanced its construction. This is an immutable truth. Since medicine is so important, it cannot be effective without gathering talent and specialized equipment, and studying and expanding it meticulously. Our country has always mistakenly believed that medicine belongs to a passive charitable enterprise. Looking at the backwardness of medicine and the decline of the nation in our country, we can take this as a warning. Now that science is advancing rapidly, we must know that medicine is a noble and active construction enterprise, whose progress is related to the health of the nation, the development of social undertakings, and the advancement of national construction. All Chinese people should be aware of this.

Prevention is better than cure: As the saying goes, "The best doctor treats the disease before it appears." Today, medicine is not omnipotent, so prevention is better than cure. Since the invention of smallpox vaccination in modern times, its benefits to mankind have been immeasurable. Therefore, there are special departments in the country, such as how to promote epidemic prevention and tuberculosis prevention work, popularize public health movements, and implement mandatory health examinations. On a small scale, this relates to the health and happiness of individuals; on a large scale, it relates to the public safety of the entire society. Therefore, the medicine of tomorrow belongs to preventive medicine. It is not a matter of eliminating all diseases with a single prescription. It must be understood that there is no such easy task in the world. The so-called treatment is only a part of the work in medicine. Our greatest goal is to suppress the occurrence of diseases, and the minimum limit is early diagnosis. If diseases are treated before they are discovered, then it can be done with half the effort and twice the result. For example, in the case of lung disease, which is most prevalent in our country, if X-ray examinations can be carried out early, then diagnosis can be made in the early stages, and a cure is certain. Not only can individuals obtain health early, but also how much social and economic strength can be increased! Therefore, preventing diseases is the highest peak in our ideal. Treating diseases after they have occurred is the last resort. This is another thing that we should all work together on.

Medicine for public enjoyment: Modern medicine, being the general link to improve the nation, relates to the rise and fall of a country, and its importance is so great. However, the nobility of all specialized medical facilities is beyond the ability of the general public to bear. Therefore, if we want to seek the progress of medicine and ensure that the public has medical security, we must concentrate great economic power. Then "medical insurance" is the only option. An extremely close cooperative organization is established between the People's Government and medical institutions, so that the public can enjoy noble medical facilities. Not only can the people obtain accurate diagnosis and treatment, but the giant wheel of medicine can also move forward continuously, developing and expanding it with economic strength, benefiting mankind, and changing the nation. Everything depends on this.

Now that international winds and clouds are becoming increasingly urgent, and the public rules of natural selection cannot be escaped, our glorious Chinese nation has a cultural and glorious history of more than four thousand years. If we do not make plans for it now, then even if the country does not perish, our ethnic group will perish. If we want to reverse the situation, we must improve medicine and understand the position of medicine. Alas! War is everywhere, and the situation is unpredictable. All Chinese people must encourage each other.

### Winter Health in Indoor Living: Paying Attention to Rooms and Practicing Cold Resistance

— Zhong Hu

As winter approaches, people often use stoves, electric heaters, and radiator equipment indoors for warmth because they are afraid of the cold. In today's time of expensive coal, electricity, and firewood, the huge cost is an economic problem, which will be set aside for the moment. Even in terms of hygiene, it is not really suitable. Those who are accustomed to warmth will inevitably weaken their ability to withstand cold. If they go to a colder place, they are easily susceptible to colds. Moreover, if the room is too warm, it often makes people feel dizzy and unable to concentrate on brain work.

In fact, the human body itself is like a small stove, continuously emitting warmth, acting as a heat source, just like a small stove. However, its warmth is difficult to perceive by oneself and must be felt by touching another person's body. For example, if many people share a quilt, they can obtain considerable warmth. Therefore, the poor inadvertently receive natural blessings. Babies and their mothers also act as natural hot water bottles for each other, forming a chain of love. If many people gather in a small room, even without a stove, it will feel considerably warmer. Because of this relationship, if many people live together in a room, even without a warm room method, they will never feel that the cold is frightening.

Although the general warm room method can weaken people's resistance to cold, making them susceptible to colds, or cause dizziness and reduce work efficiency due to the room being too warm, these are not the most harmful to the human body. The most harmful to the human body is the poor ventilation method, that is, sealing the room tightly, isolating it from fresh air from outdoors, and making people live in poor air. If electric heaters, stoves, and radiators can add a device to directly warm and send fresh outdoor air into the room, it can become an ideal ventilation warm room method and make up for its shortcomings. Moreover, even if the ventilation of electric heaters and radiators is slightly poor, it will not cause people to be poisoned. The worst thing is to use smokeless white coal stoves, gas stoves, or kerosene stoves without chimneys in a tightly sealed room, which is most likely to cause people to be poisoned and endanger their lives. If you suffer from poisoning for the sake of warmth, then what is the point of seeking warmth?

The above-mentioned ventilation warm room method is for those who cannot avoid warm rooms and need to make up for their hygienic shortcomings. As for ordinary families, I believe that all warm room methods can be avoided. This not only saves money but is also very beneficial to hygiene. Every winter, when there is sunlight, open the windows wide and let the sunlight enter, exposing oneself to it, and one will feel warmth throughout the body. This is a natural and free method of heating. Even when there is no sunlight, the windows should not be closed. If you really feel cold, just add clothes to resist the cold. At night, keep the windows open as usual. However, close one or two of the windows where the wind can blow directly onto the bed. By doing this for decades, the skin will become accustomed to the cold. Every winter, not only will there be no sign of shivering, but there will also be very few colds. I dare to share what I have learned from experience with readers, hoping to contribute to winter indoor hygiene.

### Winter Epidemic Diseases and Their Prevention

— Jie Tai

Among the epidemic diseases that are easy to contract in winter, respiratory diseases are the most common, because the temperature is low and the air is dry in winter. The following is a brief description of various epidemic diseases that are easy to contract in winter.

Nasal Catarrh: This is caused by the cold acting on the nasal mucosa, causing local anemia, and then the bacteria that are usually attached to that area take the opportunity to cause the disease.

Laryngitis: When suffering from this disease, the throat has various abnormal sensations such as dryness, itching, burning pain, etc. There is a unique cough like a dog's bark, and the voice also becomes hoarse. In mild cases, the voice only changes slightly, while in severe cases, the voice is hoarse like a mute, or there is no fever, or the fever is not high.

Tracheobronchitis Catarrh: Most cases start with a cold, and then develop this disease. The main symptom is coughing. At the beginning of the illness, there is a stubborn dry cough, sometimes with chest pain, which is called a dry cough. As the disease progresses, this cough gradually disappears, and the throat gradually has phlegm and wheezing, and the sputum gradually increases, which is called a warm cough. Coughing is an action to cough out the sputum secreted by tracheobronchitis catarrh, so forcing the doctor to stop the cough with medicine is actually a wrong request.

Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a serious disease, and there are two types: catarrhal pneumonia and croupous pneumonia. Both have high fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc., which are difficult for ordinary people to distinguish. However, if you see a sudden onset with high fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath, and cough up rusty sputum, you can consider it croupous pneumonia. This disease can affect both adults and children and is a disease that directly invades the lung tissue. On the other hand, catarrhal pneumonia is caused by tracheobronchitis catarrh, and its inflammation gradually progresses to the deeper parts and eventually invades the lung tissue, thus causing pneumonia. This is generally a disease of children or the elderly, and it is less common in adults.

Diphtheria: This is caused by diphtheria bacteria adhering to the throat, gradually multiplying, and producing white spots. The toxins produced in that area spread throughout the body through the bloodstream, causing fever. This disease requires injection of serum, and the earlier the injection, the more effective it is.

Whooping Cough: Caused by whooping cough bacteria, it is a disease of children, and many children under three years of age suffer from it. Once you have it, you get immunity, but there are exceptions, and some people get it again. The cough of this disease has its own unique characteristic: after a series of countless short coughs, there is a long, audible inhalation.

Influenza: The cold acts on the human body, reducing its resistance, and the bacteria that previously occupied the respiratory mucosa take this opportunity to suddenly cause the disease, which is a cold. Influenza, commonly known as a severe cold, is more serious than a common cold. It is transmitted by "influenza bacteria" and is a highly contagious disease.

To prevent the above diseases, you should do appropriate exercises at ordinary times, strengthen your physique, and take foods rich in nutrition and various vitamins to strengthen your body and increase its resistance to diseases. You should also pay attention to implementing general hygiene methods. You should avoid going to places where many people are crowded, and it is not advisable to stay in places that are too warm or too cold for too long. If the disease is at its peak, you can wear a mask when going out to avoid infection. If you want to prevent diphtheria, you can perform preventive injections to ensure safety. As for those who are already sick, they should seek medical treatment immediately and avoid procrastination, so as not to bring trouble upon themselves.

### Talking About Winter Food Supplements

— Huang Zhaoping

Among foods and drinks, such as milk, eggs, cod liver oil, animal liver, etc., they can all be regarded as supplements in winter.

Milk contains protein, fat, lactose, lecithin, phosphorus, calcium, iron, and important enzymes. Its quality can be called the best among foods and drinks. Drinking more high-quality milk can make weight gain very quickly.

Eggs, eating two medium-sized ones every day, each weighing fifty grams, can fully supplement the protein needed by the human body—protein is the main nutrient in the human body. Moreover, the yolk is rich in Vitamin D. Children eating one or two a day can prevent rickets and promote development, so eggs can be regarded as a special gift for children's winter supplementation.

Cod liver oil contains Vitamin A and Vitamin D. Halibut liver oil contains the most Vitamin D, one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five times more than cod liver oil. Its efficacy is similar to that of yolk. Winter is the best time to take cod liver oil. Taking an appropriate amount of cod liver oil every day can not only prevent night blindness, dry eye, and corneal softening, but also strengthen the body and enhance its resistance to infectious diseases. It is most effective for children to take it, as they easily develop and grow up.

Among animal livers, calf liver is the top-grade hematopoietic agent, and it is also rich in vitamins, so if you want to replenish blood in winter, you may wish to eat more liver foods.

However, in the current high-cost living environment, the above-mentioned foods and drinks are relatively expensive. Except for the general bourgeoisie who can afford to enjoy them, the remaining salary earners and the proletariat cannot afford them. However, it is not difficult for poor people to supplement their bodies in winter. No matter how poor they are, they cannot do without eating. So, starting from winter, first change from eating white rice to brown rice. Brown rice not only contains anti-beriberi vitamin B, but also contains development-promoting vitamins. It is truly a great supplement for the poor. Moreover, the price is somewhat cheaper than white rice, which is also an economical method.

In terms of drinks and foods, although poor people cannot afford milk, they can replace it with soy milk and soy foods. Germans are regarding soybeans as milk!

As for side dishes, such as the existing cabbage, spinach, and other vegetables containing chlorophyll, they all contain rich iron, which can replenish blood. Therefore, using the above-mentioned vegetables as daily side dishes is not only cheaper but also provides the effect of replenishing blood naturally.

If people with weak economic strength can follow the above methods as a guide for drinks and foods, then seeking supplements from food can be called economical and beneficial!

Finally, I would also like to add that the purpose of seeking supplements is to improve health, so just eat foods that are needed for health to meet the purpose of supplementing. If you kill chickens and ducks! Eat large amounts of fish and meat, thinking that you cannot supplement without doing so, then it can only be regarded as indulging in sensual pleasures. Even if you eat until your brain is full and your intestines are fat, it will cause too much fat to accumulate in the body, which is not only useless but also harmful, and deeply violates the true meaning of food supplements!

They are most suitable for children with incomplete development and those who are out of balance after illness or childbirth.

### Supplementation Should Go Hand-in-Hand with Exercise

— Zha Rui Long

Because, on the surface, supplementation and exercise seem like two unrelated matters, people who pay attention to exercise often mistakenly believe that supplementation is unnecessary, while those who take supplements often believe that medicine is all-powerful and do not pay attention to exercise.

In fact, the human body is like a machine. If a machine is not used, it will rust. Therefore, only taking supplements without exercise will at most create a fat body and a waddling gait, and will never make the physique strong and robust. If one only engages in exercise without knowing about nutritional replenishment, the result will be like a machine that has been used for a long time without being oiled or inspected and repaired. It will inevitably be easily worn out and eventually become unusable.

The author has maintained a strong physique for the past twenty years and has never been troubled by illness. I believe this is due to exercise, but also to nutrition. Initially, I also worked hard at exercise, but diseases grew rampantly and I remained weak. Later, under the guidance of martial arts seniors, I paid attention to nutrition on the one hand and devoted myself to exercise on the other, taking both into account and never interrupting either. My stubborn body gradually became stronger. Therefore, I know that supplementation and exercise are mutually reinforcing and should not be neglected. I hope that people who love exercise will also pay attention to body nutrition. And I hope that people who take supplements will pay attention to exercise, especially simple exercises that are easy and accessible to everyone... the first six forms of New Combat... should also be given considerable importance, because New Combat is a body-strengthening technique that does not cost time or money. It is very simple and effective to practice, so just a dozen minutes of practice each day is enough.

### Hygiene for the Elderly

— Ding Fubao

The health and longevity of our bodies largely depend on the strength of important organs, such as the various endocrine glands, heart, vascular system, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Mental depression and anxiety will also reduce lifespan, so it is essential to be optimistic in all things and to have adequate entertainment and rest, which can bring mental happiness. As for other lifestyle habits, they must be in line with hygiene in order to maintain the strength of various important organs. When a person is old, they should pay even more attention to self-care in order to enjoy longevity. Now, the hygiene of clothing, food, housing, and transportation will be discussed separately below.

Clothing: The clothing of the elderly should be light and warm. The material can be wool or silk. The cut of the clothes should be wider. Underwear should be made of cotton and should be changed and washed frequently. Cotton quilts should be sunned often. Because the elderly are not very active, their hands and feet are often cold, so they should pay attention to keeping warm.

Diet: Hands should be washed before eating. Meals should be frequent and small, not infrequent and large. Every day when the stomach is empty, eat a bowl of thin rice porridge (fragrant rice is even better), which can promote metabolism, generate fluids, and quickly soothe the stomach. The benefits are not small. The most suitable foods for the elderly are milk, soy milk, butter, eggs, brown rice, green vegetables, oranges, bananas, apples, grapes, tomatoes, and pure cod liver oil. When eating, one must chew slowly and take more time, and not swallow quickly. It is best to cut the food into small pieces or cook it until it is soft so that it requires less chewing. If there is a little residue left between the teeth after eating, which is most tiring for the teeth, it should be picked out with a toothpick, and then strong tea should be brewed, cooled, and used as a mouthwash to rinse it out. Brushing teeth in the morning and evening is most beneficial. It is best to drink warm liquids, not cold ones. It is also good to drink soup during meals. If the elderly like to smoke and drink alcohol, a little is fine, but it is best not to consume them. Strong cigars are harmful to the heart and should not be smoked. This also applies to young people.

Daily life: The elderly are most prone to fatigue, so there should be a recliner in the room for them to lie down at any time. If one feels sleepy, one might as well sleep right away, which can allow the body to get complete rest. It is most beneficial to take a nap after meals. A good night's sleep is most essential. If one has trouble sleeping, one should eliminate all worries and plans when going to bed. Gradually eliminate them, less and less, until there are none. Then one will naturally sleep soundly. The elderly's bedroom should be in a quiet place and should be warm in winter and cool in summer. The windows should be opened frequently. The size of the open window should be inversely proportional to the strength of the wind, the heat and cold of the weather. It is also best to maintain a room temperature of 64-65 degrees Fahrenheit.

Exercise: Although the muscles of the elderly have weakened, they should still have adequate exercise. Brisk walking is the most suitable exercise for the elderly. Going out for a walk at a set time every day is extremely beneficial to health. It can make one feel refreshed, increase appetite, promote bowel movements, and allow one to sleep soundly at night. Sometimes, if one cannot go for a walk to a farther place, walking several thousand steps in the house or behind the house is also very beneficial. Walking should be relaxed and unconstrained, walking and standing, standing and walking, with an attitude of leisure and ease.

Diseases: Common diseases for the elderly over the age of fifty include stroke (cerebral hemorrhage), chronic nephritis, and cancer. The first two diseases are mostly caused by eating too much meat and alcohol when young, leading to high blood pressure and hardening of the blood vessels. The remedy is to practice deep breathing, eat more fruits and vegetables, and abstain from meat. Blood pressure will naturally decrease, and the incidence of nephritis will also decrease. Those suffering from nephritis should further reduce salt intake, or even eat only fruits and vegetables. If one can persevere, one can prevent stroke and chronic nephritis, and it will not be difficult to gradually recover. However, there is still no cure for cancer.

Other: The elderly should eat more fruits and vegetables to keep their bowels moving, or have a set amount of exercise each day to regulate them. Sometimes, if suffering from constipation, an enema can also be used to relieve it. If accumulated feces in the intestines are not eliminated daily, one will suffer from fecal intoxication, and the blood vessels will harden even more. Therefore, Baopuzi said, "To achieve longevity, the intestines should be clear; to achieve immortality, the intestines should be without residue."

On bright sunny days, the elderly should spend several hours in the sun, which can improve blood circulation and promote metabolism. The method is to first take off the upper clothing, wipe the body clean with a wet towel, and then bask in the sun, but the head should be covered. This method can also be done in winter.

The elderly are prone to spiritual exhaustion, so they are easily angered by everything. When one becomes angry, all kinds of internal and external secretory glands stop secreting fluids, so it is most harmful to the body. Therefore, one should deal with things with patience. If one cannot see through human affairs and the ways of the world, and one cares too much about things, one will become angry. Anger does no harm to others, but only harms oneself. Or, if one cannot let go of wealth and property, one will worry about it all day long, which is extremely tiring. One does not know that there are few days left, and although one accumulates gold and jade, what use will they be? In short, all fame, wealth, fields, real estate, calligraphy, famous paintings, love, resentment, and hatred should be let go. One should only diligently cultivate the six perfections: generosity, morality, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom. This is what is meant by "what can be kept and what can be taken away."

### Phlegm and Nasal Discharge

— Chang

Winter Cleaning Campaign

One of the worst habits of the Chinese people is spitting phlegm and blowing their noses everywhere, especially in public places. We can often see walls and corners covered in phlegm and nasal discharge, which is a very conspicuous thing.

Phlegm and nasal discharge are both secretions of a disease. This is not a big deal, but in general open-type lung disease patients, one does not know how many tubercle bacilli are contained in a single mouthful of phlegm. If one spits everywhere, then the seeds of tuberculosis that they spread, making it difficult for people to defend against, are in effect engaging in widespread indirect killing. Its danger is actually more dangerous and terrifying than a tangible bomb!

Especially in winter, because the temperature is low and the air is dry, phlegm and nasal discharge dry instantly after landing on the ground and are carried by dust. The tubercle bacilli contained within take the air as a means of invasion. Its invasion of the human body is probably faster than the modern war's most powerful blitzkrieg tactics. This is how serious a threat it is to public health, it is simply unimaginable and indescribable.

Therefore, when winter comes, we sincerely ask friends who have a lot of phlegm and nasal discharge to always carry one or two large handkerchiefs when going out, so that phlegm can be spat into the handkerchief, and when there is nasal discharge or sneezing, the handkerchief can be used to cover the nose. This is not only a public virtue, but also a way to carry out a campaign to clean up phlegm and nasal discharge in winter, which is also a great deed for public health!

Supplementation Experiences: In the past two or three years, new supplements have emerged like a whirlwind. Based on the author's experience, the only one that truly deserves to be called outstanding in terms of "quality," "quantity," and "effectiveness" is "Shou Er Kang." Since I started taking this medicine, my body has become stronger and stronger, and I feel energetic and happy all day long. All kinds of aging phenomena in the past have now been swept away. As the saying goes, "experience often exceeds knowledge." Based on my personal experience, I will introduce it without avoiding suspicion, acting as an experienced guide for those who are taking supplements. (Hua)

A word for those taking cod liver oil essence: Halivita cod liver oil essence (available in capsule and drop form) contains one hundred times more Vitamin D than cod liver oil. It is carefully manufactured by Hans Pharmaceutical Company, a specialist in cod liver oil products in the United States (Health Products Corp., Newark, N.J. U.S.A.). The scale of the factory is huge and is rare even in the United States. Its biochemical laboratory is larger than any American medical university or hospital. The cod liver oil warehouse often stores more than 77,000 tons. In terms of refining technology, in addition to hiring first-class pharmacists and technicians, it also employs government medical experts and professors from various medical universities as permanent consultants, and raises more than 2,000 mice and 1,500 chickens for biological experiments. The refining process takes more than two years before it is sold in the market, which shows the excellence of its products and the accuracy of its ingredients. Halivita has been verified by the US government to contain 60,000 US units of Vitamin A and 1,000 US units of Vitamin D per cubic centimeter. The Vitamin D content of the drops is richer than that of the capsules, containing 60,000 US units of Vitamin A and 6,000 US units of Vitamin D per cubic centimeter, which is especially suitable for children, pregnant women, and lactating women.
