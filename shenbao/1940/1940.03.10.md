### Chen Shaoyu on Democratic Politics

Chongqing: Wang Ming, also known as Chen Shaoyu, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article in the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily today, discussing democratic politics. He said that merely convening the National Assembly to formulate a constitution cannot be considered the implementation of constitutional government or democratic politics. He also said that true democratic politics has two essential conditions: first, the people must have freedom, including freedom of publication, speech, assembly, association, belief, and thought; second, all legitimate activities, political parties, and groups that support democratic politics have the right to exist legally; third, there must be people's congresses automatically elected by the people in all parts of the country. If these three things do not exist in reality, then no matter how beautifully it is said, it is self-deception. Therefore, the constitutional government that the Chinese people are currently striving to achieve and demand is a National Assembly that truly represents the people, a constitution that truly represents the will of the people and protects the rights and interests of the people, and a constitutional government that can truly implement democratic politics.

### One Week of Battle Situation: March 2nd to 8th

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the Chinese army on all fronts has continued to inflict damage on the stubborn Japanese in the past week. The war is progressing extremely smoothly. The Japanese are overwhelmed and struggling. The frequent anti-war riots in their country and the declining morale of the front lines are becoming increasingly intense. Their foolish attempts to struggle desperately will be gradually crushed by the Chinese. Regarding the course of the battle, the more important aspects are approximately as follows:

Southern Guangxi

The Chinese army was originally in a standoff with the Japanese near Canshibu, Gaofeng'ao, and Santang on the outskirts of Nanning. On the 6th, the Chinese army rose up to attack the Japanese, advancing on Santang and driving the remaining Japanese to the vicinity of Ertang. The Japanese were extremely panicked and automatically destroyed the public works south of Santang and Gaofeng'ao. South of the Yu River, the Chinese party defeated the Japanese who attacked Shangsi and took advantage of the victory to advance, successively capturing Liangqing and other places, giving the Japanese a relentless pursuit and annihilation, and seizing huge gains.

Guangdong Area

On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese troops on the southern route launched a large-scale attack on the Chinese army on Hainan Island in four directions. After being met with mobile counterattacks, they were severely damaged near Wenyacun, north of Xincun, and in various areas in the near suburbs of Dan County. The Japanese offensive was greatly frustrated, and the remaining Japanese troops are hesitating and faltering in the high mountains, having fallen into a dilemma of advancing or retreating. At this moment, their return route has been cut off. Japanese troops who attacked Zhongshan landed and attacked at Tangjiawan (east of Zhongshan County) and Xiangzhou (south of Tangjiawan) on the morning of the 5th, covered by many Japanese aircraft. After the Chinese separately surrounded and fiercely attacked them, the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. At this moment, they are still being annihilated. At the same time, strongholds such as Guanyao, Xinjie, and the southwest of Sanshui in northwestern Guangzhou were repeatedly stormed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army also broke into Zengcheng in eastern Guangdong and defeated the Japanese who attacked Chenghai. The Japanese army, trapped in Guangzhou, is threatened by the Chinese on all sides. Military morale is wavering, and anti-war incidents are occurring one after another, leading to a state of self-destruction.

Hubei Province

In the past week, the Chinese army has been engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army at the foot of the Dahong, Tongbai, and Dabie Mountains, achieving successive victories. One route crossed the Xiang River to the east and advanced towards Zhongxiang, Jingshan, and Tianmen counties. On the 4th, a unit stormed into Tianmen, with the vanguard reaching the suburbs of each county, completely controlling the Hanyi Road. Another route defeated the Japanese who attacked Mopan Mountain from Luotuo Town in southern Henan and recovered the strongholds of Hejiadian and Xinqiao south of Suixian, attacking the South Gate and killing countless Japanese soldiers. At this moment, the important areas surrounding the county seat are under the control of the Chinese army. Another route defeated the Japanese army that attacked Baliwan, taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Macheng, burning down a Japanese barracks and driving all the Japanese out of the suburbs. The Japanese, who had been foolishly attempting to move towards the Dahong, Tongbai, and Dabie Mountains, were unable to do so.

Jiangsu and Anhui

After Lanxi and Liyang in the south were recovered by the Chinese army, they continued to advance in recent days, giving the defeated Japanese a fierce pursuit with rapid progress. The Chinese army in southern Jiangsu successively captured Litouqiao and Shanghebu, and the Japanese retreated to Tianwangtang. Another unit captured Dongliuzhen, and the Japanese retreated to Hongbu. On the Anhui side, the Chinese army captured Xinhezhuang, and the Japanese army retreated towards Wanzhi. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to attack Datong, killing many Japanese soldiers. Soon, over two thousand Japanese soldiers from Wan and Che launched a counterattack towards the Xinhezhuang area. After the Chinese launched a multi-pronged attack, six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese fled immediately. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Mingguang in northern Anhui had attacked Dingyuan, and the Chinese bravely fought back. As of the evening of the 4th, they were still fighting. As for the Japanese warships that had entered Anhui, they were bombarded by the Chinese army on the river surface in the Dongliu and Anqing areas in recent days, and over ten ships were sunk, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. Japanese water transportation cannot be restored.

Southern Shanxi

The war has gradually intensified in the past week. The Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi once stormed into Changzi, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese and killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in various strongholds west of the Fen River in western Shanxi were repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and retreated successively. At this moment, Heilongguan, Linfen, Hongdong, Zhao City, Hejin, and Xinjiang are still under Chinese siege. Quanzhang, an important point northwest of Xinjiang, has already been recovered. The Japanese who attacked Puxian were defeated by the Chinese army, and at this moment, there are no traces of the Japanese near Puxian.

Henan Province

The Chinese army also repeatedly frustrated the stubborn Japanese in Bo'ai, Zhongmu, and Xinyang, and once stormed into Zhongmu, killing many Japanese soldiers.

Western Suiyuan

The Chinese army continued to besiege Wuyuan and destroyed over ten Japanese vehicles that had been reinforced by Guyang to Baotou. There were fierce battles in Xincheng, Gu'an, Yongqing, and Wuqing on both sides of the Pingjin Road, killing over a thousand people. The Japanese in Pingjin were extremely shaken.

Shandong Province

The Chinese have been fiercely attacking the Japanese in Laiwu, Linqu, Pingtai, Taian, and Feixian, achieving successive triumphs. Japanese traffic on the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways has been cut off from time to time.

Northern Hunan

The Chinese stormed into the Japanese camp in Yanglousi.

Jiangnan

The Chinese are eliminating the remaining Japanese soldiers on Chongming Island. These are all important war updates in the past week. (Telegram of the 9th)

### Anti-British Movement in Weihaiwei Revives Again

Weihaiwei: The anti-British movement in Weihaiwei has been dormant for some time, but it has suddenly revived after the Japanese launched a campaign to cleanse the guerrillas in the Jiaodong area. The so-called Jiaodong area includes the entire eastern part of the Shandong Peninsula. Slogans and colorful paper banners against Britain and illustrations depicting the extraction of fat from India and China are now found everywhere in Weihaiwei. One slogan reads: "Those who hope for early peace, national liberation, and Asian prosperity should immediately rise up and overthrow Britain." Another slogan reads: "Britain is the common enemy of the Asian people. To promote the prosperity of East Asia and the new China, Britain must be dealt with first." (Reuters telegram of the 9th)

### Chongqing Municipal Government Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices

Chongqing: The municipal authorities here have recently been actively engaged in two measures: one is the control of prices, and the other is the evacuation of the people. Regarding the control of prices, the authorities have now adopted the strictest methods to deal with speculators. At the same time, the government has stipulated the selling prices of all daily necessities. Businesses that violate this law will be sealed off without exception. Regarding the evacuation of the population, notices have been posted all over the city, advising people to evacuate voluntarily. Otherwise, coercive measures will be taken. In order to make it easier for people to evacuate, the Chongqing municipality has closed down several cinemas. However, the reasons why people are still hesitant are, firstly, the inconvenience of transportation and, secondly, the difficulty of finding suitable accommodation.

Editorial

### Prospect of British and Italian Coal Interception Dispute

Recently, the military situation in Europe and the West has remained relatively quiet, but the economic war is showing signs of increasing tension. In order to intensify the economic blockade against Germany, Britain has strictly prohibited the export of all German goods, and has therefore announced that German coal destined for Italy is also on the list of prohibited items and should be detained. As a result, several Italian coal ships sailing from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were intercepted during British naval inspections. Since the issue arose, the Italian government has protested to the British government, arguing that this British action is in conflict with the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938 and has a significant impact on Italy's economic development. It also believes that current international law provides for the protection of the commercial interests of neutral countries, and that the British government's inspection and interception of Italian coal purchases violates the spirit of international law. The British government is expected to respond to this protest within days. According to yesterday's reports, the British wording is extremely mild, but its argument states that the British King's decree treats everyone equally, and that such measures were implemented during the last European war, when Italy handled it in parallel, so there is a precedent to follow. It is expected that Ribbentrop's visit to Italy at this time will inevitably have some impact on Italy's attitude towards Britain. It is very possible that this event will become a fuse, affecting Italy and the future of the European war.

Among the major European powers, Italy has the greatest shortage of coal, with domestic production amounting to only about 2 million tons per year. Moreover, the quality of the coal is poor and cannot be used in important industries, so it must be purchased from foreign countries. During the last European war, Italy's coal supply problem was already serious, let alone today, 25 years later, when Italy's industrialization has greatly increased, and the need and consumption of coal has naturally increased dramatically. According to recent statistics, the total amount of coal imported by Italy from foreign countries is about 12 million to 13 million tons per year. Now that the imported German coal has been detained, it certainly cannot be seen as a complete interruption of the source of coal needed by Italy, or even lead to serious difficulties in economic production and national life? But it cannot be seen as a profound stimulus to Italy.

Originally, Italy obtained more than half of its required coal from Germany and Austria; for example, in 1938, Italy imported 12 million tons of coal, of which 7 million tons came from Germany and Austria; in addition, 1.6 million tons were imported from Poland and 540,000 tons from Czechoslovakia. Now that Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have all fallen under the direct jurisdiction of Germany, it can be said that Italy depends on Germany for about 80 percent of its needs. When the war broke out, Germany, on the one hand, faced a surge in its own needs, and on the other hand, encountered some practical transportation difficulties in transporting coal to Italy, but there were also other factors that allowed the supply and demand between Germany and Italy to be maintained with effort, without interruption. Now, in order to intensify the economic war against Germany, Britain has intercepted Italian coal ships on the high seas and conducted inspections to prevent transportation, with the intention of hitting German trade, not making things difficult for Italy. However, coal is essential for economic production and national life, especially for heavy industry, and it cannot be short or interrupted for a day. Therefore, it is possible to find other ways to replenish the supply after the detention, but the immediate impact can be regarded as extremely serious. The Italian government is currently adopting a calm and silent attitude, awaiting the British government's reply to decide on future actions. It is extremely difficult to predict how future actions will be decided, but it would not be surprising to take any action under this pretext.

We do not need to speculate on how Italy will act for the time being, and we may as well think in the most amicable way. Even though the sea route for coal transportation between Germany and Italy has been blocked by Britain, there is still a land transport line between Germany and Italy, so it is not impossible to transport German coal to Italy. However, examining past statistics, the railway transportation between Germany and Italy has a very small limit. It is very difficult for the two countries to increase the volume of coal transported by rail, because neither Germany nor Italy has a large number of heavy-duty freight cars that can be used to transport coal. Moreover, the Alps traverse between them, and the railway transportation line is hindered by this natural obstacle and cannot carry a large amount of coal. Historically, coal from Upper Silesia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia has been transported to Italy via sea routes in Gdynia, Stettin, or Hamburg. If we consider taking the long way around, taking the slow way instead of the fast way, taking the sea instead of the land, and doing so with all kinds of uneconomical measures, then the difficulty of transporting coal by rail can be imagined. Although the dramatic changes in the political situation in Europe over the past year have brought Germany and Italy closer together in space, if efforts are made to improve the railway equipment and efficiency of Bohemia and Austria, it is politically possible and indeed much more convenient than a year ago; in this case, the volume of land transportation between Germany and Italy should be expected to increase dramatically. However, Germany has already exhausted its resources for the war, and it is said that it is struggling to maintain all its transportation infrastructure, which shows signs of being stretched thin. Therefore, it is difficult and untimely to plan improvements and new construction in order to expand transportation to Italy, even if it is possible. From this point of view, one may come to the opposite conclusion, that Italy may prepare to improve its commercial agreement with Britain in a neutral posture, thereby obtaining the coal it needs, which is not entirely impossible.

During wartime, diplomatic disputes between belligerent countries and neutral countries are a very common phenomenon. It is not surprising that Britain's prevention of German coal from being exported to Italy has led to a dispute with Italy. As for the current Italy, its international policy is so-called non-participation in the war, which has a subtle difference in meaning from general neutrality. At the same time, the foundation of the German-Italian axis still exists, and Italy can make the most of its special status and opportunities, taking its own interests as the premise in everything. This certainly cannot be said to be that Italy can make the most of its trickery and do whatever it wants, because the wartime weaknesses of Britain and France and the general weaknesses of Italy are also difficult to compare and judge which is more advantageous. Moreover, the true strength of Germany and the Soviet Union has no credible estimate at all, and the military situation on the Western Front is stagnant, so it is difficult to see the outcome. Therefore, Italy urgently needs coal. Although it is not entirely impossible that the relationship with Britain will deteriorate to the point of no return due to the coal detention, it is not an inevitable trend.

Correction: In the second batch, lines 22 and 23 of the editorial on the 8th, "cultivated by the free war," is a mistake for "cultivated by liberalism," which is specially corrected.

### U.S. Secretary of State's Talk - Purpose of Loans to China - To Promote Trade Between the Two Countries - Rumor That China Is Trying to Contact the U.S. - Third Loan of 55 Million

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the U.S. is lending China a new loan of US$20 million. The purpose of this loan is to promote U.S. foreign trade. U.S. trade policy stipulates that the Export-Import Bank, a semi-official institution, can lend to certain countries to promote trade between the two countries. When reporters asked Hull to respond to the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement that the U.S. loan to China was an "unfriendly gesture" to Japan, Hull declined to comment further. The Export-Import Bank implemented a loan of US$20 million to China on Thursday. In December 1938, the U.S. first lent China a credit loan of US$25 million. Together with the new loan of US$20 million, the total has reached US$45 million. Recent official documents announced that China has exceeded the amount due on the amortization schedule for the first credit loan. Chinese sources here claim that the new loan will be used to purchase U.S. hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other raw materials necessary for construction. In addition, the U.S. Committee for Aid to Chinese Civilians has raised US$500,000 to purchase medicines for shipment to China. Chen Guangfu, head of the Chinese Purchasing and Finance Mission, said that China will continue to ship tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials necessary for U.S. industry to the U.S. through the Universal Trading Corporation, that is, the above-mentioned exports will repay the U.S. loan. The Universal Trading Corporation will also use the new loan to purchase various goods for the Chinese government. The new loan was allocated from the US$100 million increase in the capital of the Export-Import Bank approved by Congress. Congress also amended the foreign loan law, stipulating that the loan to each foreign government be reduced from US$30 million to US$20 million. Well-informed sources here claim that China is trying to borrow another US$55 million from the U.S., which, together with the first US$25 million and the current US$20 million, totals US$100 million. It is reported that the future loan will be divided into two batches, the first batch being US$25 million and the second batch being US$30 million. At that time, Congress will have to amend the foreign loan law again to allow the Export-Import Bank to lend China the required loan. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

Washington - According to sources in Tokyo, the Japanese government believes that the U.S. loan of US$20 million to China is an "unfriendly action" to Japan. Regarding this matter, Secretary of State Hull declared that this loan is in accordance with the regulations for lending to foreign countries and promoting trade, and does not know why it is unfriendly to Japan. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 9th)

Chongqing - This morning, the Central Daily News editorial said that the establishment of a US$20 million loan between the U.S. and China on the eve of the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "new regime" is no less important than a million U.S. soldiers fighting side by side with China in China. The significance of this loan is far beyond that of ordinary international loans. The U.S. Export-Import Bank had already lent China US$25 million. According to regulations, it could no longer continue to lend. Therefore, the U.S. government specially ignored the trouble and passed a new law so that this new loan could be established. Since the expiration of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty, the U.S. has not only not extended the old treaty, but also not taken steps to negotiate a new treaty. The consistent sympathy of the U.S. President, the public, and all parties in Congress for China is evident here. This move was realized on the eve of the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "new regime" and should be a serious warning to Japan. If Japan changes its policy in China, third parties may continue to take "unfriendly and unpleasant" actions. The value of this new loan in terms of spiritual encouragement is actually greater than its material value. This kind of sympathy and friendship from the U.S. gives China greater confidence in the final victory. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)

### Japan Worried and Indignant About U.S. Huge Loan to China - Discussed U.S. Armed Intervention - Tokyo Newspaper Urges Attention to Current Trends

Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" here wrote today that the U.S. loan of US$20 million to China and the refusal to renew the new trade treaty with Japan have caused the U.S. to lose all rights and qualifications as a mediator in the Sino-Japanese war. The newspaper continued, saying that Japan's only response to U.S. mediation is that Japan's policy towards the U.S. will adopt the same attitude as Germany and Italy towards the U.S. As far as we know, Germany and Italy do not think it is very appropriate for the U.S. to mediate in Europe, because the U.S. has more sympathy for the democratic group. Also, newspapers here today criticized U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' visit to Europe as a failure. The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that there is no possibility of mediation between the Allied countries and Germany at present. The "Kokumin Shimbun" also believes that Welles' arrival in London may discuss the Far East issue with the British government, arousing the attention of people all over the world. However, the newspaper also believes that it is difficult for the U.S. to take the position of mediator. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial, stating briefly that the U.S. assistance to the Nationalist government has the sole purpose of defeating Japan. The U.S. government has notified Japan that it will abolish the U.S.-Japan trade treaty. Currently, the U.S. Export-Import Bank has lent China 20 million gold and continues to threaten Japan. The Japanese government has been forced to strengthen its national defense and find ways to eliminate its economic dependence on the U.S. Japan knows that when the U.S. cannot achieve its goals through economic pressure, it will resort to military intervention. The strengthening of the U.S. Navy is a clear indication. Japan should immediately recognize that as the U.S. gradually advances its East Asia policy, the U.S. attitude of hostility towards Japan is also increasing. Japan should give serious consideration to this trend in its current China policy. (Haitong dispatch on the 9th)

Tokyo - Today's Asahi Shimbun commented on the U.S. aid to the Chinese government, saying that in the current session of the Japanese Diet, there was a serious discussion about the U.S. intention to intervene in the China incident not only on the basis of conditions and disputes, but also by relying on the power of true force. The government authorities have done everything possible to prepare for any new developments. It also said that the more actively Japan promotes its work to build a "new order," the more the U.S. will make greater efforts to obstruct the progress of this work and will more frankly express its hostile attitude towards Japan. In Japan's current China policy, serious consideration should be given to this trend. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)

### Japan Claims Policy Toward East Asia Remains Unchanged - Will Dispatch Special Envoy to China - To Negotiate With "Wang Regime"

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today carried reports stating that the Japanese government will issue a document next week explaining that Japan's policy of "building a new order in East Asia" is based on the document issued by Fumimaro Konoe on December 22, 1938. The document advocates Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, friendly relations between the two countries, and joint anti-communism. It is said that this time, the Japanese government's document will be announced by Japanese Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai on March 15 at the opening of the "Central Political Conference" in Nanjing. The conference will make the final plans for the construction of the new "Central Government" led by Wang Jingwei. Japanese newspapers claim that Yonai will announce at that time that Japan's invasion of China, which caused hundreds of thousands of Chinese people to lose their lives and property, is not a war of aggression. Yonai will reiterate the Japanese government's determination to support the "Wang Regime" to be established in Nanjing. The Japanese will soon select a special envoy to attend the establishment of the "Wang Regime" in Nanjing next month. The special envoy will hold negotiations with the "Jiang Regime" to try to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. The highest calls for candidates for the special envoy are former Prime Minister Hirota Koki and General Abe Nobuyuki. General Abe will go to Shanghai this month. The position of the first special envoy sent by Japan to the "Nanjing Regime" was originally intended to be filled by Fumimaro Konoe, but he refused to accept it. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

### Problem of Foreign Debt of Chinese Railways - Discussed in Japanese House of Representatives

Tokyo - At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, questions were raised about the status of foreign loans secured by Chinese railways. Hidakazu, the Economic Minister of the Asian Court, replied that the Chinese railways are all operated by companies jointly run by China and Japan. The Japanese side invests in cash and materials, while the Chinese side invests in cash. Negotiations on foreign loans secured by the railways are a matter for the Chinese government. Japan believes that any negotiations should be handled by the Chinese government. Someone then asked whether Japan intends to return the railways after the China incident is resolved and before formal negotiations on the future status of the railways begin. Hidakazu replied that the companies managing the Chinese railways are enterprises jointly run by China and Japan. These railways are the property of the Chinese government. The Japanese government hopes to clarify the relationship between railway sovereignty and Japan's payments to the Chinese government for its railway operations, so as to avoid any concerns about Japan's position regarding railway affairs.

### Japanese Army in Northern Manchuria - Hastily Building Works - To Prevent Soviet Attack

Changchun - According to a report obtained here from Heihe, senior Japanese army commanders in northern "Manchukuo" are now hastily building defensive works to prevent a Soviet attack. It is said that the "Manchukuo" budget for developing the north in 1940 is 3,180,000 yuan. The first step is to rush to build highways so that the Japanese army can concentrate completely in a short period of time. It is found that the 1940 budget increased by 1,024,000 yuan compared with last year, and the total amount reached 3,181,000 yuan. Of this, 2,119,000 yuan is used for the development of transportation, and the rest is used for agricultural education and other items. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

### France Takes a Tough Stance Toward Japan - "Bangkok Maru" Incident - France Decides to Reject Japanese Protest

Paris - Well-informed sources here declared that if the Japanese side protests about the detention of mail on the "Bangkok Maru," the French side will refuse and reject it. Currently, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Hanoi has lodged an oral protest, but a formal protest from the Japanese Embassy here has not yet been received. At the same time, the French authorities have notified the Japanese transport company here that all mail must be inspected in the future. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

### Japanese Legislator Exposes Corruption in Internal Affairs - Paid for 33 Years - Telegraph Bureau Still Doesn't Install Telephone

Tokyo - Japanese legislator Kojima gave a shocking speech in the Diet the other day. According to Kojima, "He paid the Telegraph Bureau 15 yuan 33 years ago to request the installation of a telephone. He has been waiting for 33 years, but the telephone has not yet been installed. According to statistics, 100,000 houses and shops have paid 15 yuan and submitted applications for telephone installation to the Telegraph Bureau, but the results have not obtained telephones. After the Telegraph Bureau received 1.5 million yuan, it still made no statement. If the Telegraph Bureau is a private institution, I would have sued long ago. Imagine that I paid the Telegraph Bureau 15 yuan 33 years ago. If I had deposited this money in the bank, wouldn't I have become a rich man long ago? In 1907, I was still a young man, but now I have become an old man with white hair. If the Telegraph Bureau continues this policy of delay, I will have to make a will and declare that I will leave this telephone for my children and grandchildren to enjoy." (United Press dispatch on the 9th)

### Tokyo Newspapers Advocate Reorganization of the Diet - Aftermath of Saito Issue - Split of Japanese Socialist Party

Tokyo - The case of Minseito Party member Fujio's "slip of the tongue" has been disturbing for more than a month. Finally, the House of Representatives decided to expel him. An extraordinary wave has subsided. However, the newspapers feel tired of the situation in the House of Representatives and believe that parliamentary politics has completely failed. The extreme nationalist "Kokumin Shimbun" advocates dissolving all political parties and replacing them with a powerful, all-encompassing one-party system, presided over by the military and nationalists. The "Hochi Shimbun" calls for the dissolution of bad political parties. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that in view of the current international situation, it is necessary to properly reorganize the House of Representatives. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

Tokyo - The Social Democratic Party discussed the issue of Saito Takao's punishment. At that time, party leader Abe Kio and Suzuki Bunji, Koya Chozo, Nishio Suehiro, Okazaki Ken, Katayama Tetsu, Yonezawa Mitsuru, Matsunaga Yoshio, Tomikichi Eiji, Matsumoto Jihachiro and other ten people expressed opposition to the mainstream opinion of the party headquarters, which stimulated the young guards. When the party held a meeting of representatives on the 8th, the idle and comfortable sentiment was to advise the other nine people besides the party leader Abe to leave the party, and asked the nine people to reply within nine days. As a result of discussions today, Katayama Tetsu and the other nine people have refused the party's advice. (Daimen Alliance dispatch on the 9th)

### Tense Anglo-Italian Relations Strike: German Foreign Minister Suddenly Visits Rome to Exchange Important Opinions on the European Situation and Attempt to Re-Establish a Strong Axis Relationship

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left this morning at 9:15 AM (4:15 PM Shanghai time) by special train for Rome. He was accompanied by few personnel. According to well-informed sources, Finnish President Svinhufvud, who had arrived here suddenly yesterday, did not travel to Rome on the same train. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)

Berlin: German radio announced that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed by train for Rome today to exchange views with Italy, accompanied by economic expert Clodius, legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry Kost, Treaty Director Dueneburg, intelligence chief Schmidt, and a large number of secretaries. The first secretary of the Italian Embassy in Berlin, Zapponi, also traveled along. (Reuters, 9th)

Berlin: Political figures here declared that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed by train for Rome today to discuss the general European political situation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, especially various issues related to Germany and Italy. Political figures pointed out that last autumn, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano came to Berlin and conferred with Hitler and Ribbentrop on the overall situation. Ribbentrop's trip this time is of the same nature as Ciano's visit last autumn. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)

Berlin: Since German radio announced the news that the Foreign Minister would go to Rome, there has been much discussion. Foreign observers in Berlin believe that Ribbentrop will directly inform Mussolini of the overall situation in Northern Europe and Germany's position. Some neutral figures in Berlin believe that Ribbentrop will undoubtedly put pressure on Mussolini to take active actions related to the war or the spring offensive on the German side. It is also said that Ribbentrop's trip is related to the return of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to the United States via Rome, as it was rumored a week ago that Hitler was eager for Welles to have the impression of the unity of the Rome-Berlin axis. (Reuters, 9th)

Berlin: General Göring's mouthpiece, the "Essener National Zeitung," recently published a commentary on the Foreign Minister's visit to Rome today, stating that Germany and Italy will never allow the reactionary forces of the Allies to obstruct the ideal of building Europe. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome will discuss the unchanging common goals of National Socialism and Fascism with the Italian authorities, just like the talks conducted by important German and Italian figures many times before. The newspaper concluded its essay by saying that after the end of the Polish war, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited Berlin and held talks with the head of state Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Several months have passed, and now Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is going to Italy to exchange views with the Italian authorities. After the talks are over, the world situation will undergo a decisive change. (Haitong Agency, 9th)

Rome: After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here, all newspapers commented on it, saying that this is the inevitable result of maintaining the "steel axis" between Germany and Italy. The semi-official "Popolo d'Italia" stated that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's sudden arrival here is actually a consequence of the central government's improper handling of German coal measures. He probably wants to use this extraordinary situation to re-establish close relations between Germany and Italy. (Havas, 9th)

Rome: Although rumors of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy had been circulating for some time, it was unexpected that it would happen so quickly. Few Italians knew about it last night. People see Ribbentrop's visit as due to the international situation reaching a critical point. According to political circles, it is not surprising that the two axis powers maintain close contact in times of emergency, and many problems need to be resolved now. It is reasonable for Ribbentrop to personally consult with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Foreign observers, however, link Ribbentrop's visit to Italy with an unverified report from Danzig that former Finnish President Svinhufvud will arrive in Rome tomorrow, believing that Ribbentrop will explain Germany's attitude towards the Finnish issue to Mussolini, that is, Germany does not allow foreign intervention in the Soviet-Finnish war. It is hoped that Mussolini may mediate and achieve a truce in the Soviet-Finnish war because Italy is eager to avoid the expansion of the scope of the war. Other political observers say that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is currently holding talks in several European capitals and will come to Italy again soon, and Ribbentrop's early arrival is probably related to this. (Reuters, 9th)

### Hitler Will Deliver a Speech Today

Berlin: Today's announcement stated that Head of State Hitler will deliver a speech to the German people tomorrow afternoon (7:00 PM Shanghai time). Tomorrow is Germany's War Memorial Day, and a memorial ceremony will be held for the German officers and soldiers who died in the previous World War and the current European War. Hitler will also go to the War Memorial and personally lay a wreath. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)

### The Pope Will Receive the German Foreign Minister

Rome: Pope Pius XII will receive German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 9:00 AM on the 11th. (Haitong Agency, 9th)

Rome: "Padano Post" recently reported that German Prince Hessen, the son-in-law of King Amedeo of Italy, has arrived here. This person, as Hitler's confidant, has previously contacted the Italian authorities on important matters. (Havas, 8th)

### Welles in Paris, Meets with Important French Political Figures and Holds Talks with Polish Government Authorities. Welles is Scheduled to Fly to London Today.

Paris: U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles was quite busy yesterday, meeting with six or seven important French politicians separately. In the morning, he secretly met with Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Herriot and Speaker of the Senate Blum, and then talked with Deputy Prime Minister Chautemps for an hour and a half. Then he went to see Justice Minister Pomaret. This morning, Welles also had lunch with Finance Minister Reynaud. When Welles flies to London on Sunday, he will be escorted by a French military plane. After Welles arrives in London, he will visit British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Labour Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood, and Liberal Party leader Sinclair. (Reuters, 9th)

Paris: U.S. State Department official Welles met with Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski at the Polish Embassy here this afternoon. (Reuters, 9th)

Moscow: Regarding the content of Hitler's talks with Welles on March 3, as reported by the Associated Press, the German Embassy in the Soviet Union issued the following statement: "Regarding the rumors about the negotiations between U.S. Special Envoy Welles in Berlin, reliable German sources state that both sides are still firmly committed to maintaining the lie of not publicly disclosing the details of the negotiations. Therefore, the content reported by foreign newspapers is purely fabricated, and its purpose is to create distrust between Germany and the United States and to mislead the world about Germany's war goals. (TASS, 9th)

### Detention of Coal Issue: Anglo-Italian Negotiations Hope to Be Resolved Smoothly: British Reply Being Drafted

London: Diplomatic figures here recently stated that Italian Ambassador to Britain Bastianini visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon and held talks with him, discussing the issue of German coal being detained. The process was very harmonious, and it is believed that this case can be resolved smoothly. (Havas, 9th)

London: Regarding the dispute between Britain and Italy over the coal issue, after the Italian government protested, the British government is now drafting a reply, which will be sent out within days. It is said that the wording is very friendly, but it will state that in accordance with the order issued by King George VI in November last year, all German export goods must be detained. In addition, according to well-informed sources, the Anglo-Italian economic negotiations have only been temporarily suspended and have not broken down. (Havas, 9th)

The Hague: Four Italian ships are still anchored in the port of Rotterdam and have just received instructions from the government to stop loading German coal. (Havas, 8th)

### Molotov's 50th Birthday: Soviet Presidium Awards Medals: Several Districts, Towns, Schools, and Factories Named After Molotov: People's Committee Establishes Molotov Scholarship

Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, considering that People's Commissar Molotov has made great contributions to organizing the Bolshevik Party and consolidating the Soviet state, has awarded him the Order of Lenin on his 50th birthday and made the following decisions: (1) In accordance with the will of the Pam regional public group, the Pam district and town will be renamed Molotov District and Town; (2) In accordance with the will of the various public groups in the Norilsk District, the district will be renamed Molotovsk District and Town; (3) The Smolensk Military and Political School and the Gorky Anti-Aircraft Artillery Specialized School will be renamed after Molotov; (4) The Taglau Factory will be renamed Molotov Factory (this change is based on the request of the engineers and workers of the factory). (TASS, 9th)

Moscow: The Soviet People's Committee, in commemoration of Molotov's 50th birthday, decided to establish 300 "Molotov Scholarships" to be awarded to outstanding students in higher education institutions. (TASS, 9th)

Molotov's Life Story

Moscow Molotov was born in March 1890 in the town of Kukarka (Vyatka Province). In 1902, he entered the Kazan Middle School to study. In 1905, he began his revolutionary work, participating in various anti-Imperial Russia rallies and demonstrations. In 1906, he joined the Bolshevik Party. During the difficult period from 1908 to 1912,

In April 1909, he was arrested and exiled to Vologda Province for two years. In 1911, he regained his freedom and entered the St. Petersburg Academy to study. In 1912, he began working for the News. He was one of the editors of Pravda and wrote many great articles. During this period, he had his first meeting with Stalin and participated in the Duma election campaign, guiding the Bolshevik Party in the Duma.

In 1913 and 1914, he was arrested and exiled twice and ordered not to reside in industrial areas and cities again. After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, he arrived in Moscow and reorganized the Moscow Bolshevik organs. In 1915, he was arrested again and exiled to the Menshevik region of Ukrzhe Province for three years, but in 1916, he escaped and returned to Leningrad to continue his revolutionary work. In the autumn of 1916, he served on the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party and directed the revolutionary movement, preparing for the February Revolution of 1917.

After the success of the October Revolution, he became one of the leaders of the Leningrad Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. In early 1918, he served as Chairman of the Northern National Economic Department. In the summer of 1919, he was appointed as the party and government representative of the Volga region. At the end of 1919, he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Nizhny Novgorod Province. In September 1920, he was appointed Secretary of the Party Committee of the Donets region. In November of the same year, he was appointed Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. In 1921, he was elected Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party. In 1926, he was appointed as a member of the Political Bureau of the committee.

From 1921 to 1930, he served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. On December 19, 1930, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee. He has made great contributions to the construction of the Soviet state. In various developments, he contributed new methods to the country and guided them to success. The development of Soviet industry is largely due to Molotov. Trotsky, Bukharin, and other enemies of the Soviet Union attempted to economically enslave the Soviet Union, but their efforts were defeated by Molotov. He was a major participant in the implementation of Stalin's Five-Year Plan. In 1939, he was re-appointed as Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs. Although he was in an extremely complex international situation, he solved many historical problems. The non-aggression and friendship pact signed between the Soviet Union and Germany has shattered the conspiracy of Britain and France to force the Soviet Union into war. At the same time, the Soviet Union has signed mutual assistance pacts with Latvia, Estonia, and other countries. As a result of the Soviet Union's conclusion of a mutual assistance pact with the Finnish People's Government, the crisis of the Finnish Self-Defense Forces attacking Leningrad has been eliminated. (TASS, 9th)

### Rumors of Soviet Mobilization of Young Men

Stockholm: "Svenska Dagbladet" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in the capital of Estonia, stating that Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov has ordered mobilization, including all young men under the age of 35 in the northern part of the country. This move is enough to make people everywhere suspect that Britain and France intend to wage war against the Soviet Union. (Havas, 9th)

### Finland Striving for Glorious and Lasting Peace with All Its Might: Stockholm and Moscow Become Centers of Diplomatic Activity: Peace Negotiations Now Reaching a Critical Stage

Sweden: The official content of the demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland via Sweden has not yet been announced. It is reported that it includes a request to cede the Hanko Peninsula, which Finnish figures indicate cannot be accepted under any circumstances. If the Soviet Union insists on this demand, the war will inevitably continue. Political figures in Sweden, however, believe that "glorious and lasting peace" can be guaranteed, and the Finnish government will certainly not give in. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)

Stockholm: Finnish negotiations are expected to enter the final stage today. The Soviet Union now appears to insist that peace conditions be decided first, and then a truce be announced. When the Finnish side was still in the early stages of exclusive negotiations, it had already requested a truce. It is learned here that before the start of the negotiations, the Swedish authorities constantly worked to establish a foothold between the two sides, which lasted for many weeks, as both sides feared being seen as showing weakness in their preparations. (Reuters, 9th)

Helsinki: Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, according to reliable sources, the Finnish government will not issue a public statement before the 11th of this month. As for the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, the cabinet members have roughly the same understanding and are carefully considering whether to accept them or not. From the perspective of the military situation, the resistance of the Finnish army has not collapsed and is continuing to fight on the Karelian Isthmus and the frozen waters of the Gulf of Finland. Well-informed sources say that the Finnish representatives went to Moscow to explore the views of the Soviet government, and formal negotiations have not yet begun. As for the talks held by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop with former Finnish President Svinhufvud in Berlin yesterday, political circles did not initially attach importance to them because Svinhufvud had retired from politics many years ago. (Havas, 9th)

Paris: According to the latest news, the Finnish delegation, led by Minister Without Portfolio Paasikivi, is conducting talks with the Soviet government in Moscow. Former Finnish President Svinhufvud has also gone to Berlin. In addition, according to various sources, famous Finnish industrialist Gallen is also working for peace. Gallen recently returned to Europe from the Bahamas in the West Indies via the United States, traveled on the Italian liner "Rex" with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, and maintained close contact with Welles. (Havas, 8th)

Paris: According to sources here, the representatives of Finland participating in the Moscow talks are Foreign Minister Erkko and Mr. Paasikivi, who engaged in Soviet-Finnish negotiations before the war. (Reuters, 9th)

London: According to a cashless telegram from Helsinki, former Finnish President Svinhufvud has met with Hitler in Berlin. (Reuters, 9th)

Moscow: Today, the U.S. Embassy and the Swedish Legation here have become centers of diplomatic activity. Ambassadors from various countries have either gone there in person or contacted them by telephone. (Reuters, 9th)

Stockholm: A message from Helsinki states that if the current peace talks fail, the Finnish army will devote all its efforts, supplemented by foreign aid, to take a new initiative. Finnish politicians who were previously in Stockholm have now left. It is reported that former Finnish President Svinhufvud and Paasikivi, who handled pre-war negotiations with the Soviet Union, have also left here. According to observers here, in addition to Finnish government officials and Soviet leaders, there are many parties involved in the peace talks, such as the Finnish army. Any government that accepts conditions not approved by the Finnish army will find itself in a difficult situation, and the attitudes of Germany, Britain, and France are also relevant. This is a factor that Sweden often pays attention to. At the same time, although the wording of the Finnish communiqué is optimistic, the Finnish war situation does not seem to be completely reassuring, as its continued resistance depends on the speed with which it receives effective foreign aid. It was recently stated by officialdom that telephone traffic between Stockholm and various European countries, which was interrupted yesterday to prevent rumors from spreading abroad, has now been restored. (Reuters, 9th)

### "A Mother Who Is Not Free is Dead" - Tragic Words of a Finn

London: "The Times" published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Helsinki stating that if the peace terms are humiliating to the country, most of the people are still determined to defend freedom and independence. "An important person told me that Finland should continue to fight, even if such fighting is tantamount to suicide. Before we die for our country, we should first kill our wives to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy, but before we resort to this last resort, we can still fight for a year. Even if Finland is finally destroyed, this heroic and tragic struggle will surely be remembered for generations to come, and the major powers of Western Europe will be infamous for failing to provide assistance." (Havas, 9th)

### Swedish Official Statement: Only Adopting a Neutral Position: Eager for Finland to Maintain Independence and Freedom: Difficult to Stay Out of a Protracted War

Stockholm: Swedish officials issued a statement yesterday regarding Sweden's mediation of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, declaring that the Swedish government has not put any pressure on Finland, and its work is no more than a diplomatic post office. It is undeniable that Sweden is eager to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Finnish war on terms acceptable to Finland. Sweden is willing to be a technical mediator, transmitting the Soviet proposal to the Finnish government. This request was submitted to the Swedish Minister to the Soviet Union by the Soviet government and has been forwarded to the Finnish government from Stockholm. Swedish political figures attach great importance to the fact that Moscow is having difficulty negotiating with the Helsinki government, because the Soviet Union initially supported the Finnish "People's Government" headed by Kuusinen at the beginning of the war, and now re-opening negotiations with Helsinki means that the "People's Government" is fleeting. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)

Stockholm: Prime Minister Hansson's mouthpiece, "Social-Demokraten," recently published an article on the Soviet-Finnish war, stating that it is in the main interests of the Scandinavian countries to establish a glorious peace between the Soviet Union and Finland so that Finland can maintain its independence and freedom. "The longer the war lasts, the harder it will be for Sweden and the entire Scandinavian Peninsula to stay out of it. If Western countries intervene, we will have little choice but to go along. In short, we know very well what the intentions of 99% of the people will be if we are forced to decide our attitude in the future, but we also know that 99% of the people are eager to avoid this dilemma. As far as the current peace talks are concerned, their nature is very fragile, and this is the reality. Therefore, we cannot be overly optimistic and should continue to support Finland with all our strength and strengthen our country's resistance to the highest limit." (Havas, 8th)

The Hague: "De Telegraaf" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Helsinki stating, "The attitude of Sweden has made the Finnish people feel depressed. They believe that the future of Finland, to a large extent, will be determined by whether Sweden is willing to provide military assistance. As for Sweden's mediation, it is speculated that its intention is to prevent Britain and France from providing large-scale assistance to Finland, so as to avoid Sweden being drawn into the vortex." (Havas, 8th)

London: Swedish figures here recently stated that before mediating the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Swedish government informed the Turkish government of its intention. The Swedish Minister to Britain held talks with the Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Rushdi, last week, which was related to this matter. Diplomatic figures say that apart from what is stated in the newspapers about the peace plan between Finland and the Soviet Union, little is known about its true content. In any case, the power of final decision still rests with Finland. So far, the authorities of that country do not seem to have made any decision. (Havas, 8th)

### The Soviet Union Once Asked Britain to Mediate: But Was Rejected by the British Side

London: Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently stated that ten days ago, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky asked Foreign Office officials whether he would convey the country's peace terms to the Finnish government, but Foreign Office officials believed that the content of the conditions he described was difficult to accept. They only agreed to inform the Finnish government that the Soviet Union had made a peace proposal, but were unwilling to convey it on its behalf. In addition, it is heard that Ambassador Maisky stated to Foreign Office officials that the Soviet Union had not established a political agreement or military alliance treaty with Germany, but Britain still refused to act as a mediator. The ambassador was quite unhappy at the time. As for Sweden's mediation, it is actually the result of the joint pressure of Germany and the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that these countries warned Sweden that the Soviet Union did not originally harbor any ambitions towards the Scandinavian countries, but if Sweden becomes a tool of Britain and France and refuses to put pressure on Finland, then Germany and the Soviet Union will be forced to unite and deal with it. The peace conditions put forward by the Soviet government this time did not involve the demilitarization of the Åland Islands, which was intended to please Sweden. It goes without saying that under this situation of enticement and threat, the Swedish government finally handed over the Soviet peace conditions to Finland. Although the Finnish government was extremely unwelcome, it agreed to send a delegation to Moscow for negotiations at the urging of the Swedish authorities. In short, the Soviet Union clearly wants to end the Finnish war as soon as possible. This is due to the slow progress of military operations and the fear of active intervention by Britain and France. It is unlikely that the country can therefore reduce its demands. In any case, Britain and France are still preparing to step up aid to Finland, but everything is still up to that country to decide. It is regrettable that Sweden, under the direct threat of Germany, has made it difficult for Britain and France to aid Finland with its "neutral policy," and the Finnish government's dilemma can be imagined. (Havas, 8th)

### Moscow Radio Station Stops Anti-Finnish Programs

London. Moscow Radio did not mention the Soviet-Finnish war last night. The anti-Finnish programs, broadcast daily in foreign languages since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war, have now also been discontinued. (Reuters, 9th)

### If a Formal Application is Received, Britain and France Will Assist Finland with Strength. Finland's Fate is Left to the Finns to Decide; They Will Never Allow German Domination of Northern Europe.

Paris. Well-informed sources here say that Britain and France do not wish to put pressure on Finland regarding the current peace negotiations. If Finland wishes the Allied countries to continue to provide assistance, they only need to say so, and the Allied countries are prepared to respond. It is widely felt that the Swedish government has assumed a great responsibility before its own country and world opinion. Sweden, due to its close relationship with Finland, is said to have exerted great pressure on Finland and has hinted at stopping current indirect aid. It is said that the Soviet Union's new demands are tantamount to placing Finland in the position of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Conference. Its demands include the cession of the Petsamo region along with its nickel mines and fishing rights, the dismantling of coastal batteries, and the abandonment of Viipuri and all Finnish territory on Lake Ladoga. "Le Temps" states that this matter should be decided by the Finns themselves. What the Finns need to know is that Britain and France are indeed prepared to give greater and more direct assistance. Like a flood cannot be divided, the disaster of Nazism and the disaster of the Soviet Union cannot be separated. This is what the Finns and the people of various countries hesitating on the edge of war should remember. It is reported that the military supplies transported by Britain and France to Finland, including those already delivered and en route, total 405 aircraft, including 67 bombers, 916 artillery pieces, more than 2.5 million shells, 5,000 light machine guns, 124 heavy machine guns, 150 anti-tank guns, 450,000 bombs, 1,050 naval mines, 10,000 landmines, and 56 million rounds of ammunition. At least two-thirds of the above military supplies have now been delivered. (Reuters, 9th)

London. London officials are greatly disturbed by the widespread rumors that the Soviet Union and Finland are about to negotiate peace. Authoritative sources believe that the domination of the Scandinavian countries by the Soviet Union and Germany would be a failure for the Allied countries. Their concerns are based on the following reasons: (1) After the Soviet Union and Germany dominate Finland and the Scandinavian Peninsula, they will be able to obtain the iron ore they need from Gällivare, Kiruna, and Kirunavaara in Sweden, which are the world's third-largest iron-producing areas. (2) The northern coast of Germany will be almost completely immune from Allied attacks. From an economic point of view, this is the most valuable area in Germany. (3) Since Soviet Russia is free from war, it can cooperate with Germany to exploit raw materials and transport them to Germany, while also guarding Germany's Balkan border. Some observers predict that the Allied countries will one day pass through that area to attack Germany. (4) After the successive collapses of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the Balkan countries are paying close attention to the outcome of Finland. If Finland also collapses, these countries' trust in the Allied countries will be less than before, as the Allied countries are considered to be closely related to Finland. (5) If Finland surrenders and is dominated by Germany and the Soviet Union, Germany and the Soviet Union may force Norway to allow Germany to use the Me Kong base in Denmark, so that it can attack the British North Sea Fleet from there. This is also a possibility. In short, the complex situation of the entire European war may change due to Finland's decision in the next two or three weeks. As for the person in charge of this major war plan, it should be General Mannerheim. (International News Agency, 9th)

Copenhagen. According to authoritative reports, Finland intends to decide within a few hours to directly request Britain and France to send reinforcements to defend against the invasion of the Red Army. If this news is true, then the war may spread to the Scandinavian countries. According to a quick report from London, Britain is asking Sweden to allow it to transport troops through its territory. If so, then the opinion here that Britain hopes Finland will ask for help can be confirmed. According to reliable sources, whether Finland will take this measure depends on whether Sweden can mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Sweden's task is to make the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union closer to what Finland can accept, and to make what Finland can accept closer to what the Soviet Union demands. If the Soviet Union's demands cannot be greatly reduced, or if Norway and Sweden do not send strong reinforcements to Finland, then the general public expects that Finland will directly ask the Allied countries for help, and believes that the Allied countries will not refuse. (Special Correspondent Fukazawa, International News Agency, 9th)

### Finland's War or Peace Plan Against the Soviet Union Depends on General Mannerheim

Danzig. A reporter from the Hai Tong News Agency recently learned that if the activities of mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict in the Swedish capital are unsuccessful, when the foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries met in Danzig on February 25, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther told the foreign ministers of Denmark and Norway that it was possible to mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Swedish Foreign Minister Günther made this statement in the hope that Denmark and Norway could at least participate in this effort morally, because at that time, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther believed that Finland's cession of territory was unavoidable. Therefore, political figures here, after reading the official report issued by the Danzig meeting, also understood that the three Scandinavian countries all hoped to maintain Finland's independence by following a possible path to resolve the conflict. People in Norway say that the Finnish government has handed over the decision-making power on war and peace to General Mannerheim, so Foreign Minister Günther's statement that it is possible to stop the Soviet-Finnish conflict may not be entirely true. General Mannerheim and the country's former president, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, have different political views. General Mannerheim has always been pro-British and pro-French. His repeated visits to London and his repeated appeals, hoping that Western countries would help Finland under any circumstances, can be seen as a glimpse of his trust in Britain and France. On the contrary, Svinhufvud often advocated a policy of close ties with Germany. When Finland won its independence in 1918, Svinhufvud personally went to Berlin to ask Germany for assistance to Finland, but General Mannerheim expressed his opposition. In the spring of 1939, there was a proposal for Germany and Finland to conclude a non-aggression pact, but it was not successful. Therefore, it is decided whether the activities participated in by Svinhufvud will succeed or fail. The final decision still rests with General Mannerheim. (Hai Tong News Agency, 9th)

### US Government Officials are Concerned about the European Situation; US Ambassador to Moscow Has Long Talks with Foreign Minister Molotov

Washington. An official from the State Department said today that the US government has not received any formal or informal requests to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war. The State Department is now greatly concerned about the news of peace hopes, but there is no further action. (Reuters, 9th)

Moscow. US Ambassador to Moscow Steinhardt held talks with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov for two hours yesterday. It is widely believed that they discussed the possibility of the United States mediating the Soviet-Finnish war. Steinhardt also met with the Swedish Minister to the Soviet Union and other diplomatic representatives here. (United Press, 9th)

### Germany Issues Warning to Britain and France; If They Assist Finland with Force, It Will Lead to Unfortunate Consequences

Stockholm. Foreign observers in Berlin recently stated that German political figures have denied the claim that Germany and Sweden are jointly mediating the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, but warned that if Britain and France send troops or mercenaries to directly assist Finland, Germany will believe that Western European countries intend to expand the scope of the war and create a new anti-German front. If this is the case, the overall situation will be completely changed, and the German government will have to prepare to take necessary decisions. (Havas, 8th)

Rome. Italian newspapers welcome the attempt to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war and expect the possibility of restoring peace and eliminating a crisis in the entire Europe. But in Germany, the German government does not allow newspapers to mention the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, and only prints in large font the news from Northern Europe criticizing the Allied countries for preparing to send troops to land on the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Reuters, 9th)

### Soviet-Finnish War Report; Soviet Offensive in the Viipuri Area Repelled by Finnish Forces

Soviet troops captured 12 artillery pieces, 57 machine guns, and 2 million rounds of ammunition. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and shot down two enemy planes in air combat. (TASS, 9th)

Helsinki. The General Headquarters issued a war report stating, "The Red Army units intensified their attacks yesterday and today in the area from Koivisto to Lake Ladoga, but were all repelled. Our artillery effectively destroyed many enemy tanks and artillery pieces. The Red Army left behind 400 bodies between Viipuri and Vuoksi Lake. Casualties were especially heavy on the River Kollaa.

### Fierce Battles in Chenghai and Chaoan for Several Days; Chinese Troops Abandon Chenghai City After Capturing It; Japanese Troops from Guangzhou Rush to Chaoan for Reinforcements Overnight

Shantou Correspondence: The Huazhenzhong Brigade of the Chinese Army launched a three-pronged attack on Chaoan City on February 26. One route started from Tiandongxu, Fengshun, detoured through Qiulang Mountain and Zhuxiang, and attacked Yixi Station outside the North Gate. Another route crossed the river from Gebu Fushi and attacked Shuangjingshan. One route set out from the Anjie Highway, attacked Xucuoxiang, and Hougou, Chihu, Moweixiang, and Chunchenglou outside the South Gate. Another route set out from Fengfeng Mountain, Raoping, and stationed troops on the left bank of the Han River. The three sides advanced fiercely at the same time. That afternoon, they had advanced to Shuangjingshan and Zhugaoshan, narrowing the encirclement and engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. The Japanese army relied on the defensive fortifications on the mountain to hold on stubbornly. The sound of artillery fire rumbled all day long. The Japanese and puppet troops in various strongholds such as Shantou, Chenghai, Anbu, and Huamei all went to aid. The original sentry posts of the Japanese army checking pedestrians at the key traffic points in Shantou City were also replaced by puppet police. The plainclothes team in the suburbs of Shantou immediately sneaked into the city, posting slogans on the streets or giving public speeches, which was very active.

Recapture Chenghai

The Chinese troops Li Shaoru and Hong Zhizheng and other units stationed in Zhanglin Donglong, Chenghai, had already joined forces with the New Sixth Division in mid-month. On the evening of the 26th, in order to respond to the Chinese troops in Chaoan, they crossed the river in the dark of night and attacked Chenghai City. The able-bodied men bravely climbed the city walls and attacked the Japanese camp. About 400 Japanese troops in the city closed the city and defended it firmly, opening fire and bombarding the outside of the city indiscriminately. At this time, a fire had already broken out in the city, and street fighting occurred, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Waisha Xiapu Ouding on the 17th. Flour, foreign rice, kerosene, military supplies, etc. were left in the city, all of which were seized by the Chinese army. Then a transportation team of 4,000 people swept and transported all of them onto boats and transported them to the rear in Raoping. On the evening of the 27th, the Chinese army swept towards Waisha and forced an attack on the outskirts of Shantou City. Chaos had broken out in Fulong, Jinsha, Shawei, Qishan, Xinxiang, Longwei, Taizihan and other areas 10 li away from Shantou City. There were also gunshots and artillery fire in Shantou City. All shops and houses were closed. The Japanese troops in the city moved to the Qilu Waimalu Airport by the sea, preparing to get on ships and leave. At the railway station and on the Wuqiaoban, Tongji Road, there were 300 to 400 remaining Japanese soldiers guarding the intersection, cutting off traffic in and out of the city.

Intercept Japanese Troops

After the Chinese army captured Chenghai City, it blocked the retreat route of the Japanese troops in Chaoan on the railway line of Huamei and Caitang City, and quickly joined forces with the Chinese troops in Sangpu Mountain, Pannanshan, and Wugang. At this time, the focus of the war shifted to Hougou, Xiasi, Chihu, Yunlishan, and Zhugaoshan outside the South Gate of Chaoan. The fighting was most fierce on the 28th. Japanese planes flew to Chaoan in turn to help in the battle, because the Japanese troops there had been trapped for several days, and their food, ammunition, and water had all run out. They were cut off from the strongholds between Shantou and Anbu, and their responses were ineffective. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in Chaoan suffered more than 1,000 casualties in the recent ten days. On the 28th, eight Japanese transport ships stopped near Dadun, and four stopped on the sea surface of Qilu. The Japanese troops secretly sent the wounded soldiers and documents into the ships at night, intending to withdraw. On the one hand, they urgently requested help from the Southern China Dispatch Army in Guangzhou. The Japanese commander Ando specially mobilized 3,000 Japanese troops to board ships from Huangpu Taiping, and they had arrived in Shantou on the 29th, and were transported to Waisha overnight by armed motorboats to land. In addition, 16 electric boats carried more than 300 Japanese soldiers to Chenghai, Donglong, and Nanyang to invade, but before they could land, they were ambushed by the militia, and 40 to 50 people were killed or injured. Seeing that the Chinese troops in Zhanglin Donglong were prepared, the Japanese motorboats turned to sail up the tributary of the Han River, landed at Longhu, and marched north along the Hudi Road to rescue Chaoan. In addition, motorboats carried soldiers to land outside the East Gate of Chenghai, and near Anbu, Meixitou, Xianhu, Xiedu, and Daya. The Chinese team fought on the plains intertwined with rivers. The transportation was inconvenient, and the advance and retreat were out of control. Therefore, Chenghai City was lost again on the early morning of March 1, which was the fourth abandonment. When Chenghai City was captured on February 27, it was expected that it would be difficult to hold it for a long time, and the Japanese and puppet troops withdrew from the city and hid in Guanshan Township and Waisha Township, waiting for reinforcements. On March 1, fierce battles took place in these two places, and 300 to 400 Japanese and puppet troops were killed or injured. There were no battles in the near suburbs of Chenghai. 300 Japanese reinforcements boarded 16 motorboats and landed near Daya, east of Anbu, before noon on the 29th. It happened that the Chinese army withdrew from Pannanshan, preparing to cross back to Chenghai. The bamboo rafts by the shore were occupied by Japanese boats as docks. Seeing this, the Chinese army ambushed on the shore and fired from above, which was completely unexpected by the Japanese army. After two hours of melee, two Japanese motorboats were sunk. The Japanese army suffered another 70 to 80 casualties. The Chinese army seized the motorboat, planted a Japanese flag, crossed Chenghai, and returned smoothly to the Longdu Dushu position.

Chaos in Chaoan

On the Chaoan side, after the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack. The war map was quite fierce in Bijia Mountain, Yunli Mountain, Yunti Mountain, Chihu, Xiasi, Yunbu City, and Longhu outside the city. Three Japanese planes took turns flying low to help in the battle. More than 1,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry rushed out of the Chihu stronghold on the morning of the 29th and pounced on the northwest mountains. The Japanese cavalry saw that the Chinese army's mountain dangerous areas were destroyed by Japanese planes, whipped their horses and rushed into Linjiazhuang, fighting hand-to-hand four times. The Chinese army was ambushed in the forest, setting up hunting traps and tripwires. The Japanese cavalry's horse feet were tripped by the Chinese army with hemp ropes, blocking the following troops of the Japanese army. Dead people and dead horses were piled up on the road in the fields in front of Linjiazhuang. The two sides fought fiercely until 1 pm. The fresh troops stationed in Fengxi by the Chinese also arrived and defeated the Japanese troops who rushed out of Chihu. Taking advantage of the victory, they swept through the area. In the evening, the Chinese army had approached Xiasi Chihu, and 200 to 300 people were captured along the way, and more than 70 rifles and machine guns, steel helmets, military flags and other trophies were seized. There were also nine puppet soldiers, who were originally local able-bodied men who were forced to become soldiers. Seeing that the Japanese army was defeated, they carried their guns from the Guanyin Temple in Linjiazhuang and surrendered to the Chinese army, turned their guns and joined the war, leading the Chinese army to search the side of the Guanyin Temple, killing six Japanese officers and capturing a war horse and two machine guns.

### High Prices for Everything in Dinghai

Dinghai Correspondence: Various goods in this county have recently been controlled by the Japanese and puppet authorities, and the source is scarce, resulting in rising prices and the people are unable to make a living. At present, the price of rice in the city is 32 yuan per shi, pork is 1 yuan per jin, vegetable oil is 1 yuan per jin, sesame oil is 1.3 yuan per jin, lard is 1 yuan for 14 taels, soybeans are 26 yuan per shi, glutinous rice is 2.5 he per yuan, early rice is 12 yuan per 100 jin, candles are more than 6 yuan per jin, soft firewood is 5 fen per jin, hard firewood is 8 fen per jin, sweet potatoes are 6 fen per jin, sweet potato silk is 1 jiao per jin, medium-sized tin foil is more than 200 yuan per yuan, eggs are 9 fen each, duck eggs are 1.1 jiao each, matches are 3 fen per pack, kerosene is 1.2 yuan each, longan is 2.1 yuan per jin, soap is 2 jiao per piece, cotton is 9 jiao or 1.3 yuan per jin, old wine is 2 jiao per jin, and silk and cloth are more than doubled compared to before. A cloth coat cannot be made without 10 yuan (formerly only 5 yuan). Vegetables are extremely expensive, costing several jiao per jin, because the villagers dare not enter the city. Before the war, it was only 20 wen per jin. Fish was very cheap. Before the war, a yellow croaker only cost 5 fen, but now it costs no less than 3 to 4 jiao. When there is wind and rain, it is difficult to catch fish, and the price rises to 6 to 7 jiao per fish. Salt was only a little over 1 fen per jin before the war, but now it costs 7 fen or 1 jiao per jin. Other items such as cigarettes, cosmetics, stationery, books, etc. are even more expensive, more than twice as expensive as before the war. The residents of Dinghai are in dire straits in this high cost of living, which can be described as suffering.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Occupy Chonggu Town, Qingpu; The Town Has Been Blockaded by Guerrillas

Qingpu Correspondence: Chonggu, Guanyintang, and other towns in the eastern part of Qingpu have been controlled by the 3rd Detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force since the withdrawal of the Chinese troops to the west, maintaining law and order, and the people lived and worked in peace. However, since Jin Honggao, the captain of the 1st Brigade of the Qingpu County Puppet Security Team, was executed by the guerrillas in October last year, the Japanese and puppet troops, in retaliation, suddenly dispatched Jiang Akao's unit of the 3rd Brigade of the Qingpu County Puppet Security Team, together with more than 60 Japanese troops, to attack Chonggu by motorboat on the 14th day of the 12th lunar month last year. At that time, the 2nd Detachment of the 3rd Detachment met the enemy on separate routes, but because the timing was not right, after killing several puppet soldiers, they immediately withdrew. After the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Chonggu, they piled up sandbags, barbed wire, and built brick walls several feet high and thick on the Xiaolong thoroughfare to prevent the guerrillas from counterattacking. The materials used were dismantled from the Fuquan Mountain Primary School in the town and the ancient Leizu Temple with a history of 500 years, and the rest were collected. The discipline of the puppet army was gone, and villagers were tied up day and night. To this day, no less than hundreds of people have been tied up, and they have extorted and plundered everything. It is now known that the guerrillas, in addition to planning to attack by surprise, are implementing a policy of blocking the four suburbs. Pedestrians are only allowed to leave but not enter, and all rice and goods are not allowed to be imported. Therefore, the once prosperous rice market is now silent. It is also heard that the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Chonggu, originally wanting to collect rice donations and various taxes from the fields, but now there is no rice market in the town, and the four villages are still controlled by the guerrillas, so it is impossible to implement. They have to rely on kidnapping, theft, and looting to live.

### Food: Imported Rice Continues to Fall, Down Another Two Yuan; Arrivals Very Strong, Another 70,000 Bags Today; Rice Industry Brewing Over Weekly Closing

The recent rice market has plummeted and become irreversibly depressed. The continuous arrival of futures this month has made it difficult to circulate funds. Those holding goods find it difficult to hold on. The market is extremely crowded. Guests who see the drastic changes in the market are cautious. Therefore, the opening price this morning was half a yuan lower. However, people's minds are increasingly tired, causing rice prices to fall more and more sharply. By the time the market closed at noon, except for mixed broken rice, which was in short supply and sold more widely and able to hold steady, falling by half a yuan to a yuan, from 35 yuan to 34 yuan, other types of imported rice fell sharply by 1.5 to 2 yuan each. No. 1 Saigon was 44 yuan, 43.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 41 yuan, falling to 40 yuan, high-quality fire-dried Binta brand was 42.5 yuan, mixed brand was 42 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice was 39.35 yuan, small fire-dried rice was 38 yuan, Tokyo pointed rice was 38.2 yuan, 38 yuan. Seeing that the overall trend is declining and people's minds are depressed, there is still hope for a small rebound. Moreover, sales are decreasing day by day. It seems difficult to expect a turnaround at this time, and the continued decline may be expected.

The sale of imported rice is also felt by floating households, retail customers, and weak trading firms. The pressure on funds is felt even more. Overseas reports are frequently small, and foreign merchants are selling No. 2 Saigon rice for less than 50 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon rice is also lower than 52 or 53 yuan. Although traders do not dare to continue ordering, the market and people's minds are even more pressured. Therefore, after the market opened this morning, the selling pressure in the market was extremely strong. The prices of various imported rice were falling, and they were lower than the previous day by one to two yuan. There was also a lack of buyers for repurchased futures. The March Siamese No. 2 rice fell from 49.6 yuan to 49 yuan, and the small fire-dried rice fell from 48.2 yuan, also by one yuan. The turnover was less than 200 tons. There are currently only more than 3,000 bags of imported rice.

More imported rice has arrived. Ewo's Yisheng Wheel brought 6,656 bags from Haiphong, and another 7,588 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 14,244 bags, which were imported yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. According to yesterday's report, the Yu Berlin Wheel, managed by the Zhaohua Company, loaded more than 71,000 bags of rice in Saigon to Shanghai, originally scheduled to arrive yesterday. According to the company's telegram yesterday, it will not be able to import until today, and it will still dock at the Gonghexian Wharf in Hongkou as planned for unloading. (Zu)

Glutinous rice continued to be affected by imported rice, and the market was flat. Prices followed the fall by half a yuan to one yuan. The source of thick and thin japonica domestic rice has recently become sporadic due to various difficulties. Yesterday, it was still in this state. Only three to five hundred bags were transferred out of Hongkou, and most of them were goods stored in the past. Only five or six cars of Danyang and other white rice have arrived. However, it is rumored that goods from the Taicang area may be cleared soon. If it can be realized, it is indeed a blessing for the people's food. As for off-market trading, it is heard that it is still quiet. Only early and late rice in Nangang are slightly traded, and the price is 45 yuan. Because the price of this cargo is the lowest, it is quite suitable for general stores to cope with retail sales. Therefore, it is easier to sell than thick japonica rice.

The traders in Xiaoguanghan Rice Market, because all the warehouses are closed every Sunday and cannot sample, which often causes invisible business interruptions, feel very inconvenient. Following the precedent of the Grocery Association's holiday on Sundays, it is planned to close the business for one day every Sunday starting next week to facilitate the organization of business. Therefore, more than 90 traders have signed in favor of this measure yesterday, accounting for two-thirds of the entire industry. It only needs to be approved by the association meeting before it can be announced and implemented.

### Factory Powder Unchanged; Repurchased Goods Fluctuate Slightly; Suzhou Wheat Falls to 23 Yuan

The powder market was initially weak and then stabilized. The factory's price for the first-class powder has not changed during the flat selling period. The repurchased goods fluctuate slightly with the sales situation. Yesterday morning, the old car brand warehouse receipt opened at 14.25 yuan. Later, due to slight movements in the rural areas of the interior, the price returned to 14.3 yuan and 14.35 yuan. It is heard that the price of Green Cannon Car is 14.65 yuan, but there is no official market. This kind of environment may still have a period of brewing. 240 bags of powder were shipped to Xiamen on the 10th.

Wheat trading is still quiet. Both the Chinese factory and the export gang are rarely interested. The Japanese factory also wants to suppress the price and take it. Therefore, only one or two cars of Suzhou wheat were opened throughout the day, and the price was 23 yuan, which was 8 jiao lower than the opening price the previous day. There were no proper transactions for other goods.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Uptrend Unstoppable

After the soybean market once trended down, actual sales have expanded in the past two days. General speculators took advantage of the trend to stir up trouble. People's minds in the market were excited, and the rush to buy was popular again. The market situation was quite strong. Yesterday, the market saw further jumps. The highest price of Bengbu beans reached 24 yuan again, and seven or eight cars were traded, with prices ranging from 21.4 yuan to 24 yuan. More than 1,300 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were traded, with prices ranging from 24.8 yuan to 25.3 yuan. More than 800 bags of Wuhu beans were traded, with prices ranging from 20.05 yuan to 23 yuan. More than 400 bags of Nanjing beans were traded, with prices ranging from 19.5 yuan to 22.5 yuan. One car of Chuzhou beans was traded, with the price at 22.5 yuan. 100 bags of Sangyuan beans were traded, with the price at 19.5 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao beans were traded, with the price at 29 yuan. One-fourth of the sales market was taken by hoarders, and the rest was taken by oil mills, carriage workshops, local streets, and Nanyang, etc.

Today (10th), 615 packages of soybeans, 595 packages of raw peanuts, and 1,500 bean cakes are available for export to Xiamen. Another 645 packages of soybeans and 480 cans of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong. Only 520 packages of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.

### Finance: Exchange Market Quiet, Trend Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market was affected by the fact that the exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds overseas turned downward and plummeted by more than four points. Therefore, the HSBC and US dollar exchange rates in this city were reduced by 0.0625 to 6.5 yuan. The Dutch guilder, Japanese yen, and other exchange rates also saw slight reductions. Other exchange rates, such as the British pound, were relatively stable. The intraday situation was still quite quiet, and the potential trend was still stable. The recent domestic and foreign news has been quite good, and the Hong Kong telegram was slightly blocked on the same day. Therefore, the market trend was slightly firm. At the morning opening, the old pattern of British pound flat and US dollar tight reappeared. The British pound was still quoted at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.6875 yuan. After the opening, foreign firms slightly bought in, but there was no impact. Soon after, the Hong Kong telegram issued a sell order first, and the money exchange industry followed with a tight order. The situation became slightly loose. Since then, buyers and sellers have been waiting and watching, and the turnover has become even more scarce. The market closed in a stable state at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence and 6.71875 yuan. As a result, the British pound was 0.015625 looser and the US dollar was 0.03125 tighter than the previous day. The trend of futures was the same as that of spot.

British Pound Looser, US Dollar Slightly Tighter

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was up 1.875 for the near term and up 2.5 for the far term. The New York silver price was still flat, and the London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rates of British pound against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar fell sharply by four points against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell sharply by 2.25 points against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for British gold and 6.6875 yuan for the US dollar, which was flat for the British pound and 0.0625 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. This was due to the decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, foreign firms first bought into HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence. Supply and demand were balanced, and there was a lack of change. Soon after, the Hong Kong telegram issued a sell order, so the market became slightly firm. It is estimated that spot British gold was sold to foreign firms at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence. At that time, it was difficult to close the US dollar at 6.71875 yuan. The HSBC listed price was announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar reduced by 0.0625. The silver balance tax was announced at 0.75. After that, the money exchange industry also followed suit and sold US dollar bills at 6.8125 yuan to a Chinese-Italian bank, causing the market situation to continue to be slightly loose. British gold at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence and the US dollar at 6.71875 yuan could be closed. Later, the foreign firms came back to close the US dollar at 6.6875 yuan for this month with a certain bank. Afterwards, the turnover became even clearer, and the situation was flat. By the time of the noon close, British gold was 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence, and the US dollar was 6.71875 yuan. This month's British gold was 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.6875 yuan. Next month's futures British gold was 4 shillings and 0.078125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.59375 yuan. As a result, the near-term British pound was 0.015625 looser and the US dollar was 0.03125 tighter than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Hong Kong, 9th (Saturday) Telegram: The exchange market opened this morning with turbulence. The British pound spot opened unchanged, and the far-term was tighter by 0.03125 to 1 shilling and 2.8125 pence. The US dollar spot shrunk sharply by 3.125 to 24 yuan.

### Gold Market Without Major Fluctuations, Only 14 Yuan Rise and Fall in Half a Day

Yesterday's cash raw gold dark market situation continued to hover, and the changes can be said to be extremely small. It first rose and then fell back, resulting in a slightly higher price than the previous day. This was caused by the Hong Kong gang's search for bargains. The morning opening was 4,785 yuan, up 9 yuan, due to the US dollar exchange rate tightening and a certain silver shop buying on behalf of the Hong Kong gang. Then, a certain money exchange industry followed, and the price rose another 5 yuan to 4,790 yuan. Later, a certain broker sold on behalf of the Dalian gang, and a certain silver firm also sold. At that time, the foreign exchange slightly turned firm, so it was difficult to stand firm. The price once fell to 4,776 yuan. However, the Hong Kong gang came back to operate when the price was low, so the closing price was still 4,780 yuan, which was 4 yuan better than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and there was also little trading heard outside the market. The turnover in half a day was about 1,000 taels. The silver shop's jewelry gold was fixed, and the customs gold, etc., were still flat. Since the beginning of the morning, the initial opening price per bar (10 taels) was raised by 9 yuan due to the tight US dollar exchange rate and the first purchase by the Hong Kong gang. A certain silver shop entered 50 taels of silver firm, at 4,785 yuan. After a while, a certain money exchange industry also came to follow up, so the price was raised by another 5 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold firm, at 4,790 yuan. Afterwards, because a certain broker suddenly issued a sell order, and the US dollar exchange rate slightly returned firm, while the British gold was reported to be slightly looser, a certain silver firm and securities report, etc., also mutually sold out. The Hong Kong gang's appetite turned dull, and Shanghai took a step back. A certain money firm exited 10 taels to the money exchange industry, losing to 4,776 yuan. Since then, sellers have gradually decreased, and the Hong Kong gang has come back to absorb at a low price, pulling up 8 yuan again. A certain silver firm entered 50 taels of securities firm, at 4,784 yuan. In the end, because the Hong Kong gang's appetite was sufficient, the silver shop gang and a certain silver firm, etc., came back to sell, and then fell back by 4 yuan. A certain silver firm exited 30 taels to the money exchange industry, with the closing price at 4,780 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. In half a day, it only rose and fell by 4 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the raw gold, and the purchase was reduced by about 20 yuan. The current cash price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Still Not Changed

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops continued to be stable. Datonghang still quoted 485 yuan. The new same firm's price was the same as the previous price, and the purchase was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Sales Turned Tight

Yesterday's foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, had little supply and demand, and the market was stable. The trading of British and American gold notes was not prosperous. The British gold notes were still 55 yuan. The US gold notes were slightly tighter due to the rapid decline in the pound exchange rate. The evening market was 14.65 yuan. The Hong Kong notes were slightly soft. The demand for Singapore notes and Dutch notes increased. The Philippine notes also trended firm. The Japanese yen notes were slightly weak, and the evening market was 1.294 yuan. The Korean notes were slightly weak, and the evening market was 1.013 yuan. Yesterday's market price: US gold notes rose by 2 points, Hong Kong notes fell by 5 li, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and Philippine notes all rose by 5 points, Annam notes rose by 2 points, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Steady, Domestic Bonds Hover

Yesterday, the unofficial market situation for the Consolidated Public Bonds was such that, due to the recent tightening of credit and the burden of interest on margin and collateral for buyers, progress was slow. Although the bears constantly relied on rumors from Nanjing to secretly dump stocks, the general understanding of the futility of rumors and scattered small purchases meant that the bulls felt quite energetic, resulting in a balance between buying and selling. This created a slight ripple effect, with the daily fluctuations being minimal, only ranging between one or two jiao. Only the Category B bonds saw a deduction of eight jiao due to the drawing of winning numbers. Other bonds fluctuated between five fen and one jiao. The trading volume did not increase, remaining at around 500,000 yuan.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Sanyo Industry Company were traded at a price of 13.50 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Brokers' Association continued to be stable at the opening. Although there were some bulls who came out to close positions due to the weekend, the buying side was very absorbent, and trading increased significantly as a result. Purchase orders came in steadily, and prices gradually increased. Shanghai Bank, Union Insurance, Jardine Matheson, Steel Industry, and Jardine Matheson were the most actively traded, with prices showing progress. Rubber stocks were stable.

London, 8th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Far Eastern companies' stocks on the London Stock Exchange showed an overall increase. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK-registered shares rose by £1.5, priced at £93.5. The Hong Kong-registered shares followed suit, rising by £0.5, priced at £92.5. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £12 12s 6d. Kaiping Mines shares continued to rise by 3 pence, priced at 18s 6d. Kulala Klang Rubber shares slightly fell by 1.5 pence, to 21s 10.5d. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 8th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt fluctuated slightly, with mixed gains and losses. The Anglo-German Continued Loan (British issue) rose by £2, to £59. The Sino-French American Dollar (with stamp) slightly increased by £0.5, priced at £51.5. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Original Continued Loans both fell by £0.5, priced at £13. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn & Cotton: The Foundation of Cotton Yarn Should Not Be Underestimated, New Sellers Are Not Lacking When Prices Rise

The yarn market is firm and resilient, with a stable trend, but the range of fluctuations is very narrow. This is due to the stability of both domestic and foreign exchange rates, which has calmed people's minds. At the same time, although there has been no large-scale development in actual sales, the Hong Kong firms are continuously making small, sporadic purchases. The major traders have already cleared the fixed amount of 20-count Double Horse yarn for March. According to their intentions, there is no hope for the price of raw materials to fall in the short term. However, because the bears believe that the foundation cannot be considered small, new sellers are not lacking when prices rise.

The opening atmosphere for spot yarn this morning was unremarkable. Shortly after, news of a decline in foreign exchange rates stimulated buying interest. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse for March was 912 yuan, which rose directly to 14 yuan. At this time, buyers were still numerous, but the guest firms sold a little, so prices remained high for a long time. By the time the market closed, prices had risen again. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,045 bales were traded. Spot prices for 20-count Double Horse rose by three to four yuan. Today, 50 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 177 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of yarn purchased by each firm is recorded below:

Hong Kong: 275, Fellow Traders: 1,700
Inland: 45, Sichuan: 20
Xiamen: 5, Total: 2,045

### Domestic Cotton Is Scarce, Difficult to Develop, Traders Shift Focus to Indian Cotton

The trading of domestic cotton has become less active, but market sentiment remains firm as ever. The reason for the decline in business is said to be that holders are unwilling to sell. Also, due to the weekend, transactions have decreased. Recently, various cotton firms, seeing the scarcity of goods and the difficulty in developing domestic cotton, have been actively purchasing Indian cotton from overseas. It is said that the number of purchases is increasing day by day. The current situation of spot cotton transactions is listed below:

In other news, the price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market was particularly quiet yesterday. Also, due to the short selling by Southern firms and the overseas cotton merchants in the market, the closing price of the cotton market yesterday fell by six to seven points for near-term contracts and three points for long-term contracts compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been quiet in recent days due to the strike by yarn mills. In addition, many bulls have closed their positions, and the market is quite sluggish. Yesterday, brokers predicted a sharp drop of more than six rupees, and more than ten pounds for Egyptian cotton.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was quieter yesterday. Traders suddenly refrained from buying Indian cotton due to fears of further price declines in India. The factories have remained lukewarm, likely due to the heavy arrival of goods in recent days. The price for cotton delivered to factories yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 6.71875 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:

### Piece Goods: Guest Sales of Cotton Cloth Are Lively Again

The cloth market is ostensibly slack but actually tight. Although the bulls are finding it difficult to maintain their positions due to tight credit and difficulties in storage, the general attitude of goods holders remains calm. The manufacturers are quoting surprisingly high prices due to the increasing cost of production. The wholesalers' appetites seem to have been satisfied, and there is more trading in and out. The street firms and guest firms, such as those selling to the southwest, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and East, have all made progress, but the excessive inventory in the market has affected the market to a certain extent. The rise and fall of each commodity varies. Due to the gradual restoration of inland transportation in Ningbo, nearly 200 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and group cloth were purchased yesterday. The Fujian and Guangdong firms purchased more than one hundred pieces of poplin, printed cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Yunnan firms purchased more than one hundred boxes of colored cloth and woolen fabric. The Northern Anhui firms purchased more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. The Nanyang firms purchased more than 4,000 pieces. The street firms traded more than 500 pieces.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices See Mixed Gains and Losses

Yesterday, Taikoo Sugar Company quoted a price of 5.975 Dutch guilders for crude white sugar, according to the C.L.F.IC standard price, which was slightly lower than before. It also quoted 14.90 Hong Kong dollars for 3,500 bags of B-Mark granulated sugar. The market prices set by the local association showed mixed gains and losses. Spot prices for second-grade crude white sugar were up slightly, two to three jiao, at 62.20 yuan at local firms, 62 yuan for newly arrived goods at foreign firms, and 61.80 to 61.60 yuan for old goods. Re-exported goods were up slightly, five jiao, at 48.50 yuan. Taikoo granulated sugar was up slightly, three to five jiao, with B-Mark at Western firms at 66.50 yuan, CW-Mark at 66 yuan, CX-Mark at 64.50 yuan, DY-Mark at 63.80 yuan, and HX-Mark at 63.50 yuan. Eastern firms' goods were down five jiao to two jiao and three jiao. H-Mark crude sugar saw a similar decrease, at 44.50 to 44 yuan. Dutch crude sugar rose by four to five jiao, with MP-Mark at 47.50 yuan and WA-Mark at 46.90 yuan. There were no changes in local white sugar and No. 1 crystal sugar. The Jian Firm offered more than 400 bags of new Diaoging sugar at 49 to 48.50 yuan, up by one yuan. The Xinghua Firm offered another batch of sheet Qing sugar, boxed at 43 yuan and basketed at 42.50 yuan, both up by several jiao.

### North and South Goods: Tangerine Cakes Rise One Yuan

The bridge cakes, after a batch recently arrived via the Jinan freighter, have seen activity as the goods are selling quickly. The market has become tight, and the price was raised by one yuan from yesterday. The price of particularly high-quality goods is expected to continue to rise. Lotus seeds: twenty-five boxes arrived from Ningbo yesterday.

### The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement Strenuously Opposes the Municipal Council's Tax Increase; Comparisons with Foreign Cities Will Inevitably Lead to Market Disruption and Disastrous Consequences

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, citing increased expenditure, plans to increase the municipal general rate, special house rate, and land rate surcharge by 50% from July 1st of this year. After the news was made public, residents within the Settlement were panic-stricken. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, urging them to reconsider. The original letter is recorded below:

Citizens Are Panic-Stricken

"To the esteemed Council, since your Council announced the 50% tax increase, public opinion has been uneasy. We have received a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, which stated that the district branches of this association, namely the 27th, 11th, 2nd, 26th, 12th, 24th, 35th, and 34th districts, have reported that they have recently learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, citing increased expenditure, plans to increase the municipal general rate, special house rate, and land rate surcharge by 50% from July 1st of this year to compensate for the increase. The news has spread, and residents within the Settlement are panic-stricken. Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has concentrated, and the prices of all goods have soared. Although the various industrial and commercial sectors appear to be prosperous on the surface, in reality, this prosperity is entirely due to consumption and cannot last. Most of the citizens are from the war zones, and after nearly three years, their economic capacity has gradually withered. At a time when prices are skyrocketing, their lives are already under severe threat. Therefore, speaking of tax increases at this time will further deepen the market crisis. If the Municipal Council argues that the market has improved, and most salaried workers have increased their salaries or subsidies, then this salary increase is merely a drop in the bucket and cannot offset the expenditure caused by the high cost of goods. Therefore, this association sincerely hopes that the Municipal Council will abandon the tax increase at this time of economic hardship and propose a remedy, paying attention to thrift in order to balance revenue and expenditure. We are sending this letter to your Council, requesting that you, together with the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, forward it to the Municipal Council for strict negotiation and prevention, so that the tax increase does not become a reality. Then the citizens will be fortunate, the market will be fortunate, and so on. Received at the meeting, based on this.

Public Opinion Is in an Uproar

Since the Municipal Council announced its intention to increase the tax rate by 50% from July 1st of this year, public opinion, both Chinese and foreign, has been in an uproar. They all believe that this move by the Municipal Council will further deepen the market crisis. At this time, the Municipal Council should share the hardships with the taxpayers, reducing the municipal expenditure to the lowest possible level, eliminating unnecessary expenditures as much as possible, and respecting the taxpayers' hard-earned money. It is still remembered that before the war, the Municipal Council planned to increase the tax rate by 2% (from 14% to 16%), and all sectors unanimously protested, saying that they could not bear the burden, and the implementation was eventually postponed. Now, during the war, when prices are abnormal and people's livelihoods are difficult, the sudden desire to increase the tax rate by 50% is truly extracting marrow from bones. Once implemented, it will stimulate prices to continue to soar, and rent disputes will also evolve, plunging society into serious unrest. We hope that you will quickly negotiate a halt, and we will be eternally grateful. Received at the meeting.

Swiftly Halt It

Everyone knows that balancing the budget has two main aspects: (1) thrift and (2) opening up new sources of revenue, which is the old saying of "increasing income and reducing expenditure." However, if your Council compares Shanghai to foreign cities and uses this concept to manage the municipal economy of the International Settlement, it will inevitably destroy the balance on one hand while striving to achieve balance on the other. As a result, it will merely be a temporary solution and not a fundamental cure, and it will ultimately lead to the consequences that this association has repeatedly stated. In accordance with the aforementioned letter, we are hereby informing you, hoping that you will investigate and immediately stop before it is too late, avoiding a descent into a deep abyss. We sincerely hope for your friendship. This is addressed to the Chief Executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.

### Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Daily, Rice Prices Fall Accordingly; Saigon Rice Prices Decrease, Shanghai Market Follows a Downward Trend

Yesterday, another 14,244 bags of foreign rice were imported by the Jardine Matheson's Yisheng vessel, loaded with 6,656 bags from Haiphong and transported 7,588 bags from Hong Kong. They were imported at dawn yesterday, stopping at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Java Mail Steamship Company's Oberlin vessel, managed by the manager, loaded with over 71,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but had not been imported by the evening. According to the company, the vessel should arrive today and still moor at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

Population Decrease

Since the news that the subsidized rice sales will be discontinued next month spread, the public has been quite concerned about the source and price of food in the future. Rice industry insiders said that rice prices are likely to continue to fall in the future. In the past, 80% of the source was the domestic rice and 20% to 30% was the imported rice. It was quite difficult to order the imported rice at that time, which formed an open secret, and the source of domestic rice was restricted and not smooth, which led to the opportunity of manipulation and hoarding. However, now the opposite is true: 70% to 80% rely on ordering the foreign rice and only 20% to 30% hope to obtain the domestic rice. In addition, the price of ordering the rice from Saigon depends entirely on the rise and fall of the foreign exchange rate, which has become a completely open transaction. Anyone can order from foreign countries, unlike the secret transactions in the past, and hoarders are also selling their goods, to a certain extent, because of this. Secondly, Shanghai's middle and lower classes find it difficult to live in the city, and many have moved back to their hometowns due to difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods.

Price Drop in Production Areas

The daily food consumption of the entire city is 80% or even 70% of what it used to be. With these two reasons, the future price drop in rice is expected. Moreover, Saigon, the production area of foreign rice, has abundant production and lower prices. The price of foreign rice in the wooden market has also been lowered. Yesterday, the average price of rice per dan fell by about one yuan.

### British Royal Air Force Hosts a Banquet for Whitehead; Whitehead Is the Newly Appointed Military Attaché of the British Embassy

Lieutenant Colonel Whitehead, the newly appointed military attaché of the British Embassy, attended a weekly banquet of the British Royal Air Force on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Royal Air Force held a banquet on the 7th to welcome Colonel Whitehead and show their welcome, as there had been no gathering since Colonel Whitehead's appointment. Colonel Whitehead came to China in 1913, returned to his country to participate in World War I, came to Tianjin in northern China in 1928, and was later transferred to Beiping. In 1934, he was transferred to Singapore and Hong Kong, and recently transferred to his current position.

### After the Establishment of the New Sino-American Loan, the Legal Tender Becomes More Stable; Although the Japanese Side Expresses Extreme Dissatisfaction, They Do Not Dare to Offend the United States

After the news of the establishment of the Sino-American 20 million yuan credit loan spread, the financial market in Shanghai yesterday became more stable. According to a mogul of a foreign bank, this credit loan is a designated amount for China to use to purchase heavy trucks and railway materials in the United States, not to lend cash, so there will be no waves in the market. However, in terms of actively assisting China, its significance is very important. The Chinese legal tender has been quite stable in the foreign exchange market for the past three days. Even if there are fluctuations, they are only slight changes. Yesterday, the buying price of the US dollar was 14.54 yuan, and the selling price was 14.95 yuan. The buying price of the British pound was 56.47 yuan per pound, and the selling price was 58.18 yuan.

Although the Japanese Are Disappointed, There Is Nothing They Can Do

The China Press said that at yesterday's (8th) press conference hosted by the Japanese side, when a reporter asked the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy about the impact of the US government's loan to China on the Sino-Japanese situation, the reply was that a large-scale war is currently taking place in China,

Any economic or spiritual assistance given to Chongqing

Cannot be regarded as a friendly act towards Japan. However, the scope of assistance provided by the United States and the specific results of the assistance to the Chongqing government are questionable. Furthermore, this loan has been declared that it is not intended to purchase military equipment and ordnance, so Chongqing has little use for this loan. The American public seems to have

The Same Perspective

As the trend of China and Finland, which is a misunderstanding of the facts. When asked whether the loan will stimulate the emotions between the Japanese and Americans in China, the spokesperson replied that he could not imagine that the loan would have a good impact on the relationship between the American and Japanese people. The Japanese government's determination to successfully end the war in China and readjust

American-Japanese Relations

Is very firm. He believes that in the future, it will eventually show the sincerity of the Japanese people and the government. Those who pay attention to the overall situation in the Far East have known the determination of the Japanese side. When asked, "Since the American-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 has been abolished, and now the loan is granted to China, will this encourage automatic

Anti-American Sentiment

In China?", the spokesperson replied that it is currently difficult to imagine the outbreak of this sentiment, but he cannot predict what kind of events future changes and situations will promote. The actions of all governments are governed by circumstances, and so is Japan. In the future, the Japanese people's feelings towards the United States may be angered by events that occur in the future, but it goes without saying that the Japanese authorities do not want the relations between the United States and Japan to deteriorate.

### Salvaging the Sunken Jing Sheng Steamer, Bodies Recovered

After the Jing Sheng lighter sank off Ningbo, nine days have passed. The aftermath committee once tried to salvage the vessel, but was unable to lift it due to its excessive weight. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the shipping department of the Moufu Steamer Company, ten divers from Shanghai arrived in Ningbo on the morning of the day before yesterday, and began salvage operations at 1:00 PM. After the divers surveyed the vessel, it was determined that it was not easy to lift the vessel out of the water due to the presence of bodies inside, which added to its weight. Therefore, it was decided to first salvage the bodies inside the vessel. Three female bodies and one male and one child's body were immediately recovered. The salvage operations were stopped at 3:00 PM due to the strong currents. When the tide receded at 8:00 PM, the salvage operations were continued, and were stopped at 10:30 PM. One more body was recovered at that time. The third salvage operation was conducted at 8:00 AM yesterday, and it is planned to completely recover the bodies inside the vessel before attempting to salvage the vessel. However, the currents are rapid at that location, and it is necessary to wait for the tide to recede before entering the water for salvage operations. Therefore, the salvage operations cannot be completed in a short period of time. The Ningbo Shanghai Association is very concerned about the distressed passengers. In addition to allocating 10,000 yuan from the Ningbo disaster relief funds, the Association also notified Shanghai natives yesterday to solicit donations for the Jing Sheng steamer to handle the aftermath for the distressed passengers. According to another source, salvaging the sunken vessel is not difficult, but it is necessary to find a way to enter the water and seal off the vessel on all sides, pump out the water inside the vessel, and then it can float. However, the necessary equipment for salvaging the vessel has not been completed, and the salvage operations cannot be carried out.

### The First Hospital of the Relief Association to Celebrate Its Anniversary Today

For the sake of improving the health of refugees, Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and others raised a large sum of money to establish a civilian hospital. For one year, it has benefited society to a great extent. It is heard that the First Hospital of the Association, located at No. 140, North Xizang Road, has been established for one year since its establishment last year. A week of anniversary celebration will be held at the hospital today, inviting people from all walks of life to visit.

### Municipal Council Chairmanship Election; Allman Agrees to Participate; British and American Candidates Have Been Fully Launched

According to someone close to the famous American lawyer Mr. Allman, Mr. Allman has decided to accept the candidacy for the chairmanship of the Municipal Council as proposed by friends. However, the American community must first hold a primary election before the Municipal Council election, and decide on two people from among the three candidates to be the formal candidates.

The China Press said that the election for the chairmanship of the Public Concession Municipal Council is approaching, and the preparations for the primary election of candidates by the expatriates of various countries in Shanghai have been completed. The British Electoral Committee announced yesterday (8th) the names of the seven British candidates as follows: Keswick, Hayley, McGill, Powell, Lottrik McDonald, Lanar McDonald, and Lightell. An election will be held within the next fourteen days to elect five of them. The Municipal Council chairmanship election will be held on April 10th and 11th.

### The British Vessel Hunan, Which Was Shelled by Japanese Warships, Has Arrived in Shanghai; British Authorities Say the Japanese Side Has Apologized; However, It Has Caused Great Anxiety Among the People of Shanghai

The China Press said that the Taikoo Shipping Company's vessel Hunan, which was shelled by warships last month, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (8th). Captain White Ross has reported the details of the shelling to the British Embassy Office and the Taikoo Shipping Company in this city. According to authorities here, the matter has been concluded, as Japanese officials have apologized at the location of the incident and promised to compensate for the damage. Therefore, the diplomatic community will not continue to negotiate.

A Small Dent in the Rear Deck

The damage to the Hunan vessel was very minor, with only a small dent in the rear deck, indicating the location where the shell landed. A solid steel shell was found on the deck and handed over to British Embassy officials.

Once Caused Great Anxiety

The crew of the vessel were quite surprised to hear that the matter had agitated people in Shanghai when they arrived in Shanghai. It is said that the family members of the crew and passengers, after reading the brief messages about the vessel being shelled on the London Broadcasting Corporation and in the newspapers in this city, rushed to the Taikoo Shipping Company's office to inquire about the condition of the vessel. At that time, the only news that the Taikoo Shipping Company could release was "Everyone on board is safe."

The Wife of a Crew Member Mistakenly Thought It Had Sunk

However, the wife of a certain crew member thought that this statement had an undertone, and said that the vessel may have sunk and everyone on board was forced to escape by boat. According to the intention of many people in this city yesterday, if the authorities concerned had released more detailed information about the incident, there would not have been rumors and speculation, and the family members of the crew and passengers would not have had to worry. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to keep secrets.

Japan Apologized Immediately After Being Hit

It is learned that this matter occurred at about 11:00 AM on January 27th outside Yantai. The Hunan vessel did not pay attention to the first warning whistle issued by the Japanese warship, as it was thought that the Japanese warship was intercepting other ships. However, it immediately stopped and reported its name and nationality to the Japanese warship in detail. A few minutes later, when the two ships were sailing forward, a shell suddenly hit the deck of the Hunan vessel. According to Taikoo Shipping Company, after the Hunan vessel was hit, Japanese officials left the ship by boat and approached to personally apologize.

Several Passengers Were Almost Hit

However, according to a crew member of the vessel who told reporters yesterday, after the Hunan vessel was hit, it continued to sail forward, and the Japanese warship immediately reported to the Japanese authorities, and the Japanese authorities directly apologized to the officials of the British Embassy here, without notifying the Hunan vessel. The vessel had just left Tianjin and had not reported the matter to the British authorities in Tianjin. It is heard that the shell fired by the Japanese warship was sometimes used for anti-aircraft guns. It fell on the deck of the Hunan vessel without penetrating it. Public opinion is that the shell was fired by a certain junior officer of the Japanese navy. At that time, the vessel was carrying 200 passengers, including four Europeans. Several passengers were on the deck when the shell fell and were almost hit.

### The Chinese 45th Brigade Arrives at Tianmashan, Defending the Foothills as a Base

According to people from Qingpu, the regular Chinese army's 45th Brigade, led by Tian Xiushan, after defeating more than 100 soldiers of the Japanese army's Shimada unit from Qingpu city in a surprise attack in Zhangliantang last winter, has advanced again to the foothills of Tianmashan, a perfect location for troops to camp. It is said that Tian's troops have been operating in the suburbs of Qingpu for two years. Last year, they attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Fengjing train station and destroyed its two large bridges, cutting off train traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. They also fought fiercely with the Japanese army and air force in the Xitang-Taozhuang area for many days. At one point, they were forced to retreat west of the Sujia Road due to being outnumbered and outgunned by the Japanese soldiers. After receiving sufficient supplies from the military authorities, they advanced rapidly northeast along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border. Their marching was miraculous. When they developed a new base on the shores of the Yeshe Marsh and in Zhangliantang Town last winter, they were discovered by the Japanese army in Qingpu, who sent troops to resist. Tian's troops surrounded the Japanese army using a new strategic flexibility, capturing more than 70 soldiers. They charged straight to the peaks of Tianmashan. The Japanese side was thinly manned and dared not attack.

### Gauss Will Be Sworn In in Shanghai; Order to Go to Australia Has Not Yet Arrived; U.S. State Department Is Expediting

The China Press said that the official of the U.S. Consulate told reporters yesterday (8th) that the departure date of U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Gauss to take up his new post as U.S. Minister to Australia in Canberra has been delayed. Two months ago, it was expected that Gauss would be on his way to Australia at this time, but Gauss has not yet received instructions from the State Department to leave Shanghai. Although there is no special reason for the slight delay in instructions, it is clear that the preparation by Washington for Gauss's departure from Shanghai has taken longer than expected in this city. It is heard that the current U.S. Consul General in Beiping, Lockhart, is the strongest candidate to succeed Gauss as U.S. Consul General in this city. Mr. Lockhart has stayed in Shanghai several times and has the necessary experience in Far Eastern affairs. Gauss is still handling the duties of Consul General. After the instructions from Washington arrive in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss may hold the swearing-in ceremony for his position as Minister at the U.S. Consulate General in this city.

### Hungarian Community Prepares to Celebrate National Day

The Hungarian community in this city will hold a grand gathering on the 15th to celebrate their country's National Day. This year, the Hungarian people attach even greater importance to this festival because it marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of King Matthias and the 20th anniversary of the election of Horthy as Regent of Hungary. The celebration program is as follows: At 8:30 am, Hungarian expatriates will gather at the Pushi Road Church for a celebration ceremony. At 9:00 pm, a concert will be held at the American Women's Club. All proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Hungarian Relief Association.

Note: The Republic of Hungary was established on November 23, 1918, with Mr. Károlyi as its first president. On March 22 of the following year, a so-called Bolshevik government was established, but it was immediately overthrown by Romania. On March 23, 1920, Hungary officially established a new government and elected Horthy as regent.

### Residents Outside the Settlement Refuse to Pay Municipal Taxes; Water Supply Cut Off; Tax Payment Issue Not Included in Agreement; Fessenden Refuses to Comment on the Matter

According to the Continental Daily News, incidents have occurred in the area outside the Settlement where roads were built, in which residents refused to pay municipal taxes, leading to the cutoff of their water supply. Yesterday (the 8th), the reporter asked Mr. Fessenden, the Secretary-General and Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, about this matter, and asked whether the water cutoff situation in the area had become more prevalent in the past two months. Mr. Fessenden replied that he could not comment on this issue. As for whether some residents in the area refused to pay taxes to the Municipal Council because they had already paid taxes to the "Shanghai Municipal Government," he also could not say. The issue of tax payment in the area outside the Settlement where roads were built was not included in the agreement recently reached between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government." The reporter asked whether the tax issue would be resolved outside the scope of the agreement, and Mr. Fessenden said that he could not comment on this point either. However, he could inform the reporter that the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" were currently conducting "verbal discussions" regarding the water cutoff incidents involving residents of the extremely small Non-Fei Road Meicun Lane and Sancheng Lane (both transliterated) due to their failure to pay municipal taxes.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year

—Music Team

The draft budget for the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team for this year has been submitted to the Music Committee, which met on February 15 to review it. The total budget is 236,130 yuan, which is 49,770 yuan more than last year. Except for the "travel expenses" item, which is 1,270 yuan less than last year, all other items are more than last year. "Salaries and allowances" increased by 55,600 yuan, "medicines, transportation, water, electricity, and fuel" increased by 4,230 yuan, "advertising, printing, and stationery" increased by 2,500 yuan, "new sheet music" increased by 1,100 yuan, "instrument repairs" increased by 3,000 yuan, and "maintenance and repairs" increased by 1,340 yuan, totaling an increase of 67,770 yuan. After deducting the amount to be audited and the estimated increase in income this year, the net increase is 49,770 yuan. The reasons for the increase in various expenditures are roughly similar to the situation everywhere.

The team's income for this year includes the following items: (1) Grant from the French Municipal Council: 20,100 yuan; (2) Grant from the French authorities: 20,000 yuan; (3) Grant from the Italian government: 20,690 yuan; (4) Fees for private services: 150 yuan; (5) Concert ticket revenue: 9-1,300 yuan.

The total budget for the team this year is 36,1210 yuan, exceeding the per capita annual limit (200,000 yuan) for the chief accountant. Therefore, the finance director proposed using the team's reserve fund and appropriately increasing the price of concert tickets to make up for the shortfall.

The committee members have agreed to increase ticket prices, but the implementation date will be at the beginning of this year's summer concerts.

Regarding the fees for privately hiring the band, the committee members unanimously agreed that the current fees were too low and should be appropriately increased. It was then decided that (1) a surcharge of 50% should be added to all fees for privately hiring the band, as well as for transporting instruments and vehicles; (2) the free practice session should be canceled immediately. From now on, fees should be charged at half the rate of the full fee schedule for formal performances.

To reduce the budget for this year, the team's reserve fund will not be fully used, and the reserve fund that can be obtained from this year's budget will also be transferred for use.

Finally, the committee members resolved that the music team's budget for this year should be revised to within the limit of 200,000 yuan and submitted to the Finance Committee for review.

### British Expatriate Pan Lai Missing

According to the Continental Daily News, police sources in this city reported last night (the 8th) that Pan Lai, a well-known British expatriate working for the Shanghai Power Company, has been missing for several days.

### Conte Rosso Arrives in Shanghai from Europe; Speed Increased En Route; Carrying a Large Number of Passengers

The Conte Rosso, a special express liner of the Italian National Steamship Company's Europe-Asia line, departed from Conis on the 9th of last month to come to the Far East. It was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of this month. A few days ago, due to heavy fog at sea, the ship was affected by heavy fog on the way from Little Luzon to Hong Kong, which reduced the rate. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 5th, but was delayed until the 6th. It left Hong Kong at 6 pm that afternoon and headed north, and was expected to arrive in the port yesterday morning. All circumstances have been reported previously. It is now known that the ship saw clear seas on the way from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and the shipowner ordered an increase in speed. Therefore, it entered Wusongkou at 3:30 pm the day before yesterday and docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at 5:30 pm. There were a total of 935 passengers, including more than 400 Chinese crew members returning from Germany and more than 100 Jews. They were transferred in batches to small steamships to disembark at the New Customs Wharf. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Europe tomorrow morning at 8 am. Because it arrived late, it will also be changed to depart from the pier and export at 8 am on the 11th to return to Venice. Passengers are scheduled to go to the New Customs Wharf at 9 pm tonight to take the company's prepared passenger shuttle boat to the big ship. The Java Mail Ship Company's Cibadak Mail Ship, which came to Shanghai from Surabaya this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 11th. Now it is said that it will be delayed by one day and arrive on the 12th.

### Tragic Incident on Avenue Albert Yesterday; Weng Guangtian Stabbed to Death; Died of Three Stab Wounds; Two Assailants Fled Without a Trace

A stabbing murder occurred on Avenue Albert in the French Concession at around 9:00 am yesterday. The victim was Weng Guangda from Ningbo, the deputy manager of the Ningshao Fire and Marine Insurance Company in this port. He was stabbed in the head, back of the head, right face, and back, etc., bleeding profusely. The two assailants abandoned their knives and fled. The injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment but died in the afternoon. The details are recorded below:

Employed by Ningshao for Three Years

Weng Guangtian from Ningbo, 42 years old, has been the deputy manager of the Ningshao Fire and Marine Insurance Company and the Ningshao Shipping Company on the third floor of Jianhua Bank, No. 86 Jiangxi Road and Ningbo Road, for more than three years. His wife, Zhu Caijun (41 years old), currently lives in his hometown, while Weng lives at the above address with his concubine, Jiang Wenying (32 years old, from Ningbo). His son, Weng Kainian, is 24 years old and is currently studying in the political science department of Fudan University.

Suddenly Attacked on the Way to Work Yesterday Morning

Weng lived at No. 18 Baolongfang, Avenue Albert, in the French Concession. At around 9:10 am yesterday morning, Weng was dressed in Chinese clothing and took his own chartered car as usual. The driver, Yuan Weizheng (alias A Si, 26 years old) from Jiangbei, drove him to the company to work. Unexpectedly, before he had gone a few steps, in front of Zhao Ji Garment Shop, No. 3 in the lane, two thugs wearing black short coats suddenly appeared. One grabbed the car shaft, and the other showed a sharp triangular pointed knife. Without asking why, they stabbed Weng three times, once in the left back bone, once on the right side of the face below the eye, and once in the back of the head. The wounds were very deep, and blood gushed out. Weng endured the pain and got out of the car, and quickly fled home.

Driver Trapped; Assailants Flee

At this moment, another thug threw a bag of incense ash at the head and eyes of the chartered car driver, Yuan Weizheng. The incense ash powder hit his eyes directly, causing the driver to be unable to open his eyes. The assailants took the opportunity to abandon their knives and flee the lane. By the time the nearby police learned of the incident and arrived, the assailants had long since disappeared.

Died of Three Stab Wounds

Weng fled home and was accompanied by his concubine, Jiang Wenying (22 years old), in a chartered car to the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Avenue Joffre. Because the sanatorium did not have an emergency room, they transferred to the Red Cross Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 1:20 pm. Weng's chartered car driver, Yuan Weizheng, along with the recovered murder weapon, were taken back to the police station for strict interrogation.

Previous Lawsuit Due to Discord with Subordinates

Weng had previously had disagreements with employees of the company. In January of this year, all the employees jointly sent a letter to the board of directors attacking Weng very harshly. At that time, Weng reported to the police station, accusing certain employees of the company of defamation. The details were reported in this newspaper. After the court trial, they were declared innocent. The cause of this sudden death is still under investigation.

### Melting Copper Coins for Profit; Three Convicts Sentenced

Yongtaichang Copper and Tin Shop, No. 825 Beijing Road, is owned by Wu Haitang from Shaoxing and managed by Zhang Bingkun. Recently, seeing that the price of all goods has soared, especially the price of lead, they were blinded by greed and ignored the consequences. They instructed the shop assistants to collect old-fashioned copper coins widely and entrusted the Xiexing Furnace Workshop, No. 8, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, run by Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin from Shaoxing, to melt the copper coins for them, at a rate of 18 yuan per dan, and then sell the copper bars at a high price. The matter was discovered by Yang Feizhang, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station, who went to Xinzha Road and confiscated a large bag of copper coins, totaling 7,800 coins, and 13 copper bars. He then went to Yongtaichang on Beijing Road and arrested the shop assistant Li Guilin and the apprentice Jiang Qingrong, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the Second Criminal Court for a further interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, requested that Jiang Darong be released first because he was not involved. The other three defendants were prosecuted according to Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Against the Currency System. When the defendants were questioned, their confessions were evasive. After verifying the confessions, Judge Chuan sentenced Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin to two years of imprisonment each for jointly destroying copper coins, Li Guilin to one year of imprisonment, and Jiang Qingrong was released. The copper coins and other items were confiscated.

Zhu Desheng from Ningbo, a former leather craftsman, is 48 years old this year. When he was 21 years old, he met Zhang A Si from Shaoxing, a hairdresser, in Hangzhou. She is 51 years old this year.

Unexpectedly, Zhu Desheng has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang A Si in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, seeking a separation. Yesterday afternoon, the court accepted the case and Judge Yu Changzi opened the court for trial. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Du Xi, said that the two parties have been living together for 27 years and have a contract. Recently, because the plaintiff was satiated and thinking of lewdness, and frolicked in the brothels, quarrels often arose. The defendant originally intended to appear in court today, but unexpectedly the two had another fight this morning, causing the defendant to be injured and arrested and sent to the hospital, so she could not appear in court. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected. After verifying the situation, the court ordered that the case be postponed to the 27th to see if the plaintiff and defendant both appear in court for interrogation. Because the two had a fight yesterday, the police have detained Zhu and will send him to court for interrogation tomorrow.

### Trust Companies to Confer on Open Seal Storage Fees

The member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association and the Foreign Exchange Banks Association have decided to implement the collection of open seal storage fees starting from the 7th and have jointly sent letters to the Qian industry seeking their opinions. The Qian Industry Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss this matter. It was resolved that the number of open seal storage businesses handled by various Zhuang (native banks) is not large, so there is no need to establish rules for fee collection. It is heard that among the Qian Zhuang, only Fuyuan Qian Zhuang has storage vaults and safety deposit boxes for rent, while the others only have warehouses and no storage vault facilities. According to inquiries made by a Da Guang News Agency reporter in the financial sector, the Qian industry has decided not to consider the issue of collecting open seal storage fees. However, those currently planning to follow in the footsteps of the Sino-foreign commercial banks are more than twenty trust companies, including Tongyi, Zhongyi, Huanqiu, Shengda, Guoan, Dalu, Shanghai, Zhongwai, Zhongji, Zhongguo, Dongnan, Haian, Tonghai, Huaye, etc. These companies will soon hold a joint meeting to discuss the matter of collecting open seal storage fees, and it is understood that these trust companies handle a large amount of this storage business, so they will definitely decide to implement the fee collection.

(Sending Grass Eight Characters) Big Six Clash and Small Six Clash, Year and Geng avoid the same; Ask if your eight characters are true or false, Lying matchmakers waste their hard work.

Wine and food are plentiful to satisfy the old glutton, Deliberately declining and deliberately inviting; Count thirteen and a half from the beginning, Remember to water the plum root decidedly.

### The Origin of Arbor Day

— Zhang Mengzhao

The annual Arbor Day is coming soon. Do you children know the origin of "Arbor Day"? If you know, that's great, but if you don't, reading this article of mine will tell you.

In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing government stipulated that Qingming Day in the lunar calendar should be "Arbor Day." From provincial officials to county magistrates, they must lead their subordinates to the suburbs on this day to plant saplings of phoenix trees, willows, pines, cypresses, etc., with the meaning of "cultivating people and cultivating trees." Other agencies, schools, and organizations across the country also selected parks and other places to plant trees, seeking green shade. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government was formally established in Nanjing and changed the 12th of March, the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang, to "Arbor Day," on the one hand holding tree planting ceremonies, and on the other hand commemorating the founding father of the Republic of China, to encourage future generations to emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of arduous struggle.

Children! Your fathers and brothers are cultivating you with their blood and sweat, and the nation's national education is nurturing you. You should study harder and work harder. In the crucible of national crisis, temper a strong physique, excellent talent, and a brave spirit, and wait for the completion of the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. This is what the author earnestly hopes for!

### Anecdotes from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Childhood

— Yong

The day after tomorrow (March 12th) is again the anniversary of the death of our national father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Schools will be closed for a day as usual. Are the holidays given to you children to give you more opportunities to play? No, this is to call on you to recall all the great achievements made by Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, and to use them as a guide for your studies and actions. Let me give an anecdote about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's childhood, which can also leave a deeper impression in your minds.

One day, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, being idle, suddenly thought of a question: "When a person dies, is his life over?" He asked his mother this question. His mother said, "Of course it's over." But Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "If he can do some earth-shattering things in his lifetime, then even if he dies, is everything over?"

Once, Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to Honolulu with his brother, passing through Macau. Macau at that time was completely different from the isolated island it is today. Everywhere was misleading, with gambling dens and opium dens springing up like mushrooms after rain. For this reason, he advised his brother not to land.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already established such ambitions in his childhood, so his later success as a great man and being admired can be said to be a pre-ordained harvest.

### Periscope

— Jin Zhen

The curtain of the European war has been opened for nearly half a year. Naval battles on the ocean surface are also exceptionally fierce. The warring parties are competitively publicizing their victories in newspapers with news such as "submarines sinking warships" and "destroyers chasing submarines."

"Brother, submarines are lurking in the water, how can they sink other people's warships?" Ah Hui saw this news but knew nothing about the content of submarines, so she asked Ah Ming.

"Although submarines operate in the water, they know everything on the water surface clearly. That is because of their periscope, which protrudes above the water. So the periscope is the eye of the submarine. If it doesn't have it, it is as useless as a blind person. After observing other people's warships through the periscope, they use mathematical principles to measure. The distance between the warship and itself, the angle, the speed of the warship, the tonnage (that is, the size of the ship), etc., are calculated very precisely. Then, they quickly aim at the warship and launch a torpedo of the appropriate size - an underwater bomb. When the torpedo hits the warship's hull, there will be a boom, hitting the vital point, and the warship will slowly sink." Ah Ming explained the situation of the submarine sinking the warship in general.

Ah Hui asked even more inquisitively: "Then how is a periscope constructed?"

"The construction of a periscope is entirely based on the principles of light transmission and reflection in optics. To manufacture a periscope, you only need five pieces of glass - three convex lenses, and when you encounter a triangular prism, it will be refracted and reflected, and after passing through two convex lenses, it will be reflected from the triangular prism again, and then it can be projected into people's eyes. The image seen is exactly the same as the original. If the length of the periscope is longer, that is, the path that the light travels is longer, then the things we see will be smaller, so the glass used must be very accurate, otherwise it may be blurry. The periscope has a certain length, the highest is twenty meters (slightly equal to sixty feet), if it is longer than this limit, the image seen is very small, and it is even more unclear in dark weather. The periscopes used in submarines are more complex and refined, but the essence is the same." Ah Ming went on to say: "We have nothing to do today, let's make a simple periscope ourselves." Ah Hui was of course very happy.

Ah Ming went to find two square pieces of mirror and a piece of corrugated paper. First, he folded the corrugated paper into a square, and then cut the ends into long curved shapes. He painstakingly installed two pieces of mirror on the two corners, but the angle formed by the paper box must be carefully observed so that the light reflected by this piece of mirror must be on the other piece, and the other piece can be reflected from the gap into people's eyes, otherwise it is useless. In less than an hour, the periscope was completed. When playing, as long as you put something near the gap at the top, you can see the same image as that thing in the gap at the bottom. "This toy is so fun!" Everyone in Ah Hui's family was saying this. And Ah Hui also thoroughly understood the principle of the periscope.

### How the Americas Got Their Name

— Cao Lingyou

Children! When you read world geography, you must know that among the five continents there is the Americas. The Americas are the continents of the Western Hemisphere, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, narrow at both ends and with an isthmus in the center, which divides them into North and South America. But I think your geography textbooks rarely tell you how the Americas got their name, so let me tell you here!

As early as 1451, a Spaniard named Amerigo Vespucci was born. When he grew up, he was a beef merchant, and later turned to the shipping business. After several voyages, he accepted the appointment of the King of Portugal to make a long expedition to what is now Brazil. He set out in May 1501 and sailed for three months in the raging ocean before seeing the coast of Brazil. Later, a terrible hurricane sent them to the uninhabited South Georgia Island, which is hundreds of miles east of Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America and was the southernmost place that people had reached at that time. From here, drifting ice floes sent them back to Lisbon, Portugal, in September 1902.

Amerigo was a person with writing talent. He wrote the journey he went through into booklets, strongly stating that the places they passed through were indeed a new continent. He wrote vividly, which aroused the attention of many people and was translated into many languages. These books were passed to Germany. At that time, a young scholar was about to publish a new geography book. He described Amerigo's discovery in the book and suggested calling the place America - meaning the land of Amerigo, to commemorate its discoverer. No one objected to this suggestion, but at first it only referred to the area around Brazil, but later, due to widespread application, the word "America" became the name of the entire South and North America.

### Quotes from Dr. Sun Yat-sen

Money is not always useful. The most important thing is "loyalty."

Besides revolution, I only like to read. I cannot live without reading for a day.

We aspire to do great things, not to be high officials.

The method of achieving profound learning is not only to learn what the teacher teaches in the classroom every day, but also to infer three corners from one corner and expand it yourself. Outside the classroom, you must pay more attention to self-study. (Recorded from Sun Yat-sen's Stories by Ma Meibo)

### Black Brothers (9)

— Yimu

Then he continued: "Whoever can climb to the top of the mountain where the Golden River originates and pour three drops of holy water on its source, then for him, only for him, this river will truly become a golden river. But the first time must not fail. After one failure, the second time will not succeed. If someone pours unholy water into the river, then that water will submerge his body and immediately turn him into a black stone." After the King of the Golden River finished speaking, he turned around and strode into the raging fire of the stove; his body turned red, then white, and after a while it became sparkling and transparent, and finally disappeared.

Geller hurriedly rushed over, looked up at the chimney, watched the King of the Golden River evaporate and disappear, and then shouted: "Ga! Ya! Qi Ah, Qi Ah! My pot! My pot! My pot!"

Just as the King of the Golden River disappeared, Siwa and Hans stumbled into the house, drunk and yelling. They saw that the dishes had all turned into nothing, but instead of blaming themselves for their drunkenness and absurdity, they blamed Geller and beat him for a while, for a full quarter of an hour, and then each fell into a chair, asking Geller if he had anything to say. Geller did not dare to neglect, and hurriedly repeated what the King of the Golden River had said. Neither of them believed a word, and they started beating Geller again, until their arms were tired, and then they stopped and went to bed.

The next morning, they suddenly believed Geller's words again, but who of the two should try first became a difficult problem. They argued for a long time, and finally drew their knives to duel each other. The sound of the duel alarmed the neighbors, who hurriedly came to persuade them, but they were unwilling to listen and continued to fight. The neighbors had no choice but to call the police.

As soon as Hans heard that the police were coming, he immediately ran away and hid; but Siwa was arrested by the officials. The judge fined him for disturbing the peace, but he had already drunk all his last money that night and could not pay, so he was sent to prison to be imprisoned until he could come up with the money before he could be released.

Hans was overjoyed when he heard that Siwa had been imprisoned, and decided to rush to the Golden River immediately. How to get holy water was a problem. He went to the pastor to discuss, but the pastor refused to give him holy water because he was a rogue. Hans had no choice but to wait until evening prayer, when he went to participate for the first time, pretending to draw a cross on his chest, stole a cup of holy water, and returned home triumphantly.

Nothing happened overnight. Early the next morning, before the sun had risen, Hans got up. He put the holy water in a bottle, and also carried two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket on his back, and took a climbing stick and went to the mountain.

As he was leaving the village, he passed by the prison and looked at the iron window, and saw Siwa peeking out, his face showing an uneasy expression. Hans smiled coldly and asked, "Good morning, brother, do you have any messages for me to pass on to the King of the Golden River's mother?" Siwa hated him so much that he gnashed his teeth and shook the iron bars on the iron window with all his strength, but they did not move at all. Hans laughed for a while, then carried the basket on his back again and walked away happily.

### The Art of Listening (2)

Have you ever listened to what your conscience tells you? A person's character can make a sound, and morality also has a sound. Only those who know how to listen can hear it. Conscience is the master. A person's will depends on the sound his conscience makes. Whether one acts righteously or evilly, walks the path of chastity or the path of depravity, his conscience understands everything. If someone does not know whether he is acting righteously, then morally speaking, he must be a fool. Each of our consciences tells us, "This is the way to go, go on!" When we read history, we know that whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, those who can achieve great things all come from listening to the words of their conscience. All great scientists, religious figures, philosophers, and politicians are like this. Jesus speaks of the principle of "listening" here to cultivate the art of "listening." We must listen to the voice of conscience. "He who has ears, let him hear." Listen, what a tragic thing it is for a person to make himself deaf in morality! People can survive without sight, hearing, or even smell. Many disabled people in the world are like this, but they cannot survive without a sense of right and wrong. People can see, hear, feel, smell, and use various senses, but without a sense of right and wrong, how strange is that? Doing evil things without feeling pain or having a sense of guilt, such a person can only be counted as a human corpse, not a person. Because his heart is dead. As the saying goes, "If a person has no heart, he dies; if a vegetable has no heart, it turns yellow." How can his life progress? Without progress, of course, he is only considered dead. We must listen to the sound of truth, light, and glory that comes from our inner heart. If we are true to ourselves and do not deceive ourselves, we will understand that this is appropriate. This inner heart is the kingdom of heaven that Jesus said God descended into us. We must listen carefully, and at the same time we must listen carefully to the sounds from outside. It is easy to make the mistake of being deaf to the needs, difficulties, and sorrows of others. We must know that living in the world, only caring about oneself and not being considerate of others, such a life will never be happy. Because humans are social animals, and they are mutually related to each other, they cannot survive alone. Therefore, we listen carefully to the voice of conscience, and at the same time we must listen carefully to the sounds from outside. The Apostle Paul listened to the voice from outside, "Come to Damascus and help us," (To be continued)

### A Record of a Retired Female Tanci Singer: A Little History in the World of Storytelling

— Dong Yun

"In the world of storytelling, there's a distinction between the 'Su School' and the 'Hai School'. The Su School is called 'Guangyu Society', and the Hai School is called 'Runyu Society'. For thirty years, they were equals, but with deep-seated prejudices! Later, a 'Puyu Society' rose, with both men and women; the members of Guangyu and Runyu societies naturally opposed 'women storytelling', and because of this, the two societies stood on the same 'male storytelling' front, dissolving the past private biases invisibly. This is also a small vicissitude in the world of storytelling, which those who discuss books and specialize in anecdotes in the future must know.

Four or five years ago was the peak of the Puyu Society, but in recent years it has returned from brilliance to plainness! There are several reasons for the failure: First, there were too few talented people in the society; apart from Wang Yanyu's "Pearl Pagoda" and Shen Libin's "Double Phoenix Pearls," there were few books worth listening to. Second, the management of the society was not effective; often there were good venues, but they couldn't be seriously operated; the past "Zhongnan" and "Dazhong" locations were lost in this way. Third, there were too few members, which was insufficient to distribute, making it difficult to seek development. Its strength was not equal to that of Guangyu and Runyu societies; few could be called 'resonating actors', and listening again and again to the same performers inevitably led to boredom! There are many other reasons that cannot be enumerated. If this continues without improvement, the Puyu Society, established through arduous struggle, will eventually be eliminated! When discussing the girls of Puyu, one must first count Zui Yixian and Shen Yuying, and Zhou Xueyan is also a barely satisfactory one, but all three have retreated into seclusion and no longer easily show their beauty to the public!

Zui Yixian's original surname was Jin, and her storytelling skills were passed down from her brother, Ni Chang. A certain gentleman's poem, "Everyone says her brother taught her the wonders, the Jin family's little sister is the most famous," refers to this. She grew up with balanced features and a dignified appearance. Five years ago, she first revealed her beauty in the storytelling circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, her braids fluttering, looking like a beauty in a painting. She performed "Double Phoenix Pearls" with her brother, speaking clearly and singing sweetly, captivating not only with her beauty. To be fair, Zui Yixian is beautiful, but in terms of 'charm', she is not as good as Shen Yuying. Shen Yuying's appearance is not absolutely stunning, but she has a kind of endearing demeanor. A smile from Ying Ning generates a hundred charms, her pipa playing is exquisite, unparalleled for a time! Following her father, Libin, in performing "Double Phoenix Pearls", she appeared at the Great World as a "child storyteller" twelve or thirteen years ago, causing a sensation. Her speaking is not as good as Zui Yixian's, but her singing surpasses it. With the pipa hiding her face, her charming smile captivates the city. When she sings softly, she drives countless listeners in the audience mad! Now, the famous flower has its master, and this tune has not been played for a long time.

Zhou Xueyan is the daughter of Zhou Runquan. She sings "Civil and Martial Fragrant Ball", her voice is hoarse but able to maintain its 'glutinousness'. Her beauty and skill are slightly inferior to Zui and Shen; her speech is clever, and both her speaking and singing have unique qualities. A smile from the side also has a unique charm! She is probably used to telling the story of 'private engagement in the back garden,' so at the age of fifteen, she couldn't resist the spring flowers and autumn moon! It has been more than two years since her disappearance. It is said that she was found last year, but she is not prepared to make a comeback. Puyu Society has felt a lack of talent this year. Since the retirement of the three beauties, the society, known for its beautiful talents, has felt even more lonely and desolate.

### How Hu Die Lost Weight

— Hai Xing

Recently, in the publicly shown "Peerless Beauty," the audience saw that Hu Die had lost weight. How did she lose weight? According to Wang Yin, who recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, "Hu Die, in order to lose weight, not only took medicine, but also didn't eat anything containing fat. She even only ate a small wine cup of rice per meal. Although her stomach was painfully hungry, she always endured it." (Ping's note) Among the readers, there must be many who feel too fat. If you want to lose weight, you might as well imitate this method. But there are many weight loss methods. If readers have better methods, please send them to this publication, which will be happy to publish them. At the same time, there are also many thin people who always want to gain weight, so that their muscles gradually develop. We also hope that everyone will share these weight gain methods.

### On Three Kunling Male Impersonators from Shanghai Performing in Beiping

— Chen Lin

In the early years, there were many outstanding talents among the Kunling male impersonators in the North, such as En Xiaofeng and Xiao Lanying. Their singing and acting were as good as those of general famous actors. In recent years, among the female performers in the North, there have only been those in the dan (female) roles, and since Meng Xiaodong, there have been no outstanding talents in male impersonation. Last year, the Kunqu amateur Li Yingxiu from Shanghai went north with her teacher Chen Xiuhua. Following her, Chou Ledi, who had been performing in small theaters, also went to Beiping with her father, Chou Yuexiang. This spring, Zhang Wenjuan followed suit. These three have successively performed in Beiping, bringing excitement to the northern paradise, which had long lacked Kunling male impersonators.

Chou Ledi

Among these three, she has the longest history of studying opera and is the most qualified. Her father, Yuexiang, was Meng Xiaodong's first teacher. Because Ledi comes from a family of opera performers, she has advantages over Li and Zhang in many areas, such as "diction" and "martial arts skills," which are indeed better than the others. Ledi's voice is exceptionally good, and she can sing in the "B" key, but unfortunately, it has a slightly feminine tone, which is difficult to compare with Meng Xiaodong's "cloud-covered moon" voice, but otherwise it is generally good. After Ledi went to Beiping, she changed her name to "Meng Youdong." She performed at the Qingleyuan before Li and Zhang. Because she and Meng Xiaodong were sisters in the same profession, Xiaodong helped Ledi everywhere when she first started performing. Because Ledi has a good voice, her performance results are quite good.

Li Yingxiu

Although she is an amateur who has become a professional, her teacher Chen Xiuhua has a deep understanding of opera, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Yingxiu learned from Xiuhua and received her true teachings. She has now changed her name to "Li Shaohua" and is performing in Beiping. Li's voice is also good, no less than Ledi's. Although she is a latecomer, she studies diligently and shows great effort. However, her physique is getting fatter, which is a disadvantage for her appearance, and her movements are also less elegant as a result. However, Li's situation is better than the others, and she has formed a troupe to perform, recruiting famous actors, so she has a unique appeal.

Zhang Wenjuan

She came to Beiping later. Recently, she has just finalized her troupe and will perform soon. In terms of skill, Wenjuan is not as good as the previous two, but Wenjuan's voice is wide and broad, with very little feminine tone, which the others lack. Wenjuan is short in stature, which may not appeal to the people of the North. If she performs, her results may not be as good as Chou and Li. However, Wenjuan is very young and extremely intelligent, so her future development is unlimited. Wenjuan has now joined Zhang Rongkui's school. Rongkui's stage combat skills are unique and will surely be passed on to Wenjuan. Wenjuan has also sought advice from Yang Baozhong. Now that she has gone to Beiping, she may be taught by Rongkui and Baozhong.

### A Record of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

— Xin Ying

The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is the highest research institution for film art in the United States, and its location is in Hollywood. They routinely announce the list of award winners among the film workers in various departments of Hollywood for the past year. The announcement of this list is usually at the end of February. At the beginning of the new year, all the staff in the academy work particularly hard to evaluate the award-winning filmmakers. They hire experts to be responsible for the evaluation of the award winners in various departments. Not only is each one handled carefully, but they also adopt a fair attitude, without any personal bias. The evaluation work is kept strictly confidential beforehand, and the news will not be leaked. Only after the list is announced will it be confirmed who is on the list.

In terms of filmmakers, everyone believes that receiving the award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is a great honor. Therefore, before the list is announced, filmmakers who consider themselves to be award-winning hopefuls are stretching their necks and waiting for the early announcement of the list. As for people outside the Hollywood film circle, they usually make various predictions about the award-winning filmmakers beforehand, like gambling, you guess who will win, I guess who will win, and some people even bet on it! The closer the date of the announcement, the more tense the atmosphere, so recently, the issue of filmmakers winning awards has become a focus of attention for people in Hollywood.

### From Love to Family: Increased Wife Power is a Feature of Small Families, Success in Love is Not Success in Career

— Hua Sheng

Family in theory refers to a clan, because normally, clans are called families. As everyone knows, the family system in our country in the past was a large family system, where clans lived together. Later, small families appeared. This is especially evident in cities, with a husband and wife as the main body, unlike large families where a male or female elder controls the economy and manages all affairs.

After the small family appeared along with the development of some industries, many people stood up to support the small family, saying that the small family was good and the large family was not good. Especially women, who firmly advocated this. The reason is very simple: in a large family, a daughter-in-law has parents-in-law above her, and sisters-in-law and daughters beside her. It is not easy to be a person when everyone oppresses and jostles. Small families are much simpler, and even if there are parents-in-law, they no longer hold power. Women (wives) already have "economic power" and are more free than in large families, so naturally they will agree with small families. How can they still support large families? This is very reasonable.

Men also support small families and do not like large families. Because men in small families are freer than in large families and seem to be more independent. Although the ownership of children is relatively reduced, the ownership of women (wives) is increased - in large families, although the woman who is married is also his wife, the important thing is that she is the daughter-in-law of the parents-in-law, and may not belong to him personally, but mainly belongs to the family. Once in a small family, it seems that she completely belongs to him.

At this time, the idea of love also arose, and it became more important. It was felt that love marriage in a small family was the most ideal way. At this time, marriage often involved struggles between the parties involved and their parents for dominance, which were quite intense. Now, let's just talk about the parties involved in the marriage. The main reason is: love marriage, that is, couples with compatible personalities, are how important for personal (that is, career) achievements. It is said that if couples can truly cooperate, various careers will be easily successful and great careers will be easily achieved. If they are incompatible, nothing can be done successfully. Of course, there are other reasons as well.

In a small family, the compatibility of the personalities of the husband and wife is indeed more important than in a large family. In a large family, when quarrels arise, you can tell your mother-in-law, and there are many others who can mediate; when quarrels arise in a small family, there are fewer people to persuade and prohibit, so it is best not to quarrel. The compatibility of personalities becomes even more important. As for the relationship to career, of course there is a relationship. There is certainly a difference between having one more person to help and having one less person to help. However, to say that the success or failure of a career depends on having a good partner is really inaccurate, and to say that it is mainly due to this is also somewhat exaggerated. The success and failure of a career, whether large or small, is undoubtedly the result of extremely complex social relations, and many things are even related to international relations. People who work together on a career are all a part of the success, and even those who destroy or oppose it are included. The help of a spouse is only a part of it. The general public overestimates it, mostly because it is used to oppose old-fashioned marriages and advocate small family systems, especially to say that autonomous marriages are particularly good. Part of the reason, I think, comes from the movies imported from the United States. - Readers, don't think that I am opposed to individual autonomous marriage. I am not opposed to it at all, and I support it. The above words are just to restore it to its original appearance, and to explain that the success or failure of anything is not a matter for two people, but the result of social and even international relations - of course, this does not mean that personal efforts are therefore unnecessary.

### Various Marriage Problems in Shanghai

— Lao Shan

According to an advertisement in a certain weekly magazine, the number of marriages at the restaurant of the YMCA in Baxianqiao in 1936 was 98, which increased to 186 in 1938, almost doubling. This advertisement is not to show that the restaurant is auspicious, but to reflect that there are many marriages in troubled times. Not to mention this, let's first estimate the wedding banquet and other expenses consumed in Shanghai in the past year. Assuming that there are a total of 100,000 marriages throughout the year, and each marriage does not include the bride price or dowry, but only the banquet and reward expenses, and each family spends 1,000 yuan, then 100,000 new couples will cost 200 million yuan. Even if you cut it in half, it will still be 100 million yuan. This number is not small!

Parents in troubled times think that marrying off their children will fulfill their wishes, but sometimes a single thread of affection cannot tie down a couple. Being able to live peacefully on an isolated island can instead prompt children to disappear. Don't we often see advertisements in the newspapers looking for missing children? Most of them say: "Regarding marriage issues, your mother is not stubborn..." The paper tiger of "a hundred nights of affection for one night of marriage" has long been pierced by the sharp sword of "sin" in loveless marriages. Catching a pair of energetic young people, forcing them to marry, and forcing them to be confined to a small room (Shanghai has no homes, and new couples can only be wronged in small rooms), is as dangerous as wealthy old men in China in the past teaching their sons to smoke opium, so that they are mentally exhausted and do not go out to gamble. Of course, there are many examples in the world where good intentions are rewarded, but the good intentions of forcing children to marry only get bad rewards and will never get good rewards.

Secondly, there are young men and women who are in love and can get married, and can get married in a way that is ceremonious and cost-effective, but generally parents who love face must put on a show, and even demand a certain amount of bride price and a certain amount of dowry. In this way, young people only have two paths. One path is to borrow money to get married, and after marriage, they spend every day like New Year's Eve, paying off debts. The other path is for young men and women to fly away, giving their parents the reward of losing both people and money.

Shanghai is not New York, and there are no news about trial marriages; Shanghai is not Paris, and there are no newspapers manipulated by marriage agencies. Shanghai is, after all, a Chinese city. Although there are 1940s cars and 28-story Western-style buildings, the inner layer is still wrapped in the temperament of a feudal society, and new ideas are developing at the same time. The above-mentioned marriage phenomena are not inexplicable strange phenomena, but reflect one side of the entire Chinese social phenomenon.

A True Record

### It Is Difficult to Know Until You Have Experienced It: An Unsatisfactory Marriage Produces Satisfactory Results

— Qi Xun

I myself do not deny that I was also a young man who was induced by the objective environment to oppose "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers." I myself had no love interest, but I was unwilling to accept the marriage arranged by my parents. However, my opposition was not thorough. Under the thought of not being able to violate my parents' wishes, I finally accepted the "order" and "words" half-heartedly.

After the marriage was completed, this lady was indeed very far from the typical woman in my ideal. Not only was she stubborn and money-grubbing, but her dress was also out of date. Her short hair, blue cloth shirt, black silk skirt, white socks, and black cloth shoes were a modern student style in the countryside, but after arriving in Shanghai, it was difficult to integrate with the people of Shanghai society. Therefore, cloth, silk stockings, and high heels were constantly bought for her. However, unexpectedly, not only did I not gain her favor, but I also received many criticisms, such as: "You must know the days when you have no money when you have money, and think of the days when you have it when you have no it. You can't seek temporary beauty, you have to think about a permanent life is the truth..." In the past two years, I don't know how many quarrels and cries have arisen from this kind of thing. However, although she does not pursue fashion and is not as good at socializing as the virtuous wives of my friends, she manages the housework in an orderly manner without any disorder.

The days passed day by day, and the baptism of the great era produced many deformed scenes on the isolated island. The prices of daily necessities soared, making salary earners in danger of starvation. Since August last year, I have been in sorrow every day, but she has used various methods to comfort my heart every day, and also took out the money that she had secretly saved from the household money that I gave her every month, as evidence, to prepare for subsidizing life in the future. In two years, there were actually more than 300 yuan. In addition to joy, looking back at my friends who married fashionable women, only ate and did not work, resulting in high debts, my nerves were severely stimulated, and my spirit, my reason, my actions, and my personality had undergone great changes! My hatred for my wife has turned into respect and love! The distance between her in my heart and the typical woman in my heart in the past is very far. When I have sleepless nights and toss and turn in the quilt, I regret that I should not have hated her in the past, I can't help but shed tears, looking at her sleeping face, I kiss her lightly and stroke her hair.

From then on, the above-mentioned new and old theories and goals about marriage in society have become a mystery in my heart. I can't understand it with my reason alone, and I can't weigh the pros and cons. I have to tell the facts that I have experienced for people to refer to. If I resolutely opposed not marrying her, my life would not be so stable.

### The Origin of Group Weddings: October 30 is Group Wedding Day, the Effect of Chinese Group Weddings

— Ying Dai

In the history of mankind, whether there were group weddings in ancient times is unknown because I can't find any reference materials for the time being. But when we talk about group weddings, we think of the group weddings that have been popular in various countries in recent years, which originated in Italy. Since Mussolini came to power in Italy, in order to rapidly increase the population of Italy, he has spared no effort to encourage the marriage movement. In order to remedy the inability of the poor to marry, it is stipulated that October 30 of each year is the day for group weddings. New couples participating in group weddings do not need to spend much money, which is an economical method.

In the past, the Shanghai municipal government, seeing that many citizens were extravagant in marriage, with the rich spending countless money and the poor going into debt because of marriage, and even being unable to do so due to face, also advocated group weddings, with the mayor officiating the wedding. Married men and women who joined only had to pay a dress fee of ten yuan, and there were no other expenses. The ceremony was both grand and economical, so when the first group wedding was held on April 14, the number of new couples who joined was more than 100 pairs. After that, it was held once a month, and later it was held every two months. Each time it was held, many new couples participated.

Due to Shanghai's advocacy in the past, the county governments in various places also followed suit in organizing group weddings, and Shanghai has not interrupted them until the Republic of China in 1927. It was not until the "August 13" Shanghai war broke out that the municipal authorities, after three and a half months of war, retreated to the interior with the Chinese army, resulting in the interruption of group weddings. Not long after, Shanghai discovered several group wedding service agencies and group wedding agency offices, which organized group weddings. In addition, various hometown associations also organized hometown group weddings after the war.

Strange Marriage Customs

### Interesting Marriage Customs

— Youren

Speaking of marriage customs, various countries have their own peculiar and strange practices. Now, let me write about the most interesting marriage customs from across the oceans for you readers to discuss during your leisure time:

Marriage Week

In the area of Brittany, their marriage custom involves an annual "Marriage Week." During this period, the general population traditionally suspends work, and women awaiting marriage prepare their dowries a month before the festival. Men awaiting marriage must return home, and then men visit the women's families to propose. However, the women must hide themselves, and the men must search extensively to find them. This is said to train the groom's patience in love.

Courting on Horseback

Before the revolution, Mexicans often won their sweethearts on horseback. According to their customs, a man proposing marriage would dress in splendid attire on a bright, moonlit midnight, hold a cigar in his mouth, carry a stringed instrument, ride a steed to the outside of his sweetheart's residence, and serenade her with songs to express his feelings and move her heart. If successful, the marriage would be arranged. Otherwise, the man would turn his horse around, lower his head, and return home, becoming a defeated loser.

Groping in the Dark

The people of this place, on the eve of the wedding, require the groom to grope for his bride in the dark bridal chamber. During the wedding, the bride must wear a veil, and she is not allowed to open her eyes until she sits on the nuptial bed. When she goes to her new home, she must keep her eyes tightly closed during the journey, guided by two relatives, one holding her hand and the other supporting her head. Many others follow her with lanterns and candles. This kind of marriage custom truly has a unique flavor.

Mother Makes the Decision

Among the Bororo Indians in central Brazil, the union of marriage is somewhat different. The proposal does not originate from the man's idea, nor from the woman's, but from the woman's mother. This method is somewhat similar to the practice of a man being adopted into the wife's family in our country, but their meanings are different. Therefore, many scholars now support their method, and some even advocate that civilized countries imitate it. The method is that the woman's mother, in a public gathering, seeks out a suitable young man, and then invites him to her home to enjoy spicy food. When this young man attends the feast, he must go with his own mother. If he finds the woman agreeable, he will try all the food and give the leftovers to his mother to eat. If his mother also expresses her agreement, she will eat a little as well, and then the marriage will be successful. Speaking of their wedding ceremony, it is also very simple. Four days before the wedding, the groom stays at the bride's house, but only stays; he cannot meet the bride until the fifth morning when they meet and sit in front of the thatched house, declaring the wedding complete. The groom's four-day residence is said to be a test of his temperament. Many people sympathize with and promote this simple wedding.

### Strange Marriage Customs in Binyang

— Mi Ruozhuo

Binyang—anyone who pays attention to news about the war, I think, won't be unfamiliar with this place name!

Regarding marriage, early marriage is prevalent in Binyang. Boys generally marry at sixteen, and girls at fourteen. Because they feel they are too young, on the wedding day, the bride and groom not only do not feel joyful, but instead reveal expressions of shame and fear everywhere, even resorting to evasion and hiding.

On the first day after the wedding, the bride stays at the groom's house, but the next morning, she returns to her parents' home. Afterwards, even during New Year's and other festivals, the bride remains at her own home. It is not until several years later that the groom's family goes to the bride's house. The family doesn't visit, or question, but is left to happen naturally. However, if the man decides to abandon his wife, he can sell her to others as a servant. Conversely, if she is dissatisfied with her husband, she can only adopt a passive non-cooperation strategy—never returning to her husband's house.

When a woman marries for the first time, the bride price is generally between sixty and one hundred yuan. However, when she remarries, the bride price doubles. But the income from the bride price when remarried does not go to the woman's family, but belongs to the man's family, because as mentioned above, when the man decides to abandon his wife, the man's family can sell her to others as a servant!

### Horrifying Marriage Customs: Only by Chopping Off Limbs Can a Marriage Be Approved

— Si

Kalichiuma Island, part of the West Indies, is an uncivilized island. The island produces large lizards and crocodiles, which the natives hunt and eat. Explorers have repeatedly risked venturing into this wilderness to explore for mineral deposits, but with no results.

Recently, Dr. Carson flew from the West Indies to the island to explore and suddenly discovered rich antimony ore deposits in the southern corner of the island.

According to Dr. Carson, when he arrived on the island by plane, it was the beginning of the rainy season. He witnessed some natives dancing and rejoicing in the drizzle. Their marriage customs are peculiar and horrifying. After a man and woman fall in love, the man's family gathers relatives and friends and rushes to the woman's house to seize the bride. The woman's family also gathers relatives and friends to resist. The fighting is quite fierce. The woman's family must capture one of the men from the groom's family alive and chop off his hand or foot. Then, the bride is allowed to be kidnapped by the groom's family. The woman's family places the severed limb on the altar and gathers to dance and make merry. The man from the groom's family who has his limb chopped off becomes disabled for life, and the bride and groom are responsible for his support.

### Novel Wedding Ceremonies

— Junmei

Simple and novel wedding ceremonies, if our memories serve us right, we can vaguely recall: perhaps ten years ago? Liu Peiquan, then commander of the Guangdong Air Force, held an aerial wedding in Shanghai. A pair of newlyweds flew in the sky, and the wedding was considered complete. This truly embodied the saying, "Wishing to be birds flying wing to wing in the heavens!"

Six or seven years ago, a novel wedding ceremony appeared before us again. It was Miss Xu, the daughter of Mr. Xu Zhuodai, and the son of Sun Yusheng, who held a wedding on the water. At that time, it stirred the whole city, and newspapers reported it widely as a beautiful story. However, not long ago, the "aquatic lovebirds" were completely overshadowed by Tarzan, Weismuller, and the famous socialite, Barbara Scott, who used the bottom of a swimming pool as their wedding hall. Although Tarzan is a king of the jungle on the screen, he was originally an active swimming champion. Therefore, he planned to hold the wedding underwater. Thus, the officiant and bridesmaids had to follow the newlyweds into the water for a "drowning" experience.

But novel wedding ceremonies are becoming more and more strange. Since the outbreak of the European War, in Poland and Finland, many young men and women, because they had to take up arms and serve in the rear, had to quickly complete the marriage procedures amidst the chaos of war. Therefore, holding wedding ceremonies in air-raid shelters became as common as bamboo shoots after the rain. It is said that this has also become commonplace in the southwestern inland of our country. "Wishing to be intertwined branches on the ground." Using an air-raid shelter as a wedding hall, with the sound of airplanes and the rumble of bombs, there is a unique feeling in the heart! I wonder what the young men and women, who are in the midst of the red lights and green wine of the isolated island, holding lavish weddings in the grand halls of hotels, would think of this novel wedding ceremony?

### Climbing Trees for Marriage

In some places in the Philippines, there remains an interesting and lovely marriage custom. When a pair of lovers are in love with each other and wish to pledge their eternal love, their parents find two large trees in the suburbs that are not too far apart, but must be roughly the same height, thickness, and appearance. On the predetermined auspicious day, the couple is asked to stand under the trees and ordered to climb from the roots to the tops of the trees. After climbing, the man stretches out his arms to embrace the woman's tree trunk, while the woman naturally tries her best to help her fiancé achieve this goal. When the tops of the two trees are joined together, the officiant standing under the trees solemnly announces that the wedding ceremony has been completed!

### Marriage Admonitions of the Golden Country

— Yin Zi

In America, built on a foundation of gold, young men and women do not use gold to solve their marriage problems. They generally adhere to a set of very ordinary admonitions:

For Men:

1. Do not marry a woman who has been divorced multiple times, nor marry a young and alluring woman.

2. Do not marry a frivolous woman.

3. Do not marry a woman who is obsessed with makeup and competing in beauty.

4. Do not marry with the goal of obtaining a woman's wealth.

5. Do not marry a woman who lacks domestic skills and possesses only beauty.

For Women:

1. Do not marry a man who is much younger than oneself.

2. Do not marry a man who drinks heavily and smokes.

3. Do not marry a man who is dissolute and idle without skills or a job, but unemployed people with skills are exceptions.

4. Do not marry a stingy man.

5. Do not marry a hypocritical and cruel man.

6. Do not reject marriage with a poor man.

### The Simplest and Most Reasonable Marriage System in the Soviet Union

— Qinghui

In the years immediately following the revolution in the Soviet Union, social order was not yet stable, and situations of promiscuity, promiscuity, and chaos in relationships between men and women were unavoidable. However, this abnormal state of affairs is now a thing of the past. Their love affairs are much more serious and proper than in our "land of propriety"! National laws stipulate that men and women are free to marry at the age of eighteen. The marriage procedure is extremely simple. As long as the man and woman go to the marriage registration office of the national administrative organ, pay a small fee, register, and they become an official couple.

In the Soviet Union, when a man gets married, it does not mean that he will bear a terrible family burden from then on, or that the woman must be bound by her husband. No! Absolutely not! In the Soviet Union, no husband can bind his wife, nor does any wife have to rely on her husband for support. Both parties are completely independent socially and economically.

As for divorce? It is not permitted without the consent of both parties and a valid reason. The divorce procedure is also a matter of registration.

After a divorce, the support of children is still shared by both parties. If one party earns a higher salary, that party contributes more.

If a woman becomes pregnant after marriage, maternity leave is her special right. During the leave, the agency where she works not only continues to pay her salary as usual, but also provides allowances. The maternity leave period is two months before childbirth and two months after childbirth, for a total of four months. All medical and healthcare expenses during childbirth are provided free of charge by the state.
