Chongqing: According to news here today, the Japanese troops in the Nanning-Qinzhou area have already expanded their area of operations. The area of operations of the Japanese troops in this area has formed a long rectangular pocket shape. The Longmen Port in Qinzhou Bay happens to be the exit of this pocket. The highway from northeast of Nanning to Binyang, the area where the war has become a tug-of-war, is the northern end of this pocket. The Ling Shan and upper reaches of the Qin River area constitute the eastern end of this pocket. The area near Shangsi, on the western side of the Yong-Qin Highway, is the western side of this pocket. The area within this rectangular area totals 360 square miles. A considerable number of Chinese guerrillas have infiltrated it to sabotage communications and transportation. The reason why the Japanese are extending eastward to Ling Shan and westward to Shangsi is clearly to attempt to control both sides of the Yong-Qin Highway, thereby protecting their lines of communication. The recent Japanese attack on Ling Shan took the route through Yongchun, which may be preparation for another attack on Binyang. (19th United Press dispatch)

### President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan Host Banquet for Representatives to National Education Conference; President Jiang's Instructions: Attention Should Be Paid to Restoring Ancient Chinese Educational Methods to Make Students Understand the Principles of Being Human and Develop Virtues

Chongqing: At 6:30 PM on the 19th, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Vice President Kong hosted a public banquet at the Yuan for representatives to the National Education Conference, and invited Wei Daoming, Chen Lifu, Jiang Tingfu, and senior officials from various departments of the Executive Yuan to accompany them. Over 70 people attended, including education directors and representatives from various provinces. During the banquet, President Jiang gave instructions, the general idea of which was that the purpose and all educational principles of our country have a consistent spirit. My personal opinions on education are the same as what I said at the National Education Conference last year. However, today's education, especially the fundamental national education, should pay special attention to restoring the ancient Chinese educational methods: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, to arm education. Our China, because of the past education, the education of the past two or three decades, everyone has not paid attention to this, so our spirit is not good, our physical strength is not good, and the general people are so poor, weak, stupid, and therefore the country has suffered such shame. Japan, on the other hand, has been able to absorb our ancient educational methods, so their people are physically stronger than us. Since the war of resistance, it has provided us with a good opportunity to avoid the environment of the large cities along the river and coast and go to the interior, naturally giving us the opportunity to restore ancient educational methods and arm education. If our education circles, responsible people, educators, and teachers cannot take this opportunity to correct previous mistakes and give full play to the effectiveness of education, they are truly the sinners of the nation. Secondly, in the future, in addition to science, students in schools must understand the principles of being human, and must be close to daily life. Zeng Wenzhenggong educated his children with eight characters, which included all daily life. Our students today must work hard on this. Every school should follow this principle, and do what they can according to the environment and objective situation, and pay special attention to loving animals and plants, and not allow animal abuse or the destruction of trees. This should be written in the national education textbook to cultivate students' virtues of benevolence and cherishing things. In short, the past education was a harmful education. If today's education does not bring students closer to daily life and teach students the skills of rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, everyone will be sinners of the country and nation. These are a few words I have added to my previous speech. I respectfully offer everyone a glass of wine and wish you good health. (19th dispatch)

Chen also gave a detailed explanation of the Ministry of Education's efforts to promote music education in recent years, and said that rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic are the spirit of our country's founding. Today, if we want to revitalize the atmosphere of despondency, decadence, depression, and disorganization, there is no other way than to restore music education. I sincerely hope that all representatives will pay attention to this. After the speech, he invited Ying Shangneng, Cai Shaoxu, Lu Xutang, and Dai Cuilun to perform music. The performances were extremely wonderful. Tea and snacks were then served, and the guests freely chatted during the banquet. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious, and the party did not end until dusk. (19th dispatch)

Editorial

### International Brewing and Its Destination

Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler met in a train carriage at the Brenner Pass on the Italian border the day before yesterday, the 18th, for a two-and-a-half-hour discussion. The main topic of discussion must have been the international situation, and the impact of the discussion must have concerned the future of peace and war. How will international peace and war unfold? The distinction between good and bad fortune, and our opportunity, are truly tied to this. However, the world's attention was focused on this, but what was seen and heard afterward was merely that the Italian Prime Minister had a beaming smile and the German Führer was self-possessed; nothing else was known. Can this be blamed on our lack of access? We firmly believe that apart from the three or five people involved in the confidential matter, no one else can know. One should not try to catch shadows from their expressions and claim that something was revealed. Even if many speculations and propaganda prove to be somewhat accurate in the future, they are ultimately not a realistic and accurate report.

Even considering the various speculations and propaganda, there are two prevalent theories: One is that the two leaders are urgently seeking to stabilize Eastern Europe and the Balkans; the other is that Italy and Germany will invite the Soviet Union to jointly launch a peace offensive. According to the former theory, Germany is also wary of the Soviet Union; according to the latter theory, Italy is now willing to be on friendly terms with the Soviet Union. These two theories are contradictory, and at least one must be false. We suspect they are both false. Leaving aside other arguments, Italy is determined to maintain the balance of power in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, and especially wants to adjust, harmonize, and improve it. It absolutely does not want to see it reorganized or dominated. In other words, the way to stabilize it, in Italy's view, is that Germany or Germany and the Soviet Union should take no action, and it is certainly not for Germany to make Italy take any action. Italy's attitude has been consistent and increasingly clear. If this were not the case, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited the Italian capital last week, he would have known Italy's attitude. Why would the German Führer bother to personally visit a neighboring country to try to push this? Italy's attitude toward the Soviet Union is offensive in its ideology and defensive in its actions. If Germany can mediate between them, it would be the ultimate act of mediation. If it were to rope in Italy and the Soviet Union, it would not only defy Italy's ideology but would also make it abandon America, cut off England and France, and leave its comfortable seat to enter fire and water. Leaving aside the fact that Italy would not take this action, Germany would not even consider it. Even if Germany thought of it, it is not something that the German Führer would want to personally try lightly. Therefore, the lack of credibility of these two theories can be understood simply by observing Italy's attitude.

Observing the recent international situation, it is currently in the midst of much brewing. The direction of this brewing is to resolve difficulties and disputes, so it must brew failure and despair before it tends toward deterioration; otherwise, given time and human effort, a sudden opening can be expected. If we make a bold interpretation, then the success of the Finnish-Soviet peace is because the Soviet Union, in light of the international brewing, seized the opportunity first, abandoning its highest desire to attack Finland and sacrificing its greatest possibility to control Finland, in order to secure its gains from Finland before the international brewing became clear. This is truly a brilliant and ancient strategic art in politics and diplomacy; Japan is not worthy to discuss this. We truly cannot confirm the detailed content of the international brewing. Let us try to gather some clues: Before US Under Secretary of State Welles was ordered to visit Italy, Germany, England, and France, it was frequently reported that the American and Soviet envoys in Washington and Moscow were in frequent contact with the authorities of their respective host countries. The content of the contact was kept secret by both sides. Various different inferences can of course be made from this, but it can be imagined that the distance between the views of the two countries, whether far or near, does not prevent them from understanding each other. Although both the US President and Secretary of State claim that Welles is not on a mission to take positive action, the fact that he traveled and the US President immediately went sailing on the sea shows how deeply and urgently they are looking forward to Welles' mission. Welles did not disgrace his mission, so after going to Italy and Germany, the Italian and German leaders found it necessary to meet, and Welles found it necessary to stay temporarily in Rome after going from England and France. Observing Welles' reactions in Rome and Berlin first, and then in Paris and London, it is clear that Italy and Germany are strong while England and France are submissive. In our opinion, America sympathizes with England and France but does not fully favor them. England and France feel America's sympathy but regret that they have not seen America keep pace with them. American and German views must be different, but there is room for revision in Germany's proposals. Italy, which is said to be between England and France and Germany, is actually between Germany and America. When Finland and the Soviet Union were at war, Germany sided with the Soviet Union and suppressed Finland, hoping that Finland and the Soviet Union would cease hostilities and that the Soviet Union would help Germany even more. But after Finland and the Soviet Union reconciled, no German dignitaries were seen rushing to Moscow, but only the Foreign Minister and the Führer visited Italy one after another. Is this not proof that the pursuit of profit is more urgent than preparing for war? Summarizing these various signs, it would be better to say that what is brewing internationally is to resolve difficulties and disputes, rather than to say that it is full of conspiracies and intrigues. In this brewing, Soviet-Japanese negotiations are said to have failed, and US-China loans are said to have succeeded, because only Japan is outside the circle of brewing. Now that Finland and the Soviet Union have made peace, the European war has not reached its peak but seems to be heading rapidly downstream. Japan is gradually becoming a target, returning home defeated is not far off, we can wait and see.

### Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yang Jie Arrives in Chongqing from Yunnan; Yang Talks: The Soviet-Finnish Peace Was a Victory for Soviet Diplomacy; Japan's Position Will Become Increasingly Isolated

Kunming: Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yang Jie flew to Chongqing today. According to Yang's remarks to reporters last night, the Soviet-Finnish peace was a victory for Soviet diplomacy. The significance of this victory is actually far greater than its military victory. As for Japan, due to the end of the Soviet-Finnish war and the inability to continue the Franco-Japanese commercial treaty, its position will become increasingly isolated. According to Yang, when he passed through Hanoi, Annam, he heard that there were many Japanese spies in the hotels in Hanoi. When talking about Yunnan, Yang said that since the coast was blockaded by the Japanese, Yunnan has become China's international lifeline, so China's victory is closely related to this international lifeline. Before leaving here, Yang Jie also visited Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government. (19th United Press dispatch)

### US Debt Owed by China Can Be Repaid Soon

Chongqing: According to sources familiar with current affairs, the 25 million US dollars that the United States lent to China in 1938 will be completely repaid by next spring.

Currently, the Chinese government employs 20,000 workers and 12,000 mules and donkeys to engage in transportation. As for tea exports, the Soviet Union ranks first, while tung oil ranks second.

### Resolution of the Tianjin Concession Blockade Hopeless

Tianjin: Today, at a reception for newspaper reporters, a Japanese military spokesperson, when answering a question about when the Japanese side would lift the blockade of the Tianjin Concession, expressed his personal opinion that only after Japan, Italy, and other foreign powers return their concessions in China will Japan have any signs of lifting the blockade of the Tianjin Concession. The spokesperson also mentioned the Tianjin silver issue, saying that this matter cannot be resolved before the establishment of the "New Regime" led by Wang Jingwei. This issue will be one of the first issues raised after the establishment of the "New Central Government". According to the interpreter's supplement to the above remarks, the silver issue will be a supporting factor for resolving the blockade issue, but the final resolution of the blockade issue is feared to have no hope of success before a satisfactory decision is made on the return of the concessions.

### Anti-War Movement Expands in Hualien Port, Taiwan, and Other Places; Punished Officers and Soldiers Secretly Organize Groups; Many Respond, Japanese Military Authorities Embarrassed

Hong Kong. Keelung News: In Hualien Port, Pingtung, Hsinchu Prefecture, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and other places in Taiwan, many anti-war officers and soldiers who have been escorted from various places in China are being incorporated into punishment teams to be punished. These anti-war officers and soldiers secretly organized groups, using "Rather face military law sanctions than be willing to be transferred to China to fight" as their slogan. Japanese troops in various places have responded one after another. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese military authorities, fearing the expansion of the situation, urgently dispatched a large number of military police to arrest all the leading anti-war soldiers in Hualien Port.

### Mission of Japanese "Envoy" Abe to China: To Sign a New Treaty of Relations with Wang, Seizing China's Independence and Freedom

Tokyo. According to Japanese sources, Abe, Japan's newly appointed "envoy," will have full authority to adjust new relations based on the foundation agreed upon by Jingwei and the Japanese authorities in China last December, and to negotiate a treaty on new relations after the establishment of the Wang regime. This treaty contains concise clauses clarifying the joint responsibilities and missions of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" to achieve the goals of the Konoe Declaration. This will become the highest principle of Sino-Japanese relations. It is noted that the Konoe Declaration has been approved by the Japanese Emperor and cannot be changed. The basic principles of the declaration require China to (1) establish full diplomatic relations with "Manchukuo"; (2) conclude an anti-communist treaty consistent with the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy; (3) recognize the stationing of Japanese troops in designated locations in China as an anti-communist measure; (4) designate Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone; (5) recognize the freedom of Japanese to reside and trade in the Chinese interior; and (6) grant Japan the convenience of developing China, especially the natural resources of North China and Inner Mongolia. After this is signed, it will be announced simultaneously by both China and Japan in the form of a joint declaration. Japan will then begin a new relationship with the "new regime," and the envoy's mission will be completed. Abe will travel to China with a large entourage, including representatives from the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries, as well as senior personnel from the Asia Development Board's liaison office in China. The Asia Development Board is a central agency with broad powers to handle all affairs related to China, especially in the economic field. (Reuters 19th Dispatch)

### Indians Demand Complete Independence

Longar. The Proposal Review Committee of the Indian National Congress passed a resolution yesterday by an overwhelming majority, demanding complete independence for India and rejecting the status of a dominion as a solution to this issue. There were suspicions that Gandhi was preparing to compromise with Britain on India's future. Gandhi replied that if necessary, he would visit India, even fifty times, and would not be bothered. If members of the All-India Congress could eliminate the shortcomings of lack of discipline and the spirit of rebellion, he would begin the struggle within a month. However, he has not yet seen any signs that they are ready to fight immediately. (18th Dispatch from Reuters)

Rome. All-India Congress President Asad, on the eve of the opening of the All-India Congress yesterday, told reporters from the Italian press, "Since the outbreak of the European war, India has repeatedly asked Britain to declare its war aims, whether Britain is truly fighting for democracy, whether it is fighting to protect the freedom of all countries (including India), and whether Britain is preparing to recognize the right of the Indian nation to self-determination, especially to have an independent constitution, which will allow it to decide its attitude towards participating in the war. Britain's response to the above questions is that Britain is fighting for the freedom of Europe and is not prepared to allow India's independence." Asad continued, "If India, with one-fifth of the human population, is denied its constitutional rights, it is tantamount to being fooled, which India cannot tolerate. It is determined to solve its own problems, that is, the constitutional issue. In this regard, the All-India Congress demands the organization of an election congress so that the Muslim people can also participate in the elections. It should be known that the Muslim people are not opposed to India's independence. It was decided that when the European war ended, Britain would promise to resolve the Indian issue in a humane way, but for twenty-two years, India has been struggling for sovereignty. The opening of this All-India Congress is the highest point of India's struggle for independence." (19th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency)

### Interpellation on Diplomacy with Britain: A Disturbance in the Japanese House of Representatives; Members Wave Fists, Stomp Feet, and Scold Arita; Intervention by the Guard Causes Conflict

Tokyo. A major disturbance occurred in the Japanese House of Representatives today. This disturbance was due to a question raised by a member to Foreign Minister Arita. According to the questioner, Arita's handling of the Asama Maru incident was completely inappropriate. Because of his inappropriateness, Britain did not express any apology for this incident and required Japan to prohibit the transport of people of military age from belligerent countries. As a result, various countries recognized that Japan had become weak, and the United States even continued to lend 20 million US dollars to Chongqing. Britain and France also proceeded to intercept mail on Japanese ships. Foreign Minister Arita did not answer this question. Therefore, members of the Social Masses Party and the Dokuritsu-sha (transliteration) expressed indignation, waved their fists and moved forward to the podium, stomped their feet, struck the table, and scolded loudly, shouting that Arita was a "coward" and the "Foreign Minister of Britain." Some members even wailed loudly. According to eyewitnesses, this disturbance was the first of its kind in recent years. Speaker Koyama, in order to maintain order, ordered one of the members who was the most turbulent to be ejected from the Diet. However, the Speaker's actions only made the order even more chaotic, as some members even clashed with the guards. Therefore, Koyama announced a recess, and the situation did not escalate. When the Diet reconvened at 5:20 p.m., Arita stated that the British government's note to the Japanese government on January 27 clearly indicated an apology. However, there were shouts of "Lies!" and "Lies!" from the seats. At the same time, the questioner also expressed dissatisfaction with Arita's answer and planned to raise it again at another time.

### Japan's Activities in South America: Plans to Conclude Commercial Treaties with Brazil and Chile

Tokyo. According to news here today, Japan's commercial treaty with Colombia will soon be completed. It is reported that this treaty is the same as the one Japan recently concluded with Argentina, which is based on barter. It is also reported that Japan is now planning to begin negotiations on commercial treaties with Brazil and Chile. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

### Japan Plans to Abolish the Sea Otter Hunting Agreement

Tokyo. According to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's statement in the Diet, Japan is now planning to abolish the sea otter hunting agreement previously concluded with the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union. According to the agreement, sea otters on islands north of 30 degrees north latitude in the Pacific Ocean are not allowed to be hunted in order to allow them to breed and multiply. However, according to Arita, the number of sea otters on islands north of 30 degrees north latitude has now increased to 830,000, which has become a threat to fisheries in the North Pacific. Therefore, Japan is now planning to abolish the agreement so that a new agreement can be concluded. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

### Negotiations on Various Pending Issues between the Soviet Union and Japan Have Made No Progress; Adjustment of Relations between the Two Countries is Difficult; Conclusion of a Non-Aggression Pact is Even More Absurd

Hong Kong. Tokyo News: The English-language Japan Times recently conducted a general review of Soviet-Japanese relations. According to reports, at the beginning of this year, there was hope for the resolution of some pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. However, the results of the discussions between the two sides were far from what was expected, and as of today, no progress has been made. On the 11th of this month, the Paris Labor News reported that the Soviet Union and Japan were conducting negotiations to conclude a non-aggression pact and that negotiations to stop Soviet aid to China's war of resistance were all nonsense. (19th Dispatch)

Tokyo. The English-language "Japan Times" commented today, expressing deep doubts about the possibility of a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. The "Times," which usually represents the views of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, stated that although Japan and the Soviet Union have intensified negotiations in the past six months, the main problems between the two countries have not only not been resolved, but there is currently no hope for a peaceful solution. The newspaper further stated that a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan "undoubtedly cannot become an issue," because the current relationship between the two countries makes it so. In reviewing Japan's efforts to resolve various issues between the two countries and the Soviet Union, the newspaper stated that the results were "far from what was expected." The newspaper indicated, "Commercial negotiations have made no progress. The joint committee formed by Japan's 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union's 'Outer Mongolia' to resolve the issue of the Khalkha demarcation line has yielded no results. The committee ended its work at the end of January. All border issues have not been resolved. Regarding the demarcation line between the Soviet Union and 'Manchukuo,' the two sides have agreed in principle to organize a committee to conduct negotiations. In addition, the two sides have not made further contacts." The newspaper observed that there currently "seems to be a deliberate plan to place a spoke in the wheel of Japanese diplomacy, causing it to stall." Furthermore, Japan has not sought to conclude a non-aggression pact during its negotiations with the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded that, from the Japanese point of view, resolving the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is a condition for adjusting the overall diplomatic problems between the two countries.

### News from New York: German Peace Plan; Content Includes Eleven Clauses; The Pope Denies Acting as Intermediary

Rome. According to news from the New York press, well-informed sources in the Vatican have circulated a peace proposal, saying that it was submitted to the Pope by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Reuters 19th Dispatch)

Vatican. Official sources here today denied the rumors that when U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles met with the Pope, the Pope conveyed Hitler's peace terms to Welles. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

Rome. Official sources here today refuted the rumors that when the two major figures of Germany and Italy met at the Brenner Pass yesterday, Hitler had proposed eleven kinds of peace terms. Also, according to Gaida in the "Italian Daily," the Italian Prime Minister is not an envoy of peace, and in fact, no government has proposed peace terms, so it is expected that the period of war will continue and intensify. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that responsible sources in London declared today that they were completely unaware of any peace plan as disclosed by various newspapers in New York. According to the information obtained in London, they are not prepared to announce or propose any such plan under any circumstances. (Reuters 19th Dispatch)

Rome. According to a senior Vatican official last night, when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler unexpectedly met at the Brenner Pass yesterday, they asked Hitler to postpone the "major offensive" and requested that some concessions be made to the eleven compromise peace proposals put forward by the German side. It is said that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles felt that the German proposal was unacceptable. In fact, both London and Paris ridiculed the German proposal. The Vatican said that after the meeting between the German and Italian leaders, the German side might make further concessions. The eleven proposals put forward by Germany should not be regarded as "merely probing opinions," but need to be carefully managed in the future. Therefore, Mussolini, after learning from Welles about Hitler's proposals, which would inevitably lead to failure unless quick concessions were made, held the Brenner Pass meeting. Welles asked Mussolini to immediately report to Hitler that his proposals could not be accepted by the Allied countries and that further concessions had to be made if the peace movement was to succeed. As for whether Mussolini was able to obtain concessions from Hitler, both Germany and Italy remained tight-lipped last night. However, judging from Mussolini's joyful expression when he appeared on the special train and Hitler's stern and contemplative attitude, it was generally speculated that Mussolini had achieved some success. The Vatican said that the content of the eleven peace proposals submitted by Hitler to Welles is as follows: (1) Adopt universal and simultaneous disarmament measures for the army, navy, and air force. (2) Organize a small independent Polish state in the Warsaw area of central Poland, with a population of about one million or one million and one hundred thousand, and open the port of Gdynia to Poland, so that the country can have access to the Baltic Sea. Poland will also have the Free City of Danzig to facilitate Polish commerce with the Baltic Sea. The boundaries of the small Polish state will be determined by a referendum under the supervision of an international committee. The issue of ethnic minorities in the Danube River and Polish regions will be resolved by group immigration. (3) The Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary will form a three-nation alliance with Germany. Within that, Germany will enjoy certain industrial and transportation rights for twenty-five years. (4) Austria will always belong to Germany. (5) Germany will recover its colonies within twenty-five years, or at least certain colonial rights, or protect German immigrants to certain areas of Africa. (6) Organize the Danube River Group, guided by Germany and Italy. The group includes Yugoslavia, Albania, Bohemia, and Slovakia. (7) The Balkan status quo will remain, protecting the Bessarabian and Transylvanian borders of Romania. (8) Complete religious freedom. Under British guidance, a small number of Jews in Germany will be led to Palestine, Italian East Africa, and French Madagascar. (9) Complete freedom of trade after the war, with no tariff barriers to raw materials, economic cooperation with the United States, and facilitating immigration for both Germany and Italy, such as Italians moving to Tunisia and Germans moving to Africa. (10) Italy will receive special treatment in Djibouti's commerce, and from 1945, Italy will be granted the right to pass through the Suez Canal from Italy. (11) Italy will gain a new status in Tunisia. The last two points indicate the cooperation of the Axis powers, making Italy feel satisfied. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

### Welles Scheduled to Leave Europe for the United States Today; Mission is to Collect Intelligence; Did Not Participate in Any Negotiations

Rome. After U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles met with the Pope this morning, the Pope sent Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione to return the visit. Welles then met with U.S. Ambassador Phillips and attended a banquet hosted by Prince Colonna, Governor of Rome, in the evening. It is reported that Welles has drafted a report on the details of the audience with the Pope and is scheduled to depart for Genoa late tomorrow to board the "Conte di Savoia" for his return to the United States on the 20th. (Havas 18th Dispatch)

Washington. After U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles arrived in Rome for the second time, he stayed for many days without starting his return trip, causing much discussion in diplomatic circles, who said that the Deputy Secretary's delay was due to other reasons. Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press yesterday, saying that his mission in Europe was only to collect intelligence and that he did not participate in any negotiations. The intention was clearly to dispel the doubts of the general public. In short, regardless of what kind of peace offensive Germany and Italy launch, the United States has no intention of participating in it directly or indirectly. The true meaning of Hull's statement yesterday was to state this position. Diplomatic circles also said that Deputy Secretary Welles' trip to Europe has never deviated from the position of "observer," and even if someone gives him a peace proposal, he will only attach it to the report to President Roosevelt. (Havas 19th Dispatch)

### The Soviet Union is Willing to Rebuild Friendship with Northern European Countries; Setting up Defenses on the Island of Oland; No Longer Insisting on Dissent

Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry here said that the Soviet Union no longer opposes the establishment of defenses on the island of Oland, and has promised that it has no territorial ambitions in Northwestern Europe. The Soviet Union also requested to rebuild friendly relations with the Scandinavian countries as soon as possible. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)

### Germany to Launch a New Peace Offensive Against Britain and France: Joint Declaration with Italy and the Soviet Union to Maintain Balkan Peninsula Security

Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ciano and the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, returned to Rome by special train at midnight last night. Crowds gathered at the station, cheering and paying their respects. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

Rome - It is widely rumored here that Hitler and Mussolini discussed the establishment of a German-Italian-Soviet group to maintain stability outside the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. Political observers believe this move is related to the Soviet-Finnish agreement and the neutral stance of the Scandinavian countries. (Reuters, 18th)

Berlin - German leader Hitler returned to Berlin by special train from Brenner at 11:30 this morning. Although the news of the leader's return was not announced in advance, his arrival was greeted with enthusiastic welcome by the crowds. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

Solothurn, Switzerland - A Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper states that one of the results of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting will be a joint declaration by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Swiss observers believe that Germany, having secured its northern flank and free from attacks, will now protect itself in Southeastern Europe, using the assistance of Italy and the Soviet Union to expel the influence of the Allied powers in the region. Germany's assistance in reconciliation between the Iron Guard and the Romanian government has already achieved a victory. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin - Informed sources here announced last night that after the meeting between German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass yesterday, there will be surprising developments this week. It is widely believed that cooperation will be announced between Rome and Moscow. Authorities here are currently maintaining extreme silence, but all parties believe that the content of the two leaders' talks must be related to the formation of a German-Italian-Soviet bloc. The connection of these three countries will weaken the influence of Britain and France in the Balkans and the Near East. The Foreign Ministry here emphasized that the Soviet Union is one of the great powers and has the right to participate in the "New European Order of the Future," even suggesting that the Soviet Union's ambitions extend beyond what it has gained in Poland, the Baltic states, and Finland.

Yesterday, the evening newspapers here praised the "victory" of the bombing of Scapa Flow and the Brenner Pass meeting, and most newspapers especially emphasized the attack on Scapa Flow. An editorial in the "Hamburger Nachrichten" stated that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini and the air raid on Scapa Flow are sufficient to "show Germany's position in this war. Germany is taking the offensive in both military and political terms." The newspaper concluded, "Germany's military strength and grasp of victory have been clearly demonstrated to those who want to know the truth by the Battle of Scapa Flow and what will continue to happen in the future. Germany will build a historically peaceful 'living room' in Central Europe. Those who obey me will live, and those who resist me will perish." (United Press, 19th)

Berlin - The German News Agency stated that the details of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass are still unknown here, but the solid foundation of German-Italian cooperation can be seen from this. Observing this fact, it can be known that the hopes of Western European countries that Germany and Italy will be separated on their common foundation are foolish. In yesterday's talks, both sides discussed the major issues of the day in a frank spirit, which is natural. As for certain rumors spread by Britain and France, it seems that Britain and France are still unwilling to understand Hitler's speech in parliament on October 6th of last year, explaining the principles of Germany's attitude in the current war. This was Hitler's last word, but the enemy spokesmen refused it and instead proposed war aims of a criminal nature. From then on, the situation between Western European countries and Germany has become completely clear. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin - According to the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini shows that the Axis powers do not want to give up the work of deciding on European affairs and are determined to guide the reorganization of Europe in the way they believe is correct. The newspaper mentioned that the struggles of Germany and Italy for unity and freedom have the same history, emphasizing that the two countries encountered the same obstacles when realizing the same goals. The "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger" stated that Hitler and Mussolini, based on the same views, friendly relations, and various agreements, will follow their own paths and solve problems of a decisive nature with their own power. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that the politicians of Western European countries admire empty talk, while Hitler and Mussolini are figures of action and creation. They will determine the fate of Europe. The Allied powers, failing in Northern Europe, will be active in Southern Europe, paying particular attention to Italy. However, the negotiations between Germany and Italy on the coal issue have become the first response to the Allied powers' attempts, and the meeting at the Brenner Pass is the second response.

### Chamberlain Reports on the International Situation in the House of Commons: Says Germany Should be Held Responsible for the Soviet-Finnish War; Britain Has Already Fulfilled its Obligations to Assist Finland

London - When Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the current situation in the House of Commons this afternoon, the hearts of the people were particularly anxious, showing a tense atmosphere. U.S. Ambassador Kennedy sat in the diplomatic corps seat next to Soviet Ambassador Maisky. The ambassadors of Belgium, France, Turkey, Argentina, and the ministers of some smaller countries and the commissioners of the autonomous territories in London were also present. When the Prime Minister stood up and mentioned Finland, everyone cheered. The Prime Minister said that the government's initial impression of a major tragedy had occurred, and nothing could change it. Considering the terms of the Finnish-Soviet reconciliation, it can only confirm the view that these terms could only be accepted under direct coercion. It is also useless to assume that these terms do not seriously harm the country's independence and integrity. The Finns, after a long and heroic defense, were ultimately unable to resist a superior enemy in number and equipment. This is a painful concept for all who truly love freedom, but the Finnish resistance was not in vain. They have preserved the glory of Finland and earned the admiration of the world (cheers from the crowd). The Finnish government is still in office, the Finnish army is still intact, and the spirit of the Finnish people has not been broken. If we were in our own country, even though we have done everything we can, we have still failed to save Finland from its misfortune. Our power to help Finland has not yet ended (cheers from the crowd). We should watch the efforts of Finland to rebuild its national life with the deepest sympathy. If Finland continues to need assistance to rebuild, we dare to predict that this country and other countries will be happy to jointly assist Finland's revival. The collapse of Finland's resistance has deeply shaken the world. We have been forced to witness another small country become a victim of an aggressor, and we have taken up arms in resistance. It is expected that German propaganda will use this incident to shirk their responsibility and place it on the shoulders of others, but Germany cannot evade its responsibility (cheers). Without the German-Soviet agreement, Finland would never have been invaded by the Soviet Union. The Scandinavian countries originally intended to aid Finland, but stopped due to Germany's intimidation. If it is said that Britain and France failed to fulfill their obligations and provide Finland with what it needed to the best of their ability, this statement cannot be tolerated for a moment (cheers). If this statement comes from private individuals in countries far from the war (the Prime Minister's words were drowned out by prolonged cheering and could not be heard clearly), these people have never felt any concern for their friends or themselves. The Prime Minister then said that he would like to speak about the issue of aid to Finland in two parts: material aid and manpower aid. Regarding the material aspect, because this country is currently at war, any request for help from friendly neutral countries must be measured against Britain's own needs. The British government is willing to respond to Finland's requests one by one, but it must consider that anything given will reduce its own strength and endanger its own people. It should be known that Finland is far from Britain, and the supplies are at risk and must pass through two foreign countries, along a railway line that is already carrying an excessive amount. Then, the railway passes through Finland for a long distance, and this railway has never been expected to transport these military supplies. Although the difficulties are numerous, the British government has not ignored Finland's appeals. Every request is considered. The Prime Minister then listed the war materials that have been approved for supply and the amounts that have already been shipped, stating that the British government has agreed to assist Finland with 152 aircraft, of which 101 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 223 cannons; 104 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 297,700 shells; 185,000 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 100 Vickers guns, all of which have been shipped; agreed to assist with 500 mines, of which 400 have been shipped; agreed to assist with approximately 50,000 hand grenades, all of which have been shipped; agreed to assist with 20,700 aircraft bombs, of which 15,700 have been shipped; agreed to assist with 200 anti-tank rifles, 60,000 heaters, 100,000 sheepskin coats, 100,000 combat suits, and 48 ambulances, all of which have been shipped. In addition, a large number of small arms and ammunition were also provided. Britain did not hesitate to meet Finland's needs to the best of its ability, even at its own risk. The Prime Minister then addressed the issue of manpower assistance, stating that in mid-January, Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim and General Österman had informed the British representative that the Finnish military was sufficient to hold out until the snow melted, so there was no immediate need for manpower assistance. Mannerheim and General Österman had said that they would be happy to receive 30,000 trained soldiers in May, but Finland and Sweden were both afraid of Germany's reaction, so both countries hoped that if troops were sent to aid Finland, it would not be done publicly. After studying the situation, the British Cabinet realized that an effective force to aid Finland could not be recruited on a voluntary basis. The troops needed in May could only be recruited according to government regulations and formed into a properly organized expeditionary force. The Cabinet then drafted a plan and submitted it to the Supreme Military Council for discussion on February 2. An expeditionary force of 100,000 men was ready to depart, two months earlier than the date agreed upon by Mannerheim and General Österman. The construction plan of the expeditionary force had several important factors to consider, as an effective expeditionary force could not reach Finland without passing through Norway and Sweden, so permission had to be obtained from the governments of those two countries before departure. As for Germany's attitude, it goes without saying. We knew that as soon as Germany heard the rumor that the British and French expeditionary forces would pass through the two countries, it threatened them that if they allowed passage, Germany would intervene. We then realized that we had to prepare another army to help Sweden resist Germany if it was attacked by Germany. If the governments of the two countries allowed passage, the difficulties in transportation would still limit this large army. We considered this situation and decided to send as many troops as possible within the limits of what we could afford to overcome all difficulties. Part of the army would be used to aid Sweden, and another part would be the expeditionary force to aid Finland. In addition, some troops would be needed to maintain the long line of communication. Based on this basis, the number of troops decided to be dispatched was approximately 100,000 men, all fully equipped, and it was agreed that they would begin to arrive in Scandinavia in March, with the entire army arriving at its destination before the end of April. This was not the final army, and the issue of reinforcements would be decided based on the development of the war.

The British government informed Finland of this plan in late February and said that if they continued to need assistance, they should make a public appeal before March 5. We planned to formally apply to the governments of Norway and Sweden for permission for the expeditionary force to pass through as soon as we received this public appeal. We hoped that as a result of Finland's appeal, the governments of the two countries would not obstruct it, but when Finland informally consulted the Swedish government, the Swedish government refused to allow regular troops to pass through. We were very disappointed when we received this news, but our preparations for sending troops did not stop because of this. We still hoped that the governments of Sweden and Norway would change their minds, bravely bear the consequences, and allow us to give Finland the aid we had prepared for Finland. In early March, Finland asked us to allow them to postpone their decision, but Finland never made any decision by the agreed date. The next day, we heard that Finland had accepted the Soviet Union's peace terms. We are not in a position to criticize what the Finns have done. Those who have fought so bravely, like the Finns, must be forgiven and not criticized in any way. The Prime Minister continued, saying that he wanted to make it absolutely clear that the British government has always recognized that the Finns have the right to make their own decisions based on the facts they know. Whatever Britain's claims, it should accept the decisions made by the Finns themselves. Finland has not made any other application for land forces, except for the request by Mannerheim and General Österman to assist with 30,000 soldiers in May.

The Prime Minister solemnly stated again that if Norway and Sweden had allowed the British and French expeditionary forces to pass through, they would have arrived in Finland earlier. He dared to say that Britain and France have never blamed Norway and the two countries for their actions in this incident (applause). But what about Germany? The responsibility for this Finnish war should be entirely borne by Germany. The Prime Minister also expressed doubts about whether Norway and Sweden could maintain their safety. On the contrary, he believed that the danger to the two countries was closer than at any time. Today, the disaster has reached the doorsteps of the two countries, and we must express some sympathy for their position. The two countries originally intended to stay away from the center of the disturbance and not suffer the fate of Czechoslovakia and Poland. He had to point out that this kind of neutralism, which paralyzed the actions of the two countries, was based on an assumption that it was best for small countries to remain neutral and stay out of the war between Germany and the Allied powers. In addition, there was also a concept that no matter the outcome of the war, whether the victor was Germany or the Allies, it would not matter to the small neutral countries. Once the above-mentioned assumptions are abandoned and the necessary inferences are obtained, this policy of small neutral countries will prove to be both unrealistic and insufficient to guarantee their own interests. There will be no way to save them except by deciding to defend themselves and uniting with those who are prepared to help them defend themselves.

Finally, the Prime Minister mentioned the visit to Britain by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, saying that the government had welcomed him and fully and frankly expressed its views to him. He believed that Welles would be able to learn the true opinions and emotions of all aspects of Britain. When Welles returned to Italy, a new incident occurred: the meeting of the two dictators at the Brenner Pass. This meeting has naturally caused various speculations from the outside world, some saying that it was to carry out new peace proposals, but whether this is true is still unknown. However, no matter what the consequences, the British government is prepared to deal with them. We do not seem to be relieved of our purpose of joining this war because of this. (Reuters, 19th)

### Mouthpiece of German Foreign Ministry Refutes Polish White Paper: Points Out that Poland's Determination to Join the Encirclement of Germany Led to the Failure of Germany's Efforts to Improve Relations with Poland

Berlin - Regarding the White Paper published by the Polish government in Paris, the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, published an article yesterday to refute it, emphasizing that Poland's determination to join the Allied powers and encircle Germany led to the failure of Germany's efforts to promote German-Polish relations. The White Paper pointed out that relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were not good between 1934 and 1938. True, Berlin, Moscow, and countries all over the world also acknowledge the fact that Germany and the Soviet Union rejected the provocations of Western European countries and were unwilling to fight each other, so they returned to good terms. Although Polish émigré politicians want to use the past German-Soviet relations to provoke today's German-Soviet relations, this Anglo-Soviet relationship is now deeply rooted. German politicians only laugh at the words of alienation. Secondly, regarding the Polish White Paper's claim that Poland never demanded the Free City of Danzig, German officials pointed out that the history of the Free City of Danzig is full of facts about avoiding Polish political, economic, and cultural aggression. Moreover, the reason why Polish Foreign Minister Beck rejected Germany's proposals for Danzig and the corridor on March 26th of last year was entirely influenced by Britain. Thirdly, the Polish White Paper provides very little narrative on the facts between April and August 1939, which shows that Britain and France did not allow Poland to publicize the process of Britain encouraging and promoting Poland, while also indicating that Poland has no documents to prove "loyalty to the Germanic nation." Finally, regarding the White Paper's claim that Poland only knew of Germany's proposal on the evening of August 31, German officials solemnly refuted it, believing it to be a repeated lie. In fact, the German government had notified British Ambassador Henderson on August 30, and Henderson immediately informed the Polish Ambassador, who reported to the Warsaw government.

### Case of American International News Service Reporter Young's Arrest in Japan: Analysis from the Perspective of International Law by American Lawyer Mr. Olerud

Mr. Young, a correspondent for the American International News Service stationed in Japan, was previously arrested by the Japanese police authorities and is still in custody. Recently, the spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Mr. Young's actions violated Article 99 of the Japanese Army Disciplinary Code, and according to Article 3 of that code, it also applies to those who spread unfounded rumors outside the borders of Japan. How this incident will develop and end in the future is currently unpredictable. Mr. Olerud, an American lawyer in this city, is well-versed in law and has provided a detailed analysis from the perspective of international regulations. An excerpt of the translation is as follows:

The recent indictment of an American journalist in Japan has focused attention on two opposing views regarding international public law. One view holds that an action committed in country A, even if it constitutes a crime, cannot be considered a crime in country B. The other view is that a country can punish an action as a crime, even if it was committed outside its territory. According to the first view, the place where the crime was committed determines jurisdiction, while countries that hold the opposite view determine jurisdiction based on the defendant's presence within their borders.

Some important countries do not exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-nationals within the territory of other countries. The United States is a major country that holds this view, but Britain, Denmark, and Portugal also hold the same view. These countries seem to believe that according to international public law, no country should exercise jurisdiction over such cases, and their jurisdiction is governed by the laws of the place where the crime was committed.

"In a directive dated August 7, 1844, U.S. Secretary of State Calhoun to the then-U.S. Ambassador to England, Everett, clearly summarized the U.S. view. A section of this directive, as recorded in Moore's Digest of International Law, is as follows: 'An action committed in one country, even if it is a crime according to that country's laws, may not be a crime according to the laws of another country. In a legal sense, a crime is local because the law of the country where the act is committed declares that act to be a crime, and therefore it is a crime only in that place. Britain cannot, through its laws, make an act committed within the jurisdiction of the United States, no matter how immoral it may be, a crime within British territory, and vice versa for the United States. This premise is so clear that it needs no explanation or argument. But if this point is acknowledged, then another point must also be acknowledged, which is that the crimes mentioned in the annex must be judged by the laws of the place where the crime was committed, and not by the laws of the place where the fugitive is found.'"

However, some important countries, although implementing different methods, do not adhere to this territorial principle. These countries mostly claim jurisdiction over crimes that violate their national security or reputation, even if they were committed entirely within the territory of other countries. Mexico, Greece, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and China all seem to claim jurisdiction over cases where their own laws and the "law of the place where the crime was committed" both define the act as a crime. Austria, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Japan, and several other countries all claim jurisdiction over actions committed by foreigners in other countries that violate their national security or reputation.

The United States and Britain, in cases involving non-nationals, especially ordinary crimes, almost exclusively claim jurisdiction based on territorial and personal grounds. Both countries recognize universal regulations to some extent, such as piracy on the high seas, but there are also situations that differ from this strict territorial and personal theory. For example, Section 22 of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1914 stipulates that false statements or deceptions in immigration applications, even if committed abroad, can be punished. Foreigners cannot commit treason against the United States abroad, but it seems possible to prosecute actions of treason against the United States according to one or more national laws.

Apart from Britain and the United States, although most countries claim the right to jurisdiction over non-nationals who commit crimes that undermine their national security and reputation, and many other crimes, it is surprisingly rare to find famous cases involving violations of the above-mentioned laws. The Cutting Case, the Lotus Case, the Shaw Case, and the Gao Ying Case can be considered notable cases.

The Cutting Case

In 1886, Cutting, a U.S. citizen, published a notice in a newspaper in El Paso, Texas, criticizing certain legal procedures of Medina, a Mexican citizen. As a result, Cutting was tried and imprisoned in El Paso del Norte, Mexico, and sentenced to one year in prison and a fine. The U.S. government strongly protested, and Cutting was released by the Supreme Court of Chihuahua, Mexico.

The Lotus Case

On August 2, 1926, near midnight, the French mail steamer Lotus, en route to Constantinople, collided with the Turkish coal ship Boz-Kurt about five or six nautical miles north of Cape Sigri. The Boz-Kurt broke in two and sank, and eight Turkish people on board died. The Lotus made every effort to rescue the survivors and rescued ten people, then continued to Constantinople. When it arrived there on August 3, the Lotus's watch officer, Lieutenant Demons, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. The French government disputed the jurisdiction of the Turkish court, arguing that if a crime had been committed, it had been committed on a French ship on the high seas, and that France considered its ships to be French territory, so only France had the right to question Lieutenant Demons. In 1927, France and Turkey agreed to submit the case to the Permanent Court of International Justice for adjudication. The court ruled that there was dual jurisdiction, but the judges of the court held two opposing views, each occupying half, with the Chief Justice casting the deciding vote. The view held by one of the dissenting judges, Judge Moore, perhaps expressed the French view, while also stating the U.S. view. His opinion was that Turkey's claim of jurisdiction violated the following three principles of international law:

(1) A country's jurisdiction over its territory is exclusive.

(2) Foreigners traveling in a country must obey the local laws and seek judicial protection from the country's courts.

(3) A country may not punish a foreigner for violating laws that they were not required to obey when the crime was committed.

The Shaw Case

Shaw, a British national residing in Andong, China, went to Korea in 1920. The Japanese authorities alleged that Shaw had engaged in actions in China that violated Japanese law and detained him for several months. The British government demanded his release, one of the reasons being that Shaw, in this situation, should be subject to British consular jurisdiction in China and not be subject to Japanese jurisdiction for any actions in China. Four months later, Shaw was released, presumably without a formal trial.

The Gao Ying Case

Gao Ying, an official at the Chinese consulate in the United States, was involved in the purchase and sale of narcotics with several Americans. He could have been tried in the United States or in China. As a result, Gao Ying was returned to China for trial. This may have been because the U.S. authorities, due to Gao Ying's official position and for the sake of friendly relations between the two countries, did not try him in the United States, but allowed him to be tried by his own national authorities.

Such cases are very rare. The reason for this may be that countries have different views on this matter, and when such cases occur, the defendant's national government often lodges a strong protest.

A country questioning a national of another country for a crime committed outside its jurisdiction often causes international friction. Many countries have now entered into extradition treaties that are closely related to this matter, which may avoid many cases of this nature.

### The Commercial Decline and Soaring Prices in Wuxi Lead to Widespread Poverty and Rampant Banditry

Wuxi Correspondence: The commercial heart of Wuxi County, from Kongjiangmen to Sanliqiao, lies along the canal, benefiting from convenient water and land transportation. Shops of all kinds line the streets in close proximity, especially rice, wheat, and grain merchants, who gather here. Cargo ships from various ports moor along the North Embankment, making it a distribution center for rice and grain in Southeast China. After the outbreak of war, it was completely destroyed by fire. Since the occupation two years ago, a small number of merchants have pooled their resources to build simple houses and set up shops to earn meager profits. The North District market now appears to be in good condition on the surface, but in reality, it is mostly strong on the outside and weak on the inside. This is because the rice industry has always been the most important, followed by daily necessities. Before the war, capitalists from this and other ports often invested heavily in various industries. Since the occupation, those with large amounts of capital have mostly fled to safety with their funds and have not yet returned. Therefore, the current commercial activities are mostly based on pooled funds, with very little large-scale investment. Business transactions are mostly conducted in cash, with immediate buying and selling, and there are no shops that hoard large quantities of goods. In the previous two years, various industries experienced abnormal growth, with considerable profits. Between last summer and autumn, foreign exchange plummeted, the legal tender depreciated drastically, and the European war caused prices to soar. Various industries made double profits in an instant. However, in reality, due to the low value of the legal tender, widespread poverty, and the weak purchasing power of urban and rural residents, business is unusually sluggish. Although there was a surplus at the end of last winter, since the market opened this year, with the exception of necessities such as rice and grain, the prospects for other shops are bleak unless prices can be reduced. Moreover, banditry is rampant in Wuxi, occurring several times a day. Houqijie outside the north gate and Tongji Bridge and other places have been repeatedly robbed. During the robberies, bandits often burn the lower bodies of their victims. In half a month, there have been more than ten such cases, and four or five people have died from the resulting infections. The Pu Ren Hospital is filled with patients seeking treatment for their injuries. The residents are living in misery, and the Japanese and puppet authorities are unable to maintain order. It is said that most of the bandits are local gangsters and have close ties with the puppet police. Unless the problem is addressed at its root, there will be no end to banditry.

### Local Commemoration Day Tomorrow: Schools in This City Will Be Closed for One Day

(Da Hua News Agency) Tomorrow (the 21st) is the Shanghai Local Commemoration Day. In the past, schools were closed for one day. Last year, due to the War of Resistance, the city's education supervisory authorities issued a notice to all schools, prohibiting them from taking a holiday on this day and requiring them to hold classes as usual. Now, because the leader has indicated that our country's War of Resistance has achieved final victory, the education supervisory authorities have notified all schools to follow the usual practice and close for one day to commemorate the event.

### Ministry of Education Opens Cram School for High School Graduates in Kunming

Kunming Correspondence: To help high school graduates enter higher education, the Ministry of Education has opened a cram school for high school graduates in Kunming, with the aim of providing remedial instruction in basic subjects. The "Student Guidance Office in Kunming for Students from Various Places" was instructed to make preparations. The office appointed Cha Liangzhao, Wu Chunwu, and Hu Shuyi as members of the preparatory committee. Preparations began in early February, and placement tests were held on March 3, with classes officially starting on the 6th. The Ministry of Education has now formally appointed Hu Shuyu as the head of the class. It is reported that the class is divided into male and female sections, with 300 students actually enrolled, representing nineteen provinces and cities.

### Preliminary Examination for College Entrance Exams: Passing Students to Receive Training, with More Than Seventy Lecturers

Kunming Correspondence: More than 120 students who passed the preliminary examination for the Central Government's college entrance exams this year began training on the 1st of this month in a certain location in Chongqing. This training is entirely militarized, with a tight schedule. The curriculum is extremely demanding, divided into five main categories: spiritual talks, political courses, supplementary courses, military training, and physical education. Approximately seventy lecturers are responsible for teaching, all of whom are heads of various ministries and departments. Students will receive six months of training at the school, then be assigned to various places to serve in various communities for one month of practical experience and four months of internships. Finally, they will return to school to prepare reports and participate in a second examination. Those who pass will be officially employed according to the law. A monthly allowance of thirty yuan will be provided during the training period.

### Guidance for Middle School Students' Life (4)

— Wang Maozu

B. Special Guidance

First, "Guidance for Service." During the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education issued supplemental wartime curricula for middle schools and outlines for wartime youth service. In terms of training principles, there is consistency between peacetime and wartime. However, in terms of activities, certain items have been added due to environmental and time needs. I believe that it is appropriate to concentrate on a few sensitive items so that schools can effectively implement them. The first is production, which should involve students helping farmers with transplanting seedlings, sowing seeds, harvesting, and other side occupations. Since many schools have been dispersed to the countryside, they should live according to rural life, without needing summer vacations, and can change to agricultural vacations. The second is propaganda and mass education, which students are most capable of doing, but they must have propaganda skills and medical knowledge to treat common diseases for farmers to be more effective. The third is labor service, selecting what students are able to do. The fourth is rescue and assistance in the relief of refugee children. In addition, career guidance has never been well-managed in various places. After the war started, on the one hand, many students became unemployed or changed jobs. On the other hand, the conditions of occupations have greatly expanded due to the War of Resistance. All opportunities related to military affairs, transportation, rescue, and reclamation, production, medical, and news careers in the rear need people everywhere. In normal times, one can muddle through in various institutions, but now it is impossible to muddle through. The type of work that each person is suited for can be tested immediately. Because there is an urgent need for talent, many short-term training courses have to be opened. However, because of the short-term training, career guidance must be given special attention so that each person can make the most of their talents. In short, guidance for being a person and a citizen should be based on the New Life Movement standards. Guidance for service and work should also develop students' ability to cope with the present from practical activities, and explore students' interests and specialties so that each can make the most of their abilities. The lessons of the War of Resistance have had a great effect and transformation on middle school education: (1) From superficial to practical life, (2) From lecturing to automatic creation, (3) From being isolated from society to deeply entering society, (4) From special life to rural life.

### This Year's High School Enrollment in Fujian Province to Be Held Concurrently with Junior High School Joint Exams

(Yong'an Correspondence) Recently, Private Union College Principal Lin, Provincial Assembly member, and De Yi and thirty-one others jointly submitted a petition to the Provincial Government, stating that the number of students admitted in the province's unified high school enrollment last year was too small, and requesting approval to increase the number of students enrolled in high schools throughout the province and to improve the unified enrollment methods. The Provincial Government replied, "There were 1,899 students participating in the junior high school graduation joint exams and supplementary exams in the second semester of the 27th year. Apart from 611 students who failed and should repeat the grade, only 1,288 students are allowed to graduate and provisionally advance to higher education. (The original petition stated that the number of junior high school graduates in the province last year was 2,424, which does not match the facts.) The enrollment quota for high schools throughout the province for the first semester of the 28th year was set at 1,500, which is sufficient to accommodate the aforementioned junior high school graduates who wish to advance to higher education and students with equivalent qualifications. However, due to the poor performance of the examinees, the admission standards have already been lowered, and the number of students admitted is still less than the prescribed quota. In recent years, the Provincial Government has paid special attention to improving the teaching and enriching the facilities of various junior high schools. The schools should work together to improve students' levels in order to meet the admission standards. As for the number of students to be recruited by public and private high schools throughout the province in the 29th year, it will be determined after the junior high schools submit the lists of graduates from previous years, taking into account the number of junior high school graduates, the financial resources and equipment of the high schools, and the needs of the local area. The enrollment examination will be held concurrently with the junior high school joint exams, as reported by the Department of Education, and the methods will be announced separately." It is also reported that the photos and rosters of graduates from previous years and students taking supplementary exams in public and private junior high schools in Fujian Province for the second semester of the 28th year should be submitted to the Department of Education by the end of April of this year.

工部局研究　節减行政經費　組特別委員會專任其事
Shanghai Municipal Council Studies Reducing Administrative Expenses; Forms Special Committee for the Task

有人主張增加奢侈稅率
Some Advocate Increasing Luxury Tax Rates

工部局現已組織一特別委員會、對於局方行政經費可否節减一層、加以硏究、委員人選、為華董奚玉書·西董鮑惠雨·渣華郵船公司經理卡立雅·曁在華日本紡織同業會理事岡本一策等四人、惟聞最近期內、尙不能向局方提佻報吿云、又據外傳工部局業已向食港及上海銀行界、獲得借款一千萬元、此項借款、須依照初定計劃、增加捐稅百分之一百、始能償淸、工部局因鑒於各方之反對、乃不得不就預算之各方面、力求撙節、
The Shanghai Municipal Council has now organized a special committee to study whether administrative expenses can be reduced. The committee members are Mr. Xi Yushu, a Chinese director; Mr. Bao Huiyu, a Western director; Mr. Kalija, the manager of Java Mail Steamer Company; and Mr. Okamoto Ikksaku, director of the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China. However, it is rumored that a report cannot be submitted to the bureau in the near future. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council has obtained a loan of ten million yuan from the banking circles in Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to the initial plan, this loan can only be repaid by increasing taxes by 100%. In light of opposition from all sides, the Shanghai Municipal Council has had to strive for frugality in all aspects of the budget.

加捐負擔仍為平民
Increased Tax Burden Still Falls on the Common People

據納稅人稱、工部局倘所擬加捐、付之實行、此其後果、不難想像、市政總捐（房捐）現行微收率、為房租百分之十八、如再增捐百分之五十、則無異將捐率增至合房租之百分之二十七、上海習慣、房捐除房主自居自付外、其餘概山承租人二房東繳付、戰後曾因加捐及水電費增加、二房東與三房客間、為加租糾紛迭起、茲再加捐百分之五十、則二房東仍轉嫁於三房客、加租糾紛又將澎湃、又地捐增加、亦必刺激房產業主提高租金、彼此轉嫁、最後負擔者、仍為一般平民、目前高物價、平民均巳焦頭爛額、尙復能繼續誅求乎、
According to taxpayers, if the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed tax increases are implemented, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. The current levy rate for the Municipal General Tax (property tax) is 18% of the rent. If it is increased by another 50%, it would be the same as raising the tax rate to 27% of the rent. According to Shanghai custom, property tax, except for homeowners who live in and pay their own taxes, is generally paid by tenants and sub-landlords. After the war, due to increased taxes and utility costs, rent disputes arose repeatedly between sub-landlords and third-party tenants. Now, if the tax is increased by another 50%, the sub-landlords will still pass it on to the third-party tenants, and rent disputes will surge again. Furthermore, an increase in land tax will inevitably encourage property owners to raise rents, passing the burden on to each other, with the final burden falling on the general public. With current high prices, the common people are already overwhelmed; how can they continue to be exploited?

增奢侈稅寓禁於征
Increasing Luxury Taxes Combines Prohibition with Taxation

在此時艱、停止加捐、為中外同深切望、設工部局節流上果無辦法、而定欲藉增捐以彌補虧空、平衡預算、亦應轉移目標於奢侈消耗方面、因此項捐稅、取之無妨於平民生計、有一部份人士主張、工部局在此財政困難之時、不妨增收各項奢侈稅、如舞塲遊藝塲戲院等、因此項增稅轉嫁之結果、為有力之消費者、稅收雖重、不失寓禁於征、
In these difficult times, stopping tax increases is the deep hope of both Chinese and foreigners. If the Shanghai Municipal Council truly has no way to reduce expenditures and is determined to make up for deficits and balance the budget by increasing taxes, it should shift its focus to luxury consumption. This type of tax does not harm the livelihood of the common people. Some people advocate that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in this time of financial difficulty, may as well increase various luxury taxes, such as on dance halls, amusement parks, and theaters. The result of passing on this tax increase is powerful consumers, and although the tax revenue is heavy, it does not lose the combination of prohibition and taxation.

國內郵資增價　祗限於信函類
Domestic Postage Increase Limited to Letters

平信郵資本埠三分外埠七分　新聞紙及印刷品等並不增價
Local Ordinary Postage Three Cents, Out-of-Town Seven Cents; Newspapers and Printed Matter Not Increased

國內郵資、據大通計記者探悉、尙係於民國二十一年五月一度增價、迄茲已歷時九年、以目前人力物力暨運輸上之費用增高、故民衆對郵政資費之酌量增價、殆為極合乎情理之舉措、據悉此次增價、祗限於信函方面、如新聞紙印刷品、聞並不增價、故於文化事業毫無影響、關於增加數額、據西南方面郵局所透露、平信本埤由二分增至三分、外埠由五分加為七分　明信片則由二分半增為三分半、掛號信由一角三分增為二角、平快郵件由一角增至一角四分、快遞掛號由一角七分增加為二角五分、故其遞增數額、亦殊有限、惟是否於四月一日起實行一點、則上海郵政管理局尙未奉到總局命令、猶難明悉、
According to reports from Datong, domestic postage was last increased in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), nine years ago. Due to the current increase in labor, materials, and transportation costs, a reasonable increase in postal rates is a very logical measure. It is understood that this increase is limited to letters. It is said that newspapers and printed matter will not be increased, so there is no impact on cultural undertakings. Regarding the amount of the increase, according to the post office in the southwest, local ordinary letters will increase from two cents to three cents, and out-of-town letters will increase from five cents to seven cents. Postcards will increase from two and a half cents to three and a half cents, registered letters from 13 cents to 20 cents, ordinary express mail from 10 cents to 14 cents, and express registered mail from 17 cents to 25 cents. Therefore, the amount of the increase is also very limited. However, whether it will be implemented on April 1st has not been clarified, as the Shanghai Postal Administration has not yet received orders from the head office.

美名法學家霍薩曼談　美國不應退出遠東
Famous American Jurist Hossam Talks: The United States Should Not Withdraw from the Far East

如允可菲島如期宣布獨立　恐一旦實現必遭他國侵略
If the Philippines is Allowed to Declare Independence as Scheduled, It is Feared That It Will Be Invaded by Other Countries Once It Becomes a Reality

在馬尼剌負有盛名之法官霍薩曼氏、昨日由馬尼剌抵滬、對菲列賓之獨立問題、發表談話、叙述頗詳、茲誌其大要如下、美政府雖巳宣布自一九四六年起、允可菲列賓宣布獨立、霍薩曼氏以為、此舉如果實現、則無異宣布美國·英國·法國·荷蘭·及其他歐西各國之在遠東權益、其末日將臨、蓋菲列賓一旦宣布獨立、將被日人所併吞、實僅係時間問題、
Judge Hossam, who enjoys a high reputation in Manila, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Manila and gave a detailed speech on the issue of Philippine independence. The main points are recorded below. Although the U.S. government has announced that it will allow the Philippines to declare independence starting in 1946, Mr. Hossam believes that if this is realized, it would be tantamount to announcing the end of the rights and interests of the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other Western countries in the Far East. Once the Philippines declares independence, it will be annexed by the Japanese, which is only a matter of time.

一旦獨立命運堪憂
Fate is Worrying Once Independent

訪者詢及菲人是否願於一九四六年後、仍受美國政府之保護、時霍薩曼氏莞爾稱、「恕余不能代表菲人、表示意見」、惟霍薩曼氏認為如在一九四六年七月四日、菲列賓實行宣布獨立、則菲人此後之命運、自堪憂慮、以日人之侵略勢力、固無一不足以威脅菲人也、故苟菲人明乎此種危機、聲請自願繼續受美國之保護、則美政府當即可推翻成議、
When asked whether Filipinos would still be willing to be protected by the U.S. government after 1946, Mr. Hossam smiled and said, "Please forgive me for not being able to represent the Filipinos and express my opinions." However, Mr. Hossam believes that if the Philippines implements its declaration of independence on July 4, 1946, the fate of the Filipinos thereafter is worrying. The aggressive forces of the Japanese are sufficient to threaten the Filipinos. Therefore, if the Filipinos understand this crisis and request to continue to be protected by the United States, the U.S. government should be able to overturn the agreement.

美國貿易必受影響
U.S. Trade Will Be Affected

至目前菲人一致要求獨立、　間雖未嘗元反對之者、惟因不願違反領袖之意志、與損害國家體面、故此舉現時尙未露顯著之跡象、菲列賓總統奎松氏、對於獨立、恐已作秘密之準備矣、霍薩曼氏復又稱、關於菲列賓獨立問題、渠曾徵求美國旅菲巨商之意見、彼等對此項問題、均不十分重視、而僅認為菲島宣布獨立後、美商對菲對華貿易、必受重大影響、
Currently, Filipinos unanimously demand independence, and although there are no opponents, because they do not want to violate the will of their leaders and damage national prestige, this move has not yet shown significant signs. Philippine President Quezon may have already made secret preparations for independence. Mr. Hossam further stated that regarding the issue of Philippine independence, he had sought the opinions of American tycoons traveling in the Philippines. They did not pay much attention to this issue and only believed that after the Philippine Islands declared independence, U.S. trade with the Philippines and China would be significantly affected.

日本勢將獨覇遠東
Japan Will Dominate the Far East

惟霍薩曼氏認為美國在菲列賓之勢力、實足為穩定遠東局勢之唯一原動力、如美國勢力一旦撒離菲島、首先受影響者、常為英國、蓋英國勢必被排出於遠東及中國之外也、其次法國、亦將不保其在越南之勢力、荷蘭將喪失統制荷屬東印度之權力、若是、日本將一躍而執遠東之牛耳矣、
However, Mr. Hossam believes that the U.S. influence in the Philippines is the only driving force to stabilize the situation in the Far East. If U.S. influence is withdrawn from the Philippine Islands, the first to be affected will be Britain, because Britain will inevitably be excluded from the Far East and China. Secondly, France will also be unable to maintain its influence in Vietnam, and the Netherlands will lose its power to control the Dutch East Indies. If so, Japan will leap to the forefront and dominate the Far East.

兩大條件尙未具體
Two Major Conditions Not Yet Concrete

惟美國之宣布菲島獨立、在另一方面言、未始非遠東各國之福、在遠東各國中、日本當然為獲利最厚者、其他各國、則或將因菲列賓民治意識之逐漸擴大、而使遠東各國一致奮起、霍薩曼氏又以為菲島如欲宣布獨立、必須具有之條件、為二千五百萬或三千五百萬之人口、而其經濟及軍事機構、均足以抵禦外侮時始可、彼又以為菲島獨立後、其人民之生活程度、或將减低、蓋在美菲間之貿易、必彼此互相减低物價、以冀在海外競銷、
However, from another perspective, the United States' announcement of Philippine independence may not be a blessing for all countries in the Far East. Among the countries in the Far East, Japan will of course be the biggest beneficiary. Other countries may be inspired by the gradual expansion of the Philippine people's awareness of civil rights, causing all countries in the Far East to rise up together. Mr. Hossam also believes that if the Philippine Islands want to declare independence, they must have a population of 25 million or 35 million, and their economic and military institutions must be sufficient to resist foreign aggression. He also believes that after the Philippine Islands become independent, the living standards of its people may decline, because trade between the United States and the Philippines will inevitably reduce prices for each other in order to compete in overseas sales.

霍氏略歷年高德劭
Mr. Hossam's Brief History: Old, Respected, and Highly Virtuous

按霍薩曼氏年巳七十有五、為菲島著名之兩大礦業公司之大股東、霍氏為美俄亥俄州人、曾參加美國與西班牙之戰爭、戰後即至菲島執行律師職務、一九一五年投資開發金礦、因是成名、為世界著名之鉅商與推事、數年前、霍氏曾返俄亥俄州故里、而建立該州之唯一銀行、霍氏此次來滬、純屬旅行性質、彼頗希望能於最近甫返故鄕一游云、
Mr. Hossam is 75 years old and a major shareholder in two famous mining companies in the Philippine Islands. Mr. Hossam is from Ohio, USA. He participated in the Spanish-American War and went to the Philippine Islands after the war to practice law. In 1915, he invested in the development of gold mines and became famous for this. He is a world-renowned businessman and judge. A few years ago, Mr. Hossam returned to his hometown in Ohio and established the state's only bank. Mr. Hossam's visit to Shanghai this time is purely for travel purposes. He hopes to visit his recently returned home soon.

Donations of memorial banners and scrolls from all sectors are welcome and will be converted into coal and rice coupons to help refugees. Yesterday, according to Commander Xie Jinyuan's announcement to a reporter from the New Voice Society, "Mr. Tao inquired in a letter whether the name of the Lost Battalion could be used to raise coal and rice coupons outside to help refugees. I believe that door-to-door fundraising is strictly prohibited. If a campaign is launched within a school, organization, or company, it is permissible. All donations to this camp, whether goods or cash, will be acknowledged with a receipt signed by me personally. For the past two days, all donations of coal and rice funds have been declined and not accepted. Starting from today (the 19th), these funds will be accepted and sent directly to this camp. No matter whether it is monetary donations or coal and rice coupons, they must not be used for any other purpose. The method of distribution should be appropriate. After a considerable amount has been accumulated, we plan to publicly solicit opinions from all sectors in order to ensure that refugees are truly benefited."

據香港十八日電稱、關於實施憲政問題滬市各界均極重視、惟以環境特殊、對於中央實施憲政之意見、不無有隔膜之處、記者特往訪中央組織部副部長吳開先氏（前滬市選舉事務所總幹事）、承將所提各問題遂條詳答如下、（問）先生對實施憲政之意見如何、（答）本黨此次召開國民大會、實施憲政、實所以貫澈本黨數十年來一貫主張、惟本黨所推行之訓政工作、年來因國事多故、未能依限完成、故實施憲政之中、扔繼續推行訓政未完成之工作、使將來憲政實現、可有圓滿之收穫、而勿蹈過去草率從事之覆轍、（問）國大代表之選舉及其職權、現有一部份人主重行選舉、對其職權亦有擬予明白規定者、是否可行、（答）國大代表之選舉問題、中央已有規定、即巳依法辦竣、選舉之區域所產生之代表、除有附逆情事外、其餘均一律有效、此係法理所當然之事、且辦地選舉決非易事、更非短時間所能辦竣、在此抗戰期間、一切更為困難、此種重選主張、乃完全不明實際情况之幼稚見　、徒足亂人聽聞而已、至代表職權問題、應俟憲法通過後、依據憲法所賦予之權限而行使之、此刻斷不能以組織法來限止制憲機關之權力、並預定憲法之內容也、前已由中央鄭重釋明、作此主張者恐均未見中央以前之解釋、而有此誤會也、（問）先生對於憲法草案、有何意見、（答）憲法草案旣經立法院鄭重草擬、然後公佈、其合法性及鄭重性、當無可置疑、但中央對於意草、猶恐或有未能盡抒所見之處、則凡有建議、仍可依法提出於國民大會、中央之關顧民意及重視憲法之苦心、亦可見一般矣、（問）滬市有無促進憲法之總的組織、（答）促進憲政實為人民應有之表示、但滬市環境特殊、尙無此項組織、惟各合法團體及因抗戰而產生之愛國民衆組織、大都已開始研究憲草內容及實施憲政之準備各問題、將各自整理討論所得之意見、製成方案、送由國民參政會或滬市國大代表、代為提出、事實上似無此項組織之必要、（問）滬市少數刊物及其他印刷品中對於實施憲政問題、究討似有越出範圍之處、是否含有其他背景或惡意作用、（答）本人相信此類刊物大都為未明瞭本屆國民代表大會之過去辦理情形者、致對許多已結束之問題（如選舉法等）、尙在作種種無謂之爭議、實屬徒費筆墨而巳、且本人相信舉凡眞誠謀國之士、對於仟何問題之究討、決不致遺忘現在目前之最大問題、斷不肯作分化人心動搖信念之舉、故前在滬上曾與各界熱心意政人士多人座談一次、對此項問題均詳加研討後、均已明瞭、至少數刊物仍在研討此項問題者、是否別有用意、尙不可知、惟目前偽方亦在高唱「憲政」、擾亂聽聞之際、我儕自不能不予以注意、余希望滬上熱心憲政之人士、在研討此問題時、應嚴重警戒、愼勿為人利用、以破瓖中央威信、為日偽所竊笑、此乃我人所應嚴切注意者也、
According to a dispatch from Hong Kong on the 18th, all sectors of Shanghai attach great importance to the issue of implementing constitutionalism. However, due to the special environment, there are some communication barriers regarding the central government's views on implementing constitutionalism. The reporter specially visited Mr. Wu Kaixian, Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department (former Director-General of the Shanghai Election Office), who kindly provided detailed answers to the various questions raised: (Q) What is your opinion on the implementation of constitutionalism? (A) The Kuomintang's convening of the National Assembly and implementing constitutionalism this time is to implement the party's consistent principles over the past few decades. However, the tutelage work promoted by our party has not been completed on schedule in recent years due to many national affairs. Therefore, during the implementation of constitutionalism, we will continue to promote the unfinished work of tutelage, so that the future realization of constitutionalism can have satisfactory results and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past hasty actions. (Q) Regarding the election and powers of the National Assembly representatives, some people now advocate re-elections and propose to clarify their powers. Is this feasible? (A) The central government has already made regulations regarding the election of National Assembly representatives, and they have been completed in accordance with the law. The representatives produced by the elected regions are all valid, except for those who have defected to the enemy. This is a matter of legal principle. Moreover, organizing elections on the ground is by no means easy, nor can it be completed in a short period of time. During this period of resistance against Japan, everything is even more difficult. This kind of advocacy for re-election is a naive view that completely misunderstands the actual situation and only serves to confuse people. As for the issue of the powers of the representatives, it should wait until the constitution is passed and exercised in accordance with the powers granted by the constitution. At this moment, it is impossible to limit the powers of the constitutional assembly with organizational laws or to predetermine the content of the constitution. The central government has already made a solemn clarification on this matter. Those who advocate this may not have seen the central government's previous explanations and have this misunderstanding. (Q) What are your opinions on the draft constitution? (A) The draft constitution has been carefully drafted by the Legislative Yuan and then promulgated. Its legality and solemnity are beyond doubt. However, the central government is still concerned that it may not have been able to fully express its views, so any suggestions can still be submitted to the National Assembly in accordance with the law. The central government's concern for public opinion and its emphasis on the constitution can also be seen in general. (Q) Is there a general organization in Shanghai to promote the constitution? (A) Promoting constitutionalism is an expression that the people should have. However, due to the special environment in Shanghai, there is no such organization. However, various legitimate groups and patriotic mass organizations that have emerged due to the war of resistance have mostly begun to study the content of the draft constitution and the preparation for implementing constitutionalism. They will organize and discuss the opinions they have obtained, formulate plans, and send them to the National Senate or the National Assembly representatives in Shanghai for submission. In fact, there seems to be no need for such an organization. (Q) Some publications and other printed matter in Shanghai seem to be overstepping the scope of their discussion on the issue of implementing constitutionalism. Does this contain other backgrounds or malicious effects? (A) I believe that most of these publications do not understand the past handling of this National Assembly of National Representatives, resulting in all sorts of unnecessary disputes over many concluded issues (such as election laws, etc.). This is really a waste of ink. Moreover, I believe that all those who sincerely seek the country will not forget the biggest issue at hand when discussing any issue and will never take actions that divide people's hearts and shake their faith. Therefore, I once held a forum with many enthusiastic political figures in Shanghai. After detailed discussions on this issue, they have all understood it. Whether a few publications are still discussing this issue for other purposes is still unknown. However, at a time when the puppet regime is also chanting "constitutionalism" to confuse people, we cannot but pay attention. I hope that those in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about constitutionalism should be seriously vigilant when discussing this issue and be careful not to be used by others to damage the central government's prestige and be laughed at by the Japanese puppets. This is what we should pay close attention to.

Nearly Repeating the Tragedy of the Jingsheng

哈納輪船、十八日由滬駛抵鎮海口外、當日下午二時、由天寳駁輪接運旅客駛進甬江、及駛至淸水浦地方、突與新大利駁輪互撞、雙方受傷、而以天寳輪傷勢尤重、一時旅客大起驚皇、以為又將肇景昇輪慘禍、幸駁輪公司得訊、當派新寗餘駁輪將受驚旅客、轉駁抵埠、方各慶生還、亦云險矣、

When it reached the Qingshui Pu area, it suddenly collided with the Xin Daliai barge. Both sides were injured, and the Tianbao barge was more seriously damaged. Passengers were panicked for a moment, thinking that the tragedy of the Jingsheng ship was about to be repeated. Fortunately, the barge company received the news and sent the Xin Ningyu barge to transfer the frightened passengers to the dock, and everyone was glad to be alive. It was indeed dangerous.

中國古玩書畫珍寳　充斥美國各都市
Chinese Antiques, Calligraphy, Painting and Treasures Flood American Cities

引起其硏究之興趣與決心
Arousing Interest and Determination to Study Them

對中國文化表示深切同情
Expressing Deep Sympathy for Chinese Culture

美國某著名古玩珠寳商、於昨日抵滬、對記者談稱、中國古玩珍品書畫、最近充斥美國市上、至於中國古玩運銷美國如是衆多之主要原因、渠以為約有二因、第一、居住於淪陷區或非淪陷區內之華人、均恐所藏之古玩珍品遭無妄之災、故一致將所有送往美國保存、或在美獲得高價脫售
A famous American antique and jewelry dealer arrived in Shanghai yesterday and told reporters that Chinese antiques, treasures, calligraphy, and paintings have recently flooded the American market. As for the main reasons why so many Chinese antiques are transported and sold in the United States, he believes that there are two reasons: First, Chinese people living in occupied or non-occupied areas are all afraid that their collections of antiques and treasures will suffer unwarranted disasters, so they all send their possessions to the United States for safekeeping or sell them at high prices in the United States.

第二、淪陷區中之日人、大半均由日軍手中搜集古玩珍寳、而運銷美國、以圖重利、現美人對中國古玩珍寳、已發生極大興趣、對中國之古代藝術、均表驚異、職是之故、美人對中國之一切問題、其人民之生活、其人民受日機轟炸之慘狀等等、均表深切同情
Second, most of the Japanese people in the occupied areas collect antiques and treasures from the Japanese army and transport and sell them to the United States in order to make a large profit. Now, Americans have developed a great interest in Chinese antiques and treasures, and they are all amazed by the ancient art of China. For this reason, Americans have deep sympathy for all issues related to China, the lives of its people, the tragic state of its people being bombed by Japanese planes, etc.

出版界方面、關於中國書籍之出版、極形活躍

### Finance European Peace Makes No Progress, US Dollar Speculators Surge Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation showed that listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate in the unofficial market continued to fluctuate. Although the outcome was slightly firmer, there seemed to be a brewing trend towards softening. Speculators, considering the outcome of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, saw no progress towards peace on the Western Front and a possibility of escalating the war. Foreign dispatches today even suggested that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were about to sign a military alliance, intending to threaten Britain and France to make concessions and accept peace. Fearing that the future would worsen significantly, people generally anticipated a potential decline in the US-British exchange rate, leading to a majority of speculators going long on the US dollar. Conversely, there was little interest in the British pound. The forward rate fluctuated slightly more than the spot rate, mainly because, in the afternoon, a telegraphic report denied the US Secretary of State's involvement in mediating European affairs. This strengthened the resolve of market participants, who mostly abandoned near-term positions and went long on far-term contracts.

The morning session initially eased

In the early morning, the London rates for both near and far terms narrowed by 1.25. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate against the British pound and the French franc remained flat. The exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 0.0625. The US dollar continued to rise by 0.25 against the British pound, increased by 0.1 against Shanghai, and increased by 0.875 against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, banks offered spot selling prices of 4s 1.40625d for British gold and $6.50 for the US dollar, with the British pound easing by 0.015625 and the US dollar firming by 0.03125 compared to the previous close. After the opening, Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient (華比) and Chase Bank followed suit, and the market continued to ease. Banque Belge sold US dollars for the current month at $6.50 to a certain bank, and Chase Bank sold US dollars for the current month at $6.50 to Chinese merchants. Subsequently, buyers became more scarce, and the situation became even more relaxed. It was difficult to find a counterparty for US dollars at $6.53125 for the current month. When HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to have decreased by 0.5%, Banque Belge suddenly re-entered the market at the original price, buying US dollars for the current month from other banks at $6.50. At the same time, Wah Hsing Bank (華行), Shanghai Bank and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu (喬直甫), and a few speculators, also entered the market with higher bids, turning the trend firmer. The US dollar was once difficult to settle at $6.50. However, at that time, the current shilling was still at 4s 1.40625d. Suddenly, a telegraphic report came from Hong Kong offering to sell, and some Chinese merchants also sold, causing the market to ease again. Hong Kong Electric (港電) sold spot British gold to HSBC at 4s 1.5625d, and speculators sold US dollars for the current month to China Overseas Chinese Bank (華僑) at $6.53125. However, a certain bank resumed buying, absorbing US dollars for the current month from other banks at $6.50. It was also reported that a certain Chinese bank was also absorbing US dollars on behalf of Hong Kong businesses, causing the market to stabilize again. By the close, British gold remained at 4s 1.40625d, and the US dollar remained at $6.50, with no change compared to the morning opening.

Speculation Resumes on Forward Contracts

The market initially opened at 4s 1.40625d and $6.50. Subsequently, due to telegraphic reports that the US Undersecretary of State Welles denied mediating European peace, general speculators were drawn back to go long on forward US dollars, causing the current US dollar to tighten slightly. Wah Hsing Bank bought US dollars for the next month from foreign banks at $6.375, more than $10 above the New York rate, and bought US dollars for the current month from foreign banks at $6.46875. At that time, the current US dollar could only be settled at $6.46875. Later, Chase Bank still showed interest in spot, so the current US dollar returned to flat. Forward contracts, however, remained soft. By the close, British gold was at 4s 1.40625d, the US dollar at $6.50, British gold for the current month at 4s 1.125d, the US dollar at $6.46875, British gold for the next month at 4s 1.0625d, and the US dollar at $6.34375. As a result, spot British pound eased by 0.015625 and the US dollar firmed by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures for the current month saw British pound unchanged and US dollar decreasing by 0.03125. For the next month, both British and US exchange rates saw no change.

Hong Kong British-US Exchange Rate Stable

Hong Kong, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat today. The current US dollar exchange rate was unchanged. The US currency spot rate eased by 0.125 to $23.3125. The forward rate eased by 0.1875 to $23.1875. The Shanghai exchange rate spot rate decreased by $1 to $357. The Japanese exchange rate spot rate increased by $1.5 to $99. At 10:15, the market reported flat. The Shanghai exchange rate spot rate rebounded by $0.5 to $357.5. At 11:09, the market was stable. The US dollar spot rate remained at the original level. The forward rate tightened by 0.0625 to $23.125. At 11:30, the market reported flat. All exchange rates saw no change. At the noon close, the US dollar spot rate tightened by 0.0625 to $13.25. The forward rate was unchanged. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM. All exchange rates saw no change.

Tianjin British Pound Decreases, US Dollar Unchanged

Tianjin, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened firm this morning. The British pound spot rate decreased by 0.03125 to 3s 8.4375d. The US dollar spot rate was unchanged, remaining at $6.03125. The Shanghai exchange rate increased by $0.5 to $107. The (Joint Note) unofficial market was unchanged at $101.

### European Situation Unstable, Gold Prices Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall

Yesterday's market situation for cash gold and the unofficial market showed a steep rise after a fall. It is not an exaggeration to say that gold prices are easy to rise but difficult to fall. After retreating from the $5,000 mark several times, it returned to it, mainly because the foreign exchange market first eased and then rebounded, and there was news that the US Undersecretary of State denied mediating the European war, causing the atmosphere of peace to fade abruptly. People's hearts were extremely unsettled. Initially, the exchange rate between the US and Britain soared, with the British pound flat and the US dollar easing. Therefore, sellers appeared after the opening. In particular, a certain securities firm, which had aggressively absorbed gold the previous day, suddenly sold, and the buying was no match. The price once fell to $4,970. Unexpectedly, "a certain bank" saw the low price and commissioned a securities firm to aggressively buy. At noon, the market turned from weak to firm. In the afternoon, that bank continued to buy, and the price rose sharply to $5,045. Finally, many retail investors sold, and the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and returned to flat, turning weak again. The market closed at $5,028, down only slightly by $2. The total trading volume for the day was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fell and then returned to flat, remaining at $510. Customs gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Only Decreased by Two Dollars

Since the morning, the exchange market initially eased, and sentiment was very low, with a chorus of selling voices. The market immediately fell by $30 per bar (10 taels). A gold shop released 50 taels from a silver shop for $5,000. Shortly after, in a competition among securities firms and gold shops, the price fell by another $18. A securities firm released 10 taels to a money exchange for $4,982. Subsequently, thanks to a sudden surge in buying from a certain bank, and at that time, the US dollar in the foreign exchange market turned soft, silver shops and gold shops also entered the market, and the price rebounded by $21. A money exchange released 30 taels from a silver shop for $5,003. However, because a certain securities firm sold again, selling more than 200 taels, the price was pressed down again by $18. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a gold shop for $4,985. After that, a certain money exchange suddenly came to aggressively buy, and the securities firm had no intention of selling, and the price rebounded by $20. A silver shop released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,005. Soon, the exchange market eased again, and money exchanges and gold shops rushed to sell, while retail investors also sold, causing the price to fall again by $35. A money exchange released 30 taels to a securities firm for $4,970. Later, fortunately, a certain securities firm suddenly came to resume buying, and at that time, Hong Kong businesses were also searching for gold, and the foreign exchange market turned stable again, and the price rebounded by $45. A silver shop released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,015. At noon, buyers gradually became scarce, and silver shops took the opportunity to sell at a high price, decreasing by $10. A silver shop released 10 taels to a gold shop for $5,005, making the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market gradually became firm. The market opened $10 higher, with a silver shop buying 20 taels from a gold shop for $5,015. Subsequently, due to silver shops continuing to search for gold, the price increased by another $7, with a silver shop buying 30 taels from a securities firm for $5,022. Later, a jewelry shop sold, initially decreasing by $12, with silver shops trading 10 taels for $5,010. Afterwards, a certain securities firm resumed dragging in, and with the help of Hong Kong businesses, and with the exchange rate reported to be tightening, the price was raised by $35. A jewelry shop bought 50 taels from a silver shop for $5,045. After entering, another securities firm suddenly sold, and the current US dollar was reported to be firming, and buyers stopped buying, and the price fell by $19. A securities firm released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,016. Later, thanks to a certain money exchange aggressively buying, the price rebounded again, rising by $12. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a securities firm for $5,028, making the evening closing price. As a result, the price was reduced by $2 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $75 for the entire day.

The US dollar in the black market continued to ease, causing the rate to fall to $15.13. Later, demand increased slightly, and the rate rebounded to $15.22 at noon. In the afternoon, there were sudden reports that the US Undersecretary of State would not participate in any European negotiations, and the British pound exchange rate would likely fall again. Generally nervous people rushed to buy again, and the rate suddenly rose to $15.30 after 3 o'clock, but then retreated to $15.26. British gold notes initially rose and then fell.

### Securities Public Bonds Sold at High Prices, Foreign Stocks Closed Lower

The unofficial securities market yesterday saw a slight stabilization due to the continuous rise in market prices in recent days. Class C bonds once rose to $49.60, but then fell back due to sales at high prices. Currently, the market price is still not easy to return quickly due to a lack of trading codes. Class E bonds once broke through the $9 mark, but then retreated. The trend should stabilize for a while, and sentiment is still very firm. Yesterday morning, in the buying by Lianyi, Daqing, Hongkang, etc., various bonds improved by 20-30 cents. Then, due to selling by Jiufeng, Lianhe, Xinfu, Tongshun, etc., the market weakened. Although Tongkang, Lemaochang, etc. still had demand, the market atmosphere felt weak. The noon market price was roughly the same as the previous day. In the afternoon, Xinfu, Jiufeng, and Changji continued to buy, Lianhe continued to sell, and Tongshun also turned from buying to selling. Other securities such as Tai Fung and Tiansheng were sold off. The price was stable and unchanged. As a result, the highs and lows were mixed, with a difference of only 5-10 cents. The trading volume was about 1 million dollars. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of $44.50.

Yesterday's market situation at the Public Association: There was no market in the morning due to settlement. The market was very strong after the afternoon opening, so trading was quite active, and the price was still firm. Shanghai Bank and Jardine Matheson shares have recently been traded in large volumes at this new high price line of $135, as I predicted. Sellers were strong before the close, causing all shares to decline. The market was still weak at the close. However, there was no reason for the rise in selling. It was only whether there was hope for the realization of peace in Europe. Rubber shares remained weak for similar reasons.

London, 18th (Monday) dispatch: Today's London market for Chinese foreign debt showed mixed gains and losses. The Anglo-German Continued Loan (英發) and the Rehabilitation Loan (英發) each fell by £1, the former to £58 and the latter to £39. The Beining Railway Public Bond uniquely rose by £2 to £57.

### Grain Foreign Rice Plummets

Yesterday's rice market was still downstream, but the decline was not as drastic as before. Although the market opened early, guests observed, and floating hoarders continued to sell, and the price of each commodity fell by about $1.50. However, later, general guests saw that the original roots were not removed, and the prices seemed to have fallen through, so they took advantage of the low prices to make moves. Therefore, the situation in the afternoon gradually tightened, and the prices rebounded. However, they were about 50 cents to a dollar lower than the previous market. At the close, No. 1 Saigon was $38.5, No. 2 was $35, Special Siam was $37, No. 2 was $35.25, Fire Twisted was $36.5, $36, Small Twisted was $35.2, $35, Mixed Broken was $31.13, $31. The price of glutinous rice was already low, and seeing foreign rice showing hesitation, the cargo owners were unwilling to sell. As a result, the situation was flat and weak. National rice such as thick and thin japonica rice, early and late rice, which was transferred from Hongkou, gradually became popular. Yesterday, there were more than 2,000 bags. It was rumored that the unofficial market outside the market had weakened by nearly a dollar. The previous cargo from the city was not sampled, and there was no market.

After foreign rice plummeted for several consecutive days, it was further pressured by multiple factors such as incoming goods and warehouse rents. The market continued to look down. After yesterday's opening, the selling pressure increased, and the price of No. 1 Saigon in the general market fell to $37.56. Return cargo was devalued by floating households, and the market became more weak. The current foreign rice also fell by $1.23. Later, the actual sales once improved by $0.4. However, the return cargo of No. 1 Saigon was originally quoted at $48.5 and No. 2 at $44.5. There was a lack of buyers in the afternoon. In the morning, Small Twisted was $44. In the afternoon, it fell to $42.7, and sentiment was still depressed.

### Flour Flat Selling Period Expires, Factory Price Increases by $3.80

Yesterday was the last day of the current flour flat selling period. The factory price of No. 2 flour, after repeated consultations between the factory and the Public Works Bureau, was proposed to increase by $3.80 per bag, changing to a price of $13.80. After this decision, the flat selling event was implicitly cancelled. The authorities and all parties hoped to continue the low-priced flat selling. However, considering the current sharp fall in rice prices, the flour mill's increase was too rapid and large. It was heard that since the factory price had increased to $13.80, the factory could supply the local market as much as possible, so the return flour market was quite affected. It was heard that the old car brand eased to $14.10 and $14, the Fuxin brand was $13.75, the Tianzhu brand was $14, and the Japanese factory flour Double Lion brand was $13.65. The transaction volume was about 4,000-5,000 bags.

Wheat The market was still stable yesterday. Since the factory price of flour had increased to $13.80, the wheat price could not be too loose. After the Changxi wheat fell to $23.50, it gradually aroused the buying intentions of a certain factory. The Tongshi market sold more than 10 cars of Changzhou wheat at a price of $23.50-$23.70. The future market situation will depend on how the environment changes.

### Miscellaneous Grains Oil Beans Fall Rapidly

Due to the influence of the environment, sentiment in the miscellaneous grains and oil bean market was extremely chaotic. Buying and selling were still tight, and the market price fell again and again.

In the oil market, only the local market absorbed 180 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and the price plummeted from $110 to $107, a sharp drop of $9 compared to the previous day's market. Dayou factory soybean oil also fell by $8, with 280 dan traded at $83. There were no other transactions.

In addition to the local market absorbing some, soybean was purchased by oil mills operated by Japanese merchants.

### Cotton Yarn General Public Sells Short April Futures, Yarn Market Plummets, Current Double Horse Falls by $21

The yarn market was very weak, and the decline was particularly strong. This was because it was reported that there might be peace in Europe, and at the same time, overseas Indian and American cotton markets were declining. As a result, sentiment turned frustrated, and short sellers were active. The general public unanimously sold short April futures, causing the market to immediately lose its looseness and fall immediately. However, the major bulls were calm due to the factory shutdowns. The price of 20-count Double Horse April futures initially traded at $970, falling to $948. In the afternoon, it traded again at $954, but sales were still sustainable.

Current Yarn The opening was heard that the British and American exchange rates were rising, and there was a strong atmosphere of Zhou peace. Sellers were active, and the price of 20-count Double Horse for the current month was $960, a drop of $10 from the previous day. Later, with the US dollar continuing to rise, buyers were not strong, and the market became more depressed, falling to $948. Those who made profits in the middle covered their positions, and the price rebounded to $953-954. However, the short side was determined, and the price fell again to $938. The close slightly rebounded to $942. The transaction volume for half a day was 2,305 bags, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse fell by $21. Today, 80 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of daily purchases by various gangs is listed on the left.

### Chinese and Foreign Cotton Prices Unanimously Decline

There were fewer transactions for local cotton. This was because the Indian and American cotton markets turned downward, causing sentiment to soften and the market price to be slightly weak. However, inventory was getting thinner. For Su Bei origin, there were 581 bags of Tonghua. The transaction situation for current cotton is listed on the left.

Another dispatch on foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially quiet. Later, due to selling by the Liverpool gang in the market, and the settlement of some multi-headed, the market was dull all day. As a result, the closing price was 2 pound sounds lower than the previous day for near-term contracts, and 5 pound sounds lower for far-term contracts. The Indian cotton market saw a sharp drop in cotton prices of 9 mixed rupees due to rumors of peace in the market. However, the forecast showed a slight improvement of 2 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market fell by more than 30 pound sounds.

Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai: The exchange rate rose slightly, but the market sentiment was still weak due to the continued decline in overseas cotton markets, so there was no improvement in transactions. The industry was indifferent, and the factories did not purchase raw cotton because of the low cotton prices. The development of transactions in recent days may be hopeless. The price of the cotton market yesterday, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of $6.50, is as follows:

### Sugar Market Raw White Arrives in Large Quantities, Continues to Loosen

### Metals Tinplate Prices are High and Sales are Stagnant

The tinplate market, which has been good for a long time, saw a decrease in sales at various sales venues yesterday. Such as the local can factories, biscuit companies, and foreign gangs were afraid to purchase due to tight money and high prices. The business suddenly felt sluggish. However, the selling price was affected by the overseas pricing cost and did not soften. For example, 180-pound Italian double-linked iron box was sold for $190, 180-pound American double-linked iron box was sold for $195 per box, 200-pound positive American tinplate box was called $210. Only the asking price was heard, and there was no actual transaction.

Black iron billets were reported to be sold for $800 for 2,000 pounds and $78 for 200 pounds yesterday (Note: yesterday's publication was $830 for 2,000 pounds and $80 for 200 pounds, which is incorrect).

### Chamber of Commerce Receives Telegram from Ministry of Finance to Suppress and Stabilize Prices and Stabilize the Exchange Market, Hoarding and Manipulation Have Not Been Stopped, Affecting People's Livelihoods, Quickly Determine Effective Measures to Implement on a Specific Date

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, According to reports, since the spring, the exchange market in Shanghai has fluctuated greatly, and the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared, exceeding the scope allowed by exchange rate changes. The price increases of rice and flour are particularly significant. The main reason is the manipulation of hoarders. It is necessary to find ways to prevent hoarding and manipulation, which will not only stabilize prices but also benefit the stabilization of the exchange market. It is hereby ordered to quickly discuss and determine effective measures and implement them effectively. Please also telegraph to the Ministry for verification. Special printed by the Ministry of Finance.

The Shanghai French Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee held its second general meeting on the 13th of this month. The three sub-committees submitted investigation reports with plans, requesting review and submission to the French Consul General for approval. It is heard that it will be announced and implemented soon. The three sub-committees have now submitted two reports, but their work has not stopped. They are continuing to investigate the market situation in order to obtain new factual basis.

### Ministry of Finance Clearly Orders the Recall of Copper Coins, Punish Private Export, Extremely Strict Punishment Measures

The various sizes of old and new copper coins previously issued in mainland China and the newly cast one-cent copper coins in recent years have been extremely scarce. The reason is due to the surge in demand for metals after the outbreak of the European War. The main reason is the lack of metals in Japan, which has been searching for them in every possible way, resulting in smugglers buying copper coins and smuggling them out of the country in large numbers. The copper coins and newly minted cent coins currently stored in China are very few. Each cent coin can make a bullet, and old copper coins with high composition are equal to cent coins. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has clearly ordered them to be recalled and no longer minted, and the Supplementary Coin Regulations have been revised to adjust the color and weight of the one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent auxiliary coins. The Central Bank and local banks are allowed to issue one-cent and five-cent coin notes to replace them. At the same time, the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Obstructing National Currency have also been revised. The first article states: "Anyone who intends to profit by smuggling copper coins for export shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of not less than seven years," in order to strictly enforce the law and prevent abuses. It is also heard that private smuggling in the occupied areas is centered on Shanghai. In South China, they are smuggled out of the country from the Shantou, Haifeng area, transported to a certain place by small sailboats, and then transshipped to Japan.
