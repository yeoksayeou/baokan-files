### Close Contact Between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union: Consulting on Steps for Cooperation in the Far East; Striving to Prevent the Import of Military Raw Materials into Japan; The Soviet Union Guarantees Its Unchanging Stance of Providing Financial Aid to China

London - Today, it was revealed here that as a result of talks between representatives of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union, an agreement for Britain and the United States to strive to prevent the import of wartime raw materials into Japan, as well as other forms of Anglo-American cooperation in the Pacific, was concluded last night. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler told the House of Commons yesterday that "very important" consultations regarding the Far East are currently underway. News arriving here from Washington stated that US Secretary of State Hull has confirmed this matter. However, Hull stated that the purpose of the talks is not to sign any formal agreements, and therefore no conclusions have been reached. Butler indicated that talks are also underway with the Soviet Union, China, and the Netherlands. Diplomatic circles believe that the US-Soviet talks held in Washington and Moscow are related to Britain. It is generally believed that the United States will act as an "intermediary" to avoid any difficulties, as the German-Soviet Union Pact exists. Direct dealings with Britain may cause difficulties. Although direct friction between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Far East seems unlikely, it is believed here that Britain is still promoting talks between the US and the Soviet Union regarding the situation in the Far East. (International Telegram, 11th)

Washington - According to news from here today, the United States is seriously observing the progress of Anglo-Soviet relations and has apparently adopted a parallel strategy to promote limited diplomatic cooperation from the Soviet Union with the United States on a possible basis. Diplomatic sources say that the talks between the State Department and Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, may have discussed the Anglo-Soviet relations, which still have major contradictions. The British Prime Minister's announcement regarding the reopening of the Burma Road may be an expression to please the Soviet Union and satisfy the United States and China. They also pointed out that the Soviet Union is committed to assisting China. Now that a new diplomatic front has emerged and Britain has abandoned its past ideas and turned to face Japan, the main obstacles that previously stood between Anglo-Soviet relations can be removed. They continued to say that the Soviet commercial delegation has not yet left London. This commercial negotiation can be regarded as the first sign of concrete cooperation, and the profound impression that the Soviet Union is currently giving the world is that it has not yet made a decision between the Axis and the Democratic sides. If the Soviet Union is given sufficient inducement regarding the consequences of Japan's adherence to the Axis, it may lean towards the democratic side. Soviet newspapers do indeed support this view and have expressed friendliness towards Britain in the past few days.

Japanese Scrap Iron: Completely Collected

Tokyo - The people of Japan throughout the country are now collecting all their scrap iron and handing it over to the government in order to eliminate the impact on Japan caused by the US ban on scrap iron exports. A certain Japanese leader wrote an article in a newspaper suggesting that all iron fences, iron gates, and mosquito net iron hooks, etc., be donated to the government. Another writer advocated that all old-style iron rice threshers be handed over to be transformed into military equipment, as all farm families have this equipment, which is no longer used. It is said that this item alone can yield 600,000 tons of scrap iron. In addition, some people have suggested melting down the iron signs in front of tobacco shops in an attempt to remedy the situation. (Reuters Telegram, 11th) On the other hand, some diplomats believe that the Soviet Union may be like Italy, first showing goodwill to democratic countries and eventually joining hands with totalitarian countries. Furthermore, diplomatic observers point out that the US attitude towards Japan depends entirely on Soviet-Japanese relations, and Soviet-Japanese relations will also affect the Anglo-Soviet situation. (United Press Telegram, 10th)

London - Reliable sources reported here last night that the Soviet Union has given Britain assurances that the Soviet Union's policy towards the Chongqing government remains unchanged. It is said that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov told British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Stafford Cripps that the Soviet Union will continue to assist China in its war against Japan. (United Press Telegram, 10th)

London - Soviet authorities in London today expressed satisfaction with Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road to transport wartime materials to China. They said that the reopening of the road is a great help to China, and "the Soviet Union will naturally support anything that is beneficial to the Chinese government." (International Telegram, 10th)

London - Yesterday in the House of Commons, former Labour MP Mander expressed anxiety that the US government had previously approved the shipment of up to one million barrels of American oil to Japan. He proposed that the US government agree to a joint Anglo-American action to block the transport of oil to Japan. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the US ban on oil exports is limited to certain types. Regarding this matter, Britain has been in contact with the United States, and the British government will definitely adopt the best policy in this environment, as the British government is well aware that it is not appropriate to supply Japan with military raw materials. Mander was still not satisfied and asked, "Can you give us a guarantee that military raw materials will not be supplied?" This is an open secret. US Secretary of State Hull has firmly announced that in the event of unfortunate consequences, Britain can definitely obtain US assistance. "The Times" stated that the Axis powers' rash actions to threaten the United States will inevitably produce the opposite effect from what they expect. The German side's propaganda of threats and inducements to the United States has completely missed its target. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)

Ambassador Guo Speaks in London: Failure to Eliminate a Major Threat Will Leave Endless Trouble

London - At a banquet held by the Aid China Association to celebrate Double Tenth Day, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said that British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement to reopen the Burma Road naturally gives China great satisfaction and reflects the public opinion of Britain and its allies overseas, including the United States and India. The policy of appeasement in the Far East should end forever from now on, as this policy has repeatedly proven to be endlessly harmful in the Far East or elsewhere. Guo urged that the first step in governing and strengthening the country is to resolve the problem of Japan, as Japan is the weakest link in the Axis chain. Japan's ability to gallop on the Far Eastern stage is only due to being allowed to do so. We can easily and effectively regard Japan as a harmful factor and eliminate it. This move will be a panacea for curing the military and moral chronic diseases in the entire world situation. Are China's doctrine and destiny more closely linked to democratic countries than ever before, or not? The House of Commons also expressed anxiety about the progress of Anglo-American cooperation in the Pacific. Independent MP Wedgwood asked whether the Soviet Union, China, and the Dutch government are cooperating with us, and whether we have the possibility of US protection of the East Indies. Butler replied that the British government fully understands the importance of contacting friendly governments on matters of common interest. The House of Commons can rest assured that certain very important talks have been underway and have not yet concluded. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Britain Decides to Reopen the Burma Road: Confirmed to Have Obtained Full US Support

London - "The Daily Telegraph" stated that, observing the remarks of the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Japan clearly does not want to protest to Britain because of the reopening of the Burma Road, or regard this matter as a sign of an immediate attack. The reason for adopting this attitude is that the occupation of Vietnam has caused the Burma Road to lose some of its previous importance. The US attitude has become increasingly tough since the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is probably also one of the reasons why Japan has not shown any protest against the reopening of the Burma Road. Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road has indeed gained the support of the US government. The world recognizes the importance of China's war of resistance in East Asia and its relationship to the entire world war. Thanks to China's courage and patience, Japan is trapped in a quagmire in China and cannot effectively strike for itself or for the Axis powers. Even those who hate China should now know that the deciding force of the nature of the situation and the trend of East Asian affairs is China, not Japan. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

US Navy Secretary Knox States: No Plans to Withdraw Naval Forces Stationed in China

Washington - US Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that yesterday's rumors that 1,600 US Marines would withdraw from Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin are not true. The United States has no such intention. He continued that the US fleet's plan to visit the west coast in stages has not been changed due to the situation in the Far East. (United Press Telegram, 10th)

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the issue of requesting American citizens in the Far East to withdraw to the country is merely a "customary precautionary measure for military zones." The rumors that the United States will withdraw American citizens from Shanghai have been denied by President Roosevelt at yesterday's White House intelligence meeting. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

Editorial

### The Current Situation and the Residents of Shanghai

Recently, due to changes in the international situation, the Shanghai market has once again become turbulent. The majority of people either harbor fear or harbor a fluke mentality. Those who are afraid believe that once the war extends to Southeast Asia and affects the Pacific, Shanghai, besides Hong Kong, will be the most affected in terms of industry and commerce. Shanghai's original isolated island status is feared to be shaken. And the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce under this situation may also live up to its name, occupying it exclusively in reality, with exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies causing endless harassment. Who is without the feeling of worrying about gains and losses, especially when it concerns their property and business? Looking at the future, can they guarantee that they will not be moved? Even if it doesn't reach that extreme, Shanghai originally has an international nature. In peacetime, Britain and the United States account for the majority of its power, and if the regulations are observed, the citizens can still live and work in peace. Once a strong power takes over, it will take and demand whatever it wants, and indulge in whatever it likes. The impact on all industries in between is vastly different. Therefore, everyone is uneasy and fearful, as if a great disaster is about to come. But is that really inevitable? If you consider the worries and concerns as inevitable to the future situation, then what is the use of worrying? If the worries and concerns are not necessarily true in the future, then today's worries and concerns are merely seen as excessive worry. It should be known that the Shanghai concessions are an international market. Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and the majority of other countries have their property rights and interests. Even though the French Concession is nominally managed by people of one country, the vested interests of all countries are probably no less than those of the International Settlement, only without the clear banner of the International Settlement. Therefore, unless all countries abandon their entire trade with China, if they do not abandon it, then no matter which country it is, it will want to maintain Shanghai's original international nature and its neutral status, and will not want to make it biased to one side, similar to exclusive occupation. Otherwise, it will not only arbitrarily destroy the treaties with the Chinese government, but also lose the opportunity for free and fair trade. This is something that all countries that value trade with China will never want to cause to themselves. Therefore, it seems too early to be worried about changing the current state of the Shanghai concessions and to have a fear in mind. Moreover, sharpening fists and rubbing palms does not necessarily mean being determined to fight to the death. Whether taking advantage of loopholes and gaps will eventually lead to a war, the opportunity and possibility of this is at most fifty-fifty.

As for those who have a fluke mentality due to changes in the current situation, in business, merchants value profit, and everyone wants wealth. If they have a fluke mentality, they will take advantage of this opportunity based on their assets to try to make a fortune, such as short selling and speculation, or taking advantage of the fire to rob and make so-called "national crisis money." However, in the past, national crisis money could be made because the currency value went from high to low, and commodity prices went from low to high. Comparing based on the quantity of currency, there was an obvious increase. Now, however, all goods are already expensive and may rise again, but the extent of the rise is limited, and the chance of falling can be said to be even greater. If there are both rises and falls, and you gamble in the middle, then the way of gambling is also difficult. And still holding the old belief that the way to protect assets and the art of making money is nothing more than hoarding goods, then this is called speculation. Do you not realize that "today's opportunity" is vastly different from "yesterday's opportunity," or are they the same? You must be sure of the points of difference or similarity before you can know the reasons for whether or not to speculate. Moreover, you should know that today's hoarding is not the same as in the past. In the past, everyone could contribute a small amount of capital and gather together to exchange strange plans and win profits. But now it is not the case. Taking rice as an example, with a price of more than one hundred yuan per bag of rice, hoarding a hundred bags would require ten thousand gold, and a thousand bags would require one hundred thousand gold, which is no longer something that small capital gatherings can engage in. If we take Shanghai's existing stock of 600,000 bags as a calculation of its hoarding capital, it reaches as much as fifty to sixty million yuan. May I ask, if the financial resources of fifty to sixty million yuan were entirely from the collection of small hoarders, without large financial resources manipulating it, who would believe it? Believing it and saying it is either to divert the attention of large hoarders, or to use smoke screens for hoarders to lure the public. Observing their intentions, raising prices to extract wealth is one; planning to shift the danger of hoarding to outsiders who follow suit is the second. Rice is like this, and other items such as cloth, yarn, flour, and all kinds of miscellaneous grains and oil cakes are all like this. We, on the one hand, hope that the concession authorities will severely punish them as in the past; on the other hand, we are aware that the situation is turbulent, rumors are spreading, and most of those who have some wealth are both panicked and do not know where to go, and they admire and are pleased to see those who have lost their minds and gone mad making fortunes one after another. They blindly and foolishly want to follow in the footsteps of making a fortune, but they do not know that they are simply throwing themselves into a trap. This is very pitiful. Therefore, I do not hesitate to expose it further. You must know that to adapt to this turbulent situation, you must value yourself and love yourself. Don't worry about having little money; the greatest worry is not being able to keep it, and the greatest worry is being greedy for money. Those who have never speculated and hoarded goods should not think that the situation is conducive to speculation and hoarding, and should not invite the disaster of losing their family property. Even those who have already speculated and hoarded goods should be "vigilant" for the future of the situation. Regardless of profit or loss, they should immediately dispose of it and settle it. Then, what you get in legal currency is a guarantee of a certain amount of life. Then, you can calmly observe the changes in the situation, and rumors are not enough to move your heart!

### The Central National Government Jointly Commemorates National Day; Chairman Lin Delivers a Speech; Encouraging the People to Strive Harder

Chongqing - The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government held a joint commemorative meeting for National Day today. Chairman Lin gave a speech, saying: "Today is the National Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Since the outbreak of war on July 7, 1937, this is the fourth time that we have held this Double Tenth National Day Commemorative Meeting. In this difficult and serious period, holding this most sacred and glorious founding celebration gives us infinite emotion and excitement. On the one hand, we recall the arduous efforts of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution for the country and the nation. It is truly difficult to start a business, and we need to preserve it, and even more so, we need to promote and carry it forward. On the other hand, we look forward to the future of the Party and the country and the international situation, and we feel that the responsibilities we bear are extremely heavy. We must strive harder, continue the revolutionary spirit of the Xinhai year, and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation, so that we can be worthy of the Father of the Nation and the people. In his speech on the National Day of the 8th year of the Republic of China, the Father of the Nation once said, 'The cause of the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the purpose of the revolution has not yet been achieved. It still needs those who come after to continue the great cause. The Republic of China came from the revolution, so all those who acknowledge the Republic of China today must adhere to the revolutionary doctrine and strive to practice it in order to achieve the purpose of the revolution and build a country that is owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, so as to leave the cause of our Chinese nation to future generations for ten thousand years. Only then will today have the value of celebrating.' The Father of the Nation also said in his lecture on nationalism, 'We must not only restore the status of the nation, but also bear a responsibility to the world. This is the true spirit of nationalism.' These precious teachings of the Father of the Nation have indicated very clearly the significance of the National Day commemoration and the guidelines for revolutionary nation-building. All of these are what we must deeply understand and earnestly follow on this National Day."

"And our current heavy responsibility is not only to strive for the integrity of territorial sovereignty and power, but also to give full play to the great potential power of our nation, to be a stable center in East Asia, and to fulfill our due responsibility for the world's public reason, righteousness, and true and lasting peace. Looking back on the past, the Xinhai Revolution 29 years ago, although it overthrew the Manchu Qing and established the Republic of China, because of various resistance from within and outside the country, not only from the armed uprising until the 8th year of the Republic of China, when the Father of the Nation gave a speech on National Day, he had not yet completed the cause of the revolution, let alone the purpose of the revolution. The Father of the Nation needed to show us, and even until today, 29 years later, we still have not achieved our great revolutionary cause, let alone achieved our revolutionary goals. We are still waiting for those of us who come after to complete this major task of revolutionary nation-building. Looking back on the past, we are truly infinitely ashamed. We see clearly that the reason why the revolution has not succeeded is because the two kinds of resistance from within and outside the country have not been eradicated. The entire revolutionary cause, after the Xinhai Revolution, did not have the opportunity to implement the Father of the Nation's revolutionary strategies and start very construction, so there was no way to achieve our revolutionary ideals. Therefore, everyone must be of one mind and one virtue. These two

, to complete the true cause of unification. All political and economic construction and national defense construction are also advancing by leaps and bounds, a thousand miles a day. It can be seen that domestic resistance is no longer a problem. The only thing that is still hindering our revolutionary progress is external resistance. If this resistance is not overcome, the revolutionary cause will not succeed for a single day, and the survival and independence of our country and nation and the justice and peace of the world will not be guaranteed. We have been fighting against Japan for three years and three months. In these more than three years of difficult times, although we have suffered great sacrifices, we have long had a firm belief that we will become stronger as we fight and we will be more confident in lasting. We will never stop halfway until we achieve final victory. I believe that all descendants of the Yellow Emperor will never be conquered. The glorious deeds of our compatriots fighting hard throughout the country are truly worthy of our admiration. In particular, our military commander's diligent planning, the heroic struggle of soldiers throughout the country, the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese, and

the spirit of sacrifice of our compatriots in the occupied areas are all praised by friendly countries around the world. When we commemorate National Day, we think of their hard work and great contributions to the country and the nation. In addition to expressing our admiration, we must express our sincere condolences to them. At the same time, we also think of the officers and men who died in the war and our martyred comrades and compatriots on all battlefields. We must express our high respect to them, comfort their bereaved families, and educate their descendants. The only spiritual comfort we can give to the officers and soldiers throughout the country who participated in the war of resistance is to tell them that the price of their struggle and sacrifice is not only to defend the independence and survival of the motherland, but also to maintain world justice and uphold the democratic system and strive for the great results of lasting peace. The light is gradually approaching, and victory will surely belong to us. In the past, our military and political authorities loudly proclaimed that China's war was almost a vanguard for the world's democratic countries, but at that time, this warning of predicting the future was only shared by a few statesmen with a long-term vision in the world. Even those who were short-sighted could not avoid mistaking it for our own propaganda. Now the facts are before us. If it were not for China's three years of resistance, the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" would probably have been realized during the tense early days of the European war. Therefore, although China's military preparations are not as good as others, it has fulfilled the responsibility of the vanguard for the democratic countries in the world. The magnitude of the impact can be imagined. This great achievement can arouse the sympathy and awareness of people all over the world. As the trend of the times, all countries will unite and proceed hand in hand towards the bright path of public reason and justice. Therefore, the significance of our struggle is not only for the independence and survival of a country and a nation. As for our self-supervision, we must still inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs and comrades and compatriots who died in the war of resistance. We must not fear difficulties or spare sacrifices. We must be determined to fight to the end. No matter how difficult the current environment is or how the international situation changes, we must believe that our great cause of rejuvenation must rely on ourselves and cannot rely on external forces. We must rise up together and follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation on National Day in the 8th year of the Republic of China to inherit the great cause, to achieve the goals of the war of resistance and nation-building in the near term, and to lay the foundation for true and lasting peace in East Asia and the world in the long term, to realize the Three Principles of the People, and to promote the Great Harmony of the world, so that we can fulfill our responsibilities as those who come after and can be worthy of this solemn celebration today.

### German Air Force Exerts Utmost Effort, Intensifies Air Raids on Various Parts of Britain, Destructive Force Reaches New Peak Yesterday Morning, 36 Districts of London All Bombed

London: Last night was the third night of intensified German air raids on London. The German air raid strength is increasing with time, reaching a new peak of destructive force last night. More than fifty places inside and around the British capital were bombed. By 2:30 AM on Friday, the losses from fires caused by explosions were rapidly increasing. The people of London all entered air raid shelters. Although the network of combined anti-aircraft guns was formidable, German planes were able to break through it and reach London, flying to western Wales, southeastern coastal towns of England, and other parts of the British Empire. Under this record-breaking blitz, all parts of Britain were shaken. (11th International Dispatch)

London: Yesterday, thirty-six districts in London and its suburbs were bombed by German planes. The Thames Estuary, Wales, the Midlands, Liverpool, and northeastern England were also bombed by German planes. Five German planes were shot down over Britain, and five British fighter planes went missing. However, the pilots of two of them have safely escaped. Today, as of now, London has issued two daylight air raid warnings. The first time, nine German planes were spotted flying over southeastern England, heading towards London. Anti-aircraft guns fired, and the German planes immediately scattered without dropping bombs in London. Shortly afterward, several German Messerschmitt aircraft flew very high over the coast. British fighter patrols rose to meet them, driving most of them back across the Channel. German planes strafed a certain town, but there were no casualties among the residents. During today's invasion, workers in a certain district of London saw a German plane firing at barrage balloons. Anti-aircraft guns immediately fired, and the German plane escaped, the balloon unharmed. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Last night and this morning, German planes recklessly roamed the skies over Britain all night. Over forty districts belonging to London and other places were bombed. Wales also suffered its most severe air raid in weeks, with twenty bombs landing in one district without injuring anyone. When German planes dropped flares over London to find targets, anti-aircraft guns accurately targeted them. Last night, on a clear night, fifteen flares suddenly appeared in the air. Searchlights immediately activated, and anti-aircraft guns bombarded the slowly descending flares, destroying all of them in minutes. After recklessly harassing the area all night, two more squadrons of German planes attempted to attack London again this morning, but were repelled by British fighter planes. Therefore, although London issued short-term alerts, no German planes were sighted. This morning, several squadrons of German planes circled over a city in eastern East Anglia, but were scattered by anti-aircraft fire. British fighter planes then joined the interception, and the German planes fled south, with British planes in hot pursuit. According to official reports on the recent German air raids, German planes still target London and its suburbs as their main objectives. Some parts of southern and northwestern England and southern Wales were also attacked. Fires in London and its suburbs were quickly extinguished. A high-explosive bomb hit a building under construction in a certain location in London, injuring many people. There are currently no reports of mass casualties. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

London: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday, German fighter-bombers in small formations flew high to attack, mostly not crossing the coasts of Kent and Sussex.

A factory was hit, with minimal loss of materials and life. A town on the south coast was attacked, destroying several houses, with slight casualties. Some other enemy planes reached London, dropping only a few bombs, damaging some houses, and causing slight casualties. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

Fierce Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the English Channel

London: Yesterday, German planes repeatedly attempted to attack Britain. When crossing the Channel, they engaged in aerial combat with British planes over the sea, which lasted for several hours.

German Planes Bomb London City Area by Moonlight

London: From Wednesday night to Thursday morning, squadrons of German planes again invaded London from all directions, and high-explosive bombs fell like rain. At least forty districts in London were bombed, with heavy deaths and losses. Last night happened to be a clear autumn moon, and the German planes launched a fierce attack, causing the firelight to compete with the moonlight, with the fire increasing and the moonlight fading. Many buildings in central London were bombed, including a church and a hotel. Bombs exploded everywhere, shaking London. At the beginning of the air raid, two grand theaters, a large air raid shelter, and other buildings were bombed, killing hundreds of people. But rescue teams, amidst the sounds of explosions, worked fearlessly to carry out rescue work.

### U.S. Strengthens Pacific Defenses to Cope with Future Crisis, Sends National Guard to Hawaii, Naval Reserve Ordered to Mobilize

Washington: The 23rd Regiment of the Marine Corps Reserve has been ordered to mobilize, assembling at several locations on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts on November 7. A regiment of anti-aircraft artillery from the California National Guard, totaling 1,200 men, has been ordered to Hawaii to supplement the 24,000 officers and men currently stationed there. James Roosevelt, son of President Roosevelt, is currently a reserve captain in the Marine Corps and is also among those being mobilized. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington: The War Department issued a statement today stating that the 251st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment of the California National Guard has been dispatched to Hawaii to strengthen its defenses. This move adequately demonstrates that the United States has taken necessary military actions in response to the significant crisis in the Pacific. The statement was issued by Secretary of War Colonel Stimson. He issued the army's statement twenty-four hours after Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced that 4,800 naval officers and enlisted men had been sent to Hawaii to enhance its wartime capabilities. Colonel Stimson stated that the National Guard dispatched to Hawaii consists of 1,000 officers and men. They will first go to California to await transport and will be able to depart in a few weeks. At the same time, Colonel Stimson also stated that the War Department is considering further reinforcing the existing force of 24,000 men in Hawaii. According to officials from the War Department, the U.S. President, having been authorized by Congress to send the National Guard to any U.S. territory for "training," is now exercising his power for the first time. According to them, the National Guard sent to reinforce Hawaii will number not just one thousand, but likely one thousand two hundred men. When announcing the possible further reinforcement of Honolulu, Colonel Stimson stated, "Anti-aircraft artillery is gradually occupying an important position in present defense." He also stated that reinforcing the current garrison in the Philippines is not being considered at this time. The current policy of the government is to allow the Philippines to develop its military independently under the command of General MacArthur. Regarding this matter, General Stimson stated that General MacArthur had sent an exciting report to the War Department. (11th United Press Dispatch)

New York: U.S. Navy Admiral Stirling recently made comments advocating that the U.S. fleet enter the Far East to blockade Japan. He stated that if Japan fought the U.S., Japan would inevitably dispatch a fleet to Hawaii. Because of the long distance, it is not suitable for the operations of many of Japan's main fleets. Those susceptible to attacks by cruisers and aircraft carriers would be the cities along the Pacific coast and the U.S. fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor. In addition, all thirty of Japan's large submarines capable of crossing the Pacific to fight would emerge and attempt to attack U.S. warships and disrupt commerce. The Japanese could even take such actions without declaring war, as they could delay the U.S. fleet's advance into the Western Pacific and allow Japan to gain ample time to occupy Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and Hong Kong. If the U.S. were to go to war with Japan, the best strategy would be to have the U.S. fleet engage Japan as quickly as possible. If the U.S. decided to take the offensive and wanted to enter the East, the U.S. fleet would have to launch in time to allow the U.S. to use Singapore and Hong Kong. Once the U.S. occupied Singapore, it could begin a blockade of Japan. At that time, it may be necessary to use Manila as a naval and air base. Unless Germany and Italy could provide reinforcements to the Japanese Navy, Japan would already have been sold out by Hitler. In Hitler's mind, in order to eliminate British naval power, he would want to sacrifice Japan. In Hitler's view, if Japan fought the U.S., the U.S. would be unable to assist Britain, and he could then proceed to resolve the British naval and air forces. (11th United Press Dispatch)

### Glasgow University Library Destroyed

### Japan, Weak in Spirit but Strong in Appearance, Tries to Maintain Friendship with the U.S., Matsuoka Says Tripartite Pact Not Against the U.S., Hopes the U.S. Can Stay Out of the War

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka issued a statement yesterday criticizing British Prime Minister Churchill's explanation for reopening the Burma Road. At the same time, Matsuoka reiterated that the intention of the military alliance Japan signed with the Berlin-Rome Axis is not entirely directed at the United States, but is merely a kind of peace objective. Matsuoka believes that Churchill's statement that the Burma Road was closed for three months was actually to allow Japan to make peace with China during this period. Matsuoka stated that the Japanese government has always been willing to maintain peace with China, and is still so at present. Churchill views the new treaty we signed with Germany and Italy as an unfortunate matter, but it is merely another method to achieve the aforementioned objective. This objective is indeed a peace objective. Matsuoka further stated, "If the United States hopes to see the dawn of peace soon appear in East Asia, I must admit that it will be difficult for this hope to be realized after Britain reopens the Burma Road, as reopening the Burma Road will cause Chiang Kai-shek to continue resisting Japan." Matsuoka further believes that the Tripartite Pact is not directed at the United States, stating, "The three countries sincerely hope that such strong countries, including the United States, and other countries that are currently neutral will not be drawn into the vortex of the European war and will not come into conflict with Japan due to the China issue or other reasons. If we further imagine the consequences, such a possible state of affairs that is sufficient to destroy humanity is enough to make us shudder." Japanese newspapers stated today that Matsuoka Yosuke's statement was issued at a significant time because it expressed friendship to the American people. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the American people currently "seem to be distorting the true intentions of the Tripartite Pact and are trending towards engaging in provocative anti-Japanese behavior." The newspaper said that Matsuoka Yosuke invited the American people to "return to normalcy." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also pointed out that Matsuoka Yosuke desires the United States to reconsider its policy towards Japan, because only then can the United States change its involvement in the war. The United States should be responsible for the future development of the Pacific. The "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that the reopening of the Burma Road may be followed by equally tough actions by the United States against Japan. The newspaper said, "Any strengthening of U.S. anti-Japanese policy will be as dangerous as playing with fire." (11th United Press Dispatch)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the government is still satisfied with the news coming from the Far East. Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road has received a relatively moderate response from Japan. It is generally believed that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's speech shows a tendency to observe and adapt to changes. Matsuoka's claim that the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is not directed at the United States, but intends to keep the United States out of the war, is like Matsuoka's statement that his eyebrows furrowed when he thought about fighting the U.S., which may be true. The best way to prevent war between the U.S. and Japan is to properly understand the dangers of such a development. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

### New Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Goes to Moscow, Seeks to Promote Relations Between the Two Countries, Soviet Foreign Ministry Hosts Banquet for Togo

### The Balkan Situation Worsens: Germany and Italy Eye Greece, British-Romanian Diplomatic Relations on the Brink of Rupture, Romania Reorganizes its Army in Cooperation with Germany

London: Credible sources report that Hitler is currently preparing a joint offensive from the Balkans and Egypt, with the aim of breaking the Mediterranean blockade. The widespread speculation that German General Jodl has been appointed to command the Axis forces in Libya is being taken very seriously. It is apparent that the Italian forces there will continue to advance towards the Nile. (Reuters, 11th)

London: The Daily Mail's Viking correspondent, Mr. Shirto, predicted today that Italy will attack Greece, while Germany is preparing to confront Turkey via Romanian bases on the Black Sea. It is claimed that "I learned today that the Greek ambassador's reply to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has postponed this 'sudden change.' During the Brenner Pass Conference, Britain had already prepared for this. However, the serious situation they face is now becoming increasingly clear." (United Press, 21st)

Budapest: News from Bucharest indicates that diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania may be severed within twenty-four hours. German troops have already arrived in Constanța on the Black Sea and will build air and submarine bases at the mouth of the Danube. British personnel at Romanian oil refineries left the oilfields just before the German troops arrived. Italian aviators will soon arrive in Romania to reorganize the Romanian Air Force. (International News Service, 10th)

Yugoslav Capital: German troops conducted large-scale military operations in the Danube River region last night. They passed through Yugoslavia en route to Romania and Bulgaria. German troops have been marching in the Danube area for two days. Coincidentally, a German division recently arrived in Romania by train. Furthermore, it has been learned that German military vehicles passed through the Yugoslav capital in a continuous stream last night. (United Press, 11th)

Bucharest: After hearing the Axis powers' claim that the breakdown of British-Romanian diplomatic relations was only a "matter of time," British officials here began burning important documents last night. At the same time, British sources stated that British diplomats were awaiting instructions from London to prepare to withdraw to Istanbul. The highest Romanian authorities issued an announcement declaring the immediate commencement of the construction of air-raid shelters. Romania is making these preparations in fear that Britain will carry out retaliatory air strikes because Romania allowed German troops to enter the country to protect its oilfields. Meanwhile, Hitler's bodyguard commander, General Rollus, has flown to Galați to inspect Romanian defenses. Last night, diplomatic circles were also discussing completely unconfirmed reports that Germany might pass through Romania and Bulgaria to attack Turkey. (United Press, 11th)

Bucharest: The Romanian cabinet convened yesterday to discuss measures for reorganizing the Romanian army. Plans concerning the construction of barracks, underground defense works, and military highways have now been agreed upon. Conscripts from the 1940 and 1941 classes, originally scheduled to be called up next year, will now be called up early on November 20th. (Haitong Telegram, 11th)

Bucharest: Romanian ministries related to national defense held a meeting yesterday, attended by Prime Minister Antonescu and his chief of staff. Since Romania and Germany have a new military partnership, the plans agreed upon at the meeting are of considerable significance. A communiqué stated that the meeting considered new methods for reorganizing the army and rearming, including building new warehouses to store large quantities of war materials brought by Germany, and building new air-raid shelters in Bucharest. Furthermore, it was decided to call up the 1941 class of reservists for training on November 20th and to take measures to prevent covert military sabotage, with emphasis on aviation. (Reuters, 11th)

Kerosene Stopped Transport to Turkey and Greece

British Embassy Prepares to Withdraw

Rome: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that the British Embassy in Vienna is now packing up everything in preparation for returning home. The British Embassy has also notified British nationals in Romania to prepare to return home quickly at any time. (Haitong Agency, 11th)

Bucharest: Although British nationals in Romania have not received concrete instructions to evacuate, British authorities have urged them to be prepared to leave the country at any time. The British Embassy and British businesses are now making preparations for any sudden changes. Diplomatic circles view the severance of British-Romanian relations as unavoidable, either because German troops may forcefully occupy Romania, or because London will decide that the position of Britons in Romania can no longer be supported. There are at least three hundred British nationals in Romania, and the British Embassy will be responsible for handling the evacuation. Although Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu reiterated his assurance to British Ambassador Hoare on Wednesday night that only small detachments of German troops were ordered to enter Romania, several towns in Romania now have numerous German officers stationed in them, busily arranging encampments and procuring military supplies. The arrogant behavior of these officers has provoked reactions in several provinces, as many leaflets have been found in the markets stating that Romania's inherent rights have been completely sold out. (Reuters, 11th)

Budapest: Axis personnel here expect that the Axis powers will take surprising action in the Balkans within a few days. It is generally predicted that the rapid military action will occur in the Balkans as a result of Germany dispatching troops to Romania and the British Embassy in Romania burning official documents. It is reported that the Italian Embassy in Athens has ordered Italian nationals to evacuate Greece. At the same time, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas and British Ambassador to Greece Sir Palairet discussed the future crisis. It is expected that the number of German troops arriving in Romania this weekend will increase further. The current number of German troops in Romania remains a major question. At the time of the British-Greek talks in Athens, news also came that British air force reinforcements had arrived in Cyprus. It is believed here that if Britain fails to obtain a "satisfactory" explanation from the Romanian government regarding German troop movements in Romania within another day, the breakdown of British-Romanian negotiations seems certain. (International News Service, 11th)

Germans Begin Migration

Budapest: The German consulate here is currently busy repatriating the 170,000 Germans scattered throughout Eastern Carpathia. A mixed Romanian-German committee began discussing the resettlement of 45,000 German minority members from Southern Bukovina here two days ago. The resettlement of German farmers from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina is being carried out by the German Advance Squad. The first batch of several thousand farmers has set off in trucks, etc., and has now arrived at the port of Galați on the Danube River, from which they will travel upstream along the Danube, passing through the Yugoslav capital and returning to Germany. Another 15,000 Germans will withdraw from Northern Dobruja. However, 250,000 Germans in the Banat province and 350,000 Germans in Outer Transylvania will remain in their original locations. These minority members have already been granted the same rights as Romanians, and can hold important administrative positions in their districts and serve in the Romanian army. Mr. Miller, a British employee of the Astra Romana Oil Company, is still being detained at the police station, but it is said that after an investigation, the authorities are certain that Miller has not committed any acts of sabotage.

Also, British naval and coastal aircraft cooperated in attacking Brest, bombing German destroyers in the harbor. Anti-aircraft fire was quite heavy, but these German ships were still inevitably bombed by the central aircraft, and the port's docks and buildings were also damaged. (Reuters, 11th)

London: On Wednesday, the main targets of the British Air Force bombers' night raid were the Krupp factory in Essen, the aluminum factory in Grevenbroich, and the oil storage depot in Cologne. Other targets, such as the railway traffic in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Vlissingen, Le Havre, Calais, and the German-Dutch border, were all bombed. Two major fires broke out in the factory area ten minutes after the Krupp factory was bombed.

### Romania Continues to Expel Hungarians

Budapest: According to the Hungarian semi-official news agency, Romania is still expelling Hungarians. To date, 1,150 people have been expelled. A total of 450 refugees arrived on Wednesday. The refugee committee is finding it difficult to cope with this situation. As of Wednesday, 1,600 refugees had been registered, only a third of whom had found accommodation. (Reuters, 10th)

Budapest: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki spoke in parliament yesterday, protesting against Romania's treatment of expelling Hungarians after the Vienna conference. He claimed that he hoped Hungary and Romania would eventually reach an understanding, but at the same time, Hungary would act with great effort. Hungary's hopes for a reasonable understanding from Romania have not been realized, as the Romanian government has not taken action to prevent Hungarians from being mistreated. The situation that has existed for the past twenty-two years shows no signs of improvement. Hungary has therefore implemented retaliatory measures from Monday, deporting 850 people. The reason for their expulsion is not due to the deportees' own attitudes, but to the attitude of the Romanian government. (Reuters, 10th)

### US Government Authorities Discuss International Situation, Especially Emphasizing Pacific Problems, US Chargé d'Affaires to Berlin Recalled

Washington: US President Roosevelt met with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles at the White House yesterday afternoon to discuss the current tense international situation.

At the same time, State Department officials stated that the US Chargé d'Affaires to Berlin had been recalled home for consultations and would not return to Germany. The US Consul in Berlin will replace Mr. Kirk as Chargé d'Affaires, while Mr. Kirk, according to authoritative reports, will be appointed Chargé d'Affaires to Rome, as US Ambassador to Italy Phillips is currently on sick leave. The State Department has repeatedly stated that Mr. Kirk's recall does not have any significant political implications, and is merely a matter of routine. His appointment as Chargé d'Affaires to Rome is a temporary measure to deal with sudden changes. It is understood that President Roosevelt's meeting yesterday was due to the recent developments in the Dutch East Indies, which have attracted the President's attention. President Roosevelt also met with non-official personnel. After Pan American Airways manager Mr. Waldner told the press that he believed the situation in the Dutch East Indies was extremely serious, he was summoned by the President. According to Mr. Waldner, "Japan's demands on the Dutch East Indies and its 'New Order' plan have created an absolutely serious situation." He believes that the US taking a firm stance can counter the war in the Pacific.

The latest report on this plan states that there has been improvement on the early realization of this plan. (United Press, 11th)

### The Chinese National Day After Three Years of Struggle: The Understanding That the Chinese People Should Have

Today, twenty-nine years ago, under the great leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation of China, and the generous sacrifice of countless martyrs who died for the country, China was able to overthrow the imperial system and establish a republic. On this Double Tenth Festival in this year when major changes are unfolding in East Asia and the world, the Chinese people, recalling the achievements of nation-building in those years, must deeply understand the goals of the Chinese revolution and nation-building, continue the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs, and do their utmost to fulfill their current great tasks. The goal of the Chinese revolution and nation-building is to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, on the one hand, to seek China's independence and freedom, and on the other hand, to promote the great spirit of China's inherent morality, to restore China's national status, and to promote peace and happiness for all mankind. China's founding in East Asia naturally requires first seeking peace and stability in East Asia, and only by ensuring the stability of the Pacific can there be a reliable guarantee of world peace. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle, which is also the great ideal of nation-building of the Xinhai Revolution, is nothing more than strengthening national defense internally to seek China's freedom and equality; and stabilizing Asia externally to achieve true world peace.

However, the Japanese side fears the completion of this goal of the Chinese revolution and nation-building, because their consistent attempt is to control East Asia and conquer the world. If China's nation-building is completed and becomes strong, their attempt will be impossible to achieve. Therefore, the Tanaka Memorial not only says, "If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China," but also says, "The most frightening thing is that China is becoming increasingly aware. In the future, when China is unified, industry will inevitably develop accordingly. Therefore, it is necessary to actively seize rights in Manchuria and Mongolia, and then use Manchuria and Mongolia as the command tower to seize the benefits of all of China." This is not just Tanaka's words, but the basic national policy of the Japanese side. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Japan has continuously interfered with and undermined China's unification, economic recovery, and national defense construction. After the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the attempt to obstruct China's nation-building became even more obvious. From September 18th to July 7th, they launched a large-scale attack on China. China, unable to endure it any longer, rose up to survive. The struggle of more than three years is actually to strive to realize the ideal of nation-building, and also to complete the cause of the Xinhai Revolution and realize the Three Principles of the People. It must achieve the goal of restoring sovereign independence and territorial and administrative integrity, and it must also achieve the goal of establishing international credibility, human justice, and world peace before it can be said to have completed the revolutionary mission. "Only justice in the world can never be extinguished, and justice will surely triumph over power." The Chinese people must have a thorough understanding of this on the Double Tenth Festival commemorating the founding of the nation.

Japan's attempts are not concealed by themselves. The Tanaka Memorial blatantly said: "Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer the Indian Ocean, Asia Minor, and Europe"; and also said: "Japan must fight the United States and the Soviet Union." Their so-called "New Order in East Asia" is to have all the countries in the Pacific submit to Japan's power and recognize it as the sole master of Asia. China understands this, so it is not only determined to fight to crush its attempt to conquer China, but also to break its dream of conquering East Asia. China is the oldest and largest country in East Asia. Without China, there is no East Asia, and the security of East Asia is deeply and closely related to China's survival. Therefore, China is determined to take the lead in stabilizing East Asia.

Since the European War, Japan has seen an opportunity and has advanced the "New Order in East Asia" to the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," vainly attempting to take advantage of the danger to actively advance southward. Recently, it has even concluded a tripartite alliance. This policy of going against the tide is actually an expression of its inner anxiety. China must do its best to cope with it for the sake of self-defense and nation-building. China will never tolerate the so-called "New Order in East Asia" or "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Any country that recognizes Japan's "leading position in Greater East Asia" will regret it one day. Because any treaty concluded with Japan regarding East Asia that is opposed by the Chinese people will be equal to a piece of waste paper and cannot have any effect. Japan's intention is really to use this tripartite alliance to end the "China Incident." As long as China perseveres to the end and never yields, this attempt will surely be shattered.

Looking back at the environment in which the pioneers of China's nation-building were in during the Xinhai Revolution, their difficulties were no less than today's, and what they relied on was less than one ten-thousandth of what the Chinese soldiers on the front lines have today. However, they were not afraid of death and never turned back, and finally created the Republic with bare hands. As Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "In the Battle of Huanghuagang, 300 people fought against more than 30,000 people, using pistols and bombs to resist long guns and artillery; as for the Wuchang Uprising, one person fought against 500 people. This kind of struggle is not found in the art of war in ancient and modern China and abroad, and only the history of revolution has this precedent." If the Chinese nation wants to survive in the world forever, it must follow the spirit of the martyrs, and like them, give their lives to serve the country and sacrifice everything. Only in this way can the goal of revolutionary nation-building be achieved. The spirit of those who experienced thousands of dangers, broke through thousands of difficulties, endured hunger and cold, and worked hard in the independence of the United States, the revolution in Soviet Russia, and the revival of Turkey can also be used as an example for the Chinese people.

China's current struggle is indeed entering a difficult stage, but it is much better than the environment at the time of the Xinhai Revolution. Because China is only fighting against one opponent, and all the countries in the world that love justice are friends of China. Everyone hopes that there will be an independent and strong China in Asia. Everyone anticipates that the development of the new China after victory will help the world's economic cooperation and help establish true world peace. Therefore, as long as the Chinese people themselves are confident and work harder from now on, any external resistance will not be an obstacle to the completion of the goal of revolutionary nation-building.

China's war from beginning to end is based on the position of self-reliance and self-strengthening, and strives independently to carry out its firm goal. Therefore, no matter how the international situation changes, it will be beneficial to China and will not be affected by it in the slightest. Recently, the assistance of various friendly countries to China has become more active, and the sanctions against Japan have also become more intensified. This is indeed beneficial to China's war, but the biggest intangible significance is that the evolution of the international situation is getting closer and closer to the purpose China has embraced day by day. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of saving the world will surely be recognized by the world in this great world turmoil, and will eventually be fully realized. As long as the Chinese people have confidence, any environmental difficulties can be overcome. It is necessary to work hard when the international situation is favorable, and even when the international situation is unfavorable, we must still fight to the end. Future history has already destined China's nation-building to be a success.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said on the Double Tenth Festival in 1937, "This war cannot be ended in a year and a half." Now, three years after the struggle, China's arduous struggle has been connected to the final liquidation before the world obtains the final light. The Chinese people should feel that they are truly shouldering heavy responsibilities, so they must have greater courage and patience, and more hard work and diligence, to engage in the sacred work of nation-building. The Chinese people must know that all the nation-building codes that Dr. Sun Yat-sen painstakingly taught in the past were anticipating such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today; they must take the following three points as preparations to encourage themselves to act: (1) Concentrate their will, enrich the Republic of China, and lay a sound political foundation. (2) Develop industries, increase production, and strive for research and creation to lay a solid and independent economic foundation. (3) Work hard to train, revitalize industry, improve weapons, develop transportation, and lay the foundation for the national defense plan set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

The people of the whole country of China, especially the leaders with knowledge and skills, recognize that the responsibility for China's revival and the responsibility for the rise and fall of East Asia and the prosperity and decline of the world are all on their shoulders. This responsibility cannot be avoided. They must stand firm and achieve the greatest and greatest cause with the determination of utmost loyalty and bravery, so that they are worthy of being the successors of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs, and continue the solemn mission to the nation, ancestors, East Asia, and the world.

Hong Kong Government Plans to Establish More British Children's Schools in Australia

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong government has always paid special attention to education. In addition to the government's public schools at all levels, it also allocates more than 17,000 pounds of funding to subsidized private schools every year. Over the years, it has cultivated many talents. However, since the situation became tense last year and the evacuation of women and children was carried out, the impact on education has been enormous. Most of the school children who receive government subsidies every year have been evacuated to Australia and other safer British colonies. After this group of school children was evacuated to Australia, because the number of people was too large, the local schools could not accommodate them as much as possible, and the transfer procedures were very troublesome, resulting in the vast majority of them dropping out of school. At the same time, the evacuation of school children in Hong Kong has caused the following problems: (1) Teachers who used to work in schools have lost their jobs due to the suspension of school affairs due to school children leaving school. (2) Indirectly affecting the income tax levied by the government on teachers' salaries is a serious issue.

### Shanghai Middle School Student Roster Deadline at the End of the Month All Documents Must Be Universally Reviewed

It has already been detailed in various newspapers. It is now known that most of the student rosters of various schools have been sent, so the review of student status documents will begin today based on these rosters, school by school. In addition to the fact that various schools should provide as much convenience as possible to the student status review personnel who hold proof documents, they should also number the documents of each student in advance to facilitate verification. The period for creating and submitting student rosters should have ended earlier, but for the sake of flexibility and convenience, it has been extended to the end of this month. Late submissions will not be accepted. The schools that have not created and submitted rosters will be published in various newspapers at the beginning of next month, so that the students of each school will know that the student status of their school has not been submitted to the Ministry of Education, and it will not be recognized.

### 金融　外匯回緊

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC listing remain unchanged. The British and American exchange markets showed a tightening trend, reflecting the slight easing of the relationship between Japan and the United States. Foreign banks increased their purchases, initially softening the market to 3.75 and 5.78125, but Chinese banks and speculators sold heavily, and the Bank of Japan also intervened. The tightening trend soon subsided, and the market entered a period of consolidation, closing at 3.8125 and 5.875, a tightening of 0.015625 and 0.125 compared to the previous day.

Chinese Merchants Still Selling

The morning opened with London telegraphic transfers down 0.0625 for both near and far terms. New York silver prices remained stable, London gold spot prices were fixed, and the exchange rate for the pound against the US dollar was unchanged, but against Shanghai, it rose 0.1875. The US dollar fell 0.075 against the pound and rose 0.27 against Shanghai (all compared to the previous day). The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3.78125 for the pound and 5.875 for the US dollar, a decrease of 0.046875 and 0.125 respectively compared to the previous day. The opening favored brokers who were eager to buy, and a certain American bank also made purchases. Although Chinese merchants took the opportunity to sell, the market continued to soften, with trades opening at 5.875 and 5.8125 for the current month's US dollar.

### 補空雖起　金市所漲尙微

Although short covering emerged, the gold market's gains were still minor.

Yesterday, the black market for cash gold improved, mainly because the relationship between Japan and the United States in the Far East had slightly eased. This caused some operators to change their minds, covering their short positions at low prices, buying relentlessly. However, because money exchange firms and banks continued to sell short, the rebound was not overly strong. The market closed at 5,570 yuan, an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the off-market was firm, reaching 5,585 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry stores raised the price of gold jewelry by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Cash Gold Rises 65 Yuan

The market opened 35 yuan higher than the previous day due to the slight easing of the situation in the Far East. Gold shops offered 30 taels of gold at 5,540 yuan. Subsequently, the market fell back 10 yuan due to some selling by money exchange firms and securities firms. Securities firms and banks each offered 10 taels of gold to jewelry stores, retreating to 5,530 yuan. Later, the exchange rate tightened, and a certain gold firm actively bought, and banks also bought at this time. The market soon rose to 5,595 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate softened, and money exchange firms aggressively sold short at high prices, while buyers cautiously observed. In addition, banks turned around and sold, and the market soon fell to a low of 5,505 yuan. Later, the exchange rate slightly tightened again, and a certain gold firm's buying interest revived, and securities firms also followed suit. The market rose again to 5,580 yuan. However, before the close, buyers decreased, and money exchange firms and floating profits were released, resulting in a closing price of 5,548 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with jewelry stores purchasing 20 taels from money exchange firms at 5,560 yuan. Shortly thereafter, bulls from gold firms suddenly sold slightly, immediately falling to 5,535 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms and banks competed to buy, and the market rebounded to 5,570 yuan. Later, because a certain bank tended to sell short and money exchange firms also sold, the market retreated again to 5,550 yuan. Afterwards, the market rose to 5,575 yuan before the close due to securities firms and another bank competing to buy. The evening close was 5,570 yuan, an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the sentiment was stable, and the off-market traded at 5,585 yuan. The total fluctuation was 90 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher compared to cash gold, and the purchasing price was reduced by 30 yuan. Current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few trades.

Gold Jewelry Listed 10 Yuan Higher

The exchange rate for gold jewelry was listed 10 yuan higher at 9:30 AM, and there were no changes thereafter. Da Tong Hang revised the listing to 570 yuan, and the prices of Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous prices. Purchases were reduced by about 30 yuan.

### 外幣都漲　日票獨落

All foreign currencies rose, while Japanese currency fell alone.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no new developments in the international situation, and public sentiment was relatively stable. Cash gold rebounded, and foreign exchange rates narrowed. British and American gold pounds rose by two yuan, while British gold notes continued to fall by one yuan due to oversupply. American gold notes rose to 16.90 yuan in the morning but soon retreated to 16.42 yuan, eventually settling at 16.70 yuan, an increase of 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly. Singapore, Robi, and Philippine notes all rose by 0.10 yuan. Japanese gold notes fell sharply due to tighter relations between the United States and Japan, with increased supply from all sides. The market retreated to 1.34 yuan in the evening. Korean notes were relatively stable, remaining at the original price of 1.13 yuan in the evening.

### 證券　內債依然興奮

Securities - Domestic Bonds Still Excited

The grey market for securities: Yesterday, at the beginning of the market, China Trust Company No. 24 sold heavily in very large numbers. Subsequently, No. 16 absorbed them at low prices, and the rebound was strong. There were quite a few small purchases. The market has been down for five consecutive days, and there have been many short sellers, so it is not difficult for it to rise. The environment has not changed. Initially, in the morning, the prices were slowly raised by the buying from No. 16 and No. 25. Subsequently, No. 24 and No. 4 card No. 1 sold, and the market could not be sustained. Category C bonds broke through 7 yuan. Although Lianyi and Tongkang bought, Jiufeng and Xingchang still sold, so the market price could not rise. In the afternoon, new news was bullish, and No. 16 and Tongkang continued to buy. Dingkang, Hongda, and Xinfu bought one after another. Although Lianyi, Lianhe, Hengkang, and Yitai sold, the market was still in demand exceeding supply. Category C bonds exceeded 7 yuan, E-building also exceeded 7 yuan, and Category B bonds were seen again at over 60 yuan, and the situation was very good. Therefore, as a result, except for Category B bonds, which rose by 0.20 yuan, the remaining categories rose by only 0.15 to 0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 21 yuan.

Public Industry Stock Market: No special news came during the holiday. The evening market opened very lively. Under the activity of new buyers and short covering, the market rose quite sharply. Most of the stocks with short positions had almost fully recovered the prices that had fallen on Wednesday. Trading in shares of Dutch-Indian rubber companies was not uncommon.

### 投機詩話

Speculative Poetic Talk

- Hu Yimeng

This time, due to the rumors of the evacuation of American expatriates from the Far East and the reopening of the Burma Road, the foreign stock market plunged due to public anxiety. Many people went bankrupt, which is enough to serve as a warning to those who are infatuated with foreign stocks and addicted to speculation. However, I am also one of them. Ten years of hard work were lost in an instant. In a state of utter boredom, I had no choice but to dip my brush and write poems to express my resentment, to give to my fellow enthusiasts, and to warn them for the future.

Ode to Foreign Stocks (Tune: Waves Washing Sand)

Betting on foreign stocks for gold and silver, a piece of paper as evidence, the sudden rise of a downward trend is truly frightening. Locked deep in an iron box, unable to open, it is heartbreaking to see. War clouds rise in East Asia, causing fear and panic, paradise is about to turn into a concentration camp, regretting that I lightly valued fiat currency in the first place, bringing groans of pain upon myself.

The Norwegian campaign caused a wild crash in foreign stocks, which could not be salvaged. The market had just turned better last week, but unexpectedly, due to the current situation, it collapsed again. I wrote this with a heavy heart! (Seven-character Quatrain)

A weak branch, barely sprouted after frost,

Skillful manipulation has initially restored its former glory,

The sound of reed pipes rises on the Pacific Ocean,

Overnight, the west wind scatters flowers again.

A Glimpse of the Market on October 9 (Seven-character Quatrain)

The short covering failed last time,

Today, there is no one to buy the sold-off shares,

I advise you to wash your dragon-slaying hands,

And quietly watch the sunset clouds over Jiangdong.

(Compensation)

London, October 10 (Thursday) - Today (October 9) and today (October 10), the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and shares of British companies in the Far East: only bank shares fluctuated.

The share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London registration) fell by 6.5 pounds to 57.5 pounds, and the share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Hong Kong registration) fell by 4 pounds to 70 pounds.

### 紗花　多空見解不同　紗市迴旋

Cotton yarn - Divergent views between bulls and bears, the yarn market revolves.

The yarn market is still in a revolving state. Currently, there are divergent opinions in the market. The buyers say that raw cotton is firm, expensive, and bullish. The sellers say that foreign exchange rates are easing, there is a large stock of yarn, the situation is tense, and it has already risen by 400 yuan since the low point, so it may fall back a little. Therefore, the two sides are arguing fiercely. Today, 1,175 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces to Yantai.

The market for current yarn opened with good sentiment. Buyers in the market were in high spirits. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,170 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that Japanese yarn was mediocre, and foreign exchange rates shrank and then rose again. Therefore, although the calls were loud, there were few new buyers at high prices, and the market turned downward, falling to 1,162 yuan. However, some scalpers came out to cover their shorts, and the market improved slightly. By the time the market closed, it was still flat. The transaction volume for half a day was 4,270 bales. The price of 10-count Shuangma yarn fell by 10 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below.

### 棉市靜寂

The current cotton market remains sluggish and lacks excitement. However, most people are bullish, still believing that the sources of supply cannot be opened up, and the inventory will gradually decrease and become weaker. However, Japanese factories have little intention of operating. Only trading between colleagues is more lively.

Another news report on foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was slightly weak, first due to a lack of buyers, then due to quieter spot trading, and pressure from the stock market on Wall Street. As a result, the market closed down 8-9 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian forecasts fell by one rupee.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Trading has not been active in recent days due to the shortage of inventory on the market and the sluggish prices of cotton yarn. Most peers are in a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, factories have no cotton to buy. The market is unusually quiet, but prices remain firm.

### 糧食　洋米銜接而來　新粳亦小一二元

Grains - Imported rice arrives in succession, new japonica rice also down slightly by one or two yuan.

Imported rice arrives one after another. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (National Day), carrying 5,609 bags. Also, Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship arrived on the same day, also carrying 4,189 bags from Hong Kong. Another 660 bags were transferred to Qingdao and shipped on the original ship yesterday. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship arrived at the port, carrying 501 bags from Hong Kong, unloading at the Roosevelt Wharf. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 1,621 bags from Hong Kong, unloading at the company's wharf in Pudong (Zu).

The inventory of imported rice is sufficient, and fixed loans and sources of supply are continuous. With the foreign exchange market flat, new foreign transactions have been planned for a long time, and the Nanyang issue and the friction between Britain, the United States, and Japan are not enough to arouse the interest of importers. Speculators lack the opportunity to stimulate the market and are mostly waiting and seeing, waiting for the opportunity to disrupt the market again. Therefore, the market was very quiet yesterday, falling by a small half yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, Changyi, on behalf of China South Enterprise Company, sold 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice at a price of only 75.5 yuan, also down 0.70 yuan from the 76.2 yuan before Double Ten Festival. Public sentiment tended to soften, and there were no buyers for the original package rice returned to the market. The current market price of imported rice has continued to fall by one yuan, a total of one and a half yuan lower than the close on Wednesday evening.

More than 3,000 bags of new japonica rice have arrived. Sales are declining due to the weakness of imported rice. Therefore, the selling price is 1-2 yuan lower than before the anniversary. Minhang new japonica rice is 78 yuan, Xitang Baixue rice is 80 yuan, Qingjiao Dujian rice is 68 yuan, and Taicang imported rice is the only one that is selling well due to lack of supply, selling for 66-67 yuan.

The market for broken japonica rice is about to run out. Only Nangang early rice continues to open high, from 81-82 yuan to 76-77 yuan.

National glutinous rice is also scarce, and foreign goods are very popular, so the prices of national goods are stable while the prices of foreign goods are depreciating. The price of Jinli special rice still needs about 72 yuan, and the price of Hong Kong special rice has already dropped to about 71 yuan, eventually dropping to 68-69 yuan.

### 現粉軋缺　門售無貨應市

Cash flour is in short supply, and there is no stock for sale in stores.

Yesterday, the current flour was still in short supply. Because the amount allocated by each factory was limited, the actual sales in the street increased due to the addition of wheat flour, and there was often a shortage of supply. Most stores currently have no stock for sale, and a small amount of imported flour is used as a substitute, so imported flour is also in short supply. Shuangying brand is 18.7-18.8 yuan per bag, and the retail price of Fushou brand is as high as 19.6 yuan. However, the purchase of returned old car brand warehouse warrants and Chinese factory flour customers has not changed due to the large orders of imported flour, remaining at 18.4-18.5 yuan.

Wheat - The market was as quiet as ever yesterday. In recent days, the sources of supply from various places have been at firm and expensive production prices, and the costs have been high, so there has been no wholesale shipment to Shanghai. It is even more difficult to import into the concession, so sellers are thinking of supporting the prices, but manufacturers have no intention of lowering prices for purchases. The result is still original plate sporadic embellishment.

### 雜糧　黃豆回跌

Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Fall Back

Yesterday, although several batches of soybeans were traded, it is estimated that there were more than 1,000 bags. The retail price had fallen by 1-2 yuan compared to the previous price. Moreover, various sources of supply had been replenished, so the overall situation had to tend towards weakness. In addition to exports accounting for a quarter of the sales, the rest were purchases in the street. The statistics show that 300 bags of new Qingdao soybeans were sold at a price of 38.5 yuan, 200 bags of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans were sold at a price of 35.5 to 34 yuan, more than 400 bags of new Tianjin soybeans were sold at a price of 48 to 46 yuan, 50 bags of Dachan soybeans were sold at a price of 32 yuan, and 30 bags of Taicang soybeans were sold at a price of 32.5 yuan. Today, 550 bags of raw kernels and 400 bags of sesame seeds will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### 糖市　食糖步降

Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Gradually Fall

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association set the price of the No. 24 group white sugar at 75 yuan for the main warehouse, 74.2 yuan for the external warehouse in July, 75 yuan for new goods, 59 yuan for transit spot goods, 58.3 yuan to 58.3 yuan for October 20, 73.2 yuan to 73.3 yuan for Large B, 72.7 yuan for Dongcang, 71.5 yuan for CX, 71.4 yuan for DY, 71 yuan for HY, 70 yuan plus 6-7 jiao for Dongcang, 66.5 yuan for HW, 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan for Dutch cotton white, and 56 yuan for Dutch red spot goods, 55.6 yuan for road goods. Coarse white was down 0.5 yuan compared to the previous price.

### 南北貨　新紅黑棗　價俱上漲

North-South Goods - New Red and Black Dates Both Rise in Price

New Tianjin red dates have recently arrived in dozens of bags, and the price has continued to rise. It is estimated that Jujube King is 100 yuan, Jujube Head is 80 yuan, First Household is 70 yuan, and Second Household is 60 yuan.

New black dates have now arrived in 100 bags from Ergaozhuang. The price opened yesterday at 70 yuan. The market is still tight and is expected to continue to rise.

### 南芡產量不豐

The production of Southern Gorgon Fruit is not abundant

Purchases of southern gorgon fruit have increased slightly in recent days, and the price is also relatively flat. The market price has been sold at over 280 yuan. However, the number of production this year is not high, and it is not easy for the land price to continue to ease if it cannot be too low.

### 海味　香山尾二盤售開

Seafood - Xiangshan Shrimp Tails Second Batch Sold Out

A batch of Xiangshan shrimp tails from the West has recently arrived. Two batches were sold for 405 yuan a few days ago. It is found that the goods are inferior to the previous batch, so the price must be reduced by as much as 60 yuan.

### 白椒堅挺黑椒回軟

White Pepper Firm, Black Pepper Softens

Pepper trading has not been quiet recently, and white pepper is even more active, and its trend is firm. The current market price of Wendao goods is 210 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 200 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan each compared to the previous price. However, black pepper has softened, and No. 1 and black Datong are sold at 109 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan.

### 疋頭　布價尙穩

Piece Goods - Cloth Prices Still Stable

National Cloth - Yesterday, the trend of the cloth market was flat, because the sales of cotton cloth were narrow and not as good as the original yarn. The selling prices were mostly less than the cost. Recently, with the yarn market slightly rebounding, the cloth prices were still stable. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth were flat, while some coarse cloth fell by 0.10 to 0.25 yuan per piece. There was no change in bleached and dyed cloth. The trading of grey cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth in the street was over 400 pieces. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs sold over 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, Hongzhang, Lun Chang, tribute satin, and woolen cloth. The North Road Yantai gangs sold over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were handled from Singapore, Luoluo, and other places abroad.

Eastern Cloth - Yesterday, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan per piece. The morning opening price of Longtou fine cloth was seen at a high of 36.5 yuan, and the closing price was 36.2 yuan. Serge was about 1.08 yuan, because the industry had good sentiment, buying at low prices, and the trend was still stable.

Export - Today, 235 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai, and 920 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### 馬褲呢交易盛

The Sale of Riding Breeches Fabric is Thriving

The trading of riding breeches fabric has been very active recently. Wholesale users sell daily, factories are currently offering their spot inventory, and the settling of future orders has increased. There are increasingly more people who are custom-making large coats, making this the season for sales. Due to the high price, the sales of the lower-grade, all-yarn riding breeches fabric are stronger than in previous years. It is found that of the various trends in the market, all types of fabrics are not as good as camel silk as far as good sales are concerned. The imported riding breeches fabric market is slightly better due to limited inventory. The price of 1005 ordinary fabric is sold for 39 to 40 yuan, the price of Ewo 1 to 28 riding breeches fabric is 25-26 yuan, the price of Zhanghua cotton sheep is 22.5 yuan, the price of Xie Xin Wufu Linmen is 27 yuan, the price of Yinfeng Caishen Hu is 27.5 yuan, and the price of Meilun Santa Claus yarn goods is 3.5 yuan. Non-Western riding breeches fabric is sold for 30 yuan, and the Japanese-owned Shenzhi Main Factory goods are sold for 20.05 yuan.

### 藥材　益志仁回升

Medicinal Materials - Yizhiren Rebounds

The recent shipments of Yizhiren have continued, and sales have remained brisk. Therefore, the market inventory is becoming increasingly thin. The previous market price fell from 150 yuan to just over 120 yuan, and the current market has recovered to 150 yuan, rebounding by over 10 yuan, and the trend is very firm.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Frequently, Limited Rise in Local Prices

The day before yesterday was the Double Tenth Festival and the market was closed, but American and Japanese silk prices continued to rise. New York spot Japanese silk rose by one dime to one dime and one cent, Shanghai silk rose by six cents, and Guangdong silk rose by eight cents. Yesterday, New York silk prices were firm and flat, with spot and forward prices rising by six to six and a half cents compared to the previous market. Yokohama had no market yesterday. Considering the futures and spot prices on the ninth, prices rose by forty yuan and nineteen yuan compared to the previous day.

The local silk market could have sailed smoothly and started an upward trend. However, the situation in Japan and the United States also affected the exchange rate, so the rise in silk prices was limited. White filature B-grade silk was sold at prices ranging from 5,100 yuan to 5,150 yuan, nearly 100 yuan higher than at the beginning of the week. It is said that a few transactions were made with British and French foreign firms for export to the United States, due to the impact of regulations and the lack of goods available on the market.

Ten cases of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), and another 510 cases will be shipped to Tianjin.

### China's Post-War Silk Industry (Continued) (10th)

— Shi Xiang

(B) The Silk Market's Adversity

The silk market this year gradually declined. Since the end of the spring silkworm season, it has become even more unstable. The impact of the European War has affected the entire silk industry. In New York, prices have been falling daily. New silk entering the market has encountered adversity. For example, in mid-June, in the New York market, 13-15 denier silk reached US$2.75 per pound. By August, it had fallen to US$2.45, a drop of US$0.30 per pound (equivalent to a drop of US$40 per picul of silk, which weighs 133 pounds). Although the current market situation has improved slightly, most of the silk from small factories has been sold out, so we are no longer the ones profiting.

At that time, the issue of shipping raw silk arose again. Those who had sold to foreign firms in Shanghai beforehand were unable to deliver the goods. Because of the difficulties in shipping, most of them sold on the spot. However, the selling price was 500 yuan lower than that of foreign firms in Shanghai. Local silk merchants, seeing that manufacturers urgently needed funds, often lowered the selling price. At one point, only 1,000 yuan could be advanced in cash after weighing each picul of silk, and the remaining amount could only be collected after a delay of twenty days. Because manufacturers were facing imminent deadlines for payments in the countryside, they sold at a loss to solve their immediate needs. At that time, the highest price per picul of silk was only 4,000 yuan, which meant a loss of at least 970 yuan per picul. The calculation is as follows:

The price of fresh cocoons is 390 yuan per picul. After drying, this yields 280 catties. Adding 60 yuan for expenses, the price of dried cocoons per picul is 1,152 yuan. To reel one picul of raw silk requires 380 catties of dried cocoons. Therefore, the cost of one picul of silk is 4,377 yuan. Adding 600 yuan for reeling labor (i.e., production costs), the cost of each picul of silk is 4,977 yuan. However, it is now only sold for 4,000 yuan, resulting in a net loss of 977 yuan per picul.

### Bloodshed in Hongkou Yesterday Morning: Rumors of Xiaoan's Assassination and Death, Tragedy Born from Within as Old Servant Murders with Knife, Japanese Side Conducts Major Search but Finds Nothing

At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a sudden assassination occurred at No. 26-2, Xiangde Road, at the intersection of Shigaota Road in Hongkou, shocking the area. The deceased was "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan. It is said that the previous day was the Double Tenth Festival, and he reportedly went to the "City Government" in the morning to preside over the celebration ceremony. He gathered with relatives and friends somewhere in the evening, and returned home late after enjoying himself. Two hours after he fell asleep, he was killed by his close attendant Zhu Sheng with a sharp kitchen knife. It is rumored that he was stabbed three times, hitting the eye, jaw, and neck. The neck wound was the most fatal. After completing his objective, the murderer sneaked out of the mansion and disappeared without a trace. It is said that the Fu family has offered a reward of 50,000 yuan to capture the murderer. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest will be rewarded with 25,000 yuan. Although Japanese soldiers and "city police" were dispatched on a large scale afterward, they found nothing.

Those Around Fu Talk About the Cause of Death

According to those around Fu, his death must have political implications, "because he was too humble and did not agree to go to Nanjing to take office." Fu usually had strict security, employing as many as 23 guards, and Japanese soldiers and "city police" were stationed outside his residence. Fu had recently told people that he was planning to resign. Unexpectedly, he was killed by the servant he trusted most in his family. Moreover, according to a Mr. Wu, a member of Fu’s circle, told Western reporters that prior to the Nanjing Committee appointing a successor, the current state of the "City Government" could only be put on hold,

The Residence's Security Was Extremely Tight

Fu, named Zongyao, courtesy name Xiaoan, was 69 years old (born in 1872) and a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. His Shanghai residence was previously at No. 1, Xingfu Lane, Lubaan Road in the French Concession, before moving to No. 1189, Xiafei Road. The house was purchased from a German at the lowest price during the First World War. He now resides at No. 2, Lane 26, Xianglu Road, Hongkou. He had one wife and one concubine. His first wife, Zhu, died of illness on November 25th of last year. She bore him one son and one daughter each. His eldest daughter is married to Zhu Zigui, manager of the Bank of Communications. His second son, Pinggui, is 46 years old and serves as the chief auditor of the China Exchange Bank. Pinggui's wife has nine sons and four daughters. His grown sons have also had three sons, one of whom is studying at a Japanese kindergarten. Fu's concubine, Zhang, is from North China and has been elevated to the status of wife. Fu's residence usually has extremely strict security, with more than 20 "shock troops" deployed, guarding the house day and night.

Three Fatal Wounds, Died on the Spot

Fu employed many male and female servants, but Zhu Sheng was the most trusted. Zhu, courtesy name Shengyuan, also known as Chen Zhongnan, was 42 years old and a native of Shandong. When Fu was wanted and fled to Dalian, Zhu was hired at a monthly salary of 22 yuan. Zhu has a mistress who lives somewhere on Nanjing Road. He usually either goes home or, when there are events taking place inside the residence, he stays in the “guard room.” The previous day was the Double Tenth Festival. Fu gathered with relatives and friends until midnight before returning, and fell asleep exhausted. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu suddenly obtained a kitchen knife and entered Fu's bedroom to assassinate him, slashing at Fu's head three times, hitting the eyes, jaw, and throat. The wounds were extremely deep. Seeing that his objective had been achieved, Zhu abandoned the knife and fled.

Japanese Soldiers Dispatched, Searching Pedestrians

At this time, Fu's wife, Zhang, woke up in a start and entered the room to investigate. She found Fu dead in a pool of blood, and became terrified. The guards downstairs then learned of the incident. After receiving the news, the commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately dispatched a large group of armed soldiers to search pedestrians in the Hongkou area and implement a lockdown. They also went to Zhu Sheng's residence somewhere on Nanjing Road to search, but Zhu Sheng's wife had moved away three weeks earlier. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department also dispatched a team of detectives to the scene after receiving the report. However, after finding out that Fu's residence was outside the Public Concession, they turned back midway. According to the English-language "China Press" newspaper, this morning (the 11th), when Fu was killed in his bedroom, there were two Japanese and White Russian bodyguards in the neighboring room. However, they did not hear any sound when the bloodshed occurred. Today, it was said that when the murderer left Fu's residence, a servant of a nearby Chinese family saw his hurried appearance and asked him about it. The murderer said that he had resigned because he had not received his wages.

Trains on Both Lines Were Even Cut Off

After Fu was assassinated, in addition to implementing a special curfew in Hongkou, the Japanese side even ordered the suspension of trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, hoping to arrest the murderer. It is noted that Fu took office as the so-called "Mayor of Shanghai" on October 16th, 1938, and it would be almost two years since then. In March of this year, he once went to Japan. He had once celebrated the first anniversary of his so-called "inauguration" last year, but the celebratory archway suddenly collapsed in a hurricane. It was said that this was an ominous sign, which has now come to pass. Fu was recently scheduled to visit Japan again for the "East Asia Metropolitan Alliance Conference," scheduled to depart on the 24th of this month, but he was killed before he could go.

Extraordinarily Prominent During Sun Chuanfang's Time

Fu had a humble background and only later became prominent. He successively served as the Director of the Gaochang Temple Manufacturing Bureau in Nanshi, the Shanghai Supervisor of the Bank of China, the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a High Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Shanghai Customs Clearing Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Chairman and General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial Bank, the General Manager of the Siming Bank, and the President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. He was extraordinarily prominent during Sun Chuanfang's time. When the National Revolutionary Army pacified Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Fu was wanted and fled to Dalian, Japan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he secretly returned to Shanghai. He took office as "Mayor" on October 16th, 1938. It is said that Fu's body will be embalmed and lie in state at his residence for several days before the funeral.

Fu Assassinated

It has been found that there were four attempts to assassinate Fu. The first time was a few months after he took office in 1938, when he was suddenly shot at by a guard, but luckily was not hit. The second time was at a banquet at the International Hotel last year, when someone attempted to assassinate him at the table, but he escaped unharmed. The third time was a few months ago, when Fu was holding a Buddhist service at a temple on Gordon Road to commemorate his deceased wife, Zhu. He was attacked by a monk, but the attempt failed. The monk was caught by the guards and executed. Yesterday morning was the fourth time, when he was hacked to death by a trusted old servant. It seems that his fate was predestined. It is said that Fu's body is currently still lying in his residence.

### Jiang Tianduo Passes Away in Beiping, to be Commended, Jiang Lived a Pure and Self-Respecting Life, Kong Xiangxi Sends 1,000 Yuan in Condolences

After Mr. Jiang Tianduo, who held important positions in the former Beijing government, passed away in Beiping last month, the central leaders deeply regretted his integrity and uprightness during his lifetime. In addition to Deputy Prime Minister Kong of the Executive Yuan sending 2,000 yuan in condolences, it is rumored that the government will issue an official commendation to promote encouragement. Jiang was a native of Huaxian, Guangdong. He studied in Japan in his early years and graduated from the law department of Waseda University. He joined the Tongmenghui and participated in the revolutionary movement. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was elected as a member of the first National Assembly. He successively served as the Vice Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Vice Minister of Justice, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Minister of Justice, and President of the Water Conservancy Bureau in the former Beijing government. His entire family resided in Beiping. After the establishment of the National Government, he performed miscellaneous tasks in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, both the North and the South enticed him with "high positions," but he firmly refused and maintained his integrity. Last month, he rushed to Beiping to take care of his ailing mother, but suddenly contracted a serious illness and passed away at the age of 61.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Route: Dangerous Areas, Announced by the Hong Kong Navigation Authority, Including Nine Locations Such as Xiangshan Port

The Hong Kong Shipping Administration announced the following dangerous areas between Hong Kong and Shanghai: (1) Dangerous areas for shelters, including Xiangshan Port, Sandu Ao, Laiyuan Bay, Ersha Bay, Nanwan Port, and Xinghua Bay. (2) Dangerous areas for underwater power drift, namely Haitan Gorge (between Ai Near Reef and Flag Island to Shuangzu Island). (3) Potentially dangerous areas, namely Biwan Port and Luqing Bay. Safety cannot be guaranteed in these areas. All navigators must consider the mine area and the possibility of floating mines. They must wait for changes in the weather before setting the course. All shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route have followed this directive.

### Allegations of a Run on American Banks: Entirely Groundless, Busy with Deposits and Withdrawals Before and After the Holiday, Business Flourishing and Prosperous

Rumors have circulated that following the U.S. State Department's public announcement advising the families of American nationals in the Far East to evacuate as quickly as possible, American nationals in Shanghai were rushing to withdraw their deposits from American banks. Inquiries from various sources have confirmed that these rumors are untrue. According to a senior staff member of a certain bank, the increased volume of deposits and withdrawals before and after the holiday is a normal phenomenon and nothing to be concerned about. Amidst the current volatile situation, banking business is in fact flourishing and prosperous. Some members of the Chinese propertied class are exchanging U.S. dollars for legal tender, while others are exchanging legal tender for U.S. dollars, buying and selling according to their individual needs. According to general opinion among the Chinese, the State Department's proposal to evacuate American nationals from the Far East is a sign of an increasingly assertive U.S. policy in the region. Consequently, the value of legal tender has suddenly risen.

### The U.S. Expedites Evacuation Work, First Group to Depart Next Month, Shanghai East American Community Notified by Consulate, Dependents of Naval Officers Also to Return Home

Since the United States adopted a firm stance to maintain its interests in the Far East, the Japanese attitude has gradually softened. However, according to several foreign diplomatic personnel, the situation in the Far East has not eased due to Japan's softened attitude. This can be seen in the Shanghai U.S. Consulate's handling of the evacuation of American nationals. The U.S. Consulate is continuing its evacuation work. According to a unique source of information from authoritative American sources, the dependents of key U.S. naval officers in Shanghai have also confirmed dates for their evacuation back to the United States.

First Group of Americans Scheduled to Leave Shanghai

Although President Roosevelt has not strongly confirmed the evacuation of non-essential American nationals in China, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai received notification from the State Department on the 8th of this month. Yesterday morning, reporters learned from American sources that the consulate is seriously handling the evacuation. The consulate has already issued notices to the first group of registered American evacuees, explaining the contents of the State Department's instructions. The second batch of notices will be issued within days. Most of the first group of Americans preparing to evacuate reside in the eastern district of the International Settlement. The U.S. Embassy will provide subsidies to the impoverished or middle-class employees and their families to facilitate their return home. According to a New Life News Agency reporter, a group of American women and children are scheduled to return to the United States on the American President Lines' President Coolidge on November 6th.

American Organizations Hold Meetings to Discuss

Since the American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce have received instructions from the State Department in Washington regarding the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East, including North China and Shanghai, the two organizations found it necessary to discuss the steps they should take and how they should assist the authorities in carrying out the evacuation. The American Chamber of Commerce held a meeting yesterday afternoon and made detailed decisions on how to dismiss lower-paid American employees. The American Association will be convened by Chairman Fett in the next two days. It is said that both organizations believe it is necessary to increase the number of ships to the Far East for the evacuation and will request this from the authorities.

British Nationals Not Preparing to Evacuate

The British government's attitude toward its nationals in the Far East or China is of great concern to all circles. According to the British Consulate General, the British government has not yet issued such instructions, and the responsible parties have no plans to evacuate. When asked whether it would be necessary to evacuate British nationals in the future, those in charge said that the British government in London had not issued any evacuation notices and did not wish to comment.

U.S. Military Withdrawal Undecided

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox's statement in Washington about withdrawing 1,600 soldiers from the Asiatic Fleet and the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in China has not yet been finalized. However, the strengthening of the defenses of key U.S. naval and military bases in the Pacific, such as Manila, Subic Bay, and Hawaii, is indeed due to the escalating situation in the Far East. In the event of a possible withdrawal of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, since Shanghai is an international settlement, it is unlikely to undergo drastic changes like in the First World War in 1914, and its neutral status will undoubtedly be maintained.

### French Concession Strengthens Military Force, Reorganizes Volunteer Corps and Special Police, Assists Garrison in Responding to Military Actions

The French Consul General's office believes that the current situation has changed and the Concession is facing pressure. For this reason, it has reorganized the Volunteer Corps and the Special Police. The main points of the reorganization are as follows:

French Volunteer Corps

(1) The French Volunteer Corps of the French Concession was established in 1897 and reorganized in 1938. This reorganization is the fourth. (2) According to the new organization, all current members of the French Volunteer Corps must formally join the corps after registering. However, this is limited to those who support the Pétain government or are under French protection. Foreigners of nationalities other than French who wish to join the Volunteer Corps must have resided in the French Concession for many years, possess property, and have passed an examination by the authorities to prove their military knowledge. (3) The Volunteer Corps is organized into a regiment, consisting of A: an active regiment and B: a reserve regiment. Active duty personnel, after passing the new registration and examination, must have training in the operation of new weapons, possess military knowledge, and be well-intentioned towards the Pétain government. (4) The Volunteer Corps has one commander (currently the director of the education department of the French Municipal Council, Gu Loubao), one deputy commander, and several non-commissioned officers. (5) Weapons include heavy machine guns, light machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars, armored vehicles, automatic rifles, and pistols. (6) In the event of military action caused by foreign parties, the Volunteer Corps will assist the French garrison in Shanghai and act in concert. (7) The Volunteer Corps has never had a fixed number of personnel. Among them, 147 White Russian volunteers are incorporated into the French Police Department as paid mercenaries.

Special Police

(8) The issue of Special Police is now being reorganized due to the withdrawal of a majority of British and American residents. The structure includes one chief inspector, one secretary, and 14 inspectors, with a total of 135 personnel. The task of leading and managing is to inspect the service status of non-French personnel in the police stations and other agencies when military action occurs in the French Concession, and to investigate their rebellious behavior.

### Shipu Bombed for the First Time, Japanese Aircraft Drop Eight Bombs, Destroying Over 300 Houses

At 9:45 a.m. on the 9th, four Japanese aircraft were spotted over Haimen. The Ningbo air defense observation post issued a series of emergency air raid alerts. The Japanese aircraft then attacked Shipu, circling twice.

Bombing

A total of eight bombs were dropped, including two incendiary bombs. One incendiary bomb landed in Jiangxin Temple, two bombs were dropped on Wenfu Street, one bomb landed in Tiger Cave, and one bomb landed in the river outside the West Gate. Three civilians were injured: a man, a woman, and a child.

Over 300 Houses Destroyed

After dropping the bombs, two of the aircraft fled towards Songkan, Fenghua, Ningbo, Cixi, and Guanhaiwei, while the other two flew towards Hengshan and Chuanshan. The all-clear was sounded at 10:50 a.m.

### Four Foreign Ships Detained in Shenjiamen Released, Baoli Arrives in Shanghai, Moufu Trial Voyage Canceled

The Italian merchant ship Baoli, which was detained near Zhoushan, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at Roosevelt Wharf (formerly Xinjiangtian Wharf). The ship carried 11,400 pieces of local goods, including paper and oil, from Wenzhou and is scheduled to

Begin Unloading Today

According to a crew member, the ship sailed empty to Wenzhou and departed from Shanghai in the middle of last month. After arriving in Wenzhou, it immediately loaded cargo. Due to the inconvenience of local transportation and the difficulty of transporting goods from the interior, the loading was delayed. It set sail on the 22nd of last month, but was unexpectedly detained by a Japanese warship near Shenjiamen and escorted

To Zhoushan Island

Where it anchored. There, ships such as Daxin, Dasheng, Xinxiangtai, Jiangsu, Dacheng, and Anmanli were also anchored and monitored by Japanese warships. After several negotiations, it was released on the 8th of this month, along with Anmanli and Dacheng. It returned to Shanghai yesterday morning around 7:00 a.m. Anmanli and Dacheng will arrive in Shanghai within days. It is said that Jiangsu

Was Also Released and Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Public School on Jingzhou Road, which was leased to the Jewish Immigrant Committee and housed 2,000 German Jewish refugees, is to be vacated by the Jewish Immigrant Committee by November 1st, in accordance with the terms of the lease. Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Public School is expected to reopen next year. However, it is not known whether classes will be held at the original school on Jingzhou Road. It is said that the Municipal Council has sold the school property to a certain Japanese real estate company, but this has not been confirmed. At the same time, the Immigrant Committee has no concrete plans to accommodate these 2,000 Jewish people. It is rumored that some of them will move to the Pingliang Road refugee camp. However, most Jewish immigrants plan to do business in the central part of the International Settlement, and the Pingliang Road refugee camp is too far away to satisfy them.

### Public Transportation in the French Concession Halted Again Yesterday, Temporary Employees Prevented from Going to Work, All Sectors Intend to Mediate Negotiations Without Success

Since the drivers and ticket sellers of the French Water and Electricity Company went on strike, they temporarily recruited more than 200 workers and apprentices to fill the positions of the strikers and maintain the operation of the trams. However, these people mostly lived in Nanshi and went out early and returned late. For two weeks, there had been no obstacles. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, when they went to the Luban Road tram depot from Nanshi, they were suddenly prevented from going to work by the striking workers. In addition, more than 50 people in the engine room of the company who had not participated in the strike and all the workers in the machine affairs office were forced to join the strike. As a result, all trams and public buses in the concession were completely suspended. It is said that all the striking workers gathered in a certain place in Nanshi yesterday afternoon and held a meeting to discuss methods of negotiating with the capitalists.

Mediation Fails

It was found that the company's workers went on strike on the 25th of last month and agreed on 16 conditions, requesting the capitalists to respond. Because the conditions had to be translated into French, the capitalists were unable to respond immediately. On the 30th, the labor side again proposed six preconditions, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng to present them to the capitalists when mediating the labor dispute. On the 2nd of this month, the labor side again requested mediation from the political affairs department of the French police station. The capitalist side also responded to three of the labor side's conditions on the same day. The labor side then carried the revised conditions for negotiation the next day. The capitalist side was unable to send anyone to attend for some reason, causing the negotiations to come to a standstill. Although relevant parties intervened to mediate, it was not successful in the end.

Points of Contention

It is also learned that the labor side's demands are still to insist on the six preconditions proposed on the 30th of last month. The first item is that "the capitalist side recognizes the union and pays office expenses of 400 yuan in national currency per month," while the capitalist side only recognizes the old union. The second item is that the 28 workers and striking workers who were unjustly detained in the case of inspector Chen Tongzhang must be released unconditionally. The capitalist side stated that the power to release the arrested workers was in the hands of the police station, and the company could not make any decisions. The opinions of both sides on the other items, such as the third item of increasing wages, the fourth item of increasing doorkeepers, the fifth item of not dismissing workers without cause, the sixth item of paying wages during the strike period, and the payment of retirement funds, are still close. Therefore, if the labor side can make concessions on the first and second items, the entire labor dispute can be resolved easily.

Concern from All Sides

It was stated by the authorities that they still hoped that the political affairs department of the French police station and influential people in society would come forward to mediate. As for the livelihood of the striking workers, it is said that rice has been distributed to the families of the workers. It is also learned that the political affairs department of the French police station and the Chinese directors of the Public Concession, Yu Qiaqing and Wei Tingrong, etc., considering that the matter is expanding and hindering social security, will quickly seek a proper solution.

Security at the Depot

After the trams and public buses in the French Concession were completely suspended yesterday morning, the labor unrest became more serious again. The main gates of the company's depot and machine workshops on Xujiahui Road, etc., have also been open as usual since the strike, and various workers repairing vehicles have also been working as usual. Yesterday, however, barbed wire was erected at the intersection of Luban Road and Kangti Road, and more than a dozen French and Vietnamese police officers were stationed there to prohibit all pedestrians and vehicles from passing through. Residents who want to enter Luban Road must enter through other roads from Xujiahui Road. A gap was left in the middle of the barbed wire for the company's employees and patrolling motorcycles to enter and exit. A gun carriage was parked at the door of the depot inside the barbed wire, and the doors of all the factories were locked, showing a rather serious situation. However, the general situation is still peaceful. It is heard that on the night of the Double Tenth Festival, a large number of transport workers and ticket writers disappeared from the Sixteenth Shop. At the same time, when a driver living at No. 192-282 Kangnao Road was having dinner at home, ten people suddenly came and dragged him out of the house. The driver was in a hurry and sounded the police whistle, which allowed him to escape.

Continued Negotiations

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the strike of 2,500 workers of the French Tram Company has lasted for seven days and has not been resolved. The 200 drivers and ticket sellers who maintained the main line business also suddenly stopped working today (the 11th) and joined the strike. According to Mr. Fa Fulei, the manager of the French Tram Company, this morning, the labor and capital sides are still continuing negotiations, but he was unable to announce any definite news about the labor unrest. The main line business of public vehicles in the French Concession continued as usual this morning, but after foreign employees of the tram company repaired the wires at the intersection of Gongguan Road and Balizhao Road, the public buses were completely suspended at around 8:30 a.m. It is heard that after the labor side put forward seven demands on the 7th of this month, the labor unrest was close to resolution, but these demands were rejected by the capitalists. It is believed that the expansion of the labor unrest today, and the suspension of the main line business of trams and public buses, is due to the capitalists rejecting the demands. However, although the labor unrest spread again this morning, no accidents or disturbances occurred.

No Worry About Water and Electricity

After the workers in the engine room of the French Water and Electricity Company went on strike yesterday morning due to past disputes between the engine room workers and the White Russian workers, which the factory had not satisfactorily resolved, they also left the factory and joined the strike. The work in the copper shop and the coin shop was announced to be suspended. A part of the waterworks workers was also implicated. After the company received the news, it immediately summoned the White Russian workers to the factory to take over, so the engine opening and the waterworks were still operating as usual, and there was no worry about water and electricity supply. The company paid great attention to it and was prepared.

### Incidents of Robbery Recorded

At 12:00 noon yesterday, in room 104 of the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two of the robbers took out guns to threaten the people and robbed more than 900 yuan in legal currency and more than 50 yuan in old Japanese bills before leaving.

Last night, a Western woman was walking along Baina Road in Shanghai when she was suddenly stopped by two robbers with guns. The robbers snatched the woman's handbag and tried to escape. The woman immediately shouted for the police to catch the robbers. The robbers turned back and fired four shots at her to warn her. The woman lay on the ground to avoid being hit. Fortunately, she was not hit. The robbers escaped without a trace with the stolen goods.

### Case of Assaulting American Soldiers: Japan Formally Apologizes, Willing to Have Responsible Officers Offer Apology Aboard Ship, Admiral Hart Believes No Need for Further Correspondence to Conclude Matter

The North-China Daily News reports that Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, issued a public statement yesterday (the 10th), announcing the resolution of the unfortunate incident involving an American sailor and several Japanese military police inside the Bank of Communications Building. The statement said that on October 7, 1940, Admiral Hart received a letter from Major General Miura Saburo, Commander of the Japanese Military Police, regarding the unfortunate incident that occurred on September 28 at the Bank of Communications Building. In the letter, Miura expressed apology for the "unjustified behavior" of the Japanese military police in that incident, and offered to have the responsible officers directly apologize to the captain of the U.S.S. Augusta. Admiral Hart replied to Major General Miura on October 9, stating that since the Major General had already apologized, the separate direct apology could be waived. Furthermore, on the 8th, a Japanese warship anchored in the waters of Shuangzhi Harbor, Xiangshan Port, at 5:25 PM, sped towards the waters off Hengshan Lake, Houtou, for reconnaissance and fired eight shells towards the shore, causing no damage.

### Massive Copper Theft Case Involving Two Million Yuan: Perpetrator Escapes; Suspect Hides in Broadway Mansions; Police and Japanese Police Cooperate in Attempted Arrest; Japanese Military Police Firmly Request Leniency

The English-language China Press reports that Swiss national Whittle has been wanted for stealing five hundred tons of copper worth two million yuan from the premises of the American trading company Swan, Culbertson & Fritz, copper that was being transferred from the American firm's godown at the godown of the China Forwarding and Storage Company. Yesterday (the 10th) at 11:00 AM, a constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police and two officers from the Japanese Consular Police went to the seventeenth floor of Broadway Mansions

to arrest Whittle.

They were suddenly stopped by Japanese military police. It is understood that several years ago, the Swan, Culbertson & Fritz sold coin-minting machinery to the Chinese government, and received five hundred tons of copper in payment, all packed in crates and stored in the godown of the China Forwarding and Storage Company. It was recently discovered that the copper had been stolen, and the crates had been replaced with sand. It was then discovered that Whittle had orchestrated this largest theft case. Before the theft, trucks had been seen driving to the godown at night, and then

driving to Hongkou

District. The Swiss Consul-General, upon learning of the situation, issued an arrest warrant ten days ago. However, Whittle was hiding in Hongkou, making it difficult for the Shanghai Municipal Police to arrest him. On the 10th, it was learned that Whittle was in his apartment in Broadway Mansions. A constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police, together with two officers from the Japanese Consular Police, went to the address to make the arrest. Whittle contacted his lawyer, Toune, by telephone, who then contacted the Japanese Military Police. A squad of armed Japanese military police arrived at Broadway Mansions and

firmly requested his release.

As a result, Whittle, the perpetrator of the massive theft, escaped. It has been reported that Whittle has previously been imprisoned twice for privately selling firearms and committing fraud. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, regarding the case of Swiss national Whittle stealing copper worth two million yuan, the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontanel, stated that he was studying the steps to take, but could not comment at this time. American authorities also intend to initiate an investigation into this case, as the companies involved, Swan, Culbertson & Fritz, and China Forwarding and Storage Company

are both American

firms. It is believed that Whittle is still hiding north of the Suzhou Creek. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Police has given up the pursuit, but if he enters the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek, he will be arrested. Sources believe that the Swiss Consul-General will submit a request to the Japanese authorities for cooperation in the arrest. Japanese military spokesmen remained silent on the matter, saying they were unaware of it.

### Extortion Attempt; Dong Hehai Sentenced to Imprisonment

Zhang Yinlai, from Ningbo, operates the Zhang Xiangtai button shop at 690 Burkill Road. On the 6th of this month, Zhang received a threatening letter from gangsters, demanding 5,000 yuan in legal tender, instructing him to wrap the money in a package resembling a book, addressed to "Li," and send it to the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, where someone would contact him. The letter warned of consequences if he didn't comply. Zhang ignored the letter. On the 9th, he received a second letter, accusing Zhang of ignoring their warning and threatening the safety of his family if he continued to ignore them. Zhang reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station, who dispatched detective Ma Zhong and Weng Peiyu to the designated location, accompanied by Zhang's representative, Xia Chengen. At the appointed time, Dong Hehai (aka Dong Ruhai) from Ningbo arrived to make contact and was arrested. A search of his residence at 49, Lane 348, Weihaiwei Road, uncovered envelopes and scratch paper identical to those used in the extortion letters. He was taken to the Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police brought charges against him. The defendant confessed. Judge Fu sentenced Dong to four months imprisonment and ordered the destruction of the extortion letters.

### Japanese Authorities, in Conjunction with French Police, Seize Large Quantity of Military Supplies; Five Chinese Arrested

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 10th) at 2:00 AM, Japanese military police, in conjunction with police from the two concessions, searched two Chinese residences in the French Concession, arrested five Chinese, and seized weapons and ammunition. It is reported that the residences searched were located at Lane 239, Route Abert and Route Bellesme. Five handguns, ten ammunition boxes, eight mortars, and a quantity of ammunition were seized.

Japanese authorities, in conjunction with detectives from the French Police Department, conducted rigorous searches in the residential areas of the French Concession yesterday at 5:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 6:00 PM. As a result, more than ten people were arrested by the Japanese authorities. However, the locations searched and the names of those arrested could not be determined due to the Police Department's strict secrecy.

### Daughters of Deceased Fujian Merchant Huang Zhan'ao Contest Inheritance; Request Detailed Calculation of Estate for Fair Distribution; Defendant Requests Dismissal; Adjourned Indefinitely

Huang Linying (38 years old, from Min County, Fuzhou, residing at 7, Lane 164, Avenue Foch), the second wife of the late wealthy merchant Huang Zhan'ao from Min County, Fuzhou, acting as the legal representative for her daughters Huang Ruji (20 years old) and Huang Ruqi (19 years old), has retained attorney Li Zhongdao to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court against Huang Ruchan (57 years old), Huang Rubi (50 years old, residing at 19, Lane 188, Avenue Albert), and Huang Ruhao (46 years old, residing at 15, Lane 56, Rue Foochow), all born to Huang Zhan'ao's first wife, Ji, demanding the surrender of the late father Zhan'ao's estate and a detailed accounting of the

entire estate,

and requesting that the portion to be distributed be specified and retained. They also request that Zhan'ao's will be surrendered. The facts are that the plaintiff's legal representative, Huang Linying, married the late wealthy merchant Huang Zhan'ao in 1921 as his second wife and had two daughters, Ruji and Ruqi. The first wife, Pan, bore the three brothers, Huang Ruchan, Huang Rubi, and Huang Ruhao, whom are the accused. Zhan'ao owned Hengsheng, Fuyuan, and other cloth shops in Fuzhou, 50,000 yuan worth of shares in the Shanghai Commercial Press, and the Huang Feng 嶰 shop in Shanghai, specializing in Shanghai-Fuzhou remittance services. In recent years, he also engaged in

the cotton and cloth business

in Guangzhou and Fuzhou, and owned over 800 mu of farmland and houses, totaling over three million yuan in assets. Unfortunately, in 1923, Zhan'ao was injured in a tram accident in the French Concession in Shanghai and died from his injuries. After Ruji was born, he made a will to protect the rights of his wife and daughters, with provisions for the inheritance of the plaintiffs. However, the defendants viewed this with jealousy. When the plaintiff went to the hospital to visit Zhan'ao when he was on his deathbed, she was refused by the defendants. When she saw her late father before his death, he could no longer speak. Now the defendants have divided up the estate and the property that the plaintiffs should inherit

has all been divided.

Therefore, the court is requested to order the defendants to surrender the will and report the total amount of the estate in order to present evidence for distribution according to law. The court accepted the case and, yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan Hao opened the seventh court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the facts and reasons of the case and the objects of the request. The defendants, represented by lawyer Ma Shouhua, requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Their defense was that Huang Linying, the legal representative, was Zhan'ao's concubine and not his second wife. Zhan'ao had only made a distribution list for his nephews and three sons and did not make a will. Furthermore, in 1923, women did not

have inheritance rights.

Women only had inheritance rights from 1927. All the estate was distributed in 1925, and the plaintiff signed on that occasion. However, the distribution list only specified the three defendant brothers and that a house was built for the plaintiff at a cost of 10,000 yuan. If she remained chaste, a chastity arch would be built to honor her after her death. The court examined the statements and ordered a postponement, instructing the defendant to submit the distribution list for review before further examination.

### Bomb Thrown into Gambling Den at Hotel des Nations; One Gambler Injured

### Letter

To the Editor,

According to Mr. Lu Zhenqing, Director of the Sino-Western Sanatorium, the news report in the Shen Bao on October 4 regarding the lawsuit filed by Li Yuying's father to recover funeral expenses, contained elements that implicated him. Specifically, the report stated that "Lu Zhenqing withheld 8,700 yuan in cash and gold jewelry and clothing worth 100 yuan left by Li Yuying, refusing to return them to the deceased's parents, which led Li Shizhen, the deceased's father, to file a lawsuit against Lu in the Second Special Court, which is currently being audited by an accountant." However, Li Yuying's belongings were kept in the sanatorium at the request of the China Funeral Home for provisional attachment, and sealed by the Second Special District Court. It was not that Lu Zhenqing was withholding them. The deceased's parents filed a lawsuit for evidence preservation in the Second Special District Court. All the sanatorium's books and records were investigated and verified by the court and returned to the sanatorium. There was no lawsuit in the Civil Court. Past reports in various newspapers regarding the death of Li Yuying were largely inconsistent with the facts. The undersigned, as attorneys, always uphold fairness and impartiality in correcting inaccurate records, not only for the gratitude of Lu Zhenqing alone, but also to ensure that the truth is published for the benefit of society. We respectfully request that your esteemed newspaper correct the inaccuracies. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully, attorneys Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan, October 10.

### Editor's Note

Regarding the "Where Should Women Go?" question, we are first publishing Ms. Jiang Yihui's "Our Path" today. In this small space, this article may seem a bit long, but we feel that Ms. Jiang's arguments from social, national, family, educational, psychological, and other perspectives are well-rounded and her thinking is quite thorough and correct. We believe that this is a rare work, with every sentence and paragraph worthy of careful consideration by our readers. We will publish the opinions of many other readers after organizing them in succession.

Women

### Our Path

— Yihui

I am the mother of two children. Indeed, most of my time is spent on my children. Especially in the first year or two of a child's life, it is almost impossible for me to engage in any responsible work or social activities. In the joy that a mother sees in her children's daily growth, there is an expression of the infinite sacrifice of women! Perhaps some would say that children will grow up, and a woman who aspires to serve society can still engage in various activities in society when her children enter school, right? However, the reality is not as simple as we imagine. A woman who has been immersed in her family for five or six years or more, even if she is relatively willing to work hard, will not easily re-enter the circle of career. Moreover, due to environmental factors, most women have already lost all contact with the society outside the family, right? A woman's life sacrificed in the family is a unique phenomenon of an unreasonable social system. Before the entire social system is rationalized, this phenomenon cannot be completely eliminated, but it can be reduced to a minimum by means of rational child care institutions. Now let us discuss from the three aspects of women's self-development, the needs of society and the country, and the welfare of the children themselves, why women should jump out of the narrow circle of the family and embark on the path of social activity.

Each Has Its Own Strengths

First, from the perspective of women themselves, women's talents, like men's, have their own strengths. Women's interests are not consistent like men's. Some women are better than others at caring for children. Some men have a deeper interest in children than women. At the same time, some women have talents in science, politics, or art that far surpass ordinary men. For those women who are particularly interested in children, we not only agree that she should care for her own children, but also, in order to increase social efficiency, we also agree that she should care for other people's children on behalf of others. Because taking care of one child and taking care of ten children makes no big difference to a person who has special training. In this way, other women, because there are specialists to take care of their children for them, can develop their individual strengths with peace of mind and make different contributions to society. According to educational surveys, the difference in intelligence and interest between men and women, the difference between the same gender is significantly greater than the difference between the two genders. This indicates that there is a difference between intelligence and stupidity among women, just as there is a difference between intelligence and stupidity among men. Why should we say that women's duty is in the home? As Chen Mingjun said, "Managing housework and taking care of children is also a career," but precisely because it is a career, those who engage in this career must have specialized training. We should encourage a group of women who are particularly interested in children to receive specialized knowledge and training in childcare and to take on the great responsibility of childcare for society. This is truly division of labor and cooperation.

Fight Together

Second, from the perspective of the needs of the country and society, women, who account for half of the population, cannot be ignored in any country, especially in China, which is striving for freedom, independence, and liberation. At the current stage of our efforts, every additional person joining the national liberation movement will bring us one step closer to the final goal. The arduous work of building a new China requires the participation of more than 200 million women to be effective. Any attempt to encourage women to linger in the small circle of the family is doomed to failure. Because in the 1940s of the twentieth century, not only conscious women are no longer willing to entrust their fate to the hands of others, but conscious men have also recognized that women's interests are consistent with the interests of the nation and the interests of the public. The women's problem, like the unemployment problem, is one of the problems caused by an unreasonable social system. Women and men no longer stand in opposition. In the struggle for national liberation and the realization of an ideal society, they are partners fighting together. In order to promote the early realization of national liberation, women must be liberated from the trivial matters of family childcare and engage in the great cause of national liberation, serving as the vanguard of the construction of a new China. The women's liberation movement must be carried out simultaneously with the national liberation struggle.

Group Living

Third, we all know that the first few years of a child's life, the so-called pre-school age, has a very great impact on the entire life of an individual. A child's future health, habits, and attitudes largely depend on whether the parents' methods of education at this time are appropriate. From a material perspective, children need sufficient nutrition, sunlight, air, large spaces, and various toys that can exercise their bodies, develop their intelligence, and stimulate their imaginations. However, how many families can provide children with such an ideal growing environment? Speaking of the psychological environment, few parents have ever studied child education and psychology, and they have no understanding of the nature and needs of children. They are either too strict or too indulgent. Children who grow up in such an environment will hardly become well-balanced, healthy individuals. If parents want their children to grow into healthy individuals, it is best to let them grow up in collective living from an early age. Here, the group referred to is the nursery that accommodates infants from shortly after birth to four years of age. In it, there are specially trained nurses, doctors, nannies, and educators. These people understand the problems and needs of children better than mothers. All the facilities and material environment of the nursery are also most suitable for children's growth process. With such an ideal nursery, which mother would not be willing to send her children to be raised by experts for the sake of their happiness?

Run Nurseries

I feel that the problem that urgently needs to be solved at present is not whether women should come out of the family and engage in various social activities, because in today's struggle for national liberation, women cannot but come out to work hard. Our current problem is how to arouse people in society to have a clear and profound understanding of the value of nurseries, and at the same time, how to unite those who already have an understanding of this issue to voluntarily contribute money and effort to launch a nursery movement. We must hurry up to train a group of childcare talents and establish several large-scale model nurseries, so that this great movement can spread throughout Shanghai and even throughout China. (I heard that the Shanghai YWCA will have plans to open nurseries in the near future. This may be the harbinger of a large-scale nursery movement. We hope it will be realized soon.)

Equality and Mutual Assistance

Finally, I want to say that I hope that men do not intentionally or unintentionally harbor feudal "male-centered" thoughts and consciousness. The relationship between husband and wife should be based on the principle of equality and mutual assistance. Wives should assist their husbands in succeeding in their careers, and husbands should also encourage their wives to work hard in their careers. I am not opposed to a wife "quickly recovering her husband from fatigue after work, or revitalizing him from disappointment and frustration in his career." However, husbands should also fulfill the same obligations to their wives, otherwise they have no right to make such demands. At the same time, I also hope that wives and mothers do not only see the family as our paradise. We must broaden our horizons and expand our scope of activities to create a happy future for ourselves and mankind!

Hawthorne's Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Hawthorne didn't answer, but nodded slightly. He then asked, "I have one more question to ask you. Last night, when your car passed the Lilan's house, besides seeing Zhao Boxiong's back figure crouching outside the short wall, did you hear any other people?"

Yu Gantang hesitated and said, "Nothing. I only saw the lights on in her reception room. —Ah, I remember, it seemed like there was a car parked on the west side of her house."

"What color was the car? Was there anyone in the car?"

"I didn't pay attention to that, I can't say."

"You certainly wouldn't have seen anyone in Lilan's reception room at that time either."

"That's right, I didn't see them because the car was driving very fast."

Hearing this, Hawthorne stood up. "Alright, you can go now. We'll talk about other things later."

Xu San, who had been sitting there listlessly for a long time, also stood up and stretched his back.

Yu Gantang also stood up, his eyes widened, and he said in surprise, "Mr. Hawthorne, are you letting me go free?"

Hawthorne shook his head. "No, I'm telling you to go back to the police station."

Yu Gantang was disappointed again. "Mr. Hawthorne, since you believe I didn't commit the crime, why don't you let me go free?"

Hawthorne's face darkened, and he replied, "Freedom? Is it that easy? Do you now know the value of freedom? But it's too late. You're an intellectual, how could you do such absurd, degenerate, and almost suicidal things? How can you not pay the price?"

Yu Gantang pleaded, "Mr. Hawthorne, now I understand. I'm determined to be a good person from now on. Since I didn't kill anyone—"

Hawthorne interrupted, "You at least had the intention to kill." He turned to the detective and said, "Brother Xu San, take him back to the station. If Detective Ni is preparing to question Zhao Boxiong, please notify me, I'd like to listen as well."

Xu San nodded, then pursed his lips at Yu Gantang, telling him to go first. The young man dejectedly walked towards the door of the office. But before he could walk out the door, Xu San suddenly stepped forward and reached out to stop him.

Xu San said, "Wait a minute, I have one more thing to say. Mr. Hawthorne, Detective Ni instructed me to inform you that Lu Jiansheng has explained why he didn't go to Yangzi last night. He was playing mahjong at another girlfriend's house, located at 9 Dagu Road, surnamed Gan, but this is a secret. When he left, he repeatedly asked Detective Ni to plead with you not to publish his matter in the newspaper. Detective Ni has already agreed to him." (133)

A Precious Birthday Gift

Nelson Eddy, the star of "The Merry Widow," spent weeks inserting thirty-nine candles into his birthday cake. Someone must have spread the word, as Nelson received many congratulatory notes and gifts: hundreds of phone calls and telegrams, over fourteen thousand cards, a pile of gifts (mostly firecrackers), and a child who personally brought a gift to congratulate him. When Nelson met the child in the reception room, the child said without hesitation, "All your records are here, I don't need to say anything more, they've already said what I wanted to say for me." It turned out that the child had collected all of Nelson's records from films and radio performances in the past three years, making it a truly precious gift.

### Commemorating Revolutionary Artist Pan Yueqiao (Part 2)

— By Sick Dove

The Battle of Shanghai

In August of the Xinhai year, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. He was in Shanghai, his heart burning. Knowing the strategic importance of Shanghai and that the potential revolutionary force had surged to its peak, after years of preparation, the time was ripe. On the night of September 13th, amidst the bleak autumn wind and rain, he led three thousand people including police and merchants to the Shanghai Arsenal, launching a fierce attack as if facing a formidable enemy. At that time, the people in the bureau had been influenced by the revolutionary forces, and their thoughts were inclined towards the new government, so they hesitated and waited with their hands tied. Yueqiao saw through the opponent's weakness, stepped forward in the face of the crowd, and explained the great cause. Sure enough, in an instant, enemies turned into friends, and they stopped resisting. At that critical moment, Yueqiao detoured to the rear, set fire to start a fight, and cheers erupted. They poured in like bees, with blood flowing everywhere and countless corpses. He led the crowd, advancing bravely, injured in the arms and legs in several places, but his spirit did not diminish. After the entire situation was under control, he returned to the headquarters. He recounted the details of the attack to the crowd, tirelessly, with fresh blood flowing from his clothes, his whole body red, yet he still talked eloquently, unaware of his pain. Afterwards, some praised his courage. He said, "At that time, I had already given my life to the country, and had long forgotten myself. Revolution is a sacrifice, this is nothing." These words were so慷慨激昂. After the matter was settled, Chen Qimei supervised the Shanghai army and awarded him the position of Minister of Investigation. He smiled and declined, still devoting himself to the stage, using his life to advocate and do his beloved drama life.

Destroying the Home to Alleviate Difficulties

At that time, the revolutionary atmosphere had spread throughout the country. In Fengtian, the revolutionary hero Lan Tianwei, due to the failure of the uprising, came to Shanghai to raise military funds. He saw this news in the newspaper and hurried to the inn to visit him. They hit it off immediately. He immediately threw out thirty thousand gold to let him try to carry out great undertaking again. This kind of豪舉 to donate generously was also a masterpiece of his life. He once said that my friend, is for the country, friendship is important, the country is even more important. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was recognized by Li Yuanhong and served as brigade commander, mixed brigade commander, salt patrol commander, unified tax bureau chief, and water police chief. However, because of his upright nature, he repeatedly encountered dangers. He was once controlled by Zheng Ruicheng, and then again faced danger from Shen Hongying. Although he managed to escape from danger, his family property was destroyed from then on. In his entire life, he devoted himself to the revolutionary cause, going forward bravely, indomitable, with both spirit and perseverance worthy of admiration. In his later years, he returned to his old career and dedicated himself to the stage. It can be seen that the official career is complicated, and how can he get the freedom of an actor.
