Chinese forces continued their pursuit and annihilation. On the evening of the 23rd, they drove a portion of the escaping Japanese troops, as well as a portion of the Japanese troops who had rushed from Gaochun and Jurong to reinforce, completely into the area between the two large lakes of Shijiu and Gucheng, subjecting them to a swift encirclement and annihilation.

### Chinese Side Expresses Determination to Continue Resistance Until Final Victory is Achieved

Chongqing: A Chinese spokesman here today emphatically denied reports that the National Government intends to use Wang Kemin and Wang Jingwei as intermediaries to negotiate peace with Japan. This news is clearly Japanese propaganda. The National Government has long been determined to continue resistance until China achieves final victory. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Chongqing: China's peace conditions for the current war were first specifically articulated today in a special commentary published in the Ta Kung Pao, which stated that the following six unchangeable principles are essential for adjusting the new Sino-Japanese relationship: (1) China's territorial sovereignty must be complete, including the return of the four northeastern provinces and expired leased territories such as Lushun and Dalian to China. (2) Unequal treaties concluded between the two countries since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 must be abolished, including Japan's rights to establish concessions, factories, and inland waterway navigation in China. (3) China, in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's policies, welcomes foreign investment for economic development. Japan should enjoy equal rights with any other major power. All Japanese investments in China, such as the South Manchuria Railway, the Fushun Coal Mine, and the Anshan Iron Mine, must be fundamentally reorganized in accordance with Chinese law, and then be subject to legitimate supervision and protection by the Chinese government. (4) China will conclude a commercial treaty with Japan to promote international trade. Japanese citizens in China must abide by Chinese law and be subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts. (5) The resolution of the Korean and Taiwanese issues must be based on the principle of national self-determination. (6) Regarding the unequal treatment of East Asian peoples in the international community, China will unite with Japan to strive together for international justice and equality in international conferences. The newspaper continued, stating that any secret agreement between Japan and Wang Jingwei will never resolve the various issues between the two countries, and will only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to resist. China has always had sympathy and understanding for Japan's aspirations. Even if Japan's military adventures in China collapse, the Japanese nation will still exist. However, Japan's policies must be based on its historical and geographical situation, which is conducive to the development of its fishing, shipping, industry, and international trade. If China achieves victory, Japan need not fear Chinese retaliation, as China is only fighting for its territorial sovereignty and is not opposed to economic cooperation with Japan. China will not recognize Japan's special privileges in China, but it must take into account the historical and geographical conditions between the two countries. The newspaper concluded that if Japanese industrial and commercial enterprises can achieve legitimate expansion, its population problem can be automatically resolved. The various ethnic groups along the Pacific coast are all young and vigorous, and the progress of modern transportation will promote closer ties with each other. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Lanzhou: Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on Bazibulong on the evening of the 20th, bravely charging into the Japanese positions, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and annihilating over 200 Japanese troops. The Japanese forces were unable to withstand the assault and retreated in disarray towards Xishanzui and other places. Chinese forces then recovered Bazibulong at 2:00 AM on the 21st, and divided their forces to pursue the retreating Japanese troops. Bazibulong is located east of Wuyuan and is the most important stronghold on the Baowu Road. Now that it has been captured by Chinese forces, the Baowu Road has been completely cut off.

Editorial

### The Precarious Japanese Political Situation

The incident of Saito Takao's controversial remarks, which triggered a political storm in Japan, will be reviewed at the end of the month during a Diet session. The Japanese cabinet, following the military's wishes, firmly insists on expelling Saito from the Diet. This demand has received support from the Social Mass Party and the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai party, but the majority of Diet members seem to sympathize with Saito and oppose the proposal for expulsion. Saito himself has demonstrated his indomitable character, repeatedly defending the legitimacy of his remarks and arguing that there is no reason for him to be punished. Observers therefore predict that the cabinet's proposal will likely fail to secure the two-thirds majority support in the House of Representatives, potentially triggering another political crisis. The Yonai cabinet, which was formed less than two months ago, is facing this serious test. Regardless of whether the outcome is the Diet's submission or the cabinet's failure, both indicate the severity of the political crisis in Japan. This crisis, of course, did not begin recently, but has been operating beneath the surface for some time and is now gradually emerging.

According to constitutional norms, a representative's speech in the Diet enjoys absolute freedom. Regardless of whether the views are right or wrong, conforming or opposing, the executive branch has no right to interfere. Japan's constitutional government has never been fully sound from the beginning, and the political situation in the last ten years has deviated even further from the normal course of democracy. However, the privileges granted to Diet members by the constitution still exist, and there has been no fundamental change in the fundamental law. Therefore, an individual should not be punished for their speech. From this perspective, Saito and his sympathizers do indeed have a legal basis for their position. However, in reality, while Saito's speech represented the views of the Minseito party, and his opinions should be regarded as the party's views, the Minseito executives, fearing the military's displeasure, heartlessly expelled Saito first. At the same time, when Saito spoke in the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House did not deem it inappropriate and stop him from speaking. The government and the military also did not respond in a dignified manner according to normal procedures. After the dispute escalated, the Speaker revised the official record and handed Saito over to the Disciplinary Committee, while the government and the military demanded his expulsion. These disjointed phenomena, in addition to demonstrating that some people are fabricating illusions and stirring up political unrest, fully reveal the arrogance of the military, the timidity of political parties and the Diet, and the weakness of the government. Faced with this serious reality, apart from Saito himself, everyone is avoiding and fearing disaster, and few dare to look directly at the situation. Saito said afterwards that Japan has no politicians. This is not a retort, but an exposure of reality. On the other hand, the dissatisfaction and resentment of the Japanese people have been revealed to the world with the spread of the Saito incident. No matter how hard the Japanese authorities try to cover up and suppress it, this emotion will undoubtedly become an important factor in Japan's future political trends, playing a major role.

Looking at recent public and private comments within Japan, there is almost a common criticism of the government, which is dissatisfaction with the authorities' secret and autocratic policies. For example, Togo Tairou criticized the government's excessive and inappropriate control over speech; Baba Tsunego pointed out that the government has not consulted with the people on anything from the beginning; in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Diet member Makino denounced Army Minister Hata as cowardly for refusing to explain the use of military expenditures under the pretext of military secrets; even the Kokumin Shimbun, a mouthpiece of the military, attacked the government for keeping everything secret from the people, so that the people have no way to "jointly move towards the completion of the incident"; especially Saito Takao, his interpellation speech in the House of Representatives on the 2nd of this month, although the surface text spoke for the aggressors, its most important opinion was to demand that the authorities answer the questions that the Japanese people are most worried about—this is also the main reason why he was attacked—in his subsequent self-defense, he attributed all the difficulties to the authorities' "keeping everything secret." It can be seen that a trend of attacking the government's autocratic secrecy is currently spreading in Japanese society, and at the same time, it is expressing a lack of trust in the authorities and their policies. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese people have been consistently deceived and blinded by the military, tightening their belts to support the aggression. Their original wish was only to improve their own environment and living conditions through external expansion. However, in the past eight or nine years—especially since the War of Resistance, the war has expanded step by step, and life has become more and more difficult. They have only seen resources being requisitioned and casualties mounting, and the golden dream they longed for has in fact given them the opposite answer. Those who are envied and regarded as exceptions by the general public are only the military-industrial capitalists who have become rich in the war, the poor becoming rich overnight, extremely enjoying pleasure and debauchery; this forms a clear contrast with the hardship and misery of the general population. At this stage, the people naturally turn to doubting the fundamental premise of the invasion of China, criticizing the government's autocracy, and demanding that the authorities explain everything from the beginning. The reason why the military insists on expelling Saito is to suppress this unstable trend among the people. However, now that the army is old and exhausted and is fighting enemies at home and abroad, if the Japanese authorities do not have the determination to turn back from the brink and fundamentally repent, but continue to muddle through, the superficial suppression will only increase the depth of internal collapse. The Saito incident itself may soon come to an end in ambiguity, but the political unrest in Japan cannot be eased as a result, and will only make the final reckoning in the future even more serious! We sincerely expect Japan to turn back from the brink and fundamentally repent, but the deteriorating trend will inevitably be threatened by the consequences of aggression and will be beyond redemption!

### Difficult Handling of the Saito Incident: Major Crisis in the Japanese Political Situation; Saito Insists on Demanding the Publication of the Full Text of His Speech, His Just and Forcible Demands Receive Widespread Public Support

Tokyo: Saito, who was found guilty for criticizing the Konoe statement, told Japanese reporters today that "I have not changed my belief in my speech. Some of the public regard me as opposing the 'holy war,' but in fact it is not the case at all. If they read the full text of my speech, they will suddenly realize this. Therefore, I hope that the full text of my speech should be made public as soon as possible. Some newspapers in the mainland have published the second half of my speech, but in various cities, all publication has been prohibited. At the same time, all kinds of attacks against me are completely fabricated and blind. In order to correct public opinion, I hope that the full text will be published as soon as possible, otherwise Japan is not a constitutional country. In the UK, if Lloyd George delivered an anti-war speech, then Prime Minister Chamberlain could answer him in Parliament and indicate the path that the people should take. I am now attending the Disciplinary Committee to answer some of the questions of the committee members, to prove that my beliefs have not changed in the slightest. If they have any questions for me, I will answer them frankly. I have now received countless letters of encouragement from all over the country, and the number of these letters is now gradually increasing. The people in my constituency are all encouraging me to continue to insist on my beliefs even after leaving the Minseito party. Therefore, I have the support of a wide range of the public. If I am expelled from the Diet, then in 194*, I will still participate in the election according to my beliefs, so I firmly believe that I will be able to re-enter the Diet." (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo: Last night, it was generally believed that the Disciplinary Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday afternoon, with two hours of intense debate. Saito Takao, a member of the Minseito party, demanded the publication of the full text of his speech to the Diet on February 2nd, and insisted that he did not slander the "holy war." The Disciplinary Committee will study the minutes of the Diet session on Sunday. It is generally expected that the Disciplinary Committee will decide Saito Takao's fate on the 29th after studying the minutes. The military and the right wing of the Diet are still demanding Saito's expulsion. According to the opinions of the political problem authors of the Kokumin Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun, the number of those in the Diet who support Saito's speech has increased, and it is believed that Saito will not be expelled from the Diet. The Kokumin Shimbun claimed that in the past few days, most Diet members have felt that the punishment of expelling Saito seems too severe, so they believe that Saito should generally be subjected to a temporary suspension from attending. Some members of the Minseito party who support Saito have threatened other members who oppose Saito, saying that if they promote Saito's expulsion movement, they will not hesitate to leave the Minseito party. Therefore, the leaders of the party feel that unless they stop demanding Saito's expulsion, a split within the party will be unavoidable. The newspaper also said that Saito's refusal to withdraw his speech and his vigorous defense have won the support of most Diet members. The newspaper blamed this dispute on the government, stating that if the government could give Saito a powerful answer, then the government could be expected to win huge support, and at the same time, it could take this opportunity to explain some of the problems to the people, which is what responsible politicians have not explained in detail. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo: Regarding the issue of whether or not to publish the deleted part of the minutes of Saito Takao's slip of the tongue problem, the Minseito party held an executive meeting in the Diet on the 24th after the Disciplinary Committee ended, and the result of the consultation was that in order to make a decision on the problem of punishing Saito, the minutes of the slip of the tongue problem, which is the key to the problem, must be used as the basis for judgment. Therefore, the Minseito party expressed this purpose to all factions. At this time, when there is a question of distributing the deleted minutes of Saito's speech to the Diet members at a minimum in order to provide information for solving the Saito problem, the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai party and the Social Mass Party expressed their agreement. The Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai party and the Jikyoku Doshikai party agreed to consider it. Therefore, a factional negotiation meeting will be held at 1:30 PM on the 26th to discuss the most important issue of solving the Saito problem, which is to distribute the deleted minutes to each Diet member for reference. (Domei dispatch, 24th)

### Wartime Trade Issues: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Reach a Compromise in Principle

London: The Times reported on Sunday that Japanese trade has been affected to some extent after Britain and France blockaded German export trade. The British and Japanese governments have held talks on this matter, and it is reported that the difficulties have been satisfactorily resolved in principle, but there are still some technical issues that need to be carefully considered. In any case, the two Japanese ships currently docked in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Genoa, Italy, should be able to leave in the short term. As for the issue of the British Navy capturing Germans on the Japanese ship "Asama Maru," which has been negotiated between Britain and Japan for a long time, it is also about to be resolved. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Netherlands and Japan Negotiate a New Arbitration Treaty: Negotiations Underway in Tokyo

London: The Times reported on Sunday that the Japanese government has been negotiating with the Dutch ambassador to Japan for several days. It is reported that the goal is to establish a treaty with a wider scope (the arbitration and reconciliation treaty previously signed between Japan and the Netherlands in 1533 has been declared abolished by Japan) in order to adjust the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Japan should clearly state in this treaty that it has no territorial ambitions for Dutch territories. It is generally believed that the Dutch government's expansion of its fleet in the Far East and the strengthening of the defense of the Dutch East Indies have had a considerable impact on Japan's intentions. The reason why the country is trying to establish an understanding with the Netherlands is probably because of this. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Results of Japanese Invasion of China Deeply Affecting Social Inner Layers: Number of Delinquent Youths and Juvenile Crimes Increase, Elementary School Teachers Owed Salaries and Resigning One After Another

Tokyo: According to a report in the Diet this Sunday, there are currently at least 100,000 delinquent youths wandering around Japan, some of whom were produced after the outbreak of the China Incident. According to House of Representatives member Tanaka, since the outbreak of the war, juvenile crime in Japan has greatly increased. The reason is that since the outbreak of the war, people from all over the country have moved to work in urban arms factories. These parents are too busy working during the day to manage their children, so most children take risks and commit crimes. At present, this situation is becoming increasingly serious. The government should allocate funds to establish more reform schools to give delinquent youths a chance to reform. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo: In 77 prefectures and cities in Japan, the authorities are unable to pay the salaries of public elementary school teachers. Most teachers, due to long-term salary arrears, have difficulty making a living, so they have resigned one after another. The most common career change is to work in arms factories, which has led to a shortage of teachers in various elementary schools. In view of this, the government has recently decided to increase the amount of local primary education funds borne by the central government in order to remedy the situation. In the past, the government bore about 80 million yen per year. In the future, it will be increased to half of the total amount. This measure will be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval in the short term. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Chongqing: According to news received here today, a Japanese aircraft was circling in the sky over Wanxian, east of Chongqing, this morning, but it did not drop any bombs and appeared to be engaged in reconnaissance. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### Announcement by the Military Affairs Commission: War Situation of the Past Week, February 17th to 23rd

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that after suffering major blows from our forces, the Japanese troops in Henan, Guangxi, and Suiyuan have been collapsing and retreating in disarray. The area near Nanning is now completely under our control. Although the remaining Japanese forces have repeatedly made futile attempts to stir up trouble, they have been repelled each time, proving that the Japanese army has no fighting capability at all and is vulnerable to attack. Their exaggerated and false propaganda has been completely shattered by us. The major achievements of the past week are summarized as follows:

Guinan: After our troops completed annihilation battles in Binyang, Wuming, Shanglin, and other places, they pursued the enemy all the way to both sides of Gaofeng Pass, successively capturing Gaofeng Pass and nearby Dashan. The vanguard troops advanced to Shicen near Yutang on the Yongwu Road, while another unit reached Xianbi Village. On the Yongbin Road, they successively captured the Eighth, Seventh, Sixth, Fifth, and Fourth Tangs, forcing the enemy to retreat to the area of Zhantu, Cenhe, and Jiangxu. Part of the remaining Japanese forces collapsed and gathered in Nanning, while another part continued to retreat south of Nanning. They were again fiercely intercepted by us on both sides of the Yongbin Road, causing them great damage. By the 21st, the entire area between Xiaodong and Datang had been recovered by us. On the 21st, the Japanese troops who had gathered in Nanning launched an offensive of more than 2,000 troops westward, attempting to contain us. On the evening of the 22nd, part of the Japanese troops reached the vicinity of Quli Market (west of Funan), where they were encircled and completely defeated by us. There is now no trace of the Japanese army near Funan.

Suixi: For days, our troops have been sweeping the outskirts of Wuyuan in a blitzkrieg manner, successively capturing strongholds such as Wujiadi, Yiqiao Gezi (all southwest of Wuyuan), etc. The remaining Japanese troops are collapsing and retreating eastward, where they are being intercepted by us on the southern foot of the Wula Mountain and the eastern section of the Baowu Highway, resulting in numerous enemy casualties. A portion of the Japanese forces have been surrounded by us and cannot escape, retreating back into the city of Wuyuan. Another portion simultaneously fled back to Wuzhen, attempting to hold out for reinforcements. In addition to monitoring the remaining Japanese troops trapped in Wuyuan and Wuzhen, our troops are advancing rapidly eastward to jointly attack the Japanese nest. The Japanese are stretched thin and are in a desperate situation, with an annihilation battle underway.

South Bank of the Qiantang River: The battle, which began on the 17th, continued with our troops advancing until the 21st, when it took a sudden turn. The Japanese troops in Kanshan, Yaqian, Qianqing, and other areas, after suffering heavy blows from us, collapsed and retreated towards Xiaoshan, and all these places were completely recovered. The remaining Japanese troops on the west bank of the Puyang River have been completely cleared. After capturing Linpu, our troops advanced victoriously towards Xiaoshan. The remaining Japanese troops in the city were extremely panicked. In total, in this battle, more than 2,500 Japanese soldiers were killed, four rapid-fire guns, twelve heavy machine guns, hundreds of warhorses, countless rifles, sabers, and various military supplies were seized. The Japanese attempt to expand the war to the outskirts of Xiaoshan has once again turned out to be a pipe dream. The remaining Japanese troops trapped in Xiaoshan are like turtles in a jar, isolated and weak, and powerless. (To be continued)

### Japanese Troops Fleeing from the Foothills of Dahong Mountain, Traffic on the Yun River Controlled, Chinese Forces Intensify Encirclement of Maping County, Japanese Boats Near Pinglin Destroyed

The fighting has been very fierce for the past three days and is still ongoing. Traffic on the Yun River is now controlled by the Chinese army. At noon on the 21st, eighteen Japanese wooden boats sailing from Anlu to Maping were completely destroyed by the Chinese army near Pinglin, resulting in heavy losses for the Japanese army. (24th Dispatch)

Fancheng: The Chinese army in Hubei continues to attack the Japanese army for days, achieving great success. The Japanese are fleeing in disarray. The highway from Suixian to Anlu has been cut into several sections by the Chinese army. The Chinese army advanced to the outskirts of Anlu on the night before last, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese throughout the night, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated into the city, which is now being besieged by the Chinese army. The fighting near Jingshan between the Chinese and Japanese armies is very intense, with the Japanese suffering heavy losses and facing annihilation. (25th Dispatch)

### Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Attacks Zhangdian Town

Luoyang: There are still no major battles in southern Shanxi, but the Chinese army units are quite active. On the night of the 17th, a certain unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the bright moonlight to attack Zhangzhen (southeast of Anyun).

They were fiercely counterattacked by the combined Chinese infantry and artillery, resulting in heavy casualties for the Japanese and greatly diminished morale. (25th Dispatch)

### Japan's Finances Exhausted, Considering Issuing Lottery Tickets, Beautifully Named "Patriotic Bonds"

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Finance has drafted a plan for national lottery tickets, beautifully naming them Patriotic Bonds. According to the Asahi Shimbun, small-denomination "Patriotic Bonds" will be sold. These bonds will not bear interest and can be redeemed in the distant future. The plan will be discussed by the parliament in the near future. It is claimed that this plan can prevent inflation. (25th United Press Dispatch)

### Hitler Delivers a Speech, Outlining the Principles of Leadership and Struggle, Guaranteeing the Security of National Living Space, Demanding the Return of Germany's Old Colonies, and Recognizing the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan as Friends of Germany

Munich: Führer Hitler delivered a speech at eight o'clock last night (that is, three o'clock in the morning on February 25th, Shanghai time) at the memorial hall of the Nazi Party's uprising. Some veteran party members, all in uniform, rushed back from the front to listen. After an introduction by Wagner, the leader of the Nazi Party's provincial party department, Hitler began his speech, declaring:

During the World War, Germany was not conquered, but only deceived by the belief in reorganizing the world. The result was the Treaty of Versailles, which took the distinction between victory and defeat as the basis of world order, granting all rights to the victors and exploiting the defeated countries as much as possible, especially Germany. Germany at that time was indeed in a state of complete despair. However, all subsequent developments were not without the result of despair. Hitler then described the chaotic situation of Germany under democracy, as well as the unaffordable political reparations. He then discussed Germany's mission in Central Europe, claiming that Germany, due to its position in Central Europe, had the responsibility to solve this arduous task. To achieve this goal, political power must be concentrated, and public opinion must be unified. In other words, there must be a nation united by the national will, supporting a supreme and omnipotent government, before we can begin to solve this problem. When I first advocated new political ideas, I represented tens of millions of Germans. I knew that after the collapse of the old Germany and the old system, a new world could be produced. Therefore, after the governments of Marxism, the federal forms of government, political doctrines, and social classes were successively overthrown, a Germany based on the will of the German people could emerge. This Germany of the people, which was announced here twenty years ago, means nothing else but the revival of Germany and the integration of nationalism and socialism.

Hitler continued, "I have a creed regarding the necessity of our nation's life, that is, a peace agreement. If anyone wants to use violence to obstruct our peaceful development, then we will also use violence to fight back. This is the principle of my leadership and struggle. In 1933, we had the opportunity to implement everything we had said. This is the Nazi Party's coming to power. Anyone who is fair would say that it is a miracle for the German people. In recent years, how has the party achieved, has German culture progressed, has the number of unemployed decreased, these are all facts that are there, no need to say more. International politicians may blame Germany for not expanding its military. It must be known that Germany did not want to expand its military in the first place. Seeing that other countries were planning to attack us again, we had no choice but to make an unprecedented expansion. Democratic countries own a large part of the world's territory, and they cannot even solve the problem of domestic unemployment, yet they shout the slogan of reorganizing Europe. In fact, Germany has already reorganized. The work of reorganizing Europe will never be entrusted to democratic countries. I know that my struggle today violates the provisions and spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, because according to the Treaty of Versailles, the world should be ruled by two or three countries. Germany has always opposed this doctrine of democratic politics and financial oligarchies. On the contrary, the German nation puts forward two moderate demands as follows:

(1) The security of the "living space." The so-called living space of the German nation refers to the territory in the world that has been developed culturally or economically by the German nation. Central Europe is the living space of the German nation, and no infringement, threat, or resistance from any side is allowed.

(2) The German nation and I demand the return of the property stolen from us. This request is the limit of our hope and does not endanger Britain and France. But since I have decided to take it back, I will never give up halfway. I hope that Churchill, Cooper, Eden, Chamberlain, and Bailey Xia understand Germany's intentions. When Churchill said that he hated me, I said to him, "Mr. Churchill, thank you very much." When Chamberlain said that he did not believe me, I also replied, "Mr. Chamberlain, thank you very much. What do I care about the hatred and jealousy of the enemy?"

Hitler then mentioned that in the Great War, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy were all enemies of Germany, but today they are all friends of Germany. Finally, Hitler strongly emphasized the excellent morale and the strength of the German people, and the strength of the economy. He concluded by saying, "I believe that permanent peace will eventually be realized, and Germany will definitely win in this war." (25th Haitong News Agency)

London: British officials believe that Hitler's remarks are not worth commenting on. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington: People here are mostly listening intently to the English translation of Hitler's speech broadcast by radio. It seems that they are paying more attention to Hitler's speech than to the British Prime Minister's speech, because the British position is well known to the world, while the German intentions are not well understood. Listeners pointed out that Hitler's remarks were a shout of abuse against Britain. Some people expressed the opinion that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is now traveling in Europe on a peace mission. Soon Hitler will meet with him. Hitler's remarks are in fact the opening act of this conversation. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### Northern European Countries Value the British Prime Minister's Speech, Britain and France Do Not Want to Set Peace Terms The Northern European Countries Are Very Satisfied With This Point

Denmark: British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday has aroused close attention from the Scandinavian countries. Several points mentioned by the British Prime Minister are timely. The Prime Minister's clear statement on Britain's war aims, especially the statement that Britain and France do not want to set peace terms themselves, is extremely welcomed by the Scandinavian countries. The Scandinavian countries have always believed that the work of establishing a permanent European peace after the war should be discussed with them. The section of the British Prime Minister's speech mentioning the difficult situation of the small countries bordering Germany has aroused special attention in Denmark, and the British Prime Minister's clear explanation of Britain's attitude towards the Altmark incident also conforms to the common sense of the Scandinavian countries. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech yesterday has been commented on by various morning newspapers, which said that this is a response to German propaganda. However, the war goals of Britain and France have become more and more clear as a result. This speech, if compared with the one delivered by German leader Hitler four hours later, is worlds apart. The Star Chronicle stated, "The German side suddenly announced yesterday that its leader Hitler will deliver an important speech to the German people four hours after Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, which was originally expected. But what Hitler said was all old news, and what Britain's war goals are, Prime Minister Chamberlain has listed them all. Hitler replied, "What we want is security and our lifeline." Prime Minister Chamberlain has already denounced this as a lie, and cited the repeated speeches of German Minister of Aviation Goering and the country's Minister of Propaganda Goebbels to prove that the country's war goal is to destroy Britain and then dominate the world. Some people in our country, including so-called liberal intellectuals, have asked the government to explain the war goals, and Prime Minister Chamberlain has now given a clear answer." The Sunday Times said, regarding Hitler's speech, London officials said that there was no value in commenting on it, but Hitler's state of mind can be roughly seen from this. (25th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: All newspapers here have praised British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech yesterday, but the right-wing "I See" newspaper believes that although Mr. Zhang has clearly explained the difference between the war goals of Britain and France and Germany, the future problems of Europe have not been resolved. In the future, those responsible for negotiating new peace treaties must still focus on this, because in the past, British and French politicians were too kind-hearted and believed that Germany only needed to change its political system to become a peaceful and democratic country in one fell swoop. This is extremely wrong. If it is not corrected, the danger is very great. The Little Parisian newspaper said that Hitler claimed that Germany was strong enough to resist the blockade policy of Britain and France, which is self-deception. Judging from Hitler's roaring and irrational behavior at the end of his speech, the impression we get is that he knows that he has entered the devil's formation and hopes that there will be a miracle to help him extricate himself.

### Britain and France Train a Large Number of Land, Sea, and Air Forces, a Total of 8.5 Million People

London: According to a special dispatch here today, the New York Telegraph reported that Washington's dispatch stated that official statistics show that the Allied countries have trained a total of 8.5 million land, sea, and air force soldiers in order to deal with the German army in the spring war. It is estimated that the German strength totals 7.25 million people. The New York Times published an article "Allied Warships in the Arctic Ocean," saying that the Allied blockade has driven German merchant ships out of the high seas. Now, sending warships to appear in the Arctic Ocean shows that although the sea is wide, there is no safe place for German ships, or foreign ships can carry military supplies to supply blocked Germany.

### British Fascist Party Attempts to Lead Peace, Shouting Slogans During the British Prime Minister's Speech

London: When British Prime Minister Chamberlain was speaking in Birmingham yesterday, a person in the audience suddenly shouted, "We want Mosley to preside over peace." Mosley is the leader of the British Fascist Party. Chamberlain ignored him and continued to speak eloquently. When the speech was about to end, a woman shouted the same slogan. The woman was then driven out of the venue amidst the audience's condemnation. After the British Prime Minister finished his speech, the audience raised their hands to express their gratitude. Chamberlain replied that he felt that all the hard work and anxiety during the war were not as bad as before the war, when the war could still be averted. He was not old and had plenty of time. He hoped that he would still have the opportunity to devote his energy to peace work. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### Estonian Independence Anniversary, Authorities Express Willingness to Work for Peace, Soviet Pravda Publishes Article of Congratulations

Ai Jing: Estonia celebrated its twentieth anniversary of independence yesterday. A military parade was held here. The capital's garrison and volunteer corps participated. President Bartels gave a speech, stating that the Estonian government has avoided participating in the war, and Estonia should try its best to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Prime Minister Ulos declared at a reception for distinguished guests in the afternoon that Estonia had shown a spirit of loving peace when it was founded, and later continued to work hard to restore friendly relations with neighboring countries and maintain its neutral policy. This diplomatic approach has now proved its correctness. Ulos also recounted the achievements of the Estonian people in politics, economy, and culture. (25th Haitong Telegraph)

Moscow: On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of Estonian independence, Pravda commented, "The Estonian people are celebrating their 22nd anniversary of independence in a peaceful atmosphere. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, small countries neighboring the Soviet Union, no longer have to worry about the war crisis in Western Europe. The Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country and has now removed the threat of war from the Baltic countries and ensured the security of these small countries. The Estonian people are aware of the facts of British and French imperialist interference in Estonia's internal affairs. War provocateurs have attempted to establish a base for attacking the Soviet Union in the Baltic countries (including Estonia) more than once. But those who attempt to use Estonia as a tool to attack the Soviet Union have failed. In the past 20 years, Soviet-Estonian economic and political relations have become closer and closer. This improvement in relations is based on the common interests of both sides and the desire of both sides to consolidate peace. The most obvious evidence of Soviet-Estonian friendship is the mutual assistance treaty signed by both sides, which is of great help to the permanent peace of Eastern Europe. The Soviet people are very pleased with Estonia's success. On the occasion of the 12th anniversary of patriotism, the Soviet people wish Estonia a bright future with great sincerity."

### Germany and Italy Sign New Economic Agreement, Germany Exchanges Coal for Industrial Raw Materials, New Commercial Treaty Between Italy and Turkey Also Signed

(25th United Press Dispatch)

Rome: The commercial negotiations between Germany and Italy on stipulating the conditions for barter trade this year have yielded satisfactory results yesterday. The Italian official communiqué solemnly stated that Mussolini himself paid close attention to the progress of the past negotiations and repeatedly issued pertinent instructions. The agreement on border traffic between the two countries is stated separately. (25th Haitong Telegraph)

Rome: German Foreign Ministry Economic Director Clodius has signed a new economic agreement with representatives of the Italian government. Well-informed sources here commented that this agreement is extremely important to the relationship between Germany and Italy. Germany has requested that the economic agreement signed by the two countries in 1938 be extended to the two protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as the occupied areas of Poland. Although this has not been implemented, Germany can then purchase goods from the Italian market, especially food and certain raw materials that are necessary for the country's industry, and the quantity can be increased. In Italy, it can purchase the coal it needs from Germany, which can generally increase by 200,000 tons per month compared to the past. However, since German exports have now been blockaded by Britain and France, the transportation must be undertaken by Italy itself and must be transported by rail. In short, Italy can purchase an additional 3 million tons of coal from Germany each year in the future, so that its reliance on Britain will be reduced compared to the past and it can obtain greater freedom of action.

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Three Nordic Countries to Discuss Naval Warfare Issues, Finnish Observer Attends

London - The foreign ministers of the three Nordic countries are scheduled to meet today in the capital of Denmark. Danish Foreign Minister Munch told a special correspondent of the here today, "The main issues on the agenda for this meeting include the current naval warfare being waged by the belligerent countries. Regarding the 'Altmark' case, we will discuss the issue of territorial waters. In other words, we must find new ways to inspect merchant ships of neutral countries. For example, the Swiss Confederation inspects the cargo of its ships before they set sail. We should use this as a model. In short, the Scandinavian countries believe that warships are now no different from pirate ships, and international law has been put on the shelf. Considering only Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, we have lost 150 ships and 800 sailors since the outbreak of the European war." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Gathering of Large Armies by Britain and France in the Near East, Seeming to Have Intentions of Expanding the War: Commentary from Soviet Pravda

Moscow - Today's Pravda carries a commentary titled "Rumormongers Have Fallen into Straits," commenting on the new attempt by Britain and France to expand the war. The newspaper says, "Recently, British and French imperialists are again preparing to expand the war, while British and French newspapers are using false reports to cover up this preparation, saying that the Soviet Union is very active in the Caucasus and intends to attack Turkey and Iran. But these rumormongers are contradicting themselves and cannot reconcile their claims. For example, the Near East correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post reported that a Soviet offensive in the Caucasus or Central Asia is highly unlikely. The correspondent learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking Turkey and Iran, and there are currently no signs of Soviet troops concentrating on the Iranian or Afghan border.

Pravda claims that the Soviet Union has not fortified the Caucasus, but Britain and France have fortified Kars and Ardahan on behalf of Turkey. Agence Havas recently inadvertently revealed in a radio broadcast that British officers and engineers have arrived in Edirne (an important city in northern Turkey) and the Dardanelles. In Syria, an army has been established under the command of French General Weygand, while Britain has also established a Near East army in Egypt. Troops are being transported from India to Iraq. In short, Britain and France have established a huge army in the Near East. The British and French bloc is now continuing the dangerous work of expanding the war. British and French newspapers are fabricating news poorly and have fallen into straits." (TASS dispatch, 25th)

### Sweden Departs from the Gold Standard, New York Not Surprised, Forex Market Unaffected

New York - Prices in the New York foreign exchange market were not affected by the news that Sweden had departed from the gold standard.

Treasury officials expressed the view that Sweden, being adjacent to the belligerent countries, had previously implemented measures to restrict the purchase and sale of gold, and this move is somewhat of an inevitable consequence of the restriction measures. The closing prices of telegraphic transfers of major European countries in the New York market are recorded as follows: London $3.75875 (yesterday $3.9625), Paris $2.24125 (yesterday $2.245), Sweden unchanged at $23.82.

### New York Newspaper Seeks Terms of Endearment for Couples

Associated Press, New York - The New York "Daily News" recently solicited terms of endearment for couples from readers in its supplement. Many people responded enthusiastically. One respondent, signing himself as Li Ben, is a Chinese man who owns a large restaurant in Chinatown, New York. His answer provides an explanation for the emancipation of women, stating, "In the past, when I was in China, couples did not use nicknames to address each other. The husband was the head of the family, and whenever he had something to say to his wife, he would simply call out 'Hey.' His wife would respond very respectfully. But Chinese living in America now address each other as 'Hey.'" The increasing Americanization of Chinese women in the United States is evident in this.

The incident was reported to the wife of American automobile king Henry Ford, who was very sympathetic, so she bought a car to give to Du Jun, which was a good story for a while. The following are the details.

Patriotic Child Donates to Help Disaster Relief

In early September of the 27th year of the Republic of China, Du Xingqiao, a patriotic child in this city, used his savings of 26 Philippine pesos to buy a large amount of bread and send it to the association's office, entrusting it to be forwarded to Shanghai to help wounded soldiers and refugees. The association believed that the bread could not be transported to Shanghai, so it sold it on the spot, calling it "patriotic bread." The overseas Chinese community rushed to buy it. In three days, more than 3,000 yuan was raised. This news spread to the United States and attracted the attention of many people. Ms. Guthrie, a former executive of the Philippine Young Women's Christian Association, recently mentioned this in a speech in the United States. Mrs. Henry Ford, the wife of automobile king Henry Ford, happened to be in the audience and was greatly moved when she heard about it. The next day, she gave Ms. Guthrie 20 US dollars and asked her to send a bicycle to Manila as a gift to Du Xingqiao because Mrs. Ford heard that Xingqiao's savings were originally intended to buy a bicycle. Mrs. Ford's money has now been sent to Manila, and the Women's Relief Association has decided to buy a bicycle and give it to Du Xingqiao according to Mrs. Ford's wishes.

Mrs. Ford Gifts Car as Encouragement

Mrs. Sayre, the wife of the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, presented the bicycle donated by Mrs. Henry Ford, the wife of the American automobile king, to Du Xingqiao, a patriotic Chinese child in our city, at the Commissioner's Office at 11:30 AM on February 8. Among those who came to visit were Mr. Price, chairman of the Philippine Promotion Association of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Society, Mrs. Li Qingquan, chairman of the Women's Relief Association, Mrs. Xue Minlao, celebrities from the overseas Chinese community, and Mrs. Sayre. Mrs. Sayre presented the bicycle to Du Xingqiao under the American flag. The car was made in the United States, in red and white, and was very beautiful. A bronze plaque was hung on the front of the car, with the words "Presented to Du Xingqiao, Mrs. Henry Ford, delivered by Mrs. Sayre." After Xingqiao saluted and accepted it, he told Mrs. Sayre that he was very happy and hoped to rent out the bicycle for charity and remit the income to the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Society. Mrs. Sayre was very pleased to hear this and replied, "Those of us in Manila who are paying attention to the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Society are very impressed by your sacrifice and your sincerity in wanting to rent out the bicycle for charity to help the country. At the same time, we hope that more Americans will know the effect of Mrs. Henry Ford's gift and our enthusiastic admiration for Americans' efforts to help China during this construction period." After receiving the car, Du Xingqiao sent a letter to Mrs. Ford to thank her and automatically contacted the Women's Relief Association, willing to rent out the car every day and donate the rental income to the Women's Relief Association for the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Society.

Overseas Chinese Groups Send Award Flags

Du Xingqiao, 17 years old, is a student in the second year of the first term of primary school at Puzhi School. His father, Du Shi, runs the Jinfuxing Leather Factory at No. 528 Houjiezi. Mr. Du Shi is a member of the Liu Du Family Association in this city. The association believes that this patriotic child is a glory to the family and a light to the country. It has specially prepared an award flag to commend Du Xingqiao and has scheduled an award ceremony to be held at the association at 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month to encourage him.

### Chen Yi Dispatches Personnel to Comfort Overseas Chinese Dependents

Fuzhou Dispatch: Chairman Chen of the Fujian Provincial Government, considering the large number of overseas Chinese dependents in the coastal counties and the soaring prices after the coastal blockade, is extremely concerned about the living conditions and economic situation of these dependents. Last June, he dispatched Councilor Lin Qingshan to Dehua, Yongchun, Jinjiang and other three counties to offer comfort. Lin's arrival was met with a warm welcome from the overseas Chinese dependents everywhere. It is now reported that the Provincial Government has dispatched Wang Jiyu to Xianyou, Putian, Fuqing, Changle, Lianjiang, Minhou, Gutian and other seven counties with overseas Chinese dependents to continue offering comfort. Along the way, Wang will also observe the conditions of overseas Chinese in Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Hui'an counties, and solicit opinions from the dependents regarding evacuation to the interior and the construction of new villages. The tasks for Wang's trip are as follows: (1) To promote preferential treatment for Fujian overseas Chinese returning to the province to serve and the establishment of overseas Chinese affairs advisors in various regions; (2) To solicit opinions on the construction of overseas Chinese new villages; (3) To expedite the conclusion of investigations into overseas Chinese residing abroad and their relatives, and to explore the dependents' opinions on overseas Chinese affairs, to assess the living conditions and economic status of the dependents, and to discuss matters related to overseas Chinese investment in production, and to examine the living conditions of returned overseas Chinese. The period of the mission is tentatively set for one month, and preparations are underway to depart via Yongchun within days.

### Fujian Provincial Government Reforms Official Documents

Emphasis on Equality and Cordiality

Southern Fujian Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Government, noting that past official documents have perpetuated ingrained habits, placing excessive emphasis on hierarchy with condescending or arrogant language, which is inconsistent with the current era. Although there have been recent trends toward improvement, thorough reform has not yet been seen. The Provincial Government has now issued a special order to its subordinates, stating that the tone of downward-directed official documents from all agencies should henceforth adhere to the principles of equality and cordiality. All stern, aloof phrases and tones should be avoided. Furthermore, after the implementation of local self-government, when county magistrates and district heads communicate with township and town chiefs, they should, except when directives are necessary (such as when relaying orders from higher authorities), primarily use telegrams and letters to show respect for the township and town chiefs.

### Tan Kah Kee Concerned About Malaria Epidemic in Fujian Province

Donates Large Quantity of Quinine

Southern Fujian Dispatch: The Provincial Government Secretariat received a letter yesterday from Mr. Tan Kah Kee, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refugees in the Motherland, from Singapore. Regarding the prevalence of malaria in northwestern Fujian and the need for quinine, he has entrusted the Gulangyu National Defense Relief Association to send 50,000 tablets and has raised 500,000 tablets in Bandung, Java, entrusting the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce to forward them to this province. This action greatly benefits our fellow Fujianese. If there is a continuing need in this province in the future, fundraising can still be initiated. Regarding donations for the restoration of Jimei Schools, the letter also stated that concrete measures have been taken and that they will be reorganized and restored to their former glory in the future.

### Business Establishments Should Fulfill Registration

Violators Will Be Punished According to Law

Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Government, noting that there are no explicit regulations for dealing with business establishments that open without fulfilling commercial establishment registration, telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and received a reply stating that business establishments that fail to fulfill commercial establishment registration may be ordered to register by administrative order if necessary, and those who violate this order may be punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law. After receiving the reply, the Provincial Government has issued orders to all counties and districts to inform them of this.

### Ministry of Education Promotes Production Education, Simultaneous Advancement of Higher and Secondary Education, Increasing Practical Courses to Train Technical Talents, Central and Local Governments Jointly Subsidize Expenses

(Chongqing, 25th) In light of the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the Ministry of Education has been diligently guiding and promoting production education for the past three years, with the aim of training a large number of cadres and technical personnel. In the realm of higher education, ten specialized training classes have been specially established, including nine classes in the industrial field, such as telecommunications, automobiles, mining, machinery, chemical testing, papermaking, leather, dyeing and weaving, and agricultural product manufacturing; five classes in the agricultural field, such as aquaculture, sericulture, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics; and two classes in the medical field, such as sanitation and administration. In addition to establishing the National Central Vocational and Technical College to operate two classes, the remaining classes are distributed among public and private colleges and universities, so that they can utilize existing equipment. At the same time, it is stipulated that each specialized training class should establish close ties with production enterprises of the same nature and make full use of their equipment for practical training. Instructors are also instructed to selectively hire specialized personnel from relevant agencies to serve as instructors. Furthermore, in order to meet social needs, in addition to approving the establishment of practical departments in public and private colleges and universities, and planning the establishment of the National Northwest Vocational and Technical College and the National Chongqing Merchant Marine College, the Ministry has also ordered Central University and other schools to add eighteen engineering classes, and Sichuan University to add one economics department class. Additional subsidies have been allocated for these additions. In addition, the Ministry pays close attention to the supervision and improvement of provincial private colleges and universities, and allocates annual subsidies. The allocation of these subsidies gives special emphasis to science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, stipulating that they should account for at least 70% of the total each year. In the realm of secondary education, it has formulated an outline of measures for promoting agricultural and industrial vocational education in the southwest and northwest provinces, instructing the provinces to formulate implementation plans to adjust school settings and stipulating that each province and city implement measures for regional guidance of vocational schools, to divide vocational school districts, and designate colleges and universities to undertake guidance work, in order to achieve practical teaching results. Recently, the Ministry allocated special funding of 400,000 yuan, designating corresponding schools to operate 32 vocational training classes in machinery, civil engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications, surveying and mapping, printing, wool weaving, dyeing and weaving, silkworm egg production and manufacturing, accounting midwifery, nursing dispensing, automobile repair, oil manufacturing, and other fields. It also allocated funds under the central production education budget to subsidize provinces and cities in enriching vocational school equipment and establishing elementary practical vocational schools. At the same time, the Ministry issued an order to all provinces and cities that schools subsidized by the central government should be provided with additional funding by the provinces and cities at an amount no less than the central subsidy. A detailed budget of expenditures and expansion plans should be prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before funds can be used, and personnel will be dispatched by the Ministry and provinces at any time to conduct strict inspections to ensure that funds are not diverted to other uses.

### Yenching University in Peiping Promotes Self-Help Work

Students Work Hard to Solve Economic Difficulties

(Peiping Dispatch) Yenching University in Peiping, in light of the soaring prices and alarmingly high cost of living in North China, coupled with the economic downturn in the surrounding areas of Peiping and Tianjin, which directly and indirectly affected both new and old students, the university authorities decided to allocate a sum of money to alleviate the economic difficulties of these students and ensure that they could concentrate on their studies. In addition to the various scholarships provided by the existing Student Aid Committee, a Self-Help Committee was established to promote self-help work to resolve the students' economic problems. When this work began, the number of students requesting self-help work reached 180, nearly one-fifth of the total number of students in the school. Among them, there were more than 120 male students and more than 50 female students. Currently, more than 120 students have already found work. The remuneration is 40 cents per hour. The monthly remuneration for each student ranges from a minimum of three or five yuan to a maximum of more than 20 yuan, with an average of about 11 or 12 yuan. As for the work, the university's three colleges (excluding the College of Religion), more than a dozen departments, several dining halls, gymnasium, library, offices, various buildings, and a very large campus all provide excellent locations for these 100-plus young male and female workers. The nature of the work varies from place to place. Students working in the departments mostly conduct specialized research under the guidance of professors in each department. This work is of great benefit to both the department and themselves. Students working in the library are involved in cataloging, punching cards, transcribing catalogs, and some copying work. Other committees, such as the Campus Beautification Committee, have also hired more than a dozen male and female students to mow grass and remove trees on campus. Even in such cold weather, they are enthusiastically working with rakes, shovels, scissors, and so on. Students are also supervising chefs to order coal and vegetables, managing kitchen hygiene, inquiring about vegetable prices in the market, and answering doorbells in the dormitories. They are doing a very good and energetic job. Therefore, people are generally saying that the atmosphere at Yenching University has changed.

### International Cup Football Semi-Finals: China Beats Soviet Team Resoundingly, 7-2 to Secure Final Spot; Scotland's Performance Greatly Disappoints

In this year's International Football Semi-Finals, the England and Portugal match ended in a draw, requiring a replay at a later date. The Chinese team unexpectedly defeated Scotland by a huge score of 7-2 yesterday morning to secure a spot in the finals. The Chinese team took a 3-1 lead in the first half, and then completely overwhelmed the Soviet team in the second half. Despite the chilly spring weather and the previous night's rain, the enthusiasm of the Yiyuan fans was not diminished, with an estimated five to six thousand people in attendance. The Chinese team made slight changes due to injuries to Huang Kehou and Jiang Zhaoxiang, but this did not affect their strength. The Scottish team was a hastily assembled group, and first-class athletes such as Kai Moer, McClone, etc., were not present. The goalkeeper, Taoni of the Rowing Club, had extremely mediocre goalkeeping skills. The Scottish forwards lacked coordination, so all that was seen was the Chinese team dominating the field, resulting in an unprecedentedly miserable defeat.

Chinese Team: Qin Bi Gao, Yan Shixin, Zhang Linggen, Meng Yiliang, Cai Shengsen, Wang Cuixing, Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng

Scottish Team: Taoni, McShernon, MacDonald, Jack, Max Gan, Moerhel, Duncan, Cochrane, Fraser, Simms

Two Goals in Two Minutes

The Scottish team kicked off, but the ball was immediately intercepted by the Chinese army. Just one minute into the game, Jinshun passed to Qiuting, who touched the baseline and immediately hooked the ball in. Little Xu applied a smokescreen, charging forward without shooting. The eccentric Li Yichen flashed from behind and swept his leg, sending the ball into the net. The lightning-fast goal stunned the entire stadium (1-0). Before the Soviet team could recover, less than half a minute had passed since the previous goal. Wang Cuixing lobbed the ball to Mingsheng, who hooked it into the gap. A'kui rushed up and swept his leg, sending the ball into the net again (2-0). The speed of the Chinese team's attack left the audience speechless. According to the official rules of the International Cup, military players cannot exceed five. In order to strengthen their defensive line, the Soviet team replaced Aikenson with Taoni, resulting in a wide-open gate that was beyond repair.

3-1 Lead in the First Half

After the 2-0 lead, Little Xu skillfully passed to Yichen in the third minute, creating an excellent opening. Unfortunately, he slipped on the wet ground and lost his footing, otherwise, it would have resulted in a three-goal lead in three minutes. After that, the situation remained in China's control. Sun Jinshun shot like a machine gun, but without success. Xu Wenkui charged in again, but politely refrained from shooting. Fifteen minutes quickly passed, and the Soviet team only managed to approach the Chinese goal twice. The Soviet team's counterattack was brief, and soon the Chinese army regained control. In the 28th minute, Qiuting took a beautiful corner kick, the ball arcing directly towards the corner of the goal. Although it was not successful, it drew cheers from 5,000 spectators. Shortly afterward, Li Yichen tried a diving header, but missed by a hair, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. In the 40th minute, Wenkui passed to Zhang Mingsheng, who broke through from the center of the field, lobbed the ball, and Li Yichen jumped up and tapped it in with his head. The ball bounced off the ground and into the net (3-0). However, what came easily was quickly lost. A minute later, Her Duncan suddenly penetrated the Chinese defense, which had loosened slightly. Zhang Linggen failed to defend, and Duncan passed the ball to the center, where Simms caught it and pushed it in, finally winning a goal back for the Soviet team. The first half ended 3-1.

Machine Gun Fire: One Goal After Another

After halftime, Cai Shengsen and Meng Yiliang switched positions, and the effect was miraculous. Cochrane's fierce shot from five yards in front of the goal was intercepted by Meng and flew into the sky. In the 13th minute, Qiuting hooked the ball in, Little Xu created an opening, and with a light push, Li Yichen charged in like lightning and kicked the ball into the empty net. Taoni rushed out but was unable to save it (4-1). In the 16th minute, Jinlu stepped on the high ball opened by McShernon and passed it quickly to Qiuting, who avoided MacDonald and fired into the left corner from four yards in front of the goal (5-1). In the 26th minute, Jinshun sent A'kui from the back half of the field. Little Xu rushed into the Soviet camp with the posture of running 50 yards, creating a false impression to lure MacDonald away. MacDonald fell for the trick and went far out, so Little Xu calmly shot into the empty net (6-1). In the 20th minute, Mingsheng crossed the ball, McShernon lost his footing, and Sun Jinshun calmly scored, fulfilling his wish. The Chinese team scored four goals in one breath, making it 7-1. At this point, the Soviet team was in an irredeemable situation. Five minutes later, Duncan's long shot from ten yards hit the woodwork and bounced down. Qin Bigao caught the ball, and Jack seized the opportunity and pushed it into the net (7-2). Then Little Xu scored another goal, but it was ruled offside. Half a second before the end of the game, A'kui received a wonderful pass from Jinshun, passed two defenders, and shot with one foot. Just as the ball was about to enter the goal, the final whistle blew, so the goal was also deemed invalid. The Chinese team won 7-2.

### Seven Mile Cross Country, Hongkou Wins Championship

Wang Zhenglin Sets New Record, Teammate Guan Youwen Runner-Up

The annual Sino-Western Seven-Mile Open Team Championship, organized by the Hongkou Cross Country Team, started at 8:00 AM yesterday in front of Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road. There were 19 teams participating, and the scene was lively with spectators along the route. The situation was even more enthusiastic than last year. As a result, Hongkou A won both championships. The British Army's Dong Sele won the runner-up, and the individual champions and runners-up were still won by Wang Zhenglin and Guan Youwen. Champion Wang Zhilin broke the previous record of 36 minutes and 26.4 seconds created by Liu Shufa with 36 minutes and 14.8 seconds. Wang lacked competition along the way, making this new record all the more commendable. Youwen has also made rapid progress recently, winning the runner-up with a time of 37 minutes and 8.6 seconds, defeating Dong Sele's Heister and Glymons, which is also commendable. The previous winner, the Huizhen team, only had six members participating because their star player, Liu Shufa, was ill. Yesterday, the team's member, Li Duan, was ranked sixth, but at the traffic intersection about eight or nine hundred yards from the finish line, he was unfortunately injured by a car due to the large crowd of spectators, but his injuries were not serious. However, Huizhen failed to score due to insufficient legal number of participants. This accident is a pity. Wang Fudan presented the awards after the race, and the once grand long-distance race came to an end. The team awards and individual rankings are listed below:

Team Total Score: (1) Hongkou A 39 points (2) Dong Sele 51 points (3) Youqiang A 148 points (4) Qingguang A 170 points

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Finances Exhausted; Plans to Increase Various Taxes; If Approved by Taxpayers' Annual Meeting, Implementation Will Begin July This Year; Minimum Additional Tax of 50 Percent on All Items

At the end of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board's summer recess last year, the seriousness of the Bureau's financial situation had reached a point requiring deep consideration. The Bureau's budget for the previous year was based on an exchange rate of eight and a half pence. The significant impact of the subsequent exchange rate contraction and the inevitable increase in various expenditures are similar to the rising public utility and commodity prices. Therefore, the Bureau invited two bankers and two Finance Committee members to form a special subcommittee, together with the Bureau's Chief Secretary and Chief Executive, and the Chief Financial Officer, to comprehensively study the Bureau's financial situation and consider ways to remedy the financial difficulties. Their report was sent to the Finance Committee for review.

### Ten Million Deficit in This Year's Budget

The Bureau's original budget estimate for the previous year had a deficit of $2,323,80 yuan. A revised budget submitted by the Chief Financial Officer showed a deficit of $6,080,000. The draft budget for this year estimates a deficit of approximately $10 million (excluding the previous year's deficit that should be carried over to this year's budget).

### Simultaneous Progress on Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure

After detailed study of the Bureau's accounts and expenditures, the special subcommittee unanimously believed that the Municipal Council should produce a balanced budget as soon as possible to match revenue and expenditure. At present, it is not possible to borrow money in any way to seek a remedy, unless the Bureau can ensure the possibility of achieving a balanced budget and saving expenditure.

### Study Results Require Tax Increase

The Bureau's reserve fund has been continuously used to offset budget deficits for many years. This reserve fund has now been depleted. The funds required for administration will inevitably rely on tax increases or borrowing. If the Bureau wants to balance revenue and expenditure this year based on the current exchange rate, and without borrowing, it will have to levy an additional fee of 100 percent on the general municipal tax, special property tax, and land tax starting in July this year. The special subcommittee unanimously resolved to recommend to the Finance Committee that a minimum additional fee of 50 percent should be levied on the general tax, special property tax, and land tax starting on July 1 this year. In addition, the additional fee on various license fees, etc., should be increased from 10 percent to 50 percent.

### Strive to Balance Revenue and Expenditure

During the discussion of this proposal in the Finance Committee, it was argued that levying an additional fee of 50 percent based on the current tax rate would increase the burden on ordinary citizens with lower incomes. It was then replied that the proposed additional fee was imperative. Moreover, the market is currently improving, and the situation of the citizens is better than a year ago. Most employees have increased their salaries and cost-of-living allowances. Furthermore, with inflation in this city, the Bureau's revenue and expenditure must reach a balanced position sooner rather than later.

### Public Bonds to be Issued Upon Approval by Annual Meeting

If the above-mentioned proposed additional fee can be allowed by the taxpayers' annual meeting, the Bureau can expect to issue public bonds to meet the expenses required during the period before revenue and expenditure are balanced. One point to be noted is that even if the above-mentioned additional fee is levied, the deficit carried over to the next year is still about $5 million, of which $2 million is carried over from the previous year. In the future, if the exchange rate improves or the situation in this city is truly improved, the Bureau's financial position can be stabilized. In other words, if the exchange rate continues to decline or the situation in this Bureau becomes worse, the Bureau's financial losses will inevitably be heavier.

### Strenuous Efforts to Reduce Budget in Various Departments

When the special subcommittee initially reviewed the budget, it indicated that the Municipal Council should take as many measures as possible to save money in order to satisfy taxpayers. This point was understood by the Bureau. Therefore, it requested the Bureau's Chief Secretary and Chief Executive to order the heads of various departments to strive to reduce the budget when re-compiling the budget. In the past, the budgets of various departments have been strenuously reduced, and the various expenditures that must be increased due to the decline in the exchange rate have also been reduced as much as possible in this year's budget. The amount of the reduction is estimated to be about $1.8 million.

### Difficult to Tighten Police Expenses

In this regard, it should be noted that the expenditure on maintaining law and order, which accounts for a certain amount, is particularly difficult to reduce under the current environment. All reduced expenditures are based on the opinions of the heads of various departments together with the Chief Financial Officer and the proposals of various committees. The main reason for the reduction is the cessation of new facilities, and a small part is due to the expected increase in certain revenues. The detailed circumstances of the reduction and the contents of the budgets of various departments will be published in a separate article within three weeks so that all taxpayers can fully understand the facts before the annual meeting and decide on the final budget.

### Multiple Impacts of Low Exchange Rate

Finally, to avoid misunderstandings, it is necessary to solemnly state that the decline in the exchange rate has had many impacts on the Municipal Council's expenditure. In addition to affecting the payment of all retirement allowances and salaries of employees, it has also affected all items, etc. The increase in the expenditure of various application items is the same as the situation of each citizen.

### Board Meeting Has Been Approved

The above-mentioned report of the special subcommittee and the recommendations of the Finance Committee have been approved by the Municipal Council's special meeting on the 23rd of this month.

### Price Control Committee of the French Concession to Hold Meeting This Morning; Expected Large Drop in French Concession Prices; Citizens' Association Advocates Severe Punishment for Profiteering Merchants

In order to curb prices and stabilize the livelihood of the people, the French Municipal Council has already established a Price Control Committee, appointed responsible members, and started work immediately. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement is also preparing to follow the French authorities in organizing a similar committee to study prices and determine price levels. The authorities of the two concessions are closely monitoring the measures to stabilize prices, the rise and fall of commodity market prices in various industries, and whether there are any speculative manipulations, in order to curb them at any time and crack down on improper profits of speculators. Details are as follows:

Citizens' Association's Enthusiastic Support

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association and its affiliated district citizens' branches have expressed their warm support for this measure by the concession authorities to stabilize the livelihood of the people. They hope that the authorities will prioritize public safety and social order, and implement it strictly according to the plan. The association believes that there is absolutely no sign of a shortage of essential goods for the people's livelihood in Shanghai, and that the current unfortunate situation is entirely due to the monopoly and manipulation of speculators. If adjustments can be made in terms of supply and demand and distribution, prices are bound to return to normal. The association also believes that the various punitive provisions regarding sanctions against profiteering merchants promulgated by the National Government are fully applicable to Shanghai and will ask the court to pay special attention to them.

Committee Members Already Announced

The French Concession Price Control Committee is chaired by Consul General M. Auge'. The official list of other members is as follows: (Chairman) M. Auge', (Members) M. Chevretton', Donne', Laffond', Dupuy', Egle', Tsi Tche', and four Chinese members, Sadoc', Mrs. A. Slobodtchikoff', M. Favret', Jaspar', Brediam', Dr. Palud', M. Jordan', Jobez', Moret'.

First Meeting Held This Morning

The North-China Daily News reported that, in accordance with the order issued by the French Consulate on February 19, the French Concession authorities, after detailed discussions and meetings in the past few days, have appointed 16 members to limit the highest prices of daily necessities in the French Concession. There are also four Chinese members. The committee may hold its first meeting tomorrow morning (26th).

Huge Inventory in Shanghai

It is expected that after the committee investigates various aspects of the price problem, the prices of important goods in the French Concession will fall sharply in a few days. French Consul General Auge' told reporters that although the situation in Shanghai is not good due to the war in the Far East and Europe, the current inventory of important goods in the city is more than in the past. The high prices are due to speculators and profiteering merchants who disregard the livelihood of the people and take the opportunity to manipulate and enrich themselves.

Crack Down on Hoarding and Limit Prices

Now that the committee has been established, its responsibility lies in eliminating such opportunism and profiteering, and restoring prices to normal. The consular order authorizes the committee to confiscate all goods sold at prices higher than the set price, and has the right to ask merchants to produce their accounts for inspection in order to determine the original price of all goods.

Municipal Council to Issue Announcement

Regarding this matter, the reporter asked a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement (on the 24th). The reply was that the Municipal Council may issue an announcement on the general price situation in Shanghai in a few days. He did not know what methods the Municipal Council would use to curb prices in the International Settlement.

### Coal Briquette Holders Request Clearance of Warehouse Warrants; Coal Briquette Factories and Holders in Stalemate, Mutually Shifting Responsibility for Manipulation

The coal briquette retailers in the city sent a joint letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that since the price limit for pressed coal briquettes, everyone has been celebrating. However, the coal briquette factories are shifting the blame for manipulation and hoarding to the holders of warehouse warrants, hoping to win social praise. The origin of coal briquette warehouse warrants is purely due to the factories' competition to sell short. Now, as reported, there are 22,400 tons of coal briquettes hoarded in warehouse warrants, while the daily output of each factory is less than 1,400 tons. Even if the entire daily output is supplied for the withdrawal of warehouse warrants, the 10-day limit is not enough for 14,000 tons. The difference is so great, how can the goods purchased at 110 yuan now be sold at the price of 5.8 yuan, and how can it last? Is there no day of reckoning for such deceptive behavior? Our coal briquette retail stores, whether they hold warehouse warrants or not, feel extremely painful because there is no way to purchase goods and no goods to sell. Therefore, the announcement by the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association to clear the hoarded goods within a time limit is impossible in fact. The reason why the holders of warehouse warrants cannot clear the inventory is all caused by the factories. Therefore, the holders of warehouse warrants should not only not bear the warehouse rent, but also be compensated by the factories for the losses of the holders of warehouse warrants. Because it concerns the interests of the industry, we are specially requesting your chamber to investigate the facts, uphold justice, and forward this to the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association, and inform the manufacturers to increase production as soon as possible, deliver the warehouse warrants, and supply retail as much as possible. If the ordered goods cannot be delivered within the time limit, they should be liable for compensation, and we also ask you to strictly prevent under-the-table price increases and deliberately exceeding the price limit, in order to maintain a lasting flat price." More than 200 warehouse warrant holders also petitioned the Coal Industry Association yesterday, requesting to stop the factories from illegally retaining and deliberately shirking their responsibilities.

Coal Briquette Production

Since receiving the letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association has been investigating the daily output of each factory during the flat price period. The association has now completed the investigation from the 12th to the 24th and published it as follows: (1) Yi Taixing, 333.775 tons on the 22nd, 320.80 tons on the 23rd, and 339.715 tons on the 24th; (2) Nanyang Factory 1, 101.6 tons on the 12th, 116.95 tons on the 23rd, and 121.45 tons on the 24th; (3) Nanyang Factory 2, 154.30 tons on the 22nd, 234.65 tons on the 23rd, and 209.55 tons on the 24th; (4) Guohua, 146 tons on the 22nd, 170 tons on the 23rd, and 161.75 tons on the 24th; (5) Dongfang, 98 tons on the 22nd, 95.50 tons on the 23rd, and 112.25 tons on the 24th; (6) Jinghua, 47.70 tons on the 22nd, 50.675 tons on the 23rd, and 56.60 tons on the 24th; (7) Guanghua, 70 tons on the 22nd, 59.25 tons on the 23rd, and 52.75 tons on the 24th; (8) Yuanhua, 3.50 tons on the 22nd, 5.5 tons on the 23rd, and 12 tons on the 24th; (9) Beiyang, 20 tons on the 12th, 16 tons on the 23rd, and 14 tons on the 24th; (10) Hu Licheng, 18 tons on the 22nd, 24 tons on the 23rd, and 26 tons on the 24th; (11) Huacheng Cui Ji, 10 tons on the 22nd, 12.5 tons on the 22nd, and 9 tons on the 24th; (12) Nanhua, 10 tons on the 22nd, 1.5 tons on the 23rd, and stopped on the 24th; (13) Heji, 6 tons on the 22nd, 7 tons on the 23rd, and 6 tons on the 24th; (14) Nanfang Changji, 24.8 tons on the 22nd, 25.15 tons on the 23rd, and 21.85 tons on the 24th; (15) Gongyong, 8 tons on the 22nd, 9 tons on the 23rd, and 11 tons on the 24th; (16) Gongping, tons on the 22nd, 1 ton on the 23rd, and 2 tons on the 24th. The Yuedong Yanyan Factory is still under investigation, and Wufu and Xin Ping Anji have temporarily suspended production.

Improve Flat Sale

Some members of the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association also believe that the current flat sale method is not perfect and cannot benefit the real common people. Some colleagues are also making excuses to shirk their responsibilities. Therefore, they held a special meeting the day before to discuss improvement methods, which have been reported to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for review. According to inquiries from the Daguan News reporter, the main points of the plan are as follows: Starting next month, each factory will self-report the amount of flat sales and hand them over to social justice groups or coal industry to sell tickets and distribute coal. However, in order to help the real poor people, the quantity will be reduced to 2 jiao, 4 jiao, and 1 yuan, etc. At the same time, the market price will be flattened to 100 yuan guan (i.e., 5 yuan per dan).

### Barbed Wire at the Intersection of North Jiangxi Road Has Not Been Removed

The barbed wire fence across the road at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and North Jiangxi Road, which was blocked by the Japanese in the name of the concession troops yesterday, has not been removed. As a result, those who want to go to the post office have to detour through Sichuan Road Bridge or Wenjianshi Road, which is very troublesome. Moreover, both places are stationed with Japanese sentries, and those carrying postal parcels, etc., are often subjected to inspection and interrogation.

### Another Murder Case Occurred at the Paramount Cabaret Last Night; Qian Renlong Died of Two Gunshot Wounds; Murderer Fled; Case Still Under Investigation

Just after the shooting of the dancer Chen Manli at the Paramount Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road at around 0:50 yesterday morning, unexpectedly, at around 11:00 last night, another murder case occurred at the Paramount Cabaret on the edge of the racetrack on Jing'an Temple Road. The details are described below:

Former Detective Now Very Extravagant

The victim, Qian Renlong, a local, lived at No. 225 Sapo Road, French Concession. He used to be a detective in the French Concession Police Department of this city, but he retired a few years ago and lived at home without doing anything. According to general rumors, he has recently taken a job at No. 72 Jessfield Road, but it is impossible to verify whether this is true. What is noteworthy is that Qian himself has been quite extravagant recently, wearing Western suits and frequenting places of pleasure.

Frequent Presence at the Paramount Cabaret

The Paramount Cabaret on the edge of the racetrack on Jing'an Temple Road has always been known to dance enthusiasts as aristocratic. Therefore, most of those who frequent it are middle-class people, and Qian Renlong also often goes to dance there. Therefore, most of the waiters in the hall are familiar with him. At around 9:00 last night, Qian went to dance again. It was not until around 10:50 that he finished enjoying himself and left his seat. After putting on his clothes and hat in the cloakroom, he walked out of the cabaret door and down the steps.

Assassins Jump Out from the Low Bushes

Outside the door of the cabaret, the center of the lawn was originally decorated with a small garden. The left and right sides were sidewalks and driveways. Along the surrounding walls were planted winter green low bushes. When the neon lights shone at night, it was quite attractive. At that time, after Qian walked out of the door and stepped down the stone steps, he walked towards the west side of the coal cinder road. Unexpectedly, two men suddenly jumped out from between the wall trees and blocked Qian's path. They immediately pulled out a gun from their waists and opened fire on him.

Two Gunshots and Falling to the Ground

Qian Renlong was caught off guard and could not avoid the attack. He was shot twice in the abdomen and fell to the ground. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. At this time, the people in the cabaret, hearing the gunshots outside, became suspicious and rushed to look outside. They saw two men running away and were unable to catch up. Looking back at the bottom of the stairs, they saw that Qian had fallen in a pool of blood, and the flowers and plants were all red. The scene was terrifying. They immediately reported to the police station and sent Qian to Baolong Hospital for treatment in a car. At the same time, they pursued the murderers.

Death Due to Serious Injuries

After the injured person was sent to the hospital, the doctors found that Qian had two bullets in his abdomen, which had injured his internal organs. He had lost too much blood and the situation was critical. Although various treatments were given, it was difficult to save him. He died of his injuries at around 11:30 that night. His body has been sent to the coroner's office to await the court's examination this morning. As for the reasons for the murder, the police are currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### No Sign of Yangtze River Opening; Japanese and Puppets Conspire to Dominate; Establishment of "China Shipping Co., Ltd." with a Capital of 30 Million Yen Was Established Yesterday

In order to monopolize China's shipping industry, the Japanese merged 11 shipping companies including Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Nissin, Osaka, Mitsui, and Yamashita on September 1 last year and reorganized them into East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. The head office is located in Tokyo, and the Shanghai branch is located at the original site of Nissin Company and Osaka Merchant Shipping Co. on the Bund of Guangdong Road. In addition to monopolizing China's coastal, North and South Ocean routes, and the Yangtze River route, the Sino-Japanese liaison route and the Taiwan Keelung route are nationalized. Since the withdrawal of the army from Hankou,

The entire Yangtze River

Has been exclusively operated until now. In order to please the United States, the Japanese have also stated that they will open the Yangtze River shipping route between Beijing and Shanghai, starting in February. Now it is almost March, but there is still no news. No one knows when it will open. Recently, it has been heard that the Japanese puppets have a new conspiracy before the opening of the Yangtze River, planning to establish "China Shipping Co., Ltd.", jointly run by East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. and the "Renovated Government", with a capital of 30 million yen, half of which is from the Japanese and puppets, specializing in

Yangtze River Transportation

A founding meeting was held yesterday at the Japanese Club on Wenjianshi Road in Hongkou. The organization is planning to continue its monopoly after the nominal opening in the future, so that foreign ships will still have no room to intervene.

### Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in China Arrives in Shanghai from Tianjin

Headquarters Officially Moved Here

The Continental Daily reported that Colonel Gasville, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (24th) on the Taishang. The headquarters of the French Forces in China has officially moved from Tianjin to Shanghai. Those who accompanied Colonel Jia were Captain Florent, Chief of Staff. They landed at the French Post Office pier. Four French troops and two teams of French police officers, under the command of Major Datig, commander of the French forces stationed in Shanghai, greeted Colonel Jia. Many French diplomats, such as George Pico, Counselor of the French Embassy in Shanghai, French Consul General Auge', and Brediam, Director-General of the French Municipal Council, also greeted him at the pier. After Colonel Jia inspected the six teams of soldiers and police officers lined up on the Bund, he went to the French Consulate General for a short rest, and then went to the headquarters of the French forces stationed in Shanghai on Fuli Road. Colonel Jia scheduled a banquet on Wednesday evening to meet with the commanders of the armed forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai and diplomats from various countries.

### Jews Who Joined the French Army Sent to Saigon

102 Reported

The Continental Daily reported yesterday (24th) that more than 100 German-Jewish immigrants from this city who volunteered to join the French Foreign Legion to fight against the Third Reich when the European War broke out will leave Shanghai for Saigon within two days, and then go to the Western Front. After Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3 last year, the French Consulate General in Mu City announced the recruitment of foreign volunteers. These Jewish immigrants volunteered to join the fight against their "homeland." About a week ago, they received an order to report to the French garrison headquarters on Fuli Road in this city. It is reported that a total of 102 people reported. They will not be equipped or trained in Shanghai but will go to Saigon. It is believed that they will depart on the French Post Office Company's Dazhi'an, which will arrive in Shanghai from Japan this afternoon (25th).

### Customs Brokers' Beiyang Group Increases Freight Rates

Excessive Costs and Difficulties in Payment

The Shanghai Customs Brokers' Association notified Qingdao, Weihai, Yantai, Tianjin, and other guest groups yesterday: "Respectfully inform you that due to the fact that Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies have increased freight rates and reduced commissions for Qingdao, Weihai, Yantai, and Tianjin ports since February 23, and new regulations have been formulated, the Beiyang groups of our colleagues have to increase the freight rates for all goods such as groceries, foreign cloth, and miscellaneous grains loaded from this date in accordance with the company's regulations. The prices are calculated according to the company's regulations. For Tianjin, except for cotton yarn freight, which is calculated by the piece, the rest such as 32-foot, 40-foot fine cloth, single and double-wrapped coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine twill, and various colored goods, groceries, miscellaneous grains, bags, and boxes are all calculated according to the standard company's measurement of the size and weight. The freight loaded is collected at the end of the month. This is because the cost is too high and it is difficult to pay in advance. It is an unavoidable move. I hope you will understand."

### Boiled Water Industry Receives Flat-Priced Coal Cinders and Resumes Business Immediately

The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association decided not to raise prices again this time and continue to sell water at the original price. However, due to the soaring coal prices, breaking the new record of more than 250 yuan per ton, the more than 400 member companies in the industry suffered a serious blow and all suspended business. Various organs, groups, schools, and residents felt very inconvenient. The industry association has visited the authorities several times and appealed to various public groups for assistance. Now it has obtained the approval of the Coal Industry Association to designate the three coal companies of Yi Taixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai to supply boiled water shops with flat-priced Kaiping cinders at a low price of 98 yuan per ton. Each company is temporarily limited to one ton. Purchases started the day before yesterday and will last until March 4. All boiled water shops that want to purchase coal jin can apply for coal purchase by holding the application form issued by the industry from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day. The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association specially convened a representative meeting of various districts on Zhejiang Road at 7:00 p.m. yesterday. The results of the discussion were: (1) All closed shops will resume business immediately to facilitate users to purchase water; (2) Inform member companies to fill out application forms and apply to the Coal Industry Association for coal purchase; (3) After all members have used up the low-priced coal jin, they will continue to petition the Kaiping Bureau to maintain the entire boiled water business. The meeting ended at around 9:00 p.m.

### 60,000 Mu of People's Fields in Wusong Have Been Confiscated

The Japanese Plan to Develop Yunzaobang and Plan to Establish a New Urban Area

Wusong Yunzaobang is located on the edge of the Huangpu River in the mouth of the Yangtze River. It is a natural commercial port with an excellent situation. It connects to the counties of Su, Chang, Jia, and Tai in the west, so the inland ships in and out are frequent. Now the Japanese are renovating the Bang into a commercial port, with the port surface widened to 60 zhang. In the future, commercial ships of more than 20,000 tons can be parked in the port. Docks and warehouses will be built on both sides, and a large area of 60,000 mu of people's fields will be actively developed to establish a new urban area, so that factories can be established locally, with the intention of enhancing production capacity. All Japanese goods are sold in large quantities to various occupied areas to carry out economic aggression and exclude the interests of various countries in China. The Hengchan Company has negotiated with the puppet municipal government's land bureau for the requisitioned land and entrusted it to handle the purchase procedures. The puppet land and finance bureaus have established an appraisal committee, invited local bullies from various districts to participate, and arbitrarily determined land prices, forcing villagers to register within a time limit (it is said that the deadline has now passed) and pay the price to buy the land. The nominal price is 200-300 yuan per mu, but in fact, land prices above 1,000 yuan are generally given a paper of worthless and unredeemed Huaxing public bonds. Even more, the fields have been handed over for several months without receiving a cent, which is deliberately delayed by the puppet bureau personnel in an attempt to swallow them. Therefore, the survivors who have survived the disaster have no land to cultivate, and they feel displaced. They are in a situation where they cannot find a way to survive and cannot die. Now the villagers with a little knowledge, although they have been threatened by the puppets time and time again, are still unwilling to register to show their determination. It is said that the requisitioned land in each district includes Ganghao 33 Tu, Tuihao 35 Tu, Tuihao 22 Tu, Tuihao 21 Tu, and Gu Teng 2 Hao, etc. There is a lot of land being requisitioned. Because the number of maps is not detailed, we will continue to report.

### Threat to Life; Hungry People Seize Food

Since the prices of rice and coal have soared, the threat to the lives of residents has become increasingly serious. Middle- and lower-class families are already struggling, and it is even more difficult for poor people to find food. According to a Datong News reporter who personally witnessed a tragedy on Xinzha Road yesterday afternoon, Ningbo Food Company, a small shop selling snacks on the east side of Datong, had a man who was still neatly dressed suddenly grabbed a few pieces of square cake from the counter, stuffed them into his mouth, and ran away. His behavior of being hungry and not choosing food was unbearable to look at. Although the shop clerk chased after him, he did not catch him. The reporter also saw a man on the streets of western Shanghai early in the morning buying a bowl of soy milk. Just as he was about to take the money to pay, he was grabbed and drunk by someone behind him in an instant. Although he was scolded and beaten, he still endured it and did not escape. It is so sad. All these situations are unprecedented.

### Russian Firefighter Dies in Fire

A fire suddenly broke out at No. 5 and 6 Zhou Shan Road, French Concession, at 7:50 yesterday morning. The Xinkaihe Fire Brigade rushed to put out the fire. A Russian firefighter, Baoli Xueke Gelaigu (transliteration), climbed onto the roof of No. 123 Yangxing Street, the neighboring company, to put out the fire. Due to carelessness, he fell from the roof to the ground, injuring his head and fainting. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital by ambulance. Due to his serious injuries, he could not be treated and died at the hospital. The body was then transferred to the coroner's office on Tailasite Road. The Second Special Court was requested to appoint a prosecutor to examine the body at 2:00 p.m. The family collected the body, and the Municipal Council will provide preferential compensation because the deceased died on duty.

### Murder at the Paramount Cabaret; Peng and Chen Died Yesterday and Today; Chen Manli's Kidney Was Removed But Still Could Not Be Saved

Yesterday morning at 0:50, a violent man shot the red dancer Chen Manli (see picture) and accidentally injured the dancers Peng Qiutang and Liu Borong at the Paramount Ballroom at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Yuanyuan Road. The details at that time have been described in detail in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Peng Qiutang, who was shot, had a bullet in his back that pierced his lungs. Although the Red Cross doctor performed surgery, he died at around 6:00 a.m. due to his serious injuries and coma. Chen was shot in the waist and abdomen at the time, and a hole was also pierced in the large intestine. The doctor had removed one of the injured kidneys and repaired the large intestine, but she eventually died at 2:00 a.m. this morning despite medical treatment. Chen Manli was previously married to Liu Huizhi, the manager of the China Industrial Bank. Because Liu had another lover, Chen left him. Liu is still alive. What was reported yesterday was a rumor.

### On the Mediterranean Sea Rescue, Italian Steamer Arrives in Shanghai, Italian Consul and Residents Board to Congratulate, Ship Owner Narrates Event, Applause Resounds

The Continental Press reports that the Italian steamer "Volrazio" caught fire and sank in the Mediterranean Sea last month. At that time, the Italian mail steamer "Conte Verde" was nearby and did its best to rescue the endangered passengers of the "Volrazio." The "Conte Verde" arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday evening (the 24th), the Italian residents of this city boarded the ship together, gathered in the grand cabin, and congratulated Captain Fralla and his crew. First, the Italian Consul-General Nilon delivered a speech praising Captain Fralla and his crew for their brave assistance. Afterwards, Captain Fralla gave a thank you speech and described the rescue situation. When he finished speaking, the cabin was filled with applause and cheers three times. According to Associated Press, the "Volrazio" weighed 11,669 tons and was sailing from Genoa to South Africa. While passing the French Mediterranean coast, an explosion occurred in the engine room, and the fire quickly spread throughout the ship. More than 600 passengers and crew members were rescued by a French warship and several other ships, including the "Conte Verde," and were quite distressed. According to Captain Fralla, who briefly recounted his eyewitness account to reporters yesterday, "On January 21st, we received a distress signal from the 'Volrazio,' stating that the ship was on fire near the Bay of Lions, about 210 miles away from us. Without hesitation, I immediately ordered the ship to turn its rudder and speed to the rescue. At that time, the wind was strong and the waves were high. The 'Conte Verde' proceeded at full speed. At 4:15 PM, I saw a wisp of thick smoke rising into the sky. At 4:45 PM, we docked next to the 'Volrazio' and heard cries of panic from the burning ship. I immediately ordered four lifeboats to be lowered and did our best to rescue people until midnight. The next day, we sailed to Genoa with the 'Columbus' ship, which was also engaged in the rescue." The "Conte Verde" steamer set sail from Shanghai this morning (the 25th) and will return to Italy via Hong Kong.

### Rice-Laden Pushcart Robbed Clean, Poor Woman Arrested

Liu Peican from Tongzhou, a pushcart driver in the French Concession's Avenue de Mentigny, was hired to transport two bags of white rice worth more than 50 yuan and a dozen thermos flasks to a certain location in Hongkou at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday. While passing near Gansu Road on Alabaster Road in the Public Concession, he was surrounded by dozens of impoverished Jiangbei women scavenging rice and wheat soybeans etc. from various godowns, who saw the two bags of white rice on the cart. They rushed forward and robbed the cart clean, then fled in different directions. As a result, Chinese constable No. 1088 from the Third Section heard the alarm and arrested an old Jiangbei woman named Ding Xu. A small bag of white rice and a thermos flask were found, and she was taken to the Huishi Police Station for detention. Yesterday, she was brought before the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that although the defendant was an extremely impoverished woman, she had still violated criminal law. Under questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzi, the argument was still held, and she was remanded in custody to await sentencing.

### Cafe Waitress Arrested for Embezzlement

A Danish man named Nelson runs a café at 595 East Broadway, hiring Suzhou woman Chen Jinbao (18 years old) and Shaoxing woman Zhu Jinmei (17 years old) as waitresses. Nelson himself cohabits with a prostitute named Zhang Bamei upstairs in the cafe. On the 17th of this month, Nelson suddenly discovered that 2,600 yuan in French currency and 100 US dollars, equivalent to about 4,000 yuan in Chinese currency, which he had placed in a drawer in the room upstairs, had been stolen. He reported to the Huishan Police Station, and Chinese detective Gu Zhongshu and Western detective Ji Jiasheng went to investigate. Seeing that the drawer was undamaged, they determined that it must have been an inside job. After a detailed investigation, they determined that Chen and Zhu were the main suspects and went to 551 East Broadway to arrest the two women and their foster mother, Shanghai woman Yang Faying (46 years old, who had previously had a relationship with Nelson). They found 1,980 yuan in French currency and 62 US dollars, totaling 2,910 yuan, hidden in the cotton padding. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for theft. Nelson then turned himself in, requesting leniency. Judge Fei then sentenced Chen Jinbao to four months in prison, Zhu Jinmei to three months in prison, and Yang Faying to two months in prison, all with a three-year suspended sentence.

### Coppersmith Entices and Harbors Young Woman

Zhuang Hesheng, a 26-year-old coppersmith from Huzhou, is poor and still unmarried. Recently, through his friend named A Ding, he met Da Da, the 18-year-old daughter of Xu Lin, an old Ningbo woman living at No. 4, Lane 287, Rue Amiral Courbet. She was a prostitute. After Zhuang the coppersmith met her, they both agreed to elope. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, he enticed her to go to a certain amusement park to watch a play. Afterwards, they slept together in the small room on the upper floor of his residence at No. 80 Tiantong Road, acting as husband and wife. After her daughter went missing, Xu Lin asked people to search everywhere, but there was no news. It was not until the day before yesterday that she learned that her daughter had been enticed and harbored by Zhuang the coppersmith. She reported the situation to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address to arrest Zhuang and bring Xu's daughter back with them. The daughter was handed over to her mother to take home. The suspect Zhuang was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, prosecuted him for disrupting the family, and requested an investigation. Xu Lin and her daughter Da Da provided evidence, and the defendant's testimony was evasive. He bowed his head and pleaded for forgiveness. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.

### Robberies and Thefts Log

Rice merchant Gu Xiangsheng, a resident of Hongqiao Town, received over 1,260 yuan in payment from Shanghai at around 7 AM the day before yesterday. He took a No. 2 bus of the British public transportation, got off at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road, and walked west. When he was about to walk to the alley next to the Foreign General Association on the west, four robbers suddenly jumped out, each with a pistol, and robbed all the French currency that Gu was carrying. They also stripped him of his "Macuna" overcoat. Before leaving, they fired a shot into the air as a warning, fortunately without injuring anyone. Five robbers suddenly broke into the Lao Fengxiang Silver Shop on Nanjing Road at 10:20 PM last night. Three of the robbers took out pistols and threatened people to keep silent. A large amount of gold and silver jewelry was robbed, worth about 2,000 yuan in French currency. They fled through the door with the stolen goods.

At 7:30 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into No. 10, Lane 519, Hart Road. Three of the robbers took out guns and threatened the residents, ransacking the boxes and cabinets, searching and robbing at will. Clothing and French currency worth about 1,400 yuan were robbed, and they fled in different directions. Afterwards, the homeowner provided a list of stolen items and reported to the local police station to request an investigation.

### Social Miscellany

At around 1:00 PM yesterday, a loud booming sound suddenly occurred in the Nanshi area. At the time, the houses were shaken, but the source of the sound and whether it was an explosion of explosives could not be determined.

According to Japanese claims, Lu A Xiang, the leader of the guerrillas active in the Xiaochuansha area of Baoshan County, near Shanghai, is 42 years old and has more than 600 followers. Recently, Lu has been coming to Shanghai, so on the 22nd, they discovered his address and arrested him.

At 1:50 AM yesterday, a man about 20 years old suddenly hanged himself inside Lane 230, Xiamen Road. He was discovered and rescued, then sent to a hospital for treatment.

Fortunately, firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire quickly. A total of three rooms were destroyed by fire.

### Director of Tongren Foyuan Branch, Guo Shaowen, Passes Away from Illness

Guo Shaowen, the director of the Tongren Foyuan Branch in the French Concession, has devoted himself to the reorganization of charitable undertakings since taking over in the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. He also supervised and led the staff to carefully enshroud and bury unclaimed corpses in the autopsy room attached to the hall. During the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, he was even more enthusiastic about assisting in rescue and burial work. His perseverance and spirit in handling affairs were deeply admired by all walks of life. Unfortunately, he suddenly died of hemoptysis on the 23rd of this month. The colleagues of the hall deeply mourn his passing.

Ping Zun San, a native of Jiangyin, went to Singapore on August 13th and has been missing ever since. He has an elderly mother at home who misses him day and night, her tears flowing like a river. It is truly pitiful. Recently, his family has widely published advertisements seeking information. If any kind-hearted person knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to Anle Factory, Bailinan Road. Your kindness will be immeasurable.

### Japanese Soldiers in Hongkou Round Up Laborers, Over 6,000 People Rounded Up in Recent Days, Chinese Residents Have Been Relocating One After Another

Since the Japanese Navy opened Hongkou, it has been reported that Chinese people have been forcibly rounded up many times. This is still actively underway. Yesterday, a person from Hongkou told a reporter from Daguan News Agency that the Japanese army rounded up laborers, the first time being more than 1,000 people, the second time being more than 800 people, and the rest of the numbers are unknown. It is rumored that the Japanese army is rounding up laborers in deserted areas, which is not the case. According to reports, the place where the most people are rounded up is north of the Zhapui Road Bridge. Every day, Japanese armed plainclothes teams are scattered there. Many well-dressed people are beaten there. The next most common places are Zhonghong Bridge and other places. The rounded-up Chinese people are forced to board transport ships moored in the Huangpu River and transferred to a certain place. This is what some pedestrians have witnessed. In recent days, the Chinese people in Hongkou are talking about the Japanese with fear, and the situation is extremely uneasy. Therefore, they are moving to the concession one after another.

Sexual Medicine

### A Middle-Aged Woman's Frigidity is Mostly Caused by Her Husband's Sexual Weakness

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Some middle-aged husbands do not experience a rapid decline in their libido, but when compared to middle-aged women, they are far behind.

Reproduction is a responsibility shared equally by men and women. In youth, almost all energy is consumed for reproductive purposes. This has a non-shallow impact on health, especially for men.

Why are men willing to deplete their life-sustaining sperm for a moment of pleasure? The reasons are very complex. In youth, it is due to the burning of youthful desire and the eruption of libido. They always use reproduction to satisfy their desires. Therefore, indulgence injures the body, and this is common. Once they reach middle age, their libido declines, making it difficult to coordinate with their wives, and the boudoir loses its harmonious atmosphere!

Speaking of the sexual worries of middle-aged men, some do not experience a rapid decline in their libido, but when compared to middle-aged women, they are far behind. If they were weak in their youth and had problems such as masturbation, nocturnal emission, or premature ejaculation, then by middle age, they can be said to have lost the ability to stimulate a woman's beauty. At this time, the wife's libido is stronger than the husband's. If the husband suffers from the above-mentioned ailments, he cannot withstand the pressure of sexual impulse, and significant fluctuations occur in his physical and conscious aspects. Therefore, at this time, there are quite a few who turn against their husbands and seek other partners to seek their own happiness.

To remedy this kind of misfortune, men should quickly take the German "Bu Ti Kang" (Body-Building Kang) for men, a preparation made from the essence of strong animal testicles, three tablets each time, three times a day, when they suffer from the above-mentioned ailments. It can ensure healthy development, eliminate premature ejaculation and impotence quickly, and at the same time invigorate the brain and promote the function of metabolism. It nourishes the brain, blood, and kidneys, and produces significant effects in 24 hours. For the health and happiness of middle-aged men, it is necessary to take this kind of tonic regularly to consolidate the love between husband and wife and grow old together. The female "Bu Ti Kang" is an ovarian endocrine preparation that functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, treat mammary hypoplasia, anemia, and premature aging, and can show its miraculous effects everywhere.

Gonorrhea Chronicles

### Complete Elimination of Gonorrhea and Turbidity

— American Doctor of Medicine Huang Zhongchang

The phrase "complete elimination of gonorrhea and turbidity" is familiar to the ears. However, I have not heard of anyone who can truly achieve the goal of complete elimination. The reason is that they do not know to use scientific methods as the basis for comprehensive treatment, but only perform superficial treatment of a single branch or node. Originally, during acute gonorrhea, most of the gonococci are concentrated in the anterior urethra. At this time, if local treatment is used to eliminate them in one fell swoop, the gonorrhea may be eliminated immediately. However, during acute gonorrhea, it is impossible to completely eradicate the gonococci, and they gradually attack inward, penetrating deep into the tissue inside the corpus cavernosum of the reproductive organs. From then on, the cunning gonococci are like fish entering the sea or tigers entering the deep mountains. If local surgical treatment is still used, it is no different from waiting for rabbits to collide with tree trunks or carving a boat to find a sword. If most of the gonococci are no longer in the urethra, but in the deep tissues, blood, joints, etc., then even if the entire urethral mucosa is peeled off, it will not help in reality, but will instead promote the rampant spread of gonorrhea.

Therefore, to achieve the complete elimination of gonococci, the only way is to implement a method of surrounding and engulfing the gonococci. The only medicine that can meet these methods is "Neoklinon," a chemical therapy newly improved and invented by Dr. Peter, a German master of venereology (available at Taihe Pharmacy and Wing On Company). "Neoklinon" is based on metaneu therapy, that is, it is made with a chemical therapy that has no toxic reaction. After taking it, it can develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. Its bactericidal power occurs wherever gonococci are located, surrounding and destroying the gonococci. As a result, this extremely ferocious, stubborn, and unruly gonococcus finally succumbs to the bactericidal power of "Neoklinon." Therefore, all types of gonorrhea in men and women, whether it is the initial onset yesterday or old gonorrhea of many years, will be completely cured after taking three to five or six bottles of "Neoklinon." For external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" externally, and women can use "Karsote Vaginal Suppositories" as suppositories, which will produce results even faster.

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis Can Be Quickly Cured Radically

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

The two words "pulmonary tuberculosis" not only cause patients to be fearful, but even healthy people change color when talking about it. The onset of pulmonary tuberculosis is slow, and the results are all unfavorable changes. Therefore, pulmonary tuberculosis accounts for more than 80% of the mortality rate in our country, which is quite alarming. However, based on my experience of more than 20 years, pulmonary tuberculosis can not only be treated, but can also be quickly cured radically, as long as the patient can receive proper treatment and trust the transcendent medicinal power of "Xiubfei Nauer" (Lung Repair Nauer). Even critical symptoms in the second and third stages can be revived.

"Bufei Nauer" (Lung Supplement Nauer) is made by scientifically combining various mineral and plant ingredients that destroy tubercle bacilli. After taking this agent, it can revitalize breathing, relieve coughs, dissolve phlegm, and stop hemoptysis. Because the treatment method is simple, it is praised by pulmonary tuberculosis patients in various countries.

### Cases Cured of Underdevelopment and Frequent Nocturnal Emission

— German Doctor of Medicine Zheng Ting

Patient Wu Qingyun, 19 years old, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, (description omitted)——Addicted to masturbation since childhood, resulting in stunted development of the genitals, which are still as small as a child's genitalia, and also has phimosis and nocturnal emission. Last autumn, after reading an article on the harms of masturbation in a certain book, he was greatly alarmed and decided to quit. However, a small amount of semen often flows out after falling asleep. In the past six months, his body has become weaker and weaker. Knowing that if this continues, his future is hopeless, he specifically asks the doctor to diagnose and treat him. (Cure process)——It was diagnosed that Wu had nocturnal emission three times a week and had severe neurasthenia. He was given electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day, and German "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets, three tablets every night" were given to stop nocturnal emission. He was also prescribed a prescription to take the German endocrine supplement for men, "Bu Ti Kang" (Body-Building Kang), three times a day, to supplement the loss. In this way, treatment and supplementation were combined. After two months, his health improved, his complexion became rosy, and nocturnal emission was completely cured. Then, surgery was performed to remove the phimosis. In total, Wu took eight bottles of "Bu Ti Kang" and two bottles of "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets." All the ailments he suffered from were completely cured, and the genitals developed again, increasing by a quarter compared to before.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Rapid Treatment of Acute Stages of Gonorrhea

— Written by Physician Yao Ju

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Everyone knows that the toxin of gonorrhea comes on strong, but it is necessary to prevent its adverse complications. The most important thing is to treat gonorrhea quickly when it is in the acute stage, so that the gonococci hiding in the anterior urethra cannot continue to stand and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. Naturally, there will be no future transition to chronic gonorrhea, or stubborn old leukorrhea that has entered chronic gonorrhea and developed various difficult-to-cure conditions. Based on my experience of more than 20 years, I have a transcendent treatment method for the initial acute leukorrhea, which prevents it from developing the risk of chronic gonorrhea. Because the gonococci are concentrated in the anterior urethra and have not invaded the interior, the symptoms of gonorrhea at that time are simple and without any complications. Generally, acute leukorrhea that still cannot be completely cured after one or two weeks mostly turns into chronic gonorrhea. Once it enters chronic gonorrhea, the complications of gonorrhea increase. The symptoms of acute gonorrhea are just the pain in the anterior urethra, but once it turns into chronic gonorrhea, there are hundreds of pains. Some have inflammation of the bladder due to gonococci invading the bladder, and some have inflammation of the testicles due to gonococci invading the testicles. There is really no end to it. Although the pain is slightly more bearable than during the acute stage, the duration of the pain is much longer than during the acute stage.

Therefore, it is best to take the newly invented chemical therapy "Neoklinon" (available at Taihe, Zhengwei, Zhongying and other pharmacies) during the acute stage of leukorrhea, so that its bactericidal power reaches the lesion directly, and it can immediately show the effects of anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, and diuretic. In this way, the acute leukorrhea will surely be able to achieve results in a short period of time. I also assist with German inductive electrostatic therapy, WettereX-ray therapy, etc., to quickly eliminate pain, and the gonococci can also be cured more quickly.

Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, only 50 cents will be charged for each daily registration number, and a copy of "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan will be given away.

### Excessive Profit Tax Rate and Collection Issues

— Lü Renyi

Recently, accountant Pan Xulun made a statement in the Shanghai News, arguing that, according to the current regulations for excessive profit tax, enterprises with double the profit pay 40% of their profit in excessive profit tax and income tax; enterprises with threefold profit pay 50% of their profit in taxes; the tax rate is unavoidably too high. He also believes that, given the current domestic environment, it is difficult to achieve effective results by implementing new taxes with excessively high rates; and considering the current fluctuations in currency value, most of the profits earned by merchants are not genuine profits, so it is inappropriate to levy such high rates of income tax. This is from the perspective of implementation effectiveness. On the 13th of this month, the newspaper also published an article by Ouyang Cheng, who argued that in 1917 and 1918, the UK tax rate reached 80% of income, so the current tax rate in our country is not too high. This is from the perspective of comparing with other countries. The author expresses considerable agreement with Mr. Ouyang's views and would like to add a few points.

In terms of war tax rates in various countries, the current excessive profit tax rate is indeed not high. After the outbreak of the European War, the standard rate of income tax in the UK was raised to 37.5%, and together with sur-tax and excess-profit tax, the tax paid by income earners should exceed 80% during the last European War. In Japan, after tax system reform, the tax rate of the income tax system has been increased to 70% or even more than 80%. For personal income, in addition to classified tax rates, a progressive comprehensive tax is levied; the highest tax rate for personal income above 5,000 yen reaches 65%. According to the calculations of Mr. Shioami Saburo, the general income tax combined with classified income tax paid by individuals with income around 800,000 yen reaches more than 70% of their income. Moreover, for corporate income, there are four types of taxes levied. For corporate profits that account for 30% of capital, the total tax amount paid reaches more than 80% of the income.

According to the combined calculation of our country's excessive profit tax and income tax, the tax paid by profit-making enterprises, in any case, does not exceed 60% of the income; compared with Japan's exceeding 70% or 80% of the income, it still feels low rather than high. The people of our country should know that the implementation of the current excessive profit tax aims to adjust social distribution and stabilize wartime finance; it is not only for the needs of wartime finance. In this extraordinary period, the burden on our country's merchants is still much lighter than that on Japanese merchants; it seems that, both emotionally and rationally, they should not say anything else besides paying taxes according to the law.

As for the argument that half of the profits earned by merchants are due to currency fluctuations, so excessive profit tax should not be levied. However, those who are severely affected by currency fluctuations are by no means limited to the industrial and commercial sectors; it also affects general creditors and salary earners. Even if the profits gained by the industrial and commercial sectors due to currency fluctuations are not as reliable as they were a few years ago, they are already fortunate compared to the sacrifices suffered by creditors and salary earners who have no recourse. Therefore, in my humble opinion, the newly established excessive profit tax rate in our country is not too high in terms of the needs of wartime finance and the fairness of the wartime burden.

Currently, there are many places in the country with special circumstances; in special areas, the payment of various taxes has to rely on the voluntary actions of merchants. High rates of income tax are also unfamiliar to the merchants of our country; therefore, the implementation of the excessive profit tax this year may actually encounter difficulties. Mr. Pan's proposal to reduce the tax rate, based on these practical difficulties, does indeed have its reasons. However, the excessive profit tax is a nationwide tax law, and it is not appropriate to amend it hastily due to the special circumstances of one area; but in order to achieve widespread and excellent tax collection results, the financial authorities may consider some flexible measures. As far as I can see, there are no more than three flexible measures: one is incentives, the second is persuasion, and the third is special exemptions. Speaking solely of incentives: those who are in special circumstances but actively pay taxes can be given generous bonuses or given honorary commendations. According to the 25th year of the Republic of China, when the income tax law was implemented, the tax authorities also stipulated that those who withhold salary and remuneration and securities deposit income tax would be given a bonus of one-fifth as an incentive. According to reason, merchants in special areas who voluntarily pay taxes deserve far more incentives than the mere labor of withholding taxes for the government; it can be called appropriate to immediately give generous bonuses. In fact, the so-called generous bonus is nothing more than allowing taxpayers to pay less tax. In terms of persuasion: the government should issue a general order to various public organizations and associations to widely persuade taxpayers, which will certainly have considerable effect. As for the special exemption: it is already stipulated in the Excessive Profit Tax Regulations; that is, industrial and commercial enterprises that have suffered war losses or have moved from war zones to the interior are temporarily exempt from paying excessive profit tax. The application of this method should be as broad as possible in special areas; in order to show the government's understanding of the merchants' difficulties. All these points are practical flexible methods in terms of tax collection, and they must be implemented appropriately to cope with the special domestic environment; the financial authorities should pay attention to this.

### On Foreign Merchants' Stocks

— Zhang Zongyou

Introduction

Foreign merchants' stocks should not be the object of investment for Chinese merchants. If one intends to try investing, the nature should be investment rather than speculation, so the selection is particularly strict; one must seek which meets the principle of stability? Which meets the principle of profitability? Which combines both? After considering carefully, then proceed to purchase. Everyone seeks stability, so in peacetime, its fluctuations are very slight and also very rational. Until the national army retreated westward and the sea fell, the strategy of speculation suddenly flourished, from foreign exchange to gold, to others, and finally to foreign merchants' stocks. At first, one did not feel it strongly, but when the European War broke out, floating capital that had escaped early to the outside world returned again, and the wind of speculation became more intense. Jewish merchants came with capital, and stock speculation was like adding fuel to the fire, becoming even more out of control! Chinese people followed suit, as if drunk or dreaming. If this continues, how can the amount of our country's precious capital flowing into the hands of Western merchants be calculated? Newspapers and magazines are not lacking in warnings, shouting loudly, but speculators are stubbornly unrepentant, and an unhappy end is probably not far off. Fortunately, they should wake up quickly!

Market Overview

Foreign merchants' stocks in Shanghai are traded centrally at the Public Exchange (established in 1905, reorganized in October 1929 into its current state, located at 16 Central Road). The exchange currently has 84 foreign brokers and only 10 Chinese brokers! There are 104 types of listed stocks traded daily. Among them, there are 8 financial stocks, 5 insurance stocks, 9 real estate stocks, 4 dockyard, wharf and transportation stocks, 8 public utility stocks, 4 cotton mill stocks, 10 bonds, 36 rubber stocks, and 20 other stocks. Every week, except for Wednesday afternoons without trading, Thursday mornings for settlement without trading, and Saturday afternoons without trading, it actually trades for four and a half days per week. Business hours are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM every day. On Thursday afternoons, trading opens a quarter of an hour earlier. Although trading takes place at the Public Exchange, customers who are not members are not allowed to go to the exchange at 16 Central Road, but can only trade in the foreign firm where their broker is located. At the opening, the Public Exchange uses radio to broadcast the current stock prices to various foreign firms. The foreign firms directly listen in and post announcements on the blackboard. Customers use this as a standard to entrust brokers (not brokers) they know to buy and sell on their behalf. The broker informs the foreign firm of the order, and the foreign firm reports it to the Public Exchange by telephone, where its staff members buy or sell on its behalf. Trading takes place at the Public Exchange. The staff member reports back to the foreign firm, and then informs the customer, and a transaction is completed. After the transaction is completed, a contract is signed on the same day. By the settlement period, the buyer delivers money and receives the stock, and the seller delivers the stock and receives money. If the purchase and sale are completed within the same settlement period (the settlement period is on the Thursday of the week after the transaction date), only the difference needs to be settled at the settlement period, which is called profit (loss). The so-called "hat snatchers" are those. The commission charged by the Public Exchange is very high, calculated according to the transaction price. For those at 5.1.00, it is .01 per share; for 1.00-2.00, it is .0.2.0; for 2.00-3.0, it is .02; for 3.00-4.00, it is .04; for 4.00-5.00, it is .05; for 5.00-7.50, it is .06; for 7.00-10.00, it is .075; for 10.00-20.00, it is .10; for 20.00-30.00, it is .15; for 30.00-40.00, it is .20; and for those above 40 yuan, it is 5%. The commission charged for a single transaction is always several tens or hundreds of yuan.

Trading Psychology

In today's crazy speculative situation! Everyone is looking for the price to continue to rise, and their reasons are:

(1) In these extraordinary times, the business of various companies is expected to be good, and high dividends can be expected.

(2) Since the value of legal tender against foreign currencies has generally declined, the stock is calculated in foreign currencies, and its amount after conversion to national currency is naturally high.

(3) Based on the balance sheets provided by various companies.

(4) Based on the tightness of foreign exchange on the day.

In fact, seeing high or seeing low is all the effect of people's hearts. If we talk about

(1) The company's business is prosperous, and high dividends can be obtained. Then the Shanghai Telephone Company, which we can see with our own eyes, is indeed prosperous! However, the dividend it paid last year was only 6 jiao in national currency, and now the market price has reached 32 yuan. Investing 32 yuan and getting 6 jiao in interest per year, can this really become a reason? Even with rubber stocks, taking Rubber (Ziangbe Rubber Co., Ltd.) as an example, the annual interest is only 1 yuan in national currency, and now the market price has reached 43 yuan, only yielding an annual interest of 2.5%. May I ask if it meets the principles of investment? And what about other small stocks that are not even this high? For example, Sihai Insurance, after paying a dividend of 3 jiao in 1933, has not been heard of since, but its market price has soared from 1.9 yuan (July 1938) to 16.4 yuan (current price). May I ask if there is any reason for this?

(2) The value of legal tender, the value of legal tender against foreign currencies is indeed lower than before. If the shilling stock should be 16 yuan according to the current exchange rate, do you also know that the company has no possibility of returning cash during the continuing operation? On the 20th of this month, Mr. Xin An of this newspaper's business news column said: Stocks can also be regarded as a kind of commodity. Since the value of legal tender has declined, the market price of stocks should naturally rise. Then the face value of 10 shillings of Rubber (Ziangbe) is 26 yuan according to the exchange rate. Even if the business is promising and people are optimistic, there is no reason to reach 43 yuan. And it is impossible to return cash during the continuing operation. What is it if it is not speculation? Once the exchange rate improves, what can be said? Mr. Xin An also said: The amount of monthly foreign currency dividends after conversion to national currency is quite considerable. But does Mr. Xin An also know that Daomiren (market price 18 yuan) only pays 3 jiao in national currency? Even if foreign currency is used to pay dividends, such as HSBC Bank shares, the current market price is 1,400 Hong Kong dollars. Assuming a Hong Kong exchange rate of 3.5 yuan, it is 4,900 Shanghai yuan. Last year's dividend was 5 pounds, calculated at 50 yuan per pound, which is 250 yuan (from which income tax should be deducted), which is only slightly more than 5%. How does it meet the principles of investment? I'm afraid it's not necessarily.

(3) If it is said that based on the balance sheets of various companies, the book value of certain companies should be several yuan; now it is only a few yuan, so it should rise. We don't have to nitpick, but whether the valuation of its property is accurate? Whether there are hidden war losses? All must be paid attention to, and cannot be blindly followed.

(4) According to the foreign exchange market price of the day, this is also a deceptive statement. Because the two are fundamentally unrelated. Brokers often tell customers: "Today's drafts are very tight, and stock prices are expected to rise; or today's exchange rate is relaxed, and the market price is slightly sluggish." In fact, it cannot be used as a standard. For example, on the 13th of this month, the draft was reported to have shrunk, and stock prices should have been high, but in fact the opposite happened; various stocks fell sharply. What is the reason? On that day, the author was also in a certain foreign firm and saw that people were panicked and extremely weak. The broker told the customer: "Today's newspaper published an article by someone, which affected people's hearts, and the floating positions were closed, so the market price fell." Some people suspected that Mr. Wei was short and deliberately made dangerous words. In fact, it cannot be blamed on Mr. Xin Wei. People's hearts are inherently floating. Mr. Xin Wei exposed the truth and exposed the inside story; there were too many floating positions and too many weak hearts, and they rushed to close their positions, so how could the market price not fall? For example, on the 19th, the foreign exchange rate turned loose after a few days of tightness, but the stock market rebounded. This proves that the tightness of foreign exchange also has no effect on stock prices.

In short, making a big deal or making a small deal is all caused by people's hearts. Those who bought in at 10 yuan plan to sell at 11 yuan; those who bought in at 11 yuan plan to sell at 13 yuan; as for how the stock itself is, it doesn't matter! How can the market price not be high? The higher the price, the weaker people's hearts, and there was the strange weakness on the 13th of this month. On that day, the author met a Western manager of a certain foreign firm and asked him the reason for the strange weakness in the market price that day; because the 13th was the second day of the red market, and according to past practice, it should have risen. He also said that it was because of the influence of a certain article in the newspaper that people rushed to close their positions, so the price fell. As for what the article discussed, it was indeed the truth; the big drop in price would come one day; and it was not far off. In addition, the manipulation of large households is also a major factor in the high market price. I remember that at the end of last month, the stock of a certain company soared from 1.6 yuan at the opening to a high of 3.6 yuan within an hour, and everyone was excited and rushed to buy in. At the same time, it softened back to 2 yuan. The maintainers then entered again and returned to 2.6 yuan. It was speculated that the day was done by × Savings Association and × households; A sold and B bought, B sold and A traded; small households did not察Follow along and buy, there were many buyers, and the two households suddenly vomited, and the price could not be supported. This is an example. Large households often use the method of wanting to catch but letting go. They clearly plan to absorb, but first release, and small households follow out, and large households take the opportunity to buy in cheaply. The big fish eats the small fish, which is extremely obvious! Small speculators also know what to avoid?

Conclusion

Today's high stock prices are all the result of crazy support and hard support; its danger is extremely great. If investors continue to be obsessed, a big fall will follow; the intensity of the disaster is unimaginable. May those who have profited turn back as soon as possible and close their positions as soon as possible! Move their precious capital and invest in the interior; it is both stable and profitable, and it is also beneficial to the future of the war of resistance and the national economy. Speculators, should you wake up quickly?

February 29th of the Republic of China at Soochow University

### Market Knowledge Consultant

Mr. Chen Wumin's letter: Please answer the following two small questions to dispel doubts.

(1) The last time the British exchange rate reached 3.25 pounds, the price of gold bars was slightly over 4,800. Now the British exchange rate should be above 4 pounds, why has the price of gold risen to 4,880 yuan? What can be explained?

(2) Is there any difference in value between the Central Exchange and British pound notes? If calculated according to the closing price of the British Exchange on February 16 (see the report on the 17th) of 4.15625, each pound should be worth 240÷4.15625=57.72 yuan in national currency, but why is the British pound only worth 53.5 yuan on that day, a difference of as much as 4 yuan, is the calculation method wrong or are there other reasons?

Here is a brief answer:

(1) After the European War, the British pound has actually depreciated. Therefore, the previous connection between the British exchange rate and the price of gold is no longer applicable today; but today the British exchange rate and the price of gold are too far apart, and the main reason is still speculation; there is no reason to explain.

(2) The supply and demand relationship of drafts determines the exchange rate, and the market price of foreign currency is calculated from the exchange rate. However, foreign currency itself also has its own supply and demand relationship, so the exchange rate and the price of foreign currency will not be consistent. As for the value of foreign currency being much cheaper than the market price of drafts, in addition to the decline in the heat of foreign currency speculation, the main reason is still the impact of the European War. Because paper is smaller than hard currency, who would be willing to hoard a piece of foreign paper currency in Shanghai that cannot even buy a pack of matches? And the country that issued this paper currency is in wartime. Because of this, foreign paper currency that was previously hoarded is now trying to be disposed of. Since the supply is large, it far lags behind the market price of exchanges.

Mr. Fang Junzhi's letter: I would like to ask for your advice on the following questions.

(1) What is the "cost of living index," what is the meaning of the word "index," and what is the word in English?

(2) I often hear the words "bull" and "bear" in the exchange, what do they mean, please explain in detail, what is the word in English?

(3) What is "floating capital," what is the word in English?

The question is beyond the scope of market knowledge, and I will not answer it as an example. Here is a brief answer:

(1) The cost of living index, in English, is Cost of Living Index Number. The original meaning of Index in English is index finger. Humans use the index finger when pointing: therefore, the term Index Number has the meaning of indicating the number of things. The Chinese translation as index is very suitable. The cost of living index is a number that indicates the increase or decrease in the purchasing power of maintaining living supplies. The function of this index is to correct nominal wages and make them suitable for the increase or decrease in the purchasing power of money; so that actual wages do not actually undergo abnormal changes.

(2) The English word for bull is Overbought Bull, which refers to speculators who buy first and then sell. The English word for bear is Oversold Bear, which refers to speculators who sell first and then buy. This kind of selling and buying is all short selling and short buying. The delivery of actual goods is rare.

(3) The English word for floating capital is Unemployed Capital, which refers to funds that have no investment object and float on the capital market.

Mr. Mao Zhenhuan's letter: I found that in a weekly supplement of your newspaper last October, there was a method of calculating the market price of yellow surplus based on shillings. The formula is as follows:

In the February 16th issue of your newspaper's business news column, it was also stated that the ratio of the price of gold to foreign exchange should be 4,790 yuan according to the closing price of British gold that night, but the market price was 4,865 yuan, which was 70 yuan higher; if the settlement price of the US exchange was 5,070 yuan, it was only 200 yuan lower, etc.

(1) Now I have calculated according to the above formula (for the settlement price of British gold), it is 4,730 yuan, which is in line with the market price of the day, and it can be seen that it is more than 130 yuan higher, which is inconsistent with what is stated in your newspaper. I don't know what method your newspaper used to calculate the latter, please answer.

(2) What formula is used for the settlement of the US exchange, please answer.

(3) According to the market price on February 16, why is the settlement price of British gold higher, while the settlement price of US exchange is only lower (what does the word only mean), please answer.

Mr. Yao of this newspaper will give a brief answer as follows:

(1) You mistakenly believe that the standard gold is refined gold, because the purity of the standard gold is 15 parts per thousand lower than that of refined gold, which leads to a difference of 60 yuan.

(2) (3216÷black market exchange rate×, 0015)+346÷black market exchange rate＝refined gold market price

(3) According to the meaning of the word only, it shows that the price of gold is close to the US exchange settlement price; although it is not as high as the British gold settlement price, it is actually getting closer and closer to the low price and less and less lower.

(4) Please ask an expert to answer the US exchange settlement method separately.

Mr. Zhang Peide: Thank you for inquiring about the origin of a certain publication; the editor does not know the details, so I am sorry that I cannot reply.

### Food Rice prices slightly rebound by half a yuan

The rice market quickly turned downward. Yesterday, it showed a state of hesitation, because general merchants saw that the market had repeatedly fallen, and they had lost money according to the fixed price. They were unwilling to let go lightly, and tried their best to resist. However, the actual sales of shops had not yet recovered, so the way out was also few and far between. Those who were anxious to respond urgently purchased goods and had to seek from merchants, so the shouts of the merchants were quite high when they were asked. However, because the sales were limited, it was difficult to mention enough. Whether it was Saigon, fire twisted, etc., the price was only half a yuan or so better. If Saigon was quoted at 47.5 yuan, fire twisted was 46.5 yuan, Tokyo sharp tip was 43 yuan, small twisted was 43.5 yuan, mixed broken was 35.2 yuan, and the closing market was similar, but the situation seemed softer than the early market. The way out for glutinous rice turned sluggish, and it was seen to be small-faced. Jintan goods were only 42.5 yuan, and Danyang goods were 41.5 yuan, which was half a yuan lower than before. A total of more than 1,300 bags of thick and thin japonica rice were transferred from the Hongkou district. Those who made secret deals were afraid of the strict penalties imposed by the Public Concession in recent days and did not dare to act rashly as before. It is said that there are few who are doing business, and the price is not much higher than the previous market.

### Sugar Market Coarse white slightly rises

Fish skins arrive one after another, and sales are still active. The price of original goods such as public fish skins is 180 yuan for the high grade and 140 yuan for the next, which is 30 yuan higher than the previous market. However, white fish skins must be cleaned by artificial shoveling, which increases the cost and must be sold for 200 yuan, which is 70 yuan higher than before.

### Hardware US strip iron transactions are frequent

Although yesterday was a holiday, hardware transactions were not affected by it. Door-to-door purchases are still popular. Among them, US narrow strip iron is even more active. Dozens of boxes have been traded, and most of them have been pre-approved and will be delivered after customs clearance today. The opening price has not decreased. For example, the price of patterned ones is 105 yuan per 200 pounds, and the price of larger sizes is about 115 yuan per box. The price of fine patterns is only 95 or 6 yuan. It is heard that the goods are still being shipped from overseas to Shanghai, so there is no need to worry about the goods running out. The can factories, toy factories, and cigarette companies on this street are the main customers in the Shanghai market, and the merchants have nothing to mention.

### Medicinal materials Galangal will be sold out

Overseas anecdotes about food, clothing, housing, and transportation

### Overseas Anecdotes

— Nian Yun

In ancient Greece, people did not use napkins to wipe their faces after eating. Instead, they used bread to wipe their mouths, and then threw the bread to the dogs.

Near the capital of Bulgaria, there is a large tree with very lush branches and leaves. The trunk is twelve meters in diameter and has a large, rotten hole in the center. Someone built a room inside the hole and turned it into a café. Tourists flock to it, and it has become one of the country's famous attractions.

Recently, someone in the United States invented wooden clothing, using pine tree stems woven into cloth. The material is very strong, and then made soft through scientific methods. When worn, it is as light as thin silk, but as durable as leather.

A canned beef company in Canada recently hired a person specifically to taste raw beef. His name is John Barber. Only raw beef that he deems fresh can be made into canned food, and his salary is $200 per week.

### The Origin of Cuff Buttons

— Wan Nian

There is a legend about the buttons under the cuffs of suits:

In 1812, French King Napoleon led an army of 500,000 men to conquer Russia. The weather was extremely cold at that time, and the soldiers' noses ran with clear mucus from the cold. Everyone used their sleeves to wipe their noses, just like children wiping their noses. As a result, the uniforms became very dirty, and wiping one's nose with the sleeve was also unsightly. Napoleon felt that it was detrimental to military appearance, so he ordered that a ring of copper buttons be sewn onto the cuffs of the military uniforms. With this ring of copper buttons on the cuffs, it was inconvenient to wipe one's nose, and the soldiers changed their bad habit.

It is said that the buttons under the cuffs of today's suits evolved from this ring of copper buttons.

### The Crown of England

— Fen

Two years ago, when King George of England held his coronation ceremony, it caused a sensation worldwide. But how valuable that crown on the King's head actually is, I'm afraid very few people know!

The whole crown is made of pure gold, plus countless beautiful and dazzling diamonds, pearls, rubies, and sapphires.

The crown is inlaid with a total of two thousand eight hundred diamonds of different sizes, the largest of which is the famous "Cullinan" diamond, weighing a total of 309 carats. It is said that this diamond poses a great threat to the diamond market, and if it were ever put on the market for sale, its price would be impossible to determine.

This crown is also the world's most exquisite collection of pearls, totaling two hundred and seventy-seven, plus four huge rubies, eleven large emeralds, and sixteen sapphires, all priceless treasures! It is said that even if all the money in the world were gathered, it would not be enough to buy them.

However, the crown is not often worn on the King's head, because the abundant jewels on it make it very heavy - about five pounds or more. Its only use can be said to be the short few minutes of the coronation ceremony. After that, the King only uses a more ordinary crown. If he had to wear it all year round, then no one would want to be King.

### Chinese Bamboo Chopsticks in Italy

— Liu Lian

Under the leadership of Blackshirt Prime Minister Mussolini in Italy, the people's lives are extremely frugal. Even half a lira is carefully considered for its necessity and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, many consumer goods are placed in shop windows year-round without a single customer asking about them.

Recently, Chinese bamboo chopsticks have been seen in major restaurants and homes throughout Italy. The reason is that the knives, forks, and spoons they usually use for meals are made of steel, zinc, silver, or platinum, which are very expensive and inconsistent with the principle of thrift. They saw the bamboo chopsticks used by overseas Chinese during meals, which were light, convenient, and inexpensive. Therefore, families and entertainment clubs in the city of Naples announced to their members that they would all switch to using bamboo chopsticks and donate their metal cutlery to the government. However, since they are accustomed to using knives and forks, switching to bamboo chopsticks requires considerable practice. Therefore, some restaurants hire Chinese people to specifically teach customers how to use chopsticks. Some learn to use them freely in three days, while others cannot pick up food even after several weeks. Most interestingly, adults learn less easily than children over ten years old, and men learn less easily than women. To date, nearly ten thousand households in the city of Naples alone are using bamboo chopsticks.

### One Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In the current situation of soaring prices, trying to find bargains is like climbing a tree to catch fish, truly impossible to achieve. Even with dishes, whether meat or vegetarian, none are cheap. In the past, I would take a one-yuan note to the market and buy two meat and two vegetarian dishes, and still have some money left over. Now, not only is there no surplus, but it even exceeds the one-yuan price limit. However, there is still a comparison between cheap and expensive dishes, so I always choose the cheaper items to buy. For example, in the past few days, I could buy a small yellow croaker for 16 cents, and frozen ones were even cheaper. Two meals, lunch and dinner, could be managed with two fish. There are many ways to cook them, either fried, braised, or with sugar and vinegar, and they all taste pretty good. If there are many people in the family and you want it to last longer, then add some pickled vegetables. If you're tired of braising them, cut the pickled vegetables into small pieces, add a few pieces of lard, and stew them together, or cut them into slices, add a little lees and Jiaozhou vegetables, add more soup, and make a bowl of steamed yellow croaker soup with lees, which is also very delicious.

Monday: Pickled vegetable stir-fried shredded pork, braised carp, stir-fried bok choy, tofu flower with bean curd dregs.

Tuesday: Onion shredded beef, preserved egg with chives, braised vegetarian assortment, scallion oil shredded radish.

Wednesday: Salted meat tofu soup, pickled vegetable small yellow croaker, fried dried bamboo shoots with fried dough sticks, cold dressed cabbage.

Thursday: Sweet potato beef cake, steamed yellow croaker soup with lees, stir-fried bamboo shoots with shepherd's purse, vermicelli with fried tofu.

Friday: Mussels stir-fried pork slices, braised small pomfret, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe, spinach tofu soup.

Saturday: Soybean sprouts with beef, sweet and sour fried yellow croaker, pickled vegetable mung bean sprouts, stir-fried shepherd's purse.

Sunday: Braised mutton, fried ribbonfish, stir-fried water celery, stir-fried radish.

This is a caricature of current affairs drawn by the Frenchman A. Gnillaume. In the picture, two women, A and B, are sitting face to face, knitting. A says, "Do you know how disappointed Ms. Mei is?" B eagerly asks what happened. A says, "It's a pity that her car was not requisitioned, meaning that the car is too old and cannot be sold in time!"

### Family Bicycle

— Jun

An American inventor in Chicago, C. Steinlanf, has recently created a family bicycle, where the riders can still enjoy all the comforts of home. The inventor controls the bicycle from the top, his son pedals to push the bicycle forward, his wife sits in the middle of the bicycle, operating a sewing machine, and his young daughter sits in a comfortable small chair in the front of the bicycle, like a tour guide. The whole family of four, young and old, are all on the bicycle and can still work. According to Steinlanf, the bicycle is very sturdy, but bystanders cannot help but have some doubts about this point.

### Nest Houses of New Guinea

— Xiong Kou

New Guinea is a small island in the Pacific Ocean, located northeast of Australia, east of Java, and south of Guam. The island was originally connected to Australia, but after several crustal movements, it gradually separated from Australia. It is located south of the equator, so the climate on the island is very hot, and most of the year it is surrounded by heat waves. Because it is located in the tropics, plants and animals are also very lush and thriving. In particular, ferocious beasts such as lions and tigers are rampant, and the natives on the island cannot live in houses on the ground, so they have to build their comfortable nests in the high trees.

Most of the islanders of New Guinea live in these nest houses. The nest houses are built on trees that are not very thick, but those trees are very tough. The nest houses are made of thatch, and the style is very simple, similar to the Jiangbei grass sheds in Shanghai, but they are on trees. At the entrance of their nest houses, there is a wooden ladder for them to go up and down. This is completely like a large bird's nest. If a hurricane arises, the nest house may be blown away with the wind. Therefore, the comfortable nest in the minds of these natives is not very comfortable after all.

### Seventeen Ways of Walking

— Qiao

The Journal of the American Medical Association, published in Chicago, contains an article entitled "Seventeen Ways of Walking," which describes each walking posture one by one, with strange shapes that make people laugh when reading it. The record is as follows: 1. Swaying: The big toes of both feet point outwards when walking (i.e., the splayed-foot gait in Chinese slang). 2. Hopping: Walking with a shrug and a hop, up and down unevenly, caused by excessive fatigue of the muscles in both knees. 3. Hesitation: Walking slowly, mostly caused by wearing low-heeled shoes. 4. Crooked shoulder: Caused by one foot pointing outwards, resulting in an unbalanced body. 5. Stumbling: The toe lands before the heel. 6. Stiff: The body is tall and symmetrical. 7. Bent legs: Not allowing the toes to point outwards in order to correct the accompanying thigh movements. 8. Heavy tread: The heels hit the ground loudly. 9. Ghostly: No movement in the upper body and arms. 10. Forced: The arms hang close to the sides of the body, the steps are short and stiff. 11. High-stepping: The big toe is raised high when walking, lifting the whole body. 12. Thievish: The head enters before the body when walking, like peeking. 13. Shoulder-carrying: The shoulders are raised high, and there are quite a few people like this. 14. Chair-back posture: Walking with a forward and backward leaning posture. 15. Heel-tapping: The heel strikes the ground with a sound when walking. 16. Kangaroo-like: The upper body leans forward, walking quickly.

The above sixteen types of walking postures are all incorrect, but everyone cannot avoid one or several of them. Only the last type, according to research results, is considered the most rational and standardized. This seventeenth type is to keep the shoulders and pelvis in a straight line, and the head maintains a slightly backward position.

### Being a Free University Student for a Day

— Xue Mei

I graduated from middle school last summer and didn't have the opportunity to go to college, but my desire to learn has not diminished. I always wanted to go to college to study one day, but I still haven't had the opportunity. Are universities really the monopoly of the propertied class? I thought. This semester, when the schools started one after another, I suddenly thought that since I didn't have the money to go to university, why not run to the university to take classes for free for the first few days of the semester, to observe and listen to the lectures of the professors? After all, the school wouldn't lose anything because of it.

Having made up my mind, I chose a certain university to go to class. I knew that they started classes on February 17th, so I ran into Cishu Building early that day and walked into a classroom at random, sitting in the back row. There were still ten minutes before class, and the male and female students were seated one after another. After a while, the bell rang, and a professor wearing glasses walked in. I heard someone next to me say that this was Dr. Li, a Ph.D. in economics who had returned from studying in the United States. Only then did I realize that this class was economics. After taking attendance, he first reviewed the lessons taught last semester, and then assigned the extracurricular homework for the next class. He said, "If there are no questions, we will end the class." Everyone dispersed in a rush. For the second class, I still sat in this classroom, but the students had changed. The class bell rang, but the professor was not seen for a long time. The students left one after another. After sitting there for an hour, another group of students changed in that classroom. This class was Chinese. The Chinese professor said, "This semester we will read the 'Collection'," "'Collection' is a kind of emotional article and is also very interesting." He also said, "I forgot to bring the lecture notes today, and I will formally lecture next time." This professor spoke very softly, and it was difficult to hear clearly from the back.

The last class was zoology. The professor was also a doctor, and the material was similar to what I had learned in middle school, except that they used English textbooks. This professor lectured for a full hour. Before leaving, he took attendance and said, "Next time I will arrange seats for you, so as not to waste so much time taking attendance every time."

Following the crowd out of Cishu Building, my mind was filled with dreams of being a university student. Although I didn't have the opportunity to go to college, taking these four free classes gave me more experience in university life.

### Three Yuan Saves a Life: The Buddhist Comrades Association Gives Tickets to Distribute Congee, Announcing to All Benefactors

— Ci

Master Fan Cheng and Layman Fan Gunong of the Buddhist Comrades Association of this city, in view of the soaring prices in Shanghai and the difficult lives of the poor, have specially organized the distribution of congee tickets, which began on February 12th. It is reported that by the end of the lunar February, the fourteen congee shops in the two concessions have been expanded to eighteen, and 300,000 more congee tickets have been printed in order to facilitate the poor to eat nearby. Standard bowls have also been made and distributed to each congee shop. Each ticket is worth one bowl of white congee, costing five cents (recently changed to six cents due to the high price of rice). The number of people who bring tickets to the congee shops to eat congee every day is quite large, and its convenience has the following points: (1) The congee distribution time is from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day, which is longer than the time of setting up a congee factory, making it much more convenient. (2) The spring cold is bone-chilling, and sipping congee warms the body, which is enough to resist the cold. (3) The association has printed a large number of congee tickets for donations from all walks of life. Each yuan is worth 20 tickets, and it is easy to donate in units of two yuan. The donated tickets can be distributed by the donors themselves, or entrusted to the association for distribution. If you donate rice tickets, those standing on the street generally sigh that there is no pot to cook. Congee tickets are more convenient. (4) If you meet a beggar on the road, it is also convenient to give them a congee ticket instead of money. (5) Spending three yuan a month is enough to save a life. The cost to me is not much, but it greatly benefits the people. At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls and cinnamon and people are struggling to make a living, I hope that enthusiastic people in society will jointly support this good deed. The association's office is in the Fabao Hall on Hardoon Road. The donation collection points are: Guohua Bank in Baxianqiao, Zhongfu Bank at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Muir Road, and Southeast Trust Company at 134 Avenue Edward VII.

### A Night Middle School

— Hui Qun

In the situation where the cost of living is increasing day by day, ordinary middle and lower-class families simply cannot afford the education expenses for their children. For elementary school students, they can still tighten their belts and save money to cope with the difficulties for their children, but the huge tuition fees for middle school make parents feel distressed, resulting in many children dropping out of school. I am also a poor student. After graduating from elementary school, I couldn't afford to continue my studies. Fortunately, I heard about a night middle school for the poor from a friend. This middle school is the afternoon department of Minzhi Middle School, which is dedicated to helping ordinary poor students. The curriculum level is exactly the same as that of ordinary middle schools. Only the class time is changed to after 5:00 PM, and the tuition fee is even lower than that of elementary schools. Therefore, I am writing to inform my poor and out-of-school friends.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21: Mixing Wool and Fiber for Managing the Economy, Using Machinery to Assist Literary Endeavors

Ye Songfen said, "In this way, your little sister can also go to school, and you don't have to go back to teach her. You also don't have to go home for meals. Your older sister can help her when she comes back from school. This is just a proposal made by your father. Think about it, and if you don't think it's suitable, we can think of another way." Jiang Jingrong went back and discussed it with his mother. His mother naturally agreed with this method. She also felt that delivering newspapers was too difficult. He had to get up before dawn to squeeze into the newspaper office to pick up the newspapers, or he would be late. Moreover, regardless of wind, rain, heat, or cold, there was no avoiding it for a single day. When delivering to the homes of the readers, think of how vast Shanghai is. He had to walk more than a dozen miles a day. It would be fine if he had a bicycle to ride, but he couldn't afford one. A pair of cloth shoes would wear out in less than ten days. One day, he gritted his teeth and put on straw sandals. Poor thing, that day, two blisters as big as lotus seeds appeared on his feet. Even more, one day, it happened to be pouring rain in the morning. When he returned from delivering the newspapers, he was soaked all over, like a drowned chicken. His mother changed his clothes for him while tears streamed down her face like pearls from a broken string. He was, after all, her only son. He was only thirteen years old, and because he was a fatherless child, he had suffered so much. Now that she heard that there was this method, where he could work as an apprentice in a silk weaving factory in peace and learn some skills, even without a stipend, she would be willing. Therefore, she strongly urged Jiang Jingrong to agree to this matter. Jiang Jingrong had no choice but to obey his mother's orders and go to work at the silk weaving factory. However, Jiang Jingrong was a child who had been forged in hardship. It seemed that everything was a learning experience for him, and he was also focused on the weaving industry. Ye Songfen's father was very protective of him. Because he still needed to learn various applied knowledge, he sent him to a tutoring school to study English, mathematics, and various common knowledge in addition to his work. His mother still did some needlework at home, and he also received a stipend of ten yuan per month. In the past, when the cost of living was low, an income of thirty yuan per month was enough to live a hard life. His two younger sisters were also able to go to school, which was what made him happiest. In less than ten years, Jiang Jingrong became an important employee in their factory. He himself did not study in middle school, but his two younger sisters both studied in middle school. At this time, Ye Songfen had entered university. According to his father's suggestion, he felt that they were from a silk weaving family and should still follow the path of the silk weaving industry, and he wanted to send his son abroad to study textile technology.

### Who's the Culprit?

— Yin Lu

After the price of coal briquettes became extremely expensive, the citizens hated the coal briquette manufacturers. So, the seven famous coal briquette manufacturers published a joint advertisement in the newspaper, urging those who had placed orders with them to pick up their goods within ten days, so as not to harm the citizens by stockpiling more than 20,000 tons of coal briquettes. The citizens, after reading this advertisement, realized that they had wronged good people, and immediately praised their wise behavior in considering the democracy.

Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, an advertisement from coal briquette stack ticket holders to the coal briquette trade association was found in the newspaper, saying: When going to the seven coal briquette factories to buy goods, they originally wanted to buy spot goods, but the factories refused to deliver spot goods on the pretext and only issued stack tickets. They didn't deliver spot goods themselves, but said that the stack ticket holders didn't pick up the goods. Now that they are urged to pick up the goods, don't go to pick them up so they don't have to deliver them, and they can maintain the price of 110 yuan per ton.

After reading this advertisement, people became suspicious again. Are the seven factories refusing to deliver the goods for orders and stockpiling them separately? Or are the stack ticket holders hoarding and not delivering the goods to the market? In other words, who is the culprit? Each has their own reason, and from the citizens' point of view, one of them must be stockpiling, either the wife or the husband, and one of the two must be the culprit. Now that both parties have placed the responsibility of stockpiling on the other party, making it impossible for the citizens to see who is right and who is wrong, I think the local authorities and community organizations should investigate this matter to clarify the truth.
