Editorial

### Is the Second Phase of the European War Beginning?

Although there have been repeated rumors that a major battle on the Western Front in the European war is about to break out, so far, both sides' strategies have been to "hold firm as the best form of offense." All efforts have been focused on how to win over neutral countries, and how to carry out economic blockades and counter-blockades; in short, how to defend in order to weaken the other side. However, although the military confrontation is only visible in the heavily fortified Western Front, the diplomatic and economic offensives have spread throughout Europe, even beyond Europe, with tentacles reaching far into the entire world. After a period of seven months, the diplomatic and economic wars can be said to have reached a fever pitch. In Europe, from the Scandinavian countries in the north to the Balkan countries in the south, although the sounds of gunfire are not heard in those countries, and they are still able to maintain their neutral status on the surface, the major powers in the conflict have not let them go, making their situation increasingly difficult. The drifting smell of gunpowder may trigger their powder kegs at any time. Their subjective "neutrality" will soon lose its complete neutrality objectively as the economic offensive of the belligerent countries unfolds. Recently, at such a turning point in the situation, British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill said in a broadcast speech on March 31: "The war is about to become more intense, but no matter what, we will never be discouraged. We know that the people of France and Britain must make their greatest efforts in the future." Churchill did not specify what kind of war he meant by "the war is about to become more intense." However, according to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on April 2, the Allies are determined to strengthen various blockade policies; and the British government will do its best to cut off the supply of Scandinavian iron to Germany, and warn neutral countries against helping Germany; this is tantamount to implying that if neutral countries help Germany, they will suffer a terrible fate. This declaration is by no means an empty threat. What has already been seen in the facts are: (1) A note to Norway, informing them that the Allies will implement a tighter blockade, prohibiting any ships from carrying wartime contraband through Norwegian territorial waters; and that mines have been laid in certain areas of Norwegian territorial waters. (2) French blockade chief Monnet and British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross held talks on strengthening the blockade, making important technical decisions. (3) British Foreign Secretary Halifax summoned envoys stationed in the Balkan countries back home to give instructions; and began negotiations with envoys from the Balkan countries stationed in Britain, in order to make the trade of the Balkan countries lean towards Britain and France, and transfer the various materials originally supplied to Germany to Britain and France. With its decisive and vigorous posture, and its policy of combining grace and power, the main purpose is to seize neutral countries and make Germany unable to obtain raw materials economically and collapse on its own. Under this "tightening," Norway bears the brunt, and declared last night that it opposes the measures of Britain and France, and at the same time lays mines in its territorial waters to maintain its neutrality. Before we know its nature in detail, it can be regarded as Norway's proper and fair self-defense measures; but in fact, what is the difference from participating in the blockade against Germany? This is a subtle phenomenon, and to know the consequences, we must look to the future!

As for the Balkan countries, sandwiched between Germany and Italy, it is difficult for them to get rid of the intrusion of German economic power. Although Britain and France want to provide assistance to these countries "when Germany violates the rights of neutral countries," there is a considerable distance in space and time between Britain and France and the Balkans, and in the actions of Britain and France towards the Balkans. This is indeed a difficult factual problem. Since the Balkan countries have the lessons of Poland and Czechoslovakia, no matter how sympathetic they are to Britain and France, they may not have the courage to immediately change course in response to Britain and France's declared determination to strengthen the blockade, given Germany's economic demands. From this, we can speculate that the achievements that British and French policy can expect in the Balkans, at least, are not immediate. The European war originally had two possible developments. As of today, it is a natural conclusion that the flames of the European war will first spread to the Scandinavian countries.

At the beginning of the war last year, British warships penetrated into the east of the Shetland Islands at the mouth of the Baltic Sea, which demonstrated one aspect of the British naval strategy. Originally, in terms of the number of naval vessels, according to statistics at the end of September 1938, the United Kingdom alone had a total of 301 warships of all classes, while Germany had only 65, a ratio of almost five to one, a huge difference. British ships totaled over 1.3 million tons, while German ships totaled 135,000 tons, a ratio of almost ten to one, an even greater difference. Such a disparity in strength is a fact as solid as steel. Now, for the sake of the Scandinavian Peninsula, that is, for the sake of Norway's neutral status, Britain and Germany will engage in close combat in this area. In this area, all diplomatic, political, and economic wars, as well as so-called propaganda or nerve wars, have been put aside at this stage, and the navy is the only main force. We cannot imagine Germany making a desperate naval battle with Britain in this area, but imagine Britain's strict blockade in this area. The success of the blockade should be no problem.

The European war has been going on for seven months now; and this time, with Norway as the center of the issue, it will develop into the beginning of the second phase of the European war!

(11) Councilor Hu Shiqing and 55 others proposed that the government clearly explain the meaning of "territorial integrity" to encourage morale and benefit resistance. It was resolved, in essence, as follows: "This council believes that the meaning of territorial integrity refers to the entire territory of the Republic of China and is undoubtedly clear.

### Japanese Schoolchildren's Anti-Communist Test

Tokyo – 6,283 Japanese elementary and middle school students answered questions from the Japanese Anti-Communist Friendship Association. Seventy percent supported Germany's victory, only twelve percent supported democracy, and the remaining eleven percent did not care who won.

Suma continued, "I certainly hope this news is true, but as I think about it, the turn of events is not like that." Suma denied the news that Britain had demanded that Japan stop trading with Germany, saying that stopping trading with Germany would be a violation of neutrality. (Eighth Dispatch, United Press)

### Britain and France Officially Announce Laying of Mines in Norwegian Waters; Tensions in Northern Europe, War Imminent; Norway Protests Severely, Demands Removal

London – The three areas of Norwegian territorial waters mentioned in the British and French government communiqué this morning where mines have been laid are all very important areas close to the coast, not large in area, each controlling a bay, a harbor, the most important of which is near Bodo, controlling the entrance to the West Bay and the port of Narvik in the Arctic Ocean, where Germany ships out Swedish iron ore. These two mine-laying locations are both north of the main European shipping routes, and the southernmost one is at Stetland at the entrance to the North Bay, 110 miles north of Bergen. The third area is about 120 miles northeast of Stetland, near Kristiansund between that location and Narvik. According to Reuters, the minefields in Norwegian territorial waters have been successfully completed by British and French fleets in cooperation at dawn. According to responsible sources, these minefields are specifically aimed at Germany and have nothing to do with neutral countries. It is expected that the trade in iron ore between Narvik and Germany, even if not completely halted, will be severely hit. However, it is reported that the purpose of laying the mines is to deal with other trades, not limited to iron ore. Britain has received information that German ships often sail through territorial waters to evade British contraband zones and control zones, and German attacks also sneak out to sea in the same way. It is generally hoped that today's mine-laying action will prevent the recurrence of the above situations. Responsible sources also pointed out that the actions of the Allied countries are beneficial to all neutral countries, just like Britain and France. Although the Allied countries' mine-laying this time will be criticized as irregular and violating neutrality regulations, neutrality regulations must be respected by both parties to be effective. If one party often ignores them, it cannot be solely responsible for other parties to abide by them. Germany has almost destroyed all international law clauses that it can destroy, except for those adopted by the Allied countries today, because it is unable to destroy them. The Allied countries have no intention of expanding the war zone, but if Germany takes any action against Scandinavia, it will inevitably cause a severe reaction. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)

Copenhagen – The Scandinavian countries are increasingly terrified of the current situation, believing that even if they try their best to maintain neutrality, they will inevitably be dragged into the vortex of war due to the pressure of the great powers. News from London, Berlin, and Scandinavian capitals has caused newspapers to publish on their front pages records that the Scandinavian countries may be spared from war due to the peace between the Soviet Union and Finland. However, the current situation is making the Nordic countries more fearful than the consequences they had imagined from the previous British and French intervention in Finland. (Eighth Dispatch, United Press)

Oslo, Norway – This station has just broadcast the news that the Norwegian authorities have laid mines in their own waters starting this morning and have notified all countries of the boundaries of the minefields. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)

Oslo, Norway – The Norwegian government has just issued a declaration stating that Britain and France have laid mines in our territorial waters and their warships have entered our territorial waters. All of these actions violate our country's neutral status. We hereby solemnly protest and must demand that these countries remove these mines and warships together. Otherwise, our government will take all appropriate measures to deal with them. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)

Copenhagen – The "Berlingske Tidende" reports from Oslo that Norwegian Prime Minister Nygaardsvold met with Foreign Minister Koht this morning. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Norwegian Parliament held an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 this morning. According to the Scandinavian Telegraph Bureau, the British ambassador to Norway, Mr. Dormer, and the French ambassador, Mr. Baelen, visited the Norwegian Foreign Ministry at 7:00 this morning. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)

Paris – The British and French governments jointly submitted a note to the Norwegian government on the 5th of this month, which stated that Germany's actions in Norwegian territorial waters are sufficient to harm the interests of Britain and France, and it is no longer appropriate to tolerate them. Therefore, they declared their right to take necessary measures to avoid letting Germany have the convenience of obtaining resources in Norway and decided that any ship carrying wartime contraband would not be allowed to pass freely through Norwegian territorial waters. For this reason, mines have been laid in the areas of Statlandet, Bud, and Vestfjord in the country's territorial waters. In the future, any ship that enters these areas will bear all risks. However, British and French warships will patrol outside the territorial waters of these areas within 48 hours after laying the first batch of mines and issue warnings via radio to ensure the safety of maritime navigation. In addition, the British and French governments also jointly issued a statement and broadcast it via radio, stating that in recent weeks, German attacks on merchant ships of various countries have increased and their brutality has increased day by day. More than 150 ships of neutral countries have been sunk by Germany, and about 1,000 people of neutral countries have died as a result. The German side has even violated the universally recognized rules of war by attacking fishing boats and lightships to exert its terror tactics. On the other hand, Britain and France have never destroyed or damaged ships of neutral countries, nor have they killed people of neutral countries. Not only that, but they have also rescued many lives and innocent people who have been harmed by Germany, even German pilots and submarine crew members who have committed inhumane acts have been rescued by Britain and France from drowning. The actions of the two sides are as different as heaven and earth. The International Convention recognizes that belligerent countries have the right to take appropriate measures to deal with it when the enemy deliberately takes illegal actions. Therefore, the British and French governments believe that they have the right to take all actions deemed appropriate to deal with the current situation. As for the losses suffered by neutral countries' shipping, Norway accounts for the largest part. At this time, the German government is still demanding that the Norwegian government allow it to freely use Norwegian territorial waters to facilitate German commerce. The Norwegian government believes that it is forced to send warships to escort German ships within territorial waters. It is known that under German pressure, whatever policy Norway adopts to form the current situation is something that Britain and France cannot tolerate for long, that is, they cannot allow Germany to obtain convenience from Norway and obtain the main resources necessary for combat, thereby placing Britain and France in a dangerous and unfavorable position. Norway has been notified that it declares its right to take all necessary measures, as it is necessary for the victory of the war. It is believed that world public opinion will be able to understand its motives and the difficulties of having to do something. In short, the goal of Britain and France is to ensure that the various principles on which the survival of the small countries of Europe depends are implemented. As for the mines placed in Norwegian territorial waters, they are not enough to hinder Norwegians and Norwegian ships from freely entering and leaving the coastal ports of that country. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)

New York – The Republican "New York Volkszeitung" praised the decision of Britain and France to take various measures against neutral countries to intensify the blockade of Germany, stating, "Only after Germany is defeated will there be hope for the revival of international law. Britain and France, in order to achieve victory, no longer abide by the international law that Germany has repeatedly violated. While it is regrettable, if this method is the only way to win, then those who truly support international law should not criticize Britain and France for doing so." (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)

### Neutral Countries' Attitudes Closely Watched by Germany; If They Acquiesce to Blockade, Retaliation Will Be Implemented; German Foreign Minister Invites Norwegian and Swedish Ambassadors for Meeting

Amsterdam – It is reported that German political circles are greatly alarmed by Britain's intensified activities against neutral countries. The government is concentrating on studying news and plans regarding the new situation, and German newspapers are full of articles with angry and scathing words criticizing Britain, pointing out that Britain's notes to Norway and Sweden are undoubtedly a threat and a diplomatic prelude to a major war. The German government expects that Germany will not have immediate confrontational actions. At present, it is only closely watching the attitudes of neutral countries. Many observers believe that the next scene in the war will be the entire turmoil in the Scandinavian Peninsula. German Nazi spokesmen have now warned all neutral countries, "Acquiescing to the blockade is tantamount to aiding the Allied countries." This is the gist of Germany's reaction after the Netherlands promulgated an order implementing the new Dutch-British trade agreement. Semi-official German sources said that the sudden announcement of the Dutch-British trade agreement was regrettable because Germany did not have time to study it carefully. However, the extent to which the Netherlands, as a neutral transportation country for Germany, has abandoned its rights and obligations is something that Germany must consider. Yesterday, Germany used newspapers and radio propaganda to tell neutral countries that Britain was recklessly implementing its evil schemes to harm Germany. However, neutral countries are now aware that the crisis lies not in the British plan itself, but in Germany's retaliation against those it believes are succumbing to the British plan. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)

London – Paris Radio announced that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop invited the Swedish and Norwegian ambassadors to Germany to the German Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon for a discussion lasting one hour. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)

Paris – "Le Matin" quoted news from Copenhagen, Denmark, saying that the German Foreign Minister summoned the Norwegian and Swedish ambassadors to Germany. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the German government believes that Britain and France intend to take action in the direction of Norway, so it is closely monitoring the situation. "The goal of Britain and France is to prevent iron ore from being transported to our country, but this is in Germany's interest, and we should naturally rise up to defend it." (Seventh Dispatch, Havas)

Bern, Switzerland – Swiss newspapers published a dispatch from their Berlin correspondent stating that Britain and France's active diplomatic activities and the joint submission of notes to Norway and Sweden have caused a strong impression in Berlin. The correspondent of the Basler Nachrichten said that according to the German authorities, Britain and France will lay mines inside and outside the territorial waters of Norway so that German ships carrying Swedish iron ore cannot sail back to their country via the Norwegian Sea. In addition, the German Foreign Ministry seems to be dissatisfied with the attitude of the Scandinavian newspapers when commenting on the British and French notes, pointing out that it is too passive and does not conform to Germany's ideal of neutrality, and said that these countries are in danger of inviting war, at which time Britain and France will be unable to protect them even if they want to. (Seventh Dispatch, Havas)

Copenhagen, Denmark – "Nationaltidende" quoted a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the position of the Scandinavian countries may undergo drastic changes. People in Germany generally believe that the neutrality of Norway and Sweden no longer exists. Britain and France will immediately take military action against these countries. On the German side, they do not want to allow Britain and France to strike first and are preparing to launch a sudden attack. However, these people only mentioned Sweden and Norway and did not involve Denmark, which is noteworthy. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)

### Sweden Shocked, Intensifies Neutral Guard

Stockholm - Following the news that Britain and France have laid mines in Norwegian waters, Swedish political circles are shocked, recognizing that the current situation is extremely delicate and believing that the maintenance of Nordic neutrality will be seriously threatened in the future. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Stockholm - The Allied countries' laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters is regarded by Swedish official circles as a violent violation of neutrality. No condemnation of this action is too severe. Leading articles in the local newspapers continue to speculate on the nature of the British note. Well-informed sources believe that its content is a warning that Scandinavia has been too easily subdued by German threats. The *Tidningen* reports that the British note is the first action in the Allied spring offensive, which has now expanded to the Balkans. At the same time, according to the Swedish Minister of Defense, as a result of the current situation, Sweden's neutral guard has been intensified. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Large Numbers of German Warships Head North Along the Norwegian Coast

Oslo - According to reliable sources, an unidentified warship was spotted this morning near Bud on the west coast of Norway. A large warship was also seen at Hustadvika, north of Bud. According to news from Bodø in northwestern Norway, coastal traffic has now been interrupted. Also, according to the *Dagbladet*, a large number of warships were seen heading north today in the Kattegat. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Oslo - It has now been confirmed that ninety to one hundred German warships were seen heading north this morning in the Kattegat and the Great Belt, including several large warships in addition to auxiliary ships and armed fishing boats. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Germany Tightens Border with Netherlands to Prevent Espionage

The Hague - The blockade of the German-Dutch border is becoming increasingly strict. Passenger and freight traffic has been reduced to a minimum. German authorities issue entry passports only in special circumstances. German women who marry Dutch men are not allowed to return home to visit their families, even to inquire about illness. A small number of Dutch workers operating in Germany are under close surveillance, and their time and reason for entering Germany must be investigated. According to observers, this measure by the German authorities is intended to prevent espionage. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### British Foreign Office Discusses Balkan Issues, British Envoys to Southeastern European Countries Attend

London - It has been officially announced that British envoys to the Balkan Peninsula will hold a meeting at the Foreign Office at 4:00 PM today, chaired by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Those attending will include the British Ambassadors to the Soviet Union and Turkey, as well as the Ministers to Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The British Ambassador to Italy will also attend. Another meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM on Tuesday. It is reported that the above-mentioned envoys will continue to meet and will hold at least one meeting at the Ministry of Economic Warfare. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - Responsible figures here recently stated that British envoys to Southeastern European countries are scheduled to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax twice, at 4:00 PM on the 8th and 3:00 PM on the 9th, for discussions, and then meet with the Minister of Economic Warfare, Mr. Cross. If necessary, they will also be received by Prime Minister Chamberlain. British Ambassador to Italy Sir Noel Charles and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir William Seeds (who has been on leave in the UK since January and has not yet returned to his post) will also participate in the discussions. According to political observers, this move is related to the various operational plans decided upon at the recent joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France, and is another launch of intensified economic warfare against Germany by the respective countries. It is noted that French Minister of Blockade Monnet consulted with British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross on intensifying blockade measures during his recent visit here. The British and French governments then jointly presented notes to Sweden and Norway. The economic and diplomatic offensive of Britain and France was indeed initiated with these two events. Whether the content of this note will be made public depends on the attitude of Sweden and Norway, but it has been clearly stated in this note that Britain and France have the right to take appropriate and effective measures to deal with certain German activities. The government authorities should brief the envoys to Southeastern European countries on all of this,

and subsequently Britain and France will develop trade relations with the Balkan Peninsula countries to ensure that the food and military raw materials produced by these countries are sold to Britain and France as much as possible, and no longer supplied to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

London - The British Foreign Office has summoned envoys to Southeastern European countries to return home for debriefing. Among them, Sir Reginald Hoare, the British Minister to Romania, arrived at Heston Airport this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Fierce Air Battles Between British, French, and German Air Forces, German Troops Concentrated in Various Regions

London - The British and French Air Force Headquarters in France announced that a squadron of British Air Force fighters encountered a large enemy fighter formation near Metz yesterday. The British aircraft immediately attacked, resulting in a dogfight at high altitude. A German Messerschmitt Me 109 was shot down. All British aircraft returned safely to their base near Polémoselle. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - According to the Air Ministry, British Air Force reconnaissance aircraft encountered enemy fighters yesterday afternoon while patrolling the North Sea. At least one enemy aircraft was destroyed, and another is believed to have been damaged. Two British aircraft did not return to base. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Berlin - The official German news agency stated that twenty-four British Vickers and Wellington bombers were attacked by German fighters one hundred miles north of Sylt Island. Two British aircraft were shot down, and the remaining aircraft were forced to fly west. No German aircraft were lost. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - Regarding the German claim that two British bombers were shot down during an air battle one hundred miles north of Sylt Island, there was no official report here last night. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Berlin - The German High Command announced that German aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights over the North Sea and northern and central France yesterday, and patrolled the German Bight and the Western Front. Twenty-four British bombers were discovered north of Sylt Island. German fighters shot down two British aircraft, and the remaining British aircraft fled westward. Multiple air battles occurred over the Western Front, with German fighters shooting down four enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft batteries shooting down one enemy aircraft. Three German aircraft are missing. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Paris - The French Army communiqué stated that air activity was very frequent yesterday, and five enemy aircraft were shot down, one of which was shot down by the British Air Force. There was also some artillery fire west of the Vosges Mountains. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - Reuters correspondent with the French Army reports that activity on the Western Front has clearly increased in the past two or three weeks. However, it remains to be seen whether this is a prelude to more intense action. Artillery battles at the western end of the front line have intensified, with three or four times more shells fired than a month ago. Observation posts, roads, and even villages between the two armies that had previously escaped destruction have now been subjected to relentless artillery fire. The work of the sappers is often hindered, so their actions are more cautious than before. A common phenomenon on all sections of the front is that attempts by both sides' patrols to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence have become increasingly determined, and therefore encounters are becoming more intense. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Paris - It is reported that the number of troops concentrated in various German regions has increased. France is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. According to well-informed sources, it is difficult to say whether the large number of German troops concentrated is intended to intimidate, or whether they intend to land on the coasts of Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### "Nerve War," Popular Slogan in Berlin: "Paris Will Sign a Peace Treaty"

Bern - The *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* of Zurich published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that a slogan is currently popular in Berlin: "Paris will fall in the first half of June this year, and a peace treaty can be signed on July 1." In reality, this is part of a "nerve war," and the panic and confusion of German public opinion can be seen from this. As the German authorities are currently stepping up military preparations and continuing to conscript soldiers, civilian life is being affected. The atmosphere in Berlin can be summarized as depressing and tense. The authorities, aware of the anxiety of the people, are issuing the above slogan to reassure them. Alternatively, Germany, due to the imminent intensification of the blockade by Britain and France, may be planning to take military action to retaliate, so they are preparing public opinion. It is also possible. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Issue of Adriatic Sea Blockade Under Consideration by Italy and Yugoslavia

Rome - According to well-informed sources here, Italy and Yugoslavia are currently considering blockading the Adriatic Sea to prevent all foreign warships from entering, so as to prevent the spread of war. Yesterday, the Yugoslav Prime Minister visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to discuss the possibility of this matter. Recent reports from Belgrade indicate that Britain may attempt to blockade the Adriatic Sea in the near future. According to news from Dubrovnik, the German ship *Angara* is currently transporting 4,000 tons of bauxite to Trieste, which will then be transported to Germany via Yugoslav railways. British warships are tracking the *Angara*. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

### Yugoslav Plans to Restrict Exports, Joint Committee to Be Formed for Discussion

Belgrade - Well-informed sources here say that the Ministry of the Army will join with relevant departments to form a joint committee to discuss export restriction plans, in order to ensure the economic prosperity of the country and national defense strength. The supply of livestock produced in Yugoslavia already falls short of demand, and the domestic industrial need for certain raw materials is particularly urgent. It is not appropriate to further sacrifice oneself to benefit others. After the establishment of this joint committee, the first task will be to find ways to restore export trade to pre-war levels, and then gradually reduce it. In this regard, when the Yugoslav economic delegation holds negotiations with the Italian delegation in Fiume tomorrow, it will propose reducing the amount of livestock exported from Yugoslavia to Italy. In addition, Yugoslavia's current barter agreement with Germany is not expected to be extended after it expires at the end of this month. If this is the case, Germany will suffer a major blow. According to the method agreed upon by both sides last autumn, Yugoslavia must sell 10,000 carloads of wheat, 2,500 carloads of flour, 45,000 tons of vegetable oil, 300,000 pigs, and a large amount of raw materials and metal products to Germany each year. From now on, Yugoslavia is determined to demand the cancellation of this limit, and to halve the amount of German goods imported into Yugoslavia, even if Germany applies pressure.

### Franco-Swedish Business Negotiations to Be Conducted

Paris - Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General Boheman, accompanied by banker Wallenberg, arrived here today and will conduct business negotiations with the French authorities. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Soviet Union Changes Agricultural Quota System

Moscow - Local newspapers published a decree signed by Stalin and Molotov stipulating changes to the quota for agricultural products. In the future, the quota for grains, rice, potatoes, vegetables, hay, and other items from collective farms will be based on the total area of the collective farm, and no longer on the cultivated area. The quota for meat, milk, eggs, and leather will also be based on the total area of grassland and pasture owned by the collective farm, and no longer on the number of livestock. The Soviet government hopes that after the implementation of this quota system, the number of livestock can be increased. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

### Another German Ship Sunk, Freighter *Angara* Quietly Leaves Yugoslavia

London - A German ship was intercepted by a British warship and scuttled. Its 41 crew members were captured and have landed at a port in northwestern England, and were immediately sent to a concentration camp for detention. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Belgrade - The German freighter *Angara*, carrying bauxite, quietly left the Yugoslav port of Dubrovnik last night, heading for Trieste, Italy. Yugoslav port authorities did not know that the ship intended to leave, nor did they know whether there was a pilot on board. However, it is believed that a pilot was tricked into boarding the ship. It is likely that the *Angara* intended to pass through Yugoslav territorial waters to Trieste. No British warships were seen off the Yugoslav coast. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

The Hague - The semi-official German news agency *Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur* recently issued a message stating that the Japanese commercial delegation in Moscow has been negotiating with the Soviet authorities on the demarcation of the borders of "Manchukuo" and "Mongolia" and fisheries issues for a long time, but no agreement has been reached.

The Japanese side submitted a draft outlining its views to the Soviet Union, but it was not accepted by the Soviet side. Negotiations for the conclusion of a new commercial agreement will continue, but they must proceed through normal diplomatic channels, handled by the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union and the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

### Japanese Youth Association's Coal Mining Campaign

Tokyo - Last winter, Japan experienced a coal shortage. The reason for this was that automobiles and buses were using charcoal as fuel. In addition, the general public, influenced by the electricity conservation movement, had returned to the ancient practice of using "hibachi" for heating, resulting in a sharp increase in charcoal consumption. In view of this, the Japanese Youth Association launched a charcoal collection campaign, calling on the entire country to participate. The authorities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education also provided encouragement and guidance, and subsidized various equipment. As a result, 2,511,399 youth members and 1,268,901 students responded, collecting a total of 14 million bundles of charcoal, each bundle weighing eight pounds, totaling 42,000 tons. This was distributed to the families of soldiers stationed in China and to public institutions. The remainder was supplied to areas lacking charcoal. During this charcoal collection campaign, youth groups climbed mountains and entered forests, enduring hardships and facing accidents, resulting in the deaths of three young people.

### Mussolini Inspects Orvieto, Delivers Speech

Rome - Prime Minister Mussolini inspected the city of Orvieto today and delivered a public speech in a certain city. He said, "The events we are witnessing have a very significant impact, but we believe we have sufficient strength to rest easy. No matter what happens this spring, our country will be able to cope with it calmly. Italian Fascists are vibrant and determined. Twenty years ago, they conquered an African empire (referring to Abyssinia) in seven months, and last year they liberated another nation in three days (referring to Albania). In short, the Italy we have created through twenty years of arduous struggle will prevail, no matter what difficulties it encounters." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Rumors of Ribbentrop's Intention to Retire, Suffering from Heart Disease and Under Treatment

London - *The Daily Herald* recently published a dispatch from its Antwerp correspondent stating that, according to German diplomatic sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop intends to resign and abandon his political career in the shortest possible time. The vacant position is likely to be filled by the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen. Ribbentrop felt unwell during his audience with Pope Pius XII in Rome and has been receiving treatment from renowned cardiologists ever since. His recent foreign policy failures have led to criticism from political opponents. It is believed that the reason for his intended resignation is related to this, and not to his physical condition.

### Canada Actively Training Airmen, Eden Makes a Statement

London - In response to reporters' questions today, Eden informed reporters that plans to train aircraft pilots and aviation experts in Canada, with the ability to successfully train 50,000 people each year, will soon be realized. Eden outlined this plan with a calm and confident attitude, and his words were almost unbelievable, as the purpose of the plan he described was to provide Britain and France with a steady stream of skilled pilots, in numbers that far exceeded common imagination. According to the air force training program under this plan, after all preparations are completed, 1,000 fully trained pilots will be successfully trained each week. According to Eden, most of these pilots are trained at Canadian aviation schools, with an expected 50,000 graduates each year. This does not include those trained in Great Britain and Ireland, or in Australia and New Zealand. Eden also said that the ways in which the Dominions are helping Britain to "win" are surprisingly numerous. The above-mentioned plan is just one example. In other aspects, such as manpower, food, raw materials, and money, are also flowing into Britain from the various Dominions. In Australia, for example, 90,000 soldiers are currently in training, and it has been announced that a complete Australian corps will be formed and sent to serve in Britain. The Australian division trained in Palestine may be combined with the 2nd Infantry Division. New Zealand plans to train thousands of new troops to expand its garrison in Egypt to a sufficiently strong level. As for Canada, in addition to training the air force, it also plans to form a complete corps. The 1st Infantry Division is currently undergoing advanced training in Britain and will soon be completed. The Union of South Africa is currently preparing to defend Africa south of the equator. The military expenses of each Dominion are entirely borne by the respective Dominions. Not only that, but all the Dominions are also working closely with Great Britain to implement an effective double blockade policy against Germany, that is, on the one hand, refusing to accept German exports, and on the other hand, closely monitoring to prevent raw materials from being transported to Germany. For example, the Dominions are also seeking to stabilize the exchange rate of the pound. However, what Eden is most excited about is the Canadian air force training plan. Eden believes that the importance of this plan cannot be fully understood, and says that its spiritual impact on Germany is comparable to the entry of the United States in the last Great War.

### Republican Party in the US Studies Foreign Trade, Advocates Organizing a Special Committee to Draft a New Trade Plan

Washington - Several Republican members of the House of Representatives recently advocated for the establishment of a special committee to represent Congress and public opinion in drafting a new plan for the United States' foreign economic and trade relations. According to Congressman Quillyhue of Massachusetts, tariff issues and foreign trade are currently handled separately by the tariff committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and the State Department. Once the special committee is established, it will conduct a comprehensive study and draft a regular plan before January 15, 1941, for submission to Congress for discussion. This "committee has an independent nature but is still subject to Congress. Its task is to develop foreign trade as much as possible without harming the interests of domestic producers. The above plan will be submitted to Congress for review, and if approved, the committee will be organized with five senators, five representatives, and five individuals who are not actively affiliated with any political party.

### US Socialist Party Selects Presidential Candidate

Washington - Yesterday, the Socialist Party selected Thomas as its presidential candidate for the next election, and Professor Kruki of the University of Chicago as its vice-presidential candidate. The Socialist Party conference here yesterday passed a resolution opposing war and dictatorship, as well as a general outline. The resolution stated that President Roosevelt's large national defense budget is actually preparing the United States for war. The Socialist Party conference also opposed the subcommittee's endorsement of economic aid to the Allied powers. The Socialist Party conference also opposed imposing an economic blockade on Japan, saying that this would lead to a Japanese-American war. The resolution strongly criticized President Roosevelt's policy, saying that he had failed to strictly adhere to neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War. However, the resolution strongly supported the continued anti-Japanese actions of the working class and advocated that the United States should allow the independence of the Philippines and other colonies.

### Britain Orders Military Aircraft from the US

London - The "Daily People's Voice" recently reported that Britain has ordered as many as 7,000 to 10,000 military aircraft from the United States, as well as various parts. Therefore, the special funds used by Britain to purchase aircraft from the United States, 200 million pounds, are almost exhausted. After the aircraft are completed, some may be flown across the Atlantic by pilots to Britain for use, but most will be dismantled, transported to Britain, and assembled within a week. All of these aircraft will be equipped with British-made machine guns, as they are of better quality than those made in the United States. According to Colonel Johnson, the Assistant Secretary of the Army, US aircraft factories can manufacture as many as 17,500 aircraft per year, which is unmatched by any other country.

### Neutrality Issues in Mandated Territories

Berlin - The "People's Observer" commented on the issue of mandated territories, stating that representatives from the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, and Belgium on the League of Nations Mandates Commission are very concerned about the Allied powers' manipulation of mandated territories. These neutral countries participate in the administration of mandated territories, and if the mandated territories also participate in the war against Germany, the neutral countries participating in the administration also bear responsibility. For example, Tanganyika increasing import taxes on alcohol to cover British military expenses violates the regulations of mandated territories, and the neutral countries on the Mandates Commission should also bear some responsibility. These neutral countries should also inquire about which country's forces Southwest Africa is raising an army to fight against. All of these are signs of illegal actions by the Allied powers.

### Sunspot Problem: Talk by Professor Martin of Seoul University

Tokyo - Professor Martin of Seoul University in Korea recently published a talk in the Japanese newspaper Huibunho on the problem of sunspots, stating that there are currently six major sunspots on the surface of the sun. Recently, radio stations around the world have experienced significant disturbances, and the reason for this is that, as early as two months ago, two days after the first earthquake in Turkey, he personally observed two major sunspots on the surface of the sun in southern Korea. This is related to the earthquake in Turkey and is not a coincidence. He had also studied sunspots before the great Tokyo earthquake in the past. At that time, there was an extremely large sunspot at 22 degrees south of the solar equator, and he immediately predicted that an earthquake was likely to occur, which was later confirmed. According to the results of experiments conducted by German astronomer Schwabe at the Tesuo City Observatory in 1851, sunspots reach their maximum point every eleven years, and an examination of medical history and past newspapers reveals a great relationship between sunspots and human epidemics. The following facts have also been proven to be true: (1) Several types of epidemics often spread from the east to the west of the earth; (2) From the Black Death in 1536 to the so-called "Spanish flu" in 1918, epidemics occurred repeatedly in between, with intervals that coincided with the eleven-year cycle of sunspots; (3) Some microorganisms that are normally harmless become toxic due to the influence of the electromagnetic force of sunspots. In addition, during periods of sunspot appearance, the mortality rate on Earth increases, and patients' body temperature rises and pulse accelerates, often leading to death even if the symptoms are not severe. In short, the area of each sunspot is hundreds of times larger than the Earth, and its electromagnetic force is truly astonishing. Unfortunately, the scientific community still has limited knowledge of its true nature. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Sexual Hygiene

### Marriage is a Reproductive Union

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Therefore, attention should be paid to reproductive hygiene.

The hygiene of married life not only affects the happiness of individuals, but also has a close relationship with the wife and the entire family organization. Therefore, if one only begins to study hygiene after marriage, it is like digging a well when one is already thirsty. Therefore, one should pay attention to oneself before marriage. Originally, the union of husband and wife is entirely based on reproductive desires. If sexual relations are removed, there is no such thing as husband and wife. The ancients said: There is no closer relationship than that between father and son, and no more intimate relationship than that between husband and wife. In fact, although father and son belong to the natural order, their affection is far less than that of husband and wife. Those who are more affectionate to their wives than to their parents account for nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand. Those who can stand alone and be more affectionate to their wives than to their parents account for less than one out of a thousand. Is it that the love of the natural order is not as good as the love of husband and wife? One only has natural affection, while the other contains sexual relations. Therefore, sexual relations are the only tool for uniting the love of husband and wife, and also the important point of attention for hygiene after marriage. If the husband and wife have no illness and can cooperate with each other in reproductive function, then they will love each other. Even if there are differences of opinion, they can always understand each other. This is what should be paid attention to.

As for the hygiene methods of reproductive function, even doctors cannot know everything. To discuss these facts, we must first have a simple description of sexual diseases. Among those most easily contracted after marriage, premature ejaculation is the most common. People who frequently have nocturnal emissions before marriage almost all find it difficult to avoid. Premature ejaculation is caused by dissipated energy, which is the act of ejaculating. Therefore, it easily causes conflicts in love. However, those who suffer from this can use youth gland endocrine therapy to completely cure it. If left untreated, the symptoms will become increasingly dangerous, extending to the whole body, such as pale complexion, thin muscles, throbbing headaches, mental fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, and infertility after marriage. Among the best youth gland hormone preparations on the market, the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Butt Kang", is the first choice. After taking it, premature ejaculation is eliminated, physical strength is restored, brain power is stimulated, metabolic function is promoted, muscles are strengthened, and complexion is ruddy. The potency of the drug is thorough, and it generates sperm and tonifies the kidneys in just four hours. The famous British doctor Dr. Stoke has been actively using this drug for many years. According to his words, the ingredients of "Butt Kang" do not contain impurities and do not irritate the stomach. Therefore, its efficacy is difficult for other tonics to match. Therefore, this product is the best medicine for those who are weak after marriage.

### From Theory to Experiment: A New Method for Treating Gonorrhea

— American Doctor of Medicine Huang Zhongchang

Today, when speaking of gonorrhea treatment, empty talk is not enough to convince people. Ordinary preparations are also unable to achieve results. If one only speaks of drug efficacy, one is bound to exaggerate. All of this is not the attitude of a scholar. Therefore, I do not adopt this approach. However, since I went to the United States to study, I have also devoted myself to the study of gonorrhea treatment. Using new scientific methods and corroborating them with my internship at the American Venereal Disease Hospital, the path to treating gonorrhea is mutually corroborated. According to my investigation, gonorrhea must have systemic anti-gonorrheal treatment to avoid leaving out any omissions. Because with this efficacy, it can energize every cell in the tissues of the human body to carry out its function of eliminating gonococci. Therefore, whether gonorrhea is new or old, such as local urethral gonorrhea, chronic prostatitis and orchitis, female vulvar gonorrhea, uterine inflammation, and gonorrheal leucorrhea, not only can they be cured quickly, but also systemic infections such as conjunctivitis, endocarditis, and arthritis can be quickly and completely cured.

Systemic anti-gonorrheal treatment is indeed the most thorough and ideal theory for completely curing all types of leucorrhea. Later, Dr. Peter of Germany adopted the strengths of many and diligently researched and invented the drug "Kelinnong." Its ingredients are made from specially made proteins, yellow pigments, and other ingredients. Therefore, taking it can energize cells and resist the phagocytic action of gonococci. Therefore, I had already admired and used this drug in the United States, and the directors of the gonorrhea departments in hospitals in the United States unanimously praised the miraculous efficacy of "Kelinnong." In acute gonorrhea, the efficacy can be seen within one or two weeks of taking this drug? Moreover, it can be eradicated in this short period. In chronic gonorrhea, it can also be eradicated in four or five courses of treatment. In terms of external medicine, the drug "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is also excellent as a urethral wash. ("Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold at Taihe Pharmacy)

### Coughing and Hemoptysis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Everyone knows that people with a phthisic constitution have unusually fragile lungs, which really cannot withstand any kind of vibration. During this vibration, the capillaries in the lungs rupture and bleed. This kind of vibration that causes the lungs to be affected is no greater than coughing. Therefore, coughing and hemoptysis have a close relationship. This is a very obvious matter. To prevent hemoptysis, one must first suppress the cough. Only the drug "Bufei Naer" can calm the cough within three hours. Therefore, taking this drug when warming up can prevent pulmonary hemorrhage. This is the correct result of my twenty years of experience.

### Gonorrhea Lecture: A Discussion of the Comprehensive Treatment of Gonorrhea

Outline of Gonorrhea Treatment

Gonorrhea is inherently a difficult venereal disease to treat. This is because the causative agent of gonorrhea—the gonococcus—possesses an extremely tenacious and combative ability. It can also hide in deep and obscure locations. Therefore, to use a certain method to eliminate gonococci, it is best to do so in the acute stage. However, it is not to say that once acute gonorrhea has passed, chronic leucorrhea cannot be treated. The practical aspect of treating gonorrhea is how to prevent the gonococci from penetrating deep inside. Once they have penetrated deep inside, how can they be quickly eradicated to cut off their reproduction and create a desperate struggle? To consume the patient's physical strength.

Discussion of Treatment Methods

The key to gonorrhea treatment lies in eliminating gonococci. However, the location of the gonococci must be determined through precise scientific diagnostic methods. Therefore, doctors should not rely on "an old horse knows the way" and abundant experience when diagnosing gonorrhea. A doctor's experience is certainly necessary, but it is still necessary to carefully examine the patient and then prescribe the appropriate medicine. It is especially important to adopt the strengths of various treatment methods and avoid their weaknesses. If one insists on using a certain treatment method for a disease from beginning to end, one is bound to be biased. I have treated gonorrhea for more than ten years and know the advantages and disadvantages of this.

Comprehensive Treatment

Because gonococci can escape in all directions and cause a variety of complications, a comprehensive and thorough treatment method is necessary. German static electricity therapy has a great effect of completely and thoroughly eliminating the nests of gonococci. In addition, the gonorrhea panacea "Kelinnong" is used to promote the subtle anti-gonorrheal phagocytic action of various cells inside the body. Therefore, compared with the general local surgical treatments, it is naturally safer and more thorough. If gonorrhea patients develop arthritis, German anti-gonorrheal blood serum can also be injected intravenously to eliminate gonococcal toxins in the bloodstream and break down the adhesions in the joints. Diagnosis hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty numbers will be given out each day, and each number will cost only five corners.

### Important Polish Archives: German Government Publishes White Paper

Eleventh Document

Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry has recently issued the eleventh document of important Polish archives, which is a document from Polish Ambassador to France Lucas Wisiz to his Foreign Minister on January 29, 1939. The original text is translated as follows: "On the 24th of this month, I had a friendly conversation with the US Ambassador to France, Belle, about the following: "Regarding the wording of the application submitted by the four powers and how Poland should respond, I have heard something about it. However, judging from the reports revealed in the newspapers and the information I have obtained from various sources, the British proposal seems very naive. Germany and Poland have vastly different strengths, and Britain is actually instructing Poland to work with Germany to find a compromise that would benefit Chamberlain's domestic policies. Even more foolish is that the British government has clearly expressed its desire to cooperate with the Soviet Union in order to adapt to Chamberlain's domestic policies. This attempt makes other countries feel that Britain does not want to protect the countries that have been threatened by Germany's new policies, but rather wants to make things difficult for Hitlerism. Its ultimate goal is not to maintain peace, but to overthrow Germany. All those who are familiar with Poland's policies know that the Polish government does not want to easily believe Chamberlain's promises and take adventurous actions. If the British government had already mobilized the navy and implemented conscription a few days before submitting the proposal, and France had also issued an order for a larger-scale mobilization, we could seriously believe that they were sincere in their cooperation. In fact, Britain and France have not taken such measures, so it can be seen that the British diplomatic negotiations are unlikely to succeed. I have read the original text of the British proposal, and the British proposal lacks careful consideration. The Polish government can only choose its own response. Hitler may use force to oppress Poland, in which case we can only respond with force. The result will be a European war, and in the initial stages of the war, Poland will be subjected to the full force of Germany's oppression. Not only is Poland's future bleak, but it is also unfavorable to Britain and France. If Poland wants to avoid conflict with Germany, it can only stop negotiations with Britain. Hitler will regard this as an exposure of the weakness of British and French policies, which will further encourage him to expand to Eastern and Central Europe. Sooner or later, war will still break out. If the responsibility for war or peace is placed entirely on Poland's shoulders, is this not naive? In short, Britain and France should bear the most important responsibility. If the British government fails to understand this situation today, a European war or even a world war will be difficult to avoid. Ambassador Belle was moved by what I said and asked me to repeat what I said again. He then asked me if Poland would accept an alliance if Britain and France proposed it tomorrow. I replied that I could not answer this question and pointed out that the focus was not on the proposals of Britain and France, but on whether Britain would take practical measures. Belle indicated that he shared my view. The next day, Belle told me that he had asked the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, to visit Chamberlain immediately to inform him of the situation and to emphasize the responsibility that the British government bears. On the 26th, Ambassador Belle spoke to Ambassador Kennedy by phone in my presence to listen to the details of Kennedy's conversation with Chamberlain. I firmly believe that Ambassador Belle's cooperation at this critical moment is beneficial to us. Therefore, I am detailing the situation to you for your consideration.

### Jiangyin Puppet County Magistrate He Peixuan Loses Composure

Changyinsha Correspondence, Jiangyin has fallen for two years and three months. Initially, the fallen counties of Su and Chang were urged by the Japanese to establish puppet county offices one after another. However, the people of Jiangyin are upright and deeply possess the legacy of Yan Dian Shi, and no one is willing to take up the post. Later, the Japanese intended to appoint gentleman Wu Tingyang and even sent a special car to Shanghai to bring him back to Jiangyin. Wu firmly declined. On December 24, 1938, He Peixuan became the puppet county magistrate. He, who is over sixty years old, has lived a secluded life since taking the puppet post. Since March of the first year, warning letters have flown in like snowflakes. A few months ago, He's nerves were suddenly greatly stimulated, and he became like a drunkard or a madman. His diet and daily life were greatly disrupted, and he has become mentally ill. Seeing He's actions, the Japanese decided to look for someone else to replace him. Coincidentally, Lai Lantian, who had previously served as the captain of the anti-smuggling salt affairs team, often engaged in salt affairs in Jiangyin. He is also nearly seventy years old and is a dim-witted old man. Therefore, he was favored by the Japanese. A few days ago, Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, accompanied Lai Lantian to Suzhou to meet with Chen Zemin, the puppet governor. However, the exact date of Lai's inauguration is still uncertain.

### Letter

To the Editor of the Shen Bao: I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Hong Qiliang, who has requested that I address a matter of concern. We have read a news item in the Shen Bao of the 30th of last month stating that the traitorous merchant Hong Qiliang of Dinghai was executed by firing squad. We were shocked to read this, as the facts stated are largely inaccurate. Although my client's name has been deliberately altered, the pronunciation is the same, which is greatly detrimental to his reputation. The Dinghai Grain Company is a branch of the Ningbo Grain Company. Although my client was in charge of its operations, all actions were taken in accordance with resolutions. He believes that he has not committed any faults. Dinghai fell, and the company was also shut down. Since then, he has resigned from his position and has not been involved in any external affairs. How could he dare to hoard rice and create shortages, and even give people an excuse to confuse the facts? We have been specially commissioned to write this letter to request a correction. We sincerely hope that you will take this matter into consideration and allow us to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid misunderstandings and clarify the facts. We would be deeply grateful. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Shou'e, April 5th.

### Ministry of Education to Implement New Social Education Plan Starting in July This Year, Establishing Guaranteed National Schools in Every Security Region Across the Country, Eliminating Illiteracy for 21 Million People Within One Year

(Chongqing Airline News) Regarding the overall plan for social education facilities of the Ministry of Education, according to Chen Lijiang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education: (1) Before July this year, social education in various parts of the country will continue to promote civic education in accordance with the established plan. After July, in accordance with the outline of the new county system organization throughout the country, each security region should establish a guaranteed national school. Each school must include adult classes and women's classes, and the existing social education institutions will be merged. It is estimated that from July this year to the end of June next year, 21 million illiterate people should be eliminated nationwide. (2) Reorganize and improve the national county public education halls. The public education halls are the central institutions for implementing social education and are responsible for guiding and instructing the guaranteed national schools throughout the county. The Ministry of Education has transferred and trained the directors of public education halls in counties across the country. The training in the Northwest and Southwest provinces will be divided into five phases and is expected to be completed within this year. (3) Promote art education, including music, drama, and fine arts. This year, four touring drama education teams will be established, and two additional touring teaching vehicles will be added, for a total of three, to tour various places and teach in depth among the people. A National Conservatory of Music will be established and is expected to be completed in July or August after the summer vacation this year. The conservatory will be divided into three departments: one for training, gathering students from elementary school to high school who excel in music and training them; the second for research, bringing together Chinese and Western music experts to organize ancient music and study Western music; and the third for performance, establishing vocal and orchestral groups to experiment with songs created by the Ministry of Education and to train completed students to tour and perform in various places, increasing the national interest in musical arts. (4) Electrification education, divided into film and broadcasting, to produce films with anti-war consciousness on a large scale and show them in various counties. In the future, every guaranteed national school must be equipped with a radio receiver to promote government orders and allow students to listen to domestic and foreign news. In addition, in order to create a large number of teachers for national schools, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated that teacher training classes be added in the third grade of junior high school. Those who are 17 years old or older, have an average score of 70 or higher, and are willing to serve as teachers in national schools can choose to study, it is said.

### More Than 60,000 Uneducated People in Chongqing

Complete Elimination Planned for This Year, Fifth Session of People's Schools to Open on Schedule

(Chongqing Aviation News) According to a survey conducted by the Wartime People's Education Promotion Committee in September of the 27th year, there are approximately 100,000 uneducated adults in Chongqing. As of mid-January of last year, the People's Education Committee had conducted four sessions of people's schools, each session lasting two months. The teaching targets were entirely adult citizens. The first session had 227 classes with 3,688 students, the second had 323 classes with a total of 15,774 students, the third had 101 classes with a total of 3,825 students, and the fourth had 156 classes with a total of 11,189 students. The total number of people educated in the four sessions was over 34,000. This fell far short of the initial goal of 400 classes per session, totaling 20,000 people, and the objective of completely eliminating illiteracy within a year. There were many reasons for this, such as (1) financial difficulties, (2) the lack of diligent assistance from the Baojia heads, and (3) a lack of deep understanding among the people at the beginning. Currently, there are more than 60,000 illiterate people remaining. The Wartime People's Education Promotion Committee plans to completely eliminate them this year and has increased the budget to 70,000 yuan, still for four sessions, with each session expected to educate 15,000 people. The fifth session of people's schools is scheduled to open on the 15th of next month, with a total of 300 classes. The People's Education Committee will run 100 classes, the Teachers' Service Corps of the Ministry of Education will run 100 classes, and various government agencies will be entrusted to run 100 classes. This year, there will be significant improvements in the quality and quantity of students and teaching materials. The People's Education Promotion Committee convened more than 300 teachers from all the people's schools and invited Director Chen of the Ministry of Education and Director Bao of the Chongqing Social Affairs Bureau to speak, providing detailed instructions for future work. They also encouraged the teachers to first establish their faith and get close to the people, so that Chongqing's people's education could serve as a model for the rest of the country.

### Ministry of Education Schedules Regular Higher Normal Education Conference

### News from the Institute of Psychology, Academia Sinica

Research on Physiological Psychology, Neuroanatomy, etc.

The research work of the Institute of Psychology, Academia Sinica, is divided into three departments: physiological psychology research, comparative neuroanatomy research, and industrial psychology research. Before the July 7th Incident, physiological psychology research focused on the electrophysiological research of the visual system (from the retina to the visual center of the cerebral cortex), the study of vascular sensory organs, and the study of the inner ear balance sensory organs. Comparative neuroanatomy research focused on the study of the cerebral cortex and the creation of monkey brain maps. Industrial psychology research focused on the selection and training of workers in textile factories and the improvement of working conditions. Since the July 7th Incident, most of the textile factories have been destroyed or fallen into enemy hands, and the research work of industrial psychology has become almost impossible. After the Institute moved to Guizhou Province, the research work of physiological psychology had to be slightly changed due to the lack of basic laboratory equipment in the inland. Recently, the work in this area has focused on studying the development of swimming and balance reflexes in tadpoles (frog embryos) and the impact on this development after removing various parts of the nervous system and sensory organs before hatching. This type of work requires very few instruments and does not require special equipment. Furthermore, those who have studied embryonic behavior in the past have not paid attention to the impact of removing various parts of the nervous system and sensory organs on the development of behavior. The Institute is currently preparing a new laboratory in Guizhou.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Positions Continue to be Released

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. There were very few fluctuations in the black market for British and American exchange rates. The futures market showed an increasing easing trend, while the spot market was no different from the previous weekend, because most operators abandoned the near term and focused on the far term, but the action lacked persuasive power, resulting in a minimal impact. The morning opened flat as before. Soon, Huahing took the lead in releasing positions, and foreign banks accepted them, so the buying and selling were even. After 10 o'clock, Huahing continued to release positions on the market, and speculators also mutually released positions, so the futures market already showed signs of easing. By the end of the evening, transactions were sparse. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices all showed slight firmness.

The Easing Trend of Futures is Gradually Intensifying

At the beginning of the morning, overseas exchange rates, British vs. American, Shanghai, and French, were all flat. American rose half a point against British, unchanged against Shanghai, and rose 1.25 against French. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning: British gold 4 shillings 1.125, American exchange rate 6.15625 yuan, both flat from the closing price on Saturday. At the same time, futures opened and were also stable. After the opening, Huahing first came to release positions, with Huahing doing spot American exchange rate 6.15625 yuan with foreign banks, and the market remained flat. HSBC's listed prices were announced and did not move. The balance tax on silver was announced and there was no increase or decrease. After 10 o'clock, Huahing continued to release positions, and speculators followed suit and sold, causing the futures market to harden at this time. The American exchange rate for this month could be settled at 6.0935 yuan. Foreign banks benefited from absorbing Huahing, Continental, and Shanghai's American exchange rate for this month at 6.09375 yuan, and the May exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan. Chinese merchants sold American exchange rate for this month to foreign banks for 6.125 yuan. There were no major changes until noon. Spot prices were similar to the morning opening prices. Futures British gold and next month's prices all eased by 0.015625, and American exchange rates also rose by 0.03125 each.

Little Up or Down in the Afternoon

The market situation was very quiet, with little up or down. American banks once entered Huahing Continental's American exchange rate for this month at 6.125 yuan. Later, American banks sold American exchange rate for this month to Foreign Banks at 6.125 yuan. The closing results were: spot British gold and American exchange rate remained at 4 shillings 1.125 and 6.15625 yuan, American gold for this month at 4 shillings 0.078125, American exchange rate at 6.09375 yuan, May British gold at 3 shillings 0.70984375, American exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan, with no difference from the spot prices on Saturday. British gold and American exchange rate for this month each eased by 0.015625 and 0.03125, and May also hardened by 0.015625 and 0.03125.

Hong Kong British and American Exchange Rates Stable

Gold Market Tired and Unable to Rise, Falling into the 400 Yuan Range

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation: tired and unable to rise. The continuous decline has reached six days, because the foreign exchange market's flatness tends to ease, and people's interest in buying gold has decreased considerably. Furthermore, because the environment has no stimulation, the price is difficult to increase. The initial opening immediately pressed down 15 yuan to 5,410 yuan, which was still the day's high. The situation was even worse later, because foreign exchange futures were reported hard again. Silver number gangs and retail investors gathered to sell, and the supply and demand disparity was huge for a time, falling miserably below the 5,400 yuan mark to 5,375 yuan. Fortunately, the securities gang tried their best to maintain it, and gold shops and money changers also absorbed it from time to time. The floating remaining chips gradually tightened, and finally closed at 5,397 yuan. As a result, it fell 28 yuan lower than the previous weekend. The total transaction volume was more than 2,000 taels. Gold ornaments in silver buildings did not change. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

Spot Gold Has Declined for Six Consecutive Days

Since the beginning of the morning, the popularity of each bar (ten taels) was still tired, and there were many sellers. First, the securities gang sold ten taels to the silver number for 5,410 yuan, which was 15 yuan less than the previous closing. Later, most buyers were on the sidelines. On the contrary, the selling trend was stronger. Gold shops and retail investors competed to sell. Soon, it fell another 30 yuan. The gold shop sold a total of 50 taels to money changers for 5,380 yuan. But at that time, a certain money changer agreed to scoop it up, and the gold shop also followed up with purchases, while the number of sellers gradually decreased. The price returned to 18 yuan. The securities gang sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 5,398 yuan. After that, because foreign exchange futures were reported hard, those who entered suddenly stopped their activities. The silver number gang tended to release, and it fell 23 yuan. Silver numbers traded 50 taels with each other for 5,375 yuan. Then the money changer and the gold shop saw the price was cheap and scooped it up again, rising 22 yuan again. The gold shop entered 30 taels into the money changer for 5,397 yuan. At noon, the silver number gang's bulls came out again, and the money changers also intended to sell at that time, and it fell 17 yuan again. The silver number sold 10 taels to the money changer for 5,380 yuan as the noon closing price. The initial opening in the afternoon was flat and tired. First, the money changer sold 10 taels to the silver number, still for 5,380 yuan. After a while, the securities gang suddenly came to search and lift it up by 8 yuan. The securities gang entered 30 taels into the money changer for 5,388 yuan. However, a certain silver number's intention to sell became stronger, and it sold dozens of taels again, pressing it down again by 6 yuan. The silver number sold 30 taels to the money changer for 5,382 yuan. Later, the securities gang came to dig in again, and the silver number had no intention to sell, and other sellers saw the decline, and then returned to a high of 15 yuan. The securities gang entered 20 taels into the gold shop for 5,397 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell another 28 yuan compared to the previous weekend. It has been small for six consecutive days, totaling 158 yuan. The full-day range was only 35 yuan. The cash gold shop's brand gold selling price is higher than the spot price, and the purchase price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little opening.

Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged

The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in silver buildings remained unchanged. Datongxing still hangs 545 yuan. Xin Tongxing is the same as the previous price, and the purchase price is reduced by about 15 yuan.

Discount Rate Reduced by Another Four Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Rebounds by Two Points

Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate continued to decline. Every thousand yuan in the morning fell from 64 yuan to 60 yuan, and in the afternoon it slightly recovered to 61 yuan, which was 4 yuan less than the previous Saturday. The Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate was posted at 2 corners in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 2 points.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Differently

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: British and American gold pounds followed the spot market price and continued downstream. American dollar notes continued to fall due to the rise in the forward foreign exchange rate. The initial transaction was 16.15 yuan, and then it fell further to 16.07 yuan. Later, it once returned to 16.12 yuan, and in the afternoon it fell back to 16.07 yuan. In the afternoon, it once rose to 16.14 yuan, and in the evening market it fell back to 16.11 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes remained flat. There was a slight demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose slightly. French franc notes had a very firm trend. There was no shortage of demand for Singapore and Philippine notes, and the market price rose consistently. Japanese gold notes were very strong in the morning, once reaching 1.33 yuan. The afternoon saw a slight rebound, and the evening market was 1.32 yuan. The demand for Korean notes was still strong, and the evening market was as high as 1.1125 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both fell by 0.5 yuan, American dollar notes fell by 0.06 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.01 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.002 yuan, Singapore notes rose by 0.1 yuan, Philippine notes rose by 0.05 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Soar

Yesterday's black market for securities was still firm. Although transactions were slightly reduced, the trend turned into a shortage of chips due to the lack of large-scale sellers. The difficulty of bank loans was also a major reason. The ninth lottery of Type C will be held tomorrow morning, so afternoon trading today will be calculated excluding the winning numbers. Although the number of lottery draws is still only eight, people's hopes of winning the lottery are more enthusiastic than last time, so if there are no changes in the environment after the lottery, the market price is not easy to fall sharply. In the past, there was a tendency to look small, but later, because Nos. 20 and Qianfu both made large purchases, the general public's sentiment changed, and Shengda Runli and retail investors also tended to buy. On the market, only Lianyi Jiufeng Changji and sporadic retail investors sold at high prices. The morning market price rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, Nos. 20 and Xinfu still bought heavily, and No. 16 also bought Type B enthusiastically. Others such as Zhenkang Shuntai Yichang Jiufeng also received considerable income. Although Tongkang Hongda Jiufu supplied a lot, they could not overwhelm the multi-party momentum. As a result, they all rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan, and the total number of transactions was about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 100 shares of Hanyang Iron and Steel Company were traded at a price of 4 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association was extremely large because it was the beginning of the trading week. The afternoon market was exceptionally lively. As soon as the price rebounded, buyers came to pull it up. British Union shares rose sharply, once reaching 44 yuan, but this price attracted profit-takers to sell, and the closing price returned to 42 yuan. Yangzi Silver Company has been neglected recently, but yesterday it became energetic and gained new help. 70,000 shares were traded, and the price rose to 17.5 yuan. Measuring the huge amount of transactions, the rising trend does not seem excessive. The trading volume of Ewo Cotton Mill shares was not large, and the closing price also rose to 47 yuan. The opening price of China Reclamation shares was 17.6 yuan, and after the opening, it went straight to the sky, creating a high price of 19.4 yuan. Although this price attracted a lot of profit-taking, buyers still absorbed it at a price of over 19 yuan at the close, refusing to let go. The popularity of this share can be said to be extreme.

Fewer rubber shares were traded, but the public also seemed to have considerable interest in this, and the closing price was firm.

### Yarn and Cotton: After the Suspension of Futures Trading, the Rising Trend of Spot Yarn Resumes

The yarn market has turned from tired to tight. This is because demand in the South China area continues unabated. Therefore, the rising trend of Chinese yarn has resumed. Although futures trading has been suspended, those with abundant general economic conditions are absorbing and hoarding spot goods.

The morning opening of spot yarn was tired due to the mutual settlement price of the April term. The price of 20s Double Horse spot yarn initially traded at 1,112 yuan. Later, it was heard that customer demand was good, and the Guangbang's intake was still smooth. There were quite a few people searching in the market. Later, spot goods gradually rose to 1,148 yuan, which was 33 yuan higher than the previous day. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 1,565 bales, and the market was still trending upward. Yesterday, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Fujian. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Same Trade 860 Hong Kong 660

Inland 25 Xiamen 10

Jiangxi 10 Statistics 1,565

### Japanese Merchants Purchase American Cotton

Cotton transactions were flat, but American cotton transactions were particularly strong. Japanese merchants in factories purchased it strongly, while Chinese factories had a narrow intake, so the market was stable and quiet. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left:

Middling 175.75 265.50 Same Trade purchased 700 pieces

Also 277.75 East China purchased 100 pieces

Also 268.00 Inside and Outside purchased 400 pieces

North Pacific 204.00 Same Trade purchased 220 bales

Dazhongji 133.00 Also 100 pieces

Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially failed to revive due to rain in the drought-stricken area and the selling of spot merchants, as well as the weekend. As a result, the closing price fell by 2-3 pounds per sound compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, surged 10 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose 3-5 pounds per sound.

Although Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were firmer yesterday due to the strengthening of the Indian market, the yarn price tended to be flat again due to the slight easing of the exchange rate. The intention of the industry was that the silver supply on the market was extremely tight, and the future cotton market was difficult to grasp, and the factory recently had a large number of Indian cotton orders, so the intention of the industry became weak and temporarily planned to wait and see. Yesterday's trading was quite quiet. The factory delivery prices converted to American exchange rate of 6.125 yuan are as follows:

20s American Middling 286.75

Also Also Lower Grade 276.15

30s Also 301.60

Also Also Lower Grade 292.50

42s Also 306.50

Also Also Lower Grade 297.00

### Oil Market: Hong Kong Syndicate Actively Deals in Crude Oil, Sales Prices Soar by Six Yuan, Soybean Oil Also Lifted

Crude Oil: Yesterday's oil market saw considerable fluctuations. Initially, soybean trends were stable, so people were generally cautious and the market saw little change. Later, inquiries for peanut oil suddenly came from Hong Kong syndicates, bringing news of rising production prices, which excited the market. With bullish sentiment prevailing, sellers aggressively raised prices, resulting in a sharp increase of six yuan compared to the closing price before the weekend (the 4th). 500 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 74 yuan, and 2,500 tins of Yantai canned oil were traded at 96.5 yuan.

Soybean Oil: Due to the drastic fluctuations in crude oil, the market jumped by two yuan at the opening. Partway through, some powerful players seized the opportunity to sell, which dampened market sentiment and briefly caused a decline of one or two yuan. Although the market still ended up two yuan, its underlying momentum lacked stable strength. Yesterday, a total of over 600 barrels of Dalian oil were traded (price details in the Market Prices column), along with 60 barrels of Qingdao oil, 30 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 10 barrels of Bengbu oil, and 300 dan of Dayou factory oil. Yesterday, 70 cases of soybean oil arrived from Qingdao. Furthermore, 16,000 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Quanzhou today (the 9th), along with 3,000 bags of fertilizer to Fujian.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo Refined Sugar Continues to Be Sluggish

According to a Dutch telegram, raw white sugar (C.I.F. & KG) increased by 0.03 Dutch guilders, calculated at 9.10. Because the telegram arrived late, the local guild's quotation has not yet improved. It may rise today. Current spot prices for 24 coarse granulated white sugar are 62 yuan for new foreign warehouse goods and 61.8 yuan for old goods. Taikoo granulated sugar remains sluggish: B mark West Warehouse at 68.1 yuan, CW mark West Warehouse at 67.8 yuan, CX mark West Warehouse at 67.5 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse at 67.2 yuan, and HX mark West Warehouse at 67 yuan. Eastern warehouse prices declined by 0.03 yuan. There were no other changes. The national sugar guild opened a small amount of darker Zhangzhou red sugar at 40 yuan. Yesterday, 1,350 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands, and 77 bags arrived from Haikou.

### Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth is the Most Sought After

National Cloth: The market was steady in the morning but firm in the afternoon, remaining briskly sold. Due to the surge in yarn prices, sales prices for all goods were consistently strong. Bleached cloth rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt, colored cloth and colored twill rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan, and fine cloth twill rose by 0.01 to 0.025 yuan. Sixteen-pound and fourteen-pound coarse cloths were the most sought after. Sichuan-Yunnan syndicates handled over 1,000 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, etc. Guangdong syndicates handled over 400 pieces of colored cloth, pongee, coarse cloth, etc. Wenzhou-Ningbo syndicates handled over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, raw-colored yarn, pongee, fine cloth, etc. Locally, 500-600 pieces of various goods were traded.

Eastern Cloth: Due to market restrictions on further futures trading, the morning market was flat and weak. Leading fine cloth was offered for sale at 32.7 yuan. Unexpectedly, the local market saw strong real demand, with a difference of 0.025 yuan per bolt between spot fine cloth and warehouse receipts. At the same time, due to the rebound in cotton yarn, hoarders returned to scour the market. The closing price for leading fine cloth reached a new high of 33.2 yuan per bolt. Serge rose to 0.09975 yuan per yard. It is rumored that high-end raw fine cloth from Hankou requires 30 yuan in Japanese currency, equivalent to 37.8 yuan in legal tender. With direct shipments from Japanese merchants, deducting 1.5 yuan for water transport, the profit from shipping from Shanghai to Hankou is considerable. Therefore, the number of fine cloths directly shipped to the Yangtze River area has been substantial in recent days.

Exports: Yesterday, 68 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Ningbo. Today (the 9th), 1,500 pieces will be shipped to Fujian.

### Spring Ladies' Overcoats: Scramble to Buy Rabbit Hair Fabric

Rabbit hair fabric is needed by all ladies' clothing businesses, especially those around the Fourth Avenue, where transactions are even more robust. Ladies in Shanghai are scrambling for rabbit hair fabric for their spring overcoats. Pistachio green and light reddish-gray are particularly popular. However, stocks are limited, and the cost of new goods is high, resulting in very expensive selling prices. Nonetheless, Shanghai women are mostly willing to pay the price, as eight or nine out of ten value lightweight and all-wool fabric. As long as they can wear such a coat, it's like having a white dragon overcoat. Not wearing rabbit hair fabric is considered unfashionable and not showing off. Yesterday, the assorted first-grade rabbit hair fabric was priced at 26 yuan per yard, second-grade at 22-23 yuan, and ordinary third-grade all sold for around 20 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Prices Rebound, Local Market Also Sees Slight Recovery

Yokohama silk prices have rebounded, with spot prices at 1,450 yuan, up 60 yuan. Near-term is at 1,470 yuan, up 71 yuan, and long-term at 1,450 yuan, up 35 yuan. However, market sentiment suggests it will ultimately weaken. Before the new silk comes out, one side wants to raise market prices to sell off existing stock, while the other side wants to depress prices to benefit cocoon collection. Therefore, the current fluctuations in silk prices are a small rebound before a large decline.

Fifty dan of silk were traded in the local silk market yesterday, and silk prices showed signs of recovery. Foreign firms also made transactions. Please see the Market Prices section. Additionally, 24 packages of yellow silk arrived from Yantai yesterday.

### Green Tea European Sales Slightly Active

Yesterday, European firms dealing in green tea noticed that tea sales in Hong Kong recently have not been sufficient to meet demand. They have become more interested in the remaining "Zhen Mei" and "Zhu Cha" teas in the Shanghai market. A total of 360-odd boxes of ordinary "Zhen Mei" and "Shrimp Eye Zhu Cha" tea were purchased by Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Bowring, and Jardine Skinner. "Zhen Mei" tea was sold at 220-254 yuan, and "Zhu Cha" tea was bought at 270-340 yuan. There were no changes in prices.

### Coal: Coal Dust Sales Slow

Sales of various types of coal dust have slowed recently, as the weather is warming up, water heaters have stopped being used, and factories have increasingly switched to diesel for their furnaces. The supply of cheap coal dust for the cooked water industry is also sufficient, so its market is weak. Due to various reasons, sales have greatly decreased, and prices are unsustainable. First-grade dust is quoted at 215 yuan per ton, and second-grade dust at 200 yuan, but there are no buyers. It is said that if new goods flood the market, prices will decline further.

### Grain: Indica Rice Has Been Successfully Transported, Yesterday the Source Gradually Became Prosperous and There Was a Price Limit Broken, Western Rice Slightly One or Two Yuan Still Lacking Buyers

Following the usual Sunday holiday in the rice market, there have been long-standing rumors that the thick and thin japonica and early and late indica rice, etc. from the country will soon be opened. Although no official announcement has been seen, it has already been manifested in reality. The Hongkou Dachang Company, hosted by the Japanese, has been transporting rice from the Suxichangyisu area in the interior to Shanghai. The first batch that has arrived has been more than 10,000 bags, and subsequent batches are still continuing. Therefore, it is estimated that 4,000-5,000 bags of japonica and glutinous rice have been transferred from the Hongkou district into the Concession. If the Nan Gang sees early and late rice businesses selling a large amount on the market, and the selling price is even cheaper, falling into the 40-yuan price limit, selling only 29 yuan and 38.5 yuan. Although other thick and thin japonica rice still lacks normal transactions, they are all dark trades, but it is heard that the goods are prosperous and also unanimously trending downwards. The Chang Gang High Indica has already only opened at 43.5 yuan, the mid-city ones at 40 yuan, Su Kun japonica rice 42.5 yuan, 42 yuan, Li Sheng japonica rice 412 yuan, Qing Si special thin 42 yuan, and Zhongguan around 41 yuan, which is about 1.5 yuan less than the previous market. The glutinous rice market is abundant in goods, and is more double-pressured by the Cao Gen tip. Although the market has been so cheap, it has still lacked the main buyer, the market only shed 1 yuan. In addition to the high-holding goods selling for 35.5 yuan, the rest are all only between 345 yuan. The glutinous rice market has reached this point, which is really unprecedented. In various Western rices, they are greatly affected by domestic rice.

As for various Western rices, they are greatly affected by domestic rice, and they are even more unable to gain a foothold. In general, the cargo owners originally intended to hold on to all the goods that were not renewed after the April futures were cleared, and they had no intention of selling lightly. Now, the source of domestic rice has suddenly been dredged, and a large number has arrived in port. Floating hoards of scattered households are scrambling to sell, but the market cannot be shaken. Once it is shaken, even if you shout yourself hoarse, everyone will turn a blind eye, fighting less opponents, the market is full of goods, Western rice and domestic rice are mixed together, and there are no wholesale transactions. As a result, the closing market has already shed 1-2 yuan. No. 1 Saigon is only 41 yuan, 40 yuan and 5 cents, No. 2 is 37.5 yuan, Fire twist 40 yuan, No. 2 Siam 37.5 yuan, Small twist 37 yuan, Mixed broken 33 yuan, Next to 30 yuan, Miru 35.7 yuan, 35.5 yuan, Looking back at the overall situation of the rice market, since the sudden surge in the past year, it was only because the domestic source at that time suddenly ceased, and the supply of rice in Shanghai was insufficient, resulting in it. Afterwards, the design to order Western rice, although it once returned to a flat, but with a drop in the bucket, it was low and expensive again. There were also no lack of speculative manipulation of monopoly, the total is that domestic rice is controlled by people, recently the benefits are exclusively enjoyed, and transportation can be connected, then the price of rice must be restored one day, but it must be unimpeded, the source is endless, and the surcharges and taxes are removed, and the people's food can be slightly relieved.

Western rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company Taiyuan wheeled arrived at port yesterday afternoon, transporting 10,266 bags of Western rice from Hong Kong.

### Factory Flour Prices Depreciate, Wheat Also Loosens

The flour market is quite loose and abusive, it has been found that the 　 factory market, since the end of the flat sale period, has been standing at a high price of 13.8 yuan for a long time, resulting in a daily reduction in the sales of this street. The price of rice has repeatedly fallen, and the price of flour is more expensive than rice, in fact, sales are even more weak. It is even more affected by the dumping of flour from the mainland. The factory has to voluntarily depreciate, and the factory market has been changed to 13.5 yuan, which is 3 points lower than last week. The recycling of goods is also affected by this, which is also an angle outside the fall compared to last week. It is estimated that the opening of the old car Spleen is 13.43 yuan, and the transfer of the battleship brand is 13.07 yuan. The prices of other brands such as Double Lion Mountain Deer are also loose. It is estimated that the total transaction of each flour is about 10,000 bags. It is also heard that the export of flour is blocked by the Japanese side, and it is feared that the export sales will be difficult to develop for a while.

The wheat market also turned tired and fell, because the factory disk in the flour market has been changed to a low of 3 angles, the Huachang import stomach is available, the eating disk has paid more attention, and at the moment, the Japanese factory and the export road are stagnant, and in the step-down sound of various prices, people's hearts are naturally difficult to look good, so the cargo side has been difficult to struggle, and a total of 1,5600 bags were removed from the Fuxin Fufeng two factories. It is estimated that Chang Xi wheat is 23 yuan, and Wuhu wheat is 22.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan, which is half a yuan smaller than last week.

### The Election Reaches the Final Stage, Formal Elections Begin Tomorrow, the Anglo-American United Front Holds a Superior Position, the German Newspaper Strongly Urges Jews to Abstain from Voting

The election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has entered an even more intense stage since yesterday morning, as the decisive period is approaching and voting will begin tomorrow (10th and 11th). The outcome of this election is most closely related to the future of the concession. Whether the administration of the concession will be controlled by the Japanese or a portion of it will be seized, or whether the status quo can be maintained, all depends on the outcome of this election. What should be seriously noted by Chinese and foreign people is that if the Japanese seize the administrative power of the concession by other means, the Japanese will inevitably be attacked by Chinese and foreign people. The British and Americans will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese, believing that the Japanese violated international law, but if the Japanese obtain the administrative power of the concession by means of election, the third country cannot find a reason to protest. Therefore, the outcome of this election has a great relationship with the future of the concession. Therefore, according to another American overseas Chinese, although he is not very interested in the administrative policy of the Municipal Council at ordinary times, he also believes that if the Japanese threat does not materialize, the future of the concession and the Municipal Council will be more favorable in the future.

Chinese side 　 gives deep importance

The Public Concession Municipal Council's board election, in addition to the five Chinese directors, still elected Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun to continue to serve as representatives of Chinese taxpayers, the rest of the British, American, and Japanese directors have been scheduled to be held at the Wanguo Commercial Group Training Center and Hongkou Small Vegetable Market from 7 noon to 3 pm tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Because the Japanese side suddenly increased the number of candidates to five in this session, hoping to use political offensive to realize the attempt to change the existing state of the concession, the enthusiasm of the British, American, and Japanese expatriates engaged in the election has been white-hot for several days. Now that the election period is approaching, the winner will be determined in two days. This matter is deeply concerned by all parties because it is related to the entire concession administration. Although the Chinese side maintains a silent attitude, it also gives it consistent importance. According to a taxpayer surnamed a certain gentleman, foreigners often take the increase in population and the increase in tax payment as an excuse for electing the number of directors, but in fact, Chinese people account for an absolute majority of the population, and the burden of tax payment is also the heaviest for Chinese people, so municipal facilities should not ignore the welfare of Chinese people.

The election has entered 　 the final stage

The Continental Daily News said that the week starting from the 8th is a rare and important period in the history of the Public Concession. The issue of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council will be decided, and whether the Japanese will obtain control of the Municipal Council, whether the status quo can be maintained, or whether the proportion of directors will be slightly changed will be decided within this week. The election dates are Wednesday and Thursday. The election campaign has entered the final stage. Expatriates from all countries have intense activities. Japan's attempt to gain control will be met with fierce competition from all parties.

The strength of the two sides is equal

Today, there are two main forces, confronting each other, and the strength is almost equal. There are 3,700 voting rights for the Japanese side this time. The British and American voting rights, which were estimated at 3,500 rights yesterday, are heard to be increasing. Because British and American taxpayers who have the right to vote are still registering at the Municipal Council. A small number of expatriates with voting rights also seem to be divided into two factions, one for Latin expatriates, namely Portugal and Italy. It is heard that they are all determined to be on the Japanese side, and it is expected that a part of the German expatriates and White Russians will also elect the five Japanese candidates. German has a total of 700 voting rights, and it seems to be divided into two factions, one supporting and one opposing "Aryans", the latter are mostly Jewish refugees.

Political action 　 is worth pondering

According to a refugee yesterday, the methods used by the Japanese in this regard are quite similar to those used by Hitler in the early days of his rise. The Japanese activities are said to be completely legal, and so was Hitler. This is the question of what will happen once in power. According to well-informed sources, if the Japanese obtain control of the Public Concession, third countries cannot protest based on "illegal one or violation of international law". The current situation is that semi-totalitarian countries are trying to defeat democratic countries using so-called democratic methods.

The Bureau has received 　 a good lesson

Another American overseas Chinese said yesterday that he sincerely hates the methods of the Municipal Council. If the Japanese threat to dominate is not successful, this threat will have a good impact on the residents of the Municipal Council and the Public Concession, at least. Today, the rulers of the Bureau are extremely frightened and will have to implement strict reforms. Taxpayers have also woken up and will demand action from the Bureau after the election.

Japanese slander 　 British people are ridiculous

The Japanese allegations that the Public Concession Police Department sent personnel to coerce Jewish refugees in the Huishan area on the 5th of this month not to elect Japanese candidates were firmly denied by the Huishan Police Station police yesterday. The above said was published in the Japanese Shanghai Daily News and forwarded by Allied Press, roughly saying that at about 3 pm on the 5th, seven British police officers in uniform and twenty Chinese police officers gathered near 800 Tangshan Road. British police officers visited Jewish refugees from house to house, asking them who they would elect and their relationship with the Japanese, and then recorded the refugees' answers. This move by the British police exceeded their authority and interfered in the election. According to police personnel, this is a propaganda nonsense, no less than a laughable myth. It is heard that the Municipal Council may lodge a protest with the Japanese Consulate General regarding this news. However, well-informed sources believe that the Police Department will probably ignore it because it is absurd and ridiculous and not worth paying attention to.

Distribute a list 　 to attract attention

According to the Japanese Anglo-American Election Committee, in order to enable the third-national electors to support the Anglo-American candidates, it will issue a list of candidates for this session of the Board of Directors, with the surnames of each of the Anglo-American and Japanese candidates recorded together, but the fonts used are different. Among the Anglo-American candidates, except for lawyer Reno McDonald, the remaining seven are capitalized, so that the third-national voters concentrate on the seven. They are also prepared to pick up and drop off third-national electors by car. If the third-national electors need to take a car to the election ground to vote, they can tell their name and address according to the designated telephone number, and a car will be sent to meet them. This method is also notified in separate printed materials.

The German newspaper is jealous 　 and was confiscated

According to authoritative sources yesterday, a small team of Japanese military plainclothes officers confiscated a large number of German "Yellow Newspapers" in the Hongkou District at around 8 am yesterday. It is rumored that the newspaper had published news unfavorable to the Japanese campaign. Japanese military plainclothes officers went to each newspaper stall and shop to collect the newspaper, which was sold for a total of 1,000 copies (priced at 0.1 yuan each). The newspaper was resold, and all were confiscated. No reason was announced during the execution, nor was a penny paid. The police did not intervene in this move by the Japanese. It is also known that the newspaper has been extensively publishing news supporting the Anglo-American candidates for the past few weeks. Although the text did not explicitly advise Jews to support them, the Japanese believe that this move is enough to affect their campaign. The newspaper published an article warning that those who bribe and use the current special state to make profits will be punished by the Chinese government in the future. Another article stated that Jewish refugees should thank God for being able to escape from Germany, and should thank the democratic countries that have accommodated them in Shanghai. They should know that living in the area established by the democratic countries is the supreme happiness, and they should not be grateful for the Japanese people's permission to land. The newspaper also published a notice from the Jewish Refugee Association, advising Jewish refugees to maintain neutrality in this election, and to abstain from voting if necessary, because favoring any party would be enough to make enemies. The newspaper held an absolutely supportive attitude towards American overseas Chinese. The newspaper pointed out that Americans used the Boxer Indemnity to establish schools and hospitals, which made the relationship between the East and the West closer and can be praised.

Personal voting 　 cannot be overstepped

The Japanese Election Committee held a meeting of department directors at the Japanese Club yesterday morning, and the committee members held another meeting in the afternoon. There will be two more meetings today (committee members). In Japan, it was originally thought that if the elector himself did not arrive, he could entrust someone to vote on his behalf, but it is now clear that the party who casts the vote on his behalf is absolutely not allowed, so its election committee issued an appeal again, hoping that the Japanese overseas Chinese who have the right to vote must take the time to go to the polls. If the elector still has matters that cannot be understood, he can ask the election director of each district.

The Japanese people are threatening the Jewish people to help

The Japanese method of striving for Jewish support is now being implemented in earnest. It is said that in the Hongkou District, those who express their willingness to vote in favor of Japanese candidates have obtained a permit from the Japanese. It is also permitted to bring relatives and friends to Shanghai. It is also known that those who have obtained a permit and do not actually need it are making huge profits from the permit. It is estimated that each permit can be sold for 　 thousand yuan. The Japanese have set up a so-called election publicity office in Hongkou. The association sent propaganda officers who are good at speaking German to carry out activities, asking Jews to vote in favor of Japanese candidates, otherwise they and their relatives and friends will be harmed. However, observers all clearly believe that this kind of intimidation is not very effective, because the ballot is completely sealed, and it is difficult for the Japanese to investigate the names of voters.

Using White Russians 　 to distribute leaflets

The English-language Great America Evening News said that on Saturday night last week, there were many unemployed White Russians on Xiafei Road distributing Russian-language leaflets. This is the most recent action by a certain force to advise Russian taxpayers not to elect British candidates. The contents of the leaflets are highly critical of the British, roughly saying that "We demand that Russian people should not elect 'Municipal Council gentlemen' until the Municipal Council 'occupies one or two seats'". British directors of the Municipal Council appeal to Russian people for 　 protection every year when they compete for election, and they make false promises. Taking the White Russian team of the Commercial Corps as an example, it can be seen that the British use Russian people only when they need help. The hardships of Russian people when they move to Shanghai are compared with the preferential treatment of Jewish immigrants when they arrive here, and there is a world of difference. The Public Concession Police Department employs Russian police officers to handle Russian cases, but they have never been promoted to high positions. Therefore, Russian taxpayers should not elect British people, but should elect "a certain national who will help Russian people to be equal". Otherwise, they should cast a white vote "to show their protest".

Semyonov 　 acts as an accomplice

The Continental Daily News said that according to reliable sources, Semyonov, the leader of the pro-Japanese White Russian group in the Manchurian territory, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and is still in this city. Mr. Xie has a White Russian bodyguard with him and appears in several large hotels in the city — It is heard that Mr. Xie used the name of a Chinese to take a Japanese ship to Shanghai on March 29. After arriving in Shanghai, he has met with several Japanese military leaders in Shanghai. The White Russian side in this city believes that Mr. Xie's arrival here is of great significance because the election of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council is about to be held, so Mr. Xie's arrival here may be related to the start of the election campaign. Rumors say that Mr. Xie is now trying to induce a majority of White Russians to vote in favor of the five Japanese candidates.

### Thanks from the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department - Achievements of Mr. Fessenden During His Tenure - Shouldering Heavy Responsibilities in the Autumn of Shanghai's Crisis - Leading Colleagues to Maintain Security, Peace, and Order

On the third day of this month, during the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, Deputy Chairman Mr. Cornaby delivered a speech, stating that this meeting was the last one attended by Chairman Mr. Fessenden. He noted that Mr. Fessenden had shouldered heavy responsibilities in the autumn of last year's crisis, leading colleagues with diligent concern, working tirelessly day and night with high merit. He, on behalf of all colleagues, respectfully thanked Mr. Fessenden. Subsequently, Mr. Fessenden thanked the directors and colleagues of the department for their willingness to cooperate.

### Yonghe Steamer Collides with Wine Barge - Two Ships Carrying Shaoxing Wine Sink

Yesterday morning, the Yonghe steamer, arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou and intending to dock at the Longmao Wharf, collided with two Shaoxing wine barges while berthing. The two barges, along with their load of Shaoxing wine jars, sank to the bottom of the river, resulting in a loss of approximately ten thousand several thousand yuan.

### American Radio Station Avoids Interference - Temporarily Changes Radio Waves - Formally Protests Interference from Hongkou - News Reports Can Henceforth Proceed Unhindered

The Continental Daily reports that the city's largest broadcasting station, call sign XMHA, which is American-owned, has had its programming deemed "provocative" by some parties, leading to disruptions starting from the sixth day.

The station's manager, Mr. Hile, and news reporter, Mr. Yarkow, have filed a formal protest with the acting American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Bottorff, stating that the Japanese are disrupting radio waves from the Hongkou area, and requesting that the Japanese authorities be contacted to cease the interference. A response from the Japanese authorities is expected today.

According to a statement yesterday from the radio station's personnel, the station's engineers will slightly alter the radio wave suddenly a few minutes before Mr. Yarkow broadcasts the news, which should avoid interference. This is because after the radio wave is changed, the opposing station will require half an hour to locate the new radio wave before being able to resume the interference. By then, the news report will already be completed.

### The British Steamer Yonghe - Requisitioned by Order - British Consulate Orders Immediate Sailing to Hong Kong - Loading Unloaded in Shanghai Yesterday to Await Orders

The British government has requisitioned over ten British ships in the Far East. In Shanghai, the requisitioned vessels have mostly been tugs. It has now been learned that the British steamer Yonghe Inbira has recently been notified by the British Consulate in Shanghai that it has also been requisitioned and ordered to sail to Hong Kong to await orders. The ship was originally registered in Hong Kong and was chartered two months ago by a local shipping company in Shanghai to operate the Shanghai-Xinghua-Wenzhou route. It has a capacity of 800 tons. After arriving in Shanghai with cargo on the fifth of this month, it was originally scheduled to sail to Xinghua that same day. However, upon receiving notification from the British Consulate, all the loaded cargo was unloaded yesterday, and the ship will sail to Hong Kong within the next few days.

### Fuxin and Fufeng Flour Mills - Lower Mill Prices

The Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills previously implemented a one-month period of selling flour at a fixed price to maintain the people's food supply and provided flour to noodle shops, bakeries, and biscuit factories as much as possible. The general populace benefited greatly. After the fixed-price period ended, due to cost considerations, the mill price was raised to 13.8 yuan per bag. To prevent manipulation by speculators, the two mills supplied flour without restriction at the mill price, making it impossible for speculators to ply their trade. The price of recycled flour on the market fell to the mill price. Now, the two mills have decided after consultation to lower the mill price of flour to 13.5 yuan per bag, starting on April 8th.

### Negotiations on Drivers' Drink Money - Mediation Needed

The issue of increasing drink money for drivers at the Xiang Sheng and four major taxi companies in the city has reached a point where the labor and management sides have had to begin negotiating over wages, after the labor side voluntarily made concessions. Another round of negotiations took place yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the screening room of the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. According to reports from Pingming News, yesterday's negotiations were still unsuccessful, but the labor side believes there is still room for discussion and has not taken further action. However, they have asked management to respond within three days at the latest. The management side also feels that negotiations have been unsuccessful after several attempts and that third-party mediation is needed. Therefore, they plan to ask the Public Works Department to participate in mediation after three days. The labor side has not expressed any opposition.

### Negotiations on the Return of Police Authority in the Northern District - No Progress

Regarding the issue of returning police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, the Public Works Department and the Japanese side continued negotiations at 10:30 AM yesterday inside the Japanese Marines headquarters on Jiangwan Road. Attendees from the Public Works Department included Chief Inspector Eames and Special Deputy Chief Inspector Armitage. Attendees from the Japanese side included Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, Major Hayashi, Lieutenant Commander Kawabata, Jian Si, Osafune, Consul Sato, and Isono. The meeting lasted until 3:00 PM, totaling four and a half hours. Various agreements were discussed regarding the organization of E District and the number of police officers from the Public Works Department's Hongkou Police Station. However, it is reported that the opinions of both sides were not in harmony and no progress was made.

### French Postal Liners Sailing the Far East Route - Have Adopted Strict Precautions - May Consider Further Reducing Services - Night Navigation in Hong Kong and Shanghai Under Increased Vigilance

According to overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai on the 7th from Marseille, French postal liners sailing the Europe-Far East route have had irregular schedules since the start of the European war due to difficult navigation in the Mediterranean. Currently, there are, on average, two services per month, with voyages lasting anywhere from a month to forty days. According to recent news from the French shipping company, French postal liners may consider further reducing services due to certain circumstances. In the past, overseas Chinese returning from France often purchased their tickets half a month in advance, and the company would allow the sale. However, since the beginning of March, the company has stopped selling tickets to overseas Chinese returning to China because the future schedule cannot be predicted, leading many overseas Chinese to suspect that French postal liners may temporarily suspend services. The most recent French postal liner departed from Marseille on March 14th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-April. The future schedule will be known after the ship arrives in Shanghai. It is also learned that in addition to strengthening their armed equipment, French postal liners sailing the Far East route have become even more meticulous in their safety designs. The practice of turning off lights at night, which was previously limited to the Mediterranean area, has now been extended from

### Coal Industry's Third Supply - Fixed-Price Coal for Boiled Water Businesses

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has designated its members, Yitai and Huazhong Yuantai, three larger coal companies, to supply fixed-price coal to the various boiled water businesses at a discounted price per ton. This has been done twice before, with the first time selling at a fixed price of 98 yuan per ton and the second time selling at a fixed price of 50 yuan per ton (No. 2 Hongji coal dust). The association has now decided to issue a third batch of discounted coal to be used by the boiled water businesses, which began yesterday and will last until the 13th. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM each day, "Coal Purchase Application Certificates" will be issued. Each ton will be sold at a discounted price of 50 yuan in national currency, with a limit of one ton per household. Yesterday, a total of over one hundred tons were sold. The Boiled Water Industry Association is now planning price reductions.

Hong Kong to Shanghai.

On the way, the lights are completely turned off, and passengers are prohibited from carrying flashlights. Therefore, during the "Kapellabro" steamer's thirty-day voyage, no lights were visible. Ships sailing at night are equipped with large compasses, which are used to determine the direction of travel. A small blue light is installed on the top of the ship, which cannot be seen from afar, but serves as a marker for ships sailing nearby, ensuring safety.

### A "Court" Has Been Set Up on the North Bank of Suzhou Creek - Japanese "Officials" Issue Summons - The Consular Body is Unaware

The North China Daily News reports that, according to a reporter's investigation, in recent weeks, foreigners without consular jurisdiction and Chinese residents on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have been summoned to a "court" for civil cases. Those who refuse the summons issued by the Japanese "officials" of the "court" are immediately arrested and often punished. The exact location of the "court" is not yet known, but it is known that the trials are held on Haining Road, roughly in the buildings occupied by the Japanese Marines. It is also known that the "court" has heard

Four Cases in Total

But no information could be obtained from the relevant parties. It is rumored that one of the cases occurred last week, when the wife of a White Russian driver, Ms. Sikov, and her children were arrested at their residence on the fourth afternoon and taken to the Japanese Marines headquarters on Haining Road. They were later released at the request of the Public Works Department's Police Force.

The Reason for the Arrest

Was because she owed a Chinese shopkeeper eighty yuan. According to absolutely reliable sources, the woman had received a summons a few days earlier but ignored it. The other three cases all involved Chinese debt disputes. It has been discovered that the consular body is unaware that the "court" is arbitrarily hearing cases.

### British American Tobacco Strike Lingers

The strike by workers at the British American Tobacco shipyard in Yangshupu, which began on the 14th of last month due to the management's failure to fulfill the labor-management agreement signed on December 14, 1939, has not been resolved for over three weeks. Although the labor and management sides have negotiated several times, they have failed to reach an agreement due to the vast differences in their conditions. It has been learned that last Wednesday, the management sent a final written response to the labor side, rejecting the current eleven-member delegation. On the same day, the factory workers were informed that those who wished to continue working should register immediately, and those who did not wish to work could collect their dismissal pay. Therefore, the factory workers have been holding large communal meals in the union hall since the day before yesterday, struggling to survive. Over a thousand people have participated, and the labor dispute is unlikely to be resolved immediately.

### Brief News

New An Li Steamer - The British steamer Xin An Li, agented by Taichang Foreign Firm in Shanghai, which loaded cargo in Shanghai on the first of this month and sailed to Wenzhou, was blocked from entering the port by a Japanese warship outside Wenzhou. After being detained for several days, it was released on the afternoon of the 7th and arrived in Wenzhou at 12:00 AM that night. The ship was detained outside the port for five nights, resulting in intangible losses totaling over 20,000 yuan.

### Kidnapping This Morning

At around 12:30 AM this morning, a black-plated car with the number 5417 abducted a man in front of a dance hall in the International Settlement and disappeared. Subsequently, the police in both settlements paid close attention to the car's whereabouts. The identity of the kidnapped person is temporarily unknown.

### Passenger Trains Now Officially Running from Guilin to Liuzhou - Trip Takes Eleven Hours

Passenger train tickets are now officially being sold for the Guiliu section of the Xianggui Railway (i.e., Guilin to Liuzhou). However, for the time being, only second and third-class tickets are available. Third-class tickets cost 3.45 yuan per person, and second-class tickets cost 6.9 yuan. The trip takes eleven hours. Recent reports from Guilin state that the railway tracks near Youlan Station on the section were washed away by floodwaters, requiring passengers to disembark and walk for about a mile before continuing their journey. It is also learned that the journey between the Liuzhou North Station and the highway bus station of the Liuzhu section requires crossing the Liujiang River, a distance of four kilometers. It costs about four yuan per load to carry luggage.

### The Revitalized Christian Literature Society - General Secretary Now a Chinese National - Efforts to Innovate in Literary Work

The Christian Literature Society is the largest Christian literary organization and also the pioneer of China's publishing industry. It has a history of fifty-three years. Initially, the society published books on politics, astronomy, geography, medicine, and other sciences. Those who presided over the society included Young John Allen and Timothy Richard. The great literary figure Liang Qichao also worked there. Therefore, the society has not only made contributions to religious matters but has also provided enlightened leadership in China's political and cultural affairs. Later, major bookstores such as the Commercial Press were established one after another. The society then changed its focus and specialized in religious matters. Recently, the society's board of directors convened a meeting and believed that Christian literature should target the Chinese people and strengthen the position of the Chinese people. Therefore, it was specifically decided to adjust the administrative personnel of the society. In order to revitalize the literary lineup, important changes were also made to policies. The situation is explored below:

Division of Powers

In the past, some directors of the society were also elected as executive committee members, which appeared to create a conflict of interest. Now, the current board of directors has decided that any person serving as a director and also holding the position of a secretary cannot be re-elected as an executive committee member. Therefore, the legislative and administrative powers of the society have been clearly separated.

Term of Office for Secretaries

In the past, there was no fixed term of office for the society's secretaries. The current board of directors has also decided that the term of office for secretaries should be fixed. After the term expires, whether or not to renew the appointment will be considered to prevent the problem of incompetence.

Competent Leadership

The current board of directors of the society has also appointed several new secretaries, such as Mr. Tong Kesheng, a Western missionary who has extensive experience in literary work. He has also been elected as an acting secretary. However, what is most noteworthy is that Mr. Zhu Lide has been elected as the general secretary. For fifty-three years, the position of general secretary of the society has been held by Westerners. Although there is no shortage of capable people among Westerners, it is still difficult to manage China's literary affairs. Therefore, the current board of directors is looking for a Chinese national to take on this important task in order to achieve the goal of having Chinese nationals manage China's literary affairs. It is heard that Mr. Zhu previously served as the deputy general secretary of the National Christian Council of China. In August 1937, he was hired by the council as deputy general secretary. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, Dr. Jia Liyan, the general secretary of the council, returned to the United States, and Zhu took over as the acting secretary. During his tenure, he made outstanding contributions and was highly praised by both Chinese and Western figures. Now that the board of directors has entrusted him with this position, church members are all delighted to have found a capable person.

Publishing Business

In the past, the chairman of the society's publishing committee was also a Westerner. Recently, Dr. Xu Baoqian, a professor at Shanghai University, was elected to preside over the committee. Mr. Xu is very knowledgeable in literary matters, and he will make another contribution in the future.

Recruiting Talents

The new general secretary of the society has already sent letters to the cultural circles in China to recruit literary talents in order to revitalize the literary lineup. He also plans to cooperate with various organizations outside the society. It is expected that the society's literary work will soon have a new lineup and excellent performances.

Books Sell Well

According to reliable sources, although the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, the sales of the society's first editions and reprints last year broke all previous records. An average of about two new books were published every day, which can be said to have spread like wildfire. The content of each book has been greatly improved, and shallow content and incomprehensible writing have been greatly reduced.

### Bizarre Murder Case Occurs on Gordon Road Yesterday Morning - Deceased is Dai Buyun from Wuxi - Head Wound Caused by Gunshot - Cause of Death Unknown

A bizarre shooting occurred at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning at No. 85, Lane 1000, Gordon Road (i.e., Guangming Village). According to reports from Pingming News, the deceased was Dai Buyun, a 47-year-old man from Wuxi. He had previously opened the Xingtai Printing and Paper Box Factory in his hometown, specializing in manufacturing rubber shoe boxes and gift boxes, which were sold on the market. The business was doing quite well. The factory was located in Jiangwan before the August 13th Incident.

It was moved here after the war. His wife has already passed away, and he has four sons and four daughters. The eldest son, named Zengshou, is 19 years old and is still studying at a middle school. The youngest child is still an infant. Household affairs are handled by the second daughter, Xuezhen (14 years old), and the maid. Dai went to bed in a room on the second floor the night before last, along with one of his youngest children. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the second daughter, Xuezhen, got up and walked into the kitchen and saw that the back door was

Wide Open. Suspecting that a thief had taken advantage of the opportunity to steal something and fled in a hurry, she rushed upstairs to inform her father. Pushing open the door, she caught a glimpse of blood-stained bedding. Upon closer inspection, she was shocked to discover that her father had been shot in the head, the bullet piercing through his brain from the back of his head. He lay stiff in a pool of blood, his body already cold. She cried out. The maid rushed over upon hearing the sound and was horrified by the sight. She immediately reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station. The police immediately sent detectives to inspect the scene, took fingerprints, and then transferred the body to the Jiaozhou Road Morgue. A "Pass" from the Jiangwan District was found near the deceased's body.

As to the Cause of His Death

The police are currently investigating. No. 85 is a three-story Western-style building, entirely inhabited by Dai's family. There are no other tenants. When reporters visited his home in the afternoon, all the relatives were present, their faces filled with grief. They were asked if the deceased had any enemies. Only one person seemed about to say something but was interrupted by another person who told them not to say too much. Therefore, the details remain unknown.

### A Thief Was Shot Dead on East Hanbury Road - 980 Yuan in Legal Tender Was Found - Had Previously Robbed a Japanese Store with an Accomplice

At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Officer No. 622 of the Public Works Department's Police Force was patrolling East Hanbury Road in Hongkou when he spotted a man in a light gray long gown carrying a handgun. He immediately ordered him to stop, but the man ignored the order and turned to flee. The officer knew he was a bandit and chased after him. The bandit still tried to resist arrest, and the officer shot him in the chest and left eye. The bandit fell to the ground at the intersection of East Hanbury Road and Wuzhou Road. He was immediately apprehended. A handgun was found on him, along with 980 yuan in legal tender in his pocket. The injured thief was sent to the police hospital, where he died from his injuries shortly after. The thief was 25 or 26 years old. Before being shot, he was working with an accomplice to rob a Japanese store.

### Defendant in Child Abuse Case Released on Bail Pending Judgment

Miao Xiqi, a Wuxi native and owner of the Yongxing Auto Shop at No. 180 Datong Road, lives at No. 189 Meiboge Road. Last year, he adopted an 11-year-old girl from Wuxi named Xiuying. However, Miao is quite violent and often abused Xiuying. Neighbors, feeling sorry for her, secretly reported the matter to the New Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective No. 1013 from the Third Road and Western Detective Bertel to investigate. After confirming the facts, they sent Xiuying to the hospital and detained Miao Xiqi in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tiansa filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that doctors had examined Xiuying and found bleeding in her eyes and injuries to her buttocks and legs. He asked for an interrogation. According to Xiuying's complaint, she had been repeatedly beaten by Miao for allegedly stealing and that her eye had been injured by a thrown shoe. The defendant's testimony was evasive. He hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After reviewing the evidence and hearing the arguments, the judge ruled that the defendant could be released on bail of 300 yuan to await sentencing. Xiuying was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute.

### Two Men Arrested for Kidnapping and Raping a Young Woman in Shanghai

Chen Boqin, a 13-year-old man from Menghe, has a wandering spirit. He recently kidnapped a neighbor girl, Chen Gendi (17 years old), from his hometown and brought her to Shanghai, where they temporarily resided at the home of Wang Liansheng, a fellow villager, at No. 30 Dekang Lane on Qiujiang Road. Chen Boqin and the girl then went to the Jie Road Hotel and rented Room 30, where he defiled Gendi. On the tenth day, at 9:00 AM, Chen Boqin and the girl went to the hotel again and rented Room 45 to continue their romp. Wang Liansheng also went with them. This was discovered by Guo Xiangyao, a Chinese detective from the Huisi Police Station, who rushed to the address and arrested them, finding Chen Boqin, Wang Liansheng, and the girl Gendi in bed together, laughing and joking. Detective Guo arrested them all and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji explained the case and requested a trial. Judge Dong questioned the defendants and ordered them to be held in custody pending sentencing.

### Shot While Standing in Front of His Door - Yang Zhongshan Shot in the Abdomen

Yang Zhongshan, a 49-year-old man from Yancheng, who lives in a bungalow behind the Jiaozhou Garden on Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, was standing in front of his gate at around 2:00 PM yesterday when a man approached him and shot him in the abdomen with a handgun. Yang fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled. His family summoned an ambulance to the scene and took him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Doctors performed surgery and removed the bullet, but his fever is high, and his life may be in danger. The police are investigating the reason for the shooting.

### Trolley Car Damaged by Truck

Trolley Car No. 28 of the French Company's Route 10 Trolley, while traveling west on Route Ghisi near Zilai Street at 10:15 AM yesterday morning, was rear-ended by a coal truck with the license plate number 2052. The truck driver was attempting to pass the trolley car, but another trolley car was approaching from the opposite direction. The truck driver was unable to avoid a collision. The third-class iron door of the trolley car was damaged, and the trolley car was derailed. The truck was not damaged but was blocking the road, temporarily disrupting traffic. Police officers from nearby arrived to maintain order and notified the company to send a repair car to put the trolley car back on the tracks. The truck involved in the accident was taken to the police station for questioning.

### New Prohibition of Storytelling

The art of storytelling (pinghua), it's unknown when it started. It is said that those in the profession consider Zhuang Zhou as their founder, although the reason is unknown. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, people like Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, and others daily used their knowledge of subjects for amusement. It was like a clown in the play, not a narration of the past and present. New unofficial history records such as Li Guinian's ballad singing and Zheng Yuanhe selling songs were all capable of singing but did not involved direct storytelling. Only during the late Ming Dynasty, there was Liu Jingting from Jiangnan, who was good at telling ancient and modern romances, vividly depicting the situations. Whenever he told of the events involving the rebel Li Zicheng and Zuo Liangyu's southern armies, the listeners would invariably weep. He frequently socialized with gentlemen and the wealthy, and his reputation was immense. One might think that this person is what is now called a storyteller. Storytelling is known for depicting fighting and killings, while matters within women's quarters are usually omitted. Therefore, the stories told are mostly "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty," "Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," and so on, which have not been prohibited in the past. The customs in Hangzhou Province place great importance on storytelling. In every teahouse, there is a storytelling venue, with hundreds and thousands of listeners surrounding it. Flower drum tunes, Pinghu tunes, and the like, which involve both playing and singing, are regarded as minor stories by the people and are disdained. Since the recent new ban, no less than ten thousands people gather every day to listen to storytelling, and business has flourished because of this. There are no fewer than thirty storytelling venues in the teahouses in the city. However, a newly issued notice has suddenly been posted in the bustling market, strictly prohibiting storytelling. This is because, although storytelling narrates stories of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, it may also involve treachery, theft, and obscenity, which can corrupt the minds of the listeners. Therefore, the authorities have ordered that "Water Margin," "Investiture of the Gods," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Jin Ping Mei" be permanently banned from being performed. Furthermore, storytelling venues gather large crowds, with men and women mixed together, and criminals lurking among them. During the day, this can be slightly tolerated, but at dusk and in the middle of the night, the crowds are even more densely packed and disorderly, which is truly unacceptable. This notice was issued by the Bao'an Bureau (Security Bureau), which is indeed a measure to prevent problems before they arise.

### Parricide Case: Identification Work Completed, Court Investigation Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon

The sensational parricide case involving the unfilial sons Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, who murdered their father, resulted in the Shanghai First Special District Court sentencing Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death. Their mother, Madam Jing, was also suspected of jointly disposing of the body and was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. After the sentences were pronounced, the defendants were not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang jointly hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, and Ye Shaoying, while Madam Zhou Jing hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan, to file the appeals separately. At the same time, lawyer Yang and others argued that the Zhou brothers had a traditional mental illness, and requested the court to conduct an identification on this point. The court approved this request and appointed forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to conduct a detailed identification. The identification work by the forensic doctors has now been completed. Therefore, the Second Branch of the High Court has scheduled a court investigation for 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month, presided over by Judge Nie Chongyi. The lawyers for the appellants have all received notification. At that time, the audience is certain to fill the courtroom.

Education

### Shortcomings of University Education

— Yang Tongfang

After reading Mr. Fang Xiaolan's "The Words of University Students" in this publication, I have endless thoughts. Indeed, the focus of the problem should be on the entirety of university education. It is certainly the fault of the average university student that they do not diligently study and immerse themselves in research, and they should be criticized for this. However, the fact that today's university education is unable to meet the needs and is unable to responsibly guide young people is also undeniable. It is naturally difficult to hope to cultivate the morality of young people and create outstanding talents under an unsound and unreasonable system. The extravagance in conduct and lack of academic cultivation of university students merely reveal a deplorable aspect of university education.

We seem to only see those university students from generally well-off circumstances, who spend their days in and out of restaurants and dance halls, pursuing sensual pleasures, and wasting their time and energy on useless things, while regarding studying as a form of decoration and embellishment. As a result, the impression that university students give is that of young masters in suits and leather shoes, or fashionable, permed-hair young ladies. In fact, not only in the inland areas, but also in Shanghai, there are many diligent and promising university students who study hard, and their lives are filled with blood and tears. They borrow, pawn, strive, and struggle in order to enter the gates of the university. The unsoundness and unreasonableness of university education lies here: it cannot provide as many opportunities as possible for poor and ambitious young people to study, and instead turns the sacred cause of education into a commodity, while allowing the education of the young masters and ladies who float around and are uninhibited to tarnish the dignity of education.

The crux of today's university education lies in the overemphasis on the transmission of lectures and the injection of knowledge, and in only knowing how to instill old experiences, while being unable to create new culture. Students are able to memorize dead provisions and formulas, and it seems that they no longer need to use active thought. Completing the prescribed credits is considered graduation, without regard for the student's actual knowledge and ability. It superficially touts the beautiful name of academic research, but does not have any connection with career activities and practical life. These pathological states presented by university education built on economic conditions are not surprising that they are given criticism.

Judging from the current situation, the children of families below the middle class, although aspiring to study, can only sigh at the gates of the university; the rich young masters and ladies regard entering university as an investment to decorate their image. How can this not disappoint us?

Originally, the purpose of education is to help the educated to make effective adaptations to life, and to promote the continuous progress of society through the development of individual knowledge and ability. The function of university education is even more so to cultivate a beautiful personality and train specialized skills. The experiments and researches of European and American universities often directly contribute to the development of industry and commerce, which can be said to have fulfilled the mission of university education.

The task of the university is not only to transmit old knowledge, but should also focus on the discovery of new things and the creation of new culture. The most important thing is to provide a method of academic research as a key to unlock the treasure of culture, and at the same time cultivate a perfect life ideal and the ability to adapt to society. The weak atmosphere of academic research in today's universities is undeniable. Not to mention that there are few unique findings and inventions in a certain field of knowledge or a certain practical technique, even the systematic sorting of old experiences and the guiding of the path and methods of research science, the cultivation of students' appropriate life attitudes, and the opening of noble life ideals have not been done to a satisfactory degree, which is something that cannot but make us feel deeply regretful.

Under the slogan of "Save the University Students," and under the public opinion that criticizes university students, we cannot ignore the defects of today's university system itself without trying to remedy them.

Science

### Rats

— Bo Hewa

It really is a kind of irony. Rats are the most similar of all animals to humans. Because humans and rats are the only omnivores. The diseases that plague humans also entangle rats. And they can survive in climates from the tropics to the poles.

Because humans and rats have the same diet, biologists believe that rats are the most ideal experimental animals. The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States has a specially built steel-framed building to house healthy, pure Norwegian white rats.

Under the management of the authoritative researcher Dr. Donaldson, ninety-six generations of white rats were raised. Their food has been scientifically tested and properly distributed; the air in the room has also been sterilized. At the same time, the institute refuses visits to prevent guests from transmitting bacteria to the rats.

They study the sex lives of rats in a state of fatigue; the conditions of leprosy, syphilis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia passed on to rats; the physiological effects of the amount of vitamins; the differences in blood pressure and circulatory organs between panicked rats and normal rats, among animals other than humans themselves, the scientific experimental reports on rats are the most numerous.

The nutritional value of food is also often determined based on rat experiments. For example, Professor McCollum's research on the effect of manganese on the human body was tested on rats. After a new drug, serum, or poison is invented, it is also used on rats to determine the medical dosage. A well-developed rat weighs about half a pound, equivalent to one two-hundred-fiftieth of an average person's weight. The appropriate dosage can be easily calculated proportionally. The use of morphine, snake venom, etc., are all first studied using white rats.

After a pregnancy of twenty-two or twenty-three days, the baby rats are born. Eyes closed, no hair, undeveloped limbs, short tail. Only able to cry and suckle. After ten days, they will wander around in the cage. After twenty-five days, they leave their parents. The development after that is very rapid? A white rat usually lives for three years, which is thirty times faster than the development of humans. The ninety-six generations of rats in the Wistar Institute are equivalent to 3,100 years of humans, longer than recorded history.

Rats are the most suitable animal for studying human genetics. Observing the situation of three generations of humans takes almost a hundred years; rats tell us the same story in eighteen months.

Warfare

### Poison Gas Two Thousand Years Ago

— Fangren

Everyone thought that the use of poison gas as a weapon of war began in the last World War. However, unknown to people, it had already been used two thousand years ago.

According to the records of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides in "History of the Peloponnesian War," when the Spartans besieged the city of Plataea in 470 BC, they tried to smoke out the defenders with smoke. Their method was to pile bundles of firewood around the city mound, soak the firewood with sulfur and tar, and then light it to produce thick smoke. However, this time they failed because the wind changed direction and the smoke smoked themselves, so they had to retreat.

Later, in 428 BC, they besieged Plataea again using the same method, and this time they succeeded. However, although they conquered the enemy because of this, they never knew that the death of the enemy was not only because of the smoke, but also because of the toxic gas – carbon monoxide – produced by the combined burning of sulfur and tar.

The Spartan method of burning sulfur and tar was also widely used in the Middle Ages, the Roman Empire, and the Renaissance, but they still did not know the real reason for its killing effect. Seeing that the mixture of sulfur and tar could burn on the surface of the water, they miraculously called it "Greek Fire."

In the fourteenth century, the Arab historian Abramah also suggested using opium gas to defeat the enemy. And in the military library in Berlin, there is an ancient book from 1437 that contains a method for manufacturing poison gas bombs. From this formula, it can be known that it actually contains arsenic trisulfide.

The history of poison gas ends here. This is not to say that human beings suddenly paid attention to humanity and showed great compassion, but in reality, it was still because there was no better method of application. Because the distance was not far, they were also in danger of poisoning.

In the nineteenth century, there were more and more inventions. For example, during the French Revolution, the French army used it once based on the experiments of a chemist named Fourcroy. During the Napoleonic era, a British chemist also contributed the secret method of making cyanide gas bombs to Napoleon, but Napoleon refused to use it. In 1912, the Hague International Conference decided to prohibit the use of poison gas, except for tear gas, which was not included in the ban because it did not cause serious harm.

It was not until the end of October 1914 that the German army violated the prohibition of the Hague Conference and used chlorine gas in the Rhine, and then the Allied forces also followed suit. However, in the beginning, it was very weak and failed repeatedly. According to statistics, in three and a half years, the German army used a total of 47,500 tons of poison gas, and 57,000 French soldiers were poisoned. And 27% of the losses of the American Expeditionary Force were also due to poison gas. As a result, the military status of poison gas was established.

After the war, the research on poison gas by various countries has become even more alarming. Fortunately, until now, no country has used it on a large scale, otherwise, in this year-on-year war, I don't know how many millions of new ghosts would have been added.

Musings

### Wife's Hair

— Jinchuan

I am a poor scholar who makes a living by selling manuscripts. Three years ago, I borrowed money to get married. Fortunately, I have no children, so the burden is lighter. But living a life of eating one meal and starving the next, barely surviving on the poverty line, is really endless. However, my wife nags every day, sighs and complains, and quarrels at the slightest dissatisfaction. This kind of problem can only be cured with money, so I desperately write manuscripts. But manuscripts are not worth much these days, and sometimes they are rejected. Borrowing from friends is only possible once or twice, and there is no hope of opening my mouth again next time! It really is "misfortune that always surrounds me." But apart from the problem of eating, at least "housing" is thanks to the favor of relatives; a small room built on the sun deck costs ten yuan a month, which is not expensive. As for "clothing," the few uniforms I had when I was in school can barely pass muster. But my wife's clothes must be constantly renewed. She doesn't want to wear long sleeves, she wants short sleeves; if the color is a bit old, she doesn't want to wear it either. If I open my mouth to object, she says others are doing this and that. It really forces me to groan in misery. Next is the problem of hair. For this matter, we have to argue at least twice a month. For example, the day before she goes to meet her girlfriend, she is sure to start a fuss about getting her hair permed. I say, "Natural hair is beautiful." She says, "Everyone else is permed. If I don't perm it, it's hard to meet people. Even Bing Sheng's wife, who works in a factory, has permed it. Humph, as a husband, you should be ashamed to see your wife go out with messy hair." So we quarrel again, and in the end, I have to give her the money to get it permed to end the argument. When she comes back, a few days' worth of food has been exchanged for a head full of curls. Seeing it makes me laugh and angry at the same time!

Therefore, for me, my wife's hair is a serious problem. If I unfortunately (a laugh) have a few more daughters, that would be terrible. The money I make from writing can only be used for a month of perms. My stomach will start to go hungry, and I might even become a starved corpse because of hair. Thinking of this makes me shudder.

In addition to lamenting, I hope that the fashionable young ladies and mistresses will reduce their expenses, or not perm their hair and change to a style that doesn't cost money. This would also save us who wear long gowns and work hard, people with wives and daughters who are overly concerned with appearances. Then the merit would be immeasurable!

### How to Learn

— Ziwen

All knowledge comes from learning. The more you learn, the richer your knowledge. Conversely, nothing can progress. If you don't advance, you will regress, and you may even lose what you have learned. This shows how precious learning is. However, if you only know it is precious and do not know how to learn, then the harvest will definitely be small. Therefore, I have set out a few basic principles of learning here. Please keep them firmly in mind during the learning process. This can help you learn the most and progress the fastest:

First, you must seize time.

Second, you must have perseverance and regularity.

Third, you must have confidence, determination, and a tenacious spirit.

Fourth, you must be humble.

Fifth, you must have a high degree of self-motivation. (Moved from the Orphaned Army)

### A Huge Sum of Money

— Jingzheng

The UK is currently spending approximately six million pounds per day on the war. Sir Simon estimates that this day's expenses could be used for the following purposes:

(1) To provide all unemployed men and women in the UK with five pounds a day, or 1,825 pounds a year. (2) To provide retirees with a pension of two pounds a day.

(3) To clear the debts owed by the London County Council in two weeks.

(3) This huge sum could allow shipyards to build three cruisers a day.

(4) The UK's annual fire losses could be fully compensated for in one day with this money.

### An Interesting Question: Do Hollywood Stars Know Each Other?

— Jieni

Do you think Claudette Colbert and Marlene Dietrich are good friends? Or do you believe that Tyrone Power and Robert Taylor know each other well?

This is indeed an interesting and difficult question to answer.

Although they are all big stars who don't need introductions when they meet; although they are all in the same big family - Hollywood; in fact, this big family is not very happy, with all kinds of competition and displeasure, so it is not surprising that stars do not interact with each other.

Once, Claudette Colbert and Zassu Pitts lived next door to each other for three years and never met or spoke a word to each other. A year later, they were both actors at Paramount. One day, they happened to meet at the company. They smiled at each other and shook hands, and only then did they begin to get to know each other.

Another time, Constance Bennett and Claudette Colbert were waiting in the waiting room of a hospital at the same time. Apart from meeting on the screen, they had never met each other before, so they did not dare to greet each other. Later, they took the movie magazines on display in the room and flipped through them, and they both discovered that the other's photos really looked like the other person. So Claudette mustered up the courage to introduce herself:

"Hi, I'm in the movies, my name is Claudette."

"My name is Constance," the other person replied.

Then, the two of them laughed loudly. From then on, they talked very warmly and enthusiastically until the doctor called them inside. When Claudette met [Norma Shearer], after the hostess introduced them to each other, both of them wanted to say "I've heard so much about you," but they found it difficult to start the conversation. So they first talked about the movies they had seen recently. Then Claudette told Norma that she admired her very much, and Norma replied by praising Claudette as a great artist.

From the above examples, it seems that although Hollywood stars know each other's names, even if they often meet or live next door, if there is no accidental chance, they may never get to know each other in their lives.

### On the Public Charity Concert

— Lin Meixian

Every spring and autumn, concerts become the most active artistic trend in Shanghai. Harmonica groups are of course no exception. The Public Harmonica Society's concert was held the night before last at the auditorium of Aurora University.

The Public Harmonica Society is led by harmonica player Mr. Shi Renwang. He held a charity concert last autumn, which was well-received. This concert is also of a charitable nature, entertaining and not forgetting disaster relief. We should express our respect to this person who is engaged in popular music.

The musical program the night before last was entirely performed by members of the Public Harmonica Society. The opening was the "Raymond Overture," a large ensemble. Following that was Mr. Li Yinting's harmonica solo "Wilhelm Tell Overture," and the "Era Military Officer March" large ensemble. The audience seemed to have a great affection for the march, and expressed great welcome.

"The Dove" and "Wild Dance" were played by Shi Renwang, Shi Hailun, Zhu Rongshi, Cai Qilin and other four gentlemen with four accordions. "Light Cavalry" is a world-famous piece, now played by Gong Yuxiang and Tang Zhihui with small harmonicas, which can express many advantages. "Lily Waltz" is also a well-known piece of music, played with excellent technique. Miss Shi Hailun's ensemble harmonica solo is said to be the first public performance of the ensemble harmonica by a Chinese woman. She played "Sailor's Whistle" and "Tales from the Vienna Woods," which won great acclaim. "The Public Harmonica Society Song" is adapted from the famous song "Xichun Gui (Regret for Spring)," with singing added in the middle, which is also very unique.

### Recent News of Mei Lanfang in Hong Kong

— Hai Xing

The international drama artist Mei Lanfang is living in seclusion in Hong Kong. His face is covered with a short beard, and it seems that he has no intention of returning to the stage. However, he is still very concerned about the art.

One day, he visited the filming of "Striking the Fishing Boat" in Southern Guangdong. He praised Lu Ming's portrayal of Xiao Guiying, believing that she had the shyness and dignity that a girl should have in ancient times.

When asked about his opinion on domestic films, he said that he had recently watched "Peerless Beauty" and found it generally quite good, but some aspects, such as the wind roaring without dust blowing, seemed to be lacking. He also mentioned many technical issues in directing, showing that he is quite knowledgeable about film.

Mei Lanfang's acceptance of Wang Xichun as his disciple has already been held at the Repulse Bay Hotel. Mei said to people, "Although Xichun's figure and acting skills have not yet reached perfection, she has no bad habits. Her voice is inherently narrow, but it is not impossible to improve." Now Xichun goes to Mei's residence for vocal exercises around 5 pm every day. It is said that Xichun is the first female disciple Mei has accepted. Although Mei's wife, Fu Zhifang, also received guidance from Mei in the past, she soon married Mei.

Ma Lianliang's Square Back Flags in Lintong Mountain (Middle)

For any newly invented thing, one must first consider its meaning. Drama is an art of beauty, so the newly created costumes must consider aesthetics and convenience in addition to meaning. Lianliang is originally unlearned, and those who cater to him only seek to please the audience with novelty. Thus, this incongruous dragon and tiger armor and square back flags appeared in the play "Lintong Mountain." Little did they know that Chinese drama is praised worldwide for its "symbolic" nature. If everything strives for realism, then the value of Chinese drama is lost. For example, the armor worn by military generals was originally made of iron and leather, and was used to protect the body against the enemy. The armor is composed of three parts connected together. The part that resembles a cape is called the shoulder guard, the part that is attached to the chest is called the breastplate, and the parts that hang down on both sides are called the leg guards. Although they are all made of iron leaves, their weight is also forty to fifty pounds. In drama, the shape is imitated with satin and decorated with brocade, and it is called "kao" (armor). Except for the leg guards (insiders call this "kao paizi"), the upper and middle parts are connected as one, and the lower part of the "kao du" (the middle part called the breastplate) is longer than the real one, purely for lightness and beauty. If it were really made of iron leaves, I am afraid that even Yu Runxian, who is superhuman in strength, would find it difficult to show his good skills in "Changban Slope." Also, the armor is divided into soft and hard types. The hard armor has a leather seat on the back to insert the four-sided back flags, while the soft armor does not. The original intention of the back flags was that when generals fought on horseback, they could take any one of the command flags to issue orders. The number did not have to be four, and the shape did not have to be square. In the early years, I saw that the Bangzi troupes used eight back flags. Later, Xia Yuerun, a martial arts actor in Shanghai, also used them once, but in the end, they felt cumbersome and not elegant. Therefore, for many years, the triangular four-sided back flags have been unanimously adopted by the performing arts circle.
