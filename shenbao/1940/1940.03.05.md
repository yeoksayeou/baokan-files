### Shanxi War Situation in the Past Week

Xingji: The war situation in Shanxi this week was most intense on both sides of the Tongpu Railway in southern Jin. On the east side, there were frequent engagements at the end of last month on the line of Fushan, Yicheng, and Jiangxian. The Chinese forces advanced along various routes and achieved many victories on the Fulin Road. Japanese forces in each stronghold are now fearful of Chinese attacks and are on high alert. On the west side, the Japanese army reinforced their troops and harassed areas such as Heilongguan, Fencheng, Xinjiang, and Jishan this week, leading to fierce fighting. The Japanese troops in Jishan and Xinjiang were subjected to a counter-attack by Chinese forces and retreated mostly back into the city. Small groups are still active, and the Chinese are currently destroying them separately. Over a thousand Japanese troops were added to the Heilongguan area this week. Since the 28th, they have repeatedly attempted to invade westwards but have been repelled. On the morning of the 1st, Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked the Jingjiashan and Baihuling areas in the southeast of Puxian. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Wan'an also attacked Qiaojiawan, coordinating with each other with great momentum. The Chinese army calmly faced the enemy and engaged in mobile operations from morning to noon, repeatedly charging the Japanese lines. Fearing encirclement by the Chinese, the Japanese retreated towards Heilongguan and Wan'an. The fighting in the triangular area was also intense. The Chinese launched fierce attacks on Zhangdian and Ershiling for days, causing the Japanese forces to waver and urgently transfer troops from Linfen for reinforcement. The Japanese troops in Xiaxian and Wenxi attempted to take action but failed to succeed. The morale of the Chinese army is boosted, and progress is smooth. The war situation in Shanxi Province is becoming more optimistic. (3rd Dispatch)

### Floods and Water Conservancy During the War of Resistance

The spring breeze is gentle, and the ice and snow in the northwest melt, marking the beginning of the season when turbulent currents become active. It is rumored that the people of northern provinces, amidst the foreign invasion that puts them in deep water and scorching fire, are also concerned about the potential for floods that may be inevitable. Everyone sympathizes with the National Government's temporary inability to reach them, and fellow countrymen in other provinces, though concerned about the north, can only sigh helplessly at their inability to assist. Japan constantly proclaims its development of the economy of North China, but its focus is on the immediate exploitation and oppression, and it naturally disregards what is called water conservancy.

When one speaks of floods and water conservancy, the Yellow River is the source. To eliminate floods in the north and develop water conservancy in the north, the key is to control the Yellow River. "Those who govern a hundred-li river should have their sights set a thousand li away; those who govern today's river should have their sights set a hundred years ahead." This is a penetrating statement by Zhang Jian of Nantong, but those currently in control of the north are of course unable to discuss this. Originally, after the great achievements of Yu the Great, the Yellow River once again became a major disaster for China, and it has been so for two thousand years. The construction of flood control and water conservancy is a long-term plan for a hundred years, and its effects cannot be seen overnight. Historically, special officials have been appointed, and huge sums of money have been spent annually without interruption, and only then could flood disasters be slightly mitigated. Since the invasion, almost all previous efforts have been abandoned. Above ChengGao, the Yellow River is constrained by the natural terrain of the mountains and gorges on both sides, so there is no fear of the river overflowing. However, downstream to the east of ChengGao is the loess layer of northern China, which is loose and unstable, so the river carries sediment from upstream and merges with the flows of the Jing, Wei, Qi, Ju, Fen, Yi, Luo, Chan, Jian, Dan, and Qin rivers over thousands of miles, passing through the Dragon Gate and the Zhidong Pillar, and flows directly into the plains. The river becomes turbulent, the sediment settles, the riverbed narrows, and the riverbed rises, so dykes and embankments are often breached, causing disasters. At ordinary times, we rely on the prevention and rescue of water conservancy administrative engineering.

The impact of the Yellow River disaster was originally not limited to the Yellow River Basin of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, but also severely affected Jiangsu and Anhui. Historical miracles show that the impact is directly proportional to the intrusion of foreign forces into China. In the fifth year of the Mingchang reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the Jin Dynasty, the Yellow River seized the Huai River. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, it seized the entire Huai River and flowed into the sea. By the fifth year of the Xianfeng reign of the former Qing Dynasty, it moved north again and flowed into the sea through Qiancheng. The causes and consequences are difficult to explain, but the facts are such, and how can they be easily explained? In the three years of the War of Resistance, the rivers have also changed. The old course of the Huai River has been eroded by the Yellow River, receiving less benefit from the water volume and more harm from the sediment. The passage to the sea has also been silted up. Although there is Hongze Lake that can be used for storage, the lake has been rising daily due to the backflow of sediment. The lake water overflows, and flooding occurs frequently, creating a situation where "when the lake floods, Fengyang and Sizhou both grieve, and when it overflows, Xuzhou and WuNing have no good years." In view of this, the National Government has been striving to govern, and in recent years, it has extensively requisitioned labor to guide the Huai River, dredging the river channel and building embankments, so that the flow has a direction and the water is controlled. Although the project is huge and has not been fully completed, the results have already been significant. However, when foreign aggression came and the War of Resistance began, it made it difficult to carry out the Huai River diversion project. During the battles on the Longhai Railway two years ago, the indiscriminate artillery fire broke the Huayuan River mouth in Zhongmou and the Zhaokou in Zhengxian. As a result, the Yellow River flowed horizontally, flowing directly down the Jialu River to the Ying River, and joining the Huai River at Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui. Dozens of counties were submerged, covering an area of 100,000 square miles, and nearly 12 million people were affected. This is an unprecedented disaster for Jiangsu and Anhui, caused by the invasion, but the indirect cause is also related to the Yellow River. As for the Yellow River Basin itself, the upstream is still stable, but the downstream area of eastern Henan, after being occupied by the Japanese army, is beyond the reach of the National Government's regulations. It is of course impossible to trace the root cause and block the Yellow River. Seeing the disaster, one can only sigh helplessly.

It is difficult to seek quick success in controlling the river, but persistence must be the creed. Take the Shanghai example. At ordinary times, almost everyone doubts the effectiveness of the Junpu Bureau. However, last autumn, due to the Junpu Bureau's cessation of activities for two years, the Huangpu Riverbed rose daily, creating a situation where the Shanghai Concession was flooded with several feet of water, which did not recede for several days. Another example is that the water conservancy in Tianjin in the north is poorly maintained, resulting in the flooding of the Ziya and Hai Rivers to a depth of more than ten feet, and the estimated loss to citizens is about 150 million. We can of course understand that these disasters are not natural disasters but man-made disasters! Disasters will inevitably intensify if they are not eliminated, and invasion and floods are no exception. According to a Reuters report from Chongqing the other day, experts on river dredging believe that the Yellow River's entry into the Yangtze River via the Huai River has a negative impact on the Yangtze River waterway, which will not only cause floods, but may even damage thousands of agricultural, industrial, and commercial cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, or even cause Shanghai, the largest industrial and trading port in the Far East, to lose its original position. It is also said that... when the Chinese and Japanese armies fought in the area of the Longhai Railway in May of the year before last, the Yellow River breached its banks in the area of Kaifeng, and the water flowed through Hongze Lake into the Huai River, and then through the Grand Canal into the Yangtze River. It was originally hoped that the waters of the Yellow River would return to their old course this year, but according to recent news received by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission here, it has been determined that the waters of the Yellow River will no longer flow back to their old course. Its total flow now pours into the Huai River, destroying all the dikes built by the Huai River Diversion Committee of the Chinese government before the Sino-Japanese War. This speculation is indeed shocking, but the opinions of experts cannot be lightly dismissed. Then the great disaster of the coming days should be worried about by those who care, and should also be something that the War of Resistance cannot cope with. To seek countermeasures, the only thing is to strengthen the belief in the primacy of resistance and the primacy of victory. Because in today's situation, any water conservancy construction is of course out of the question. It is clear that the Yellow River carries its flow of 18,000 cubic meters per second, and the Huai River carries its flow of 16,000 cubic feet per second, and that the confluence flows directly into the Yangtze River, which is a great disaster. However, this aggressive intent fundamentally destroys the nation, cutting off thousands of years of history from above and enslaving hundreds of generations of descendants from below. In comparison, controlling floods and developing water conservancy are not the most urgent tasks.

### British Embassy Stationed in Shanghai; No Rift with Chongqing; Butler Responds to Questions from Members of Parliament; Says Policy Towards China Unaffected

London: At the meeting of the Lower House today, Conservative MP Dr. Lape asked whether the Government was prepared to take appropriate measures, since the National Government of China was now in Chongqing and the British Embassy in China was in Shanghai, 1,800 miles away, so that after the end of the war, Britain's commercial position in China could be restored to its former state. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "I stated in the House of Commons on the 20th of last month that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, has been in Chongqing for some time and has not yet left. The Embassy has a permanent office in Chongqing, and even if Ambassador Kerr is stationed in Shanghai or goes elsewhere, he can still maintain contact with the National Government of China on all matters relating to British commercial interests." Dr. Lape further asked whether the Government had sent important personnel to Chongqing to deal with all important matters at any time, since the British Ambassador to China was 1,800 miles away from the seat of the Chinese government. Undersecretary Butler replied, "Ambassador Kerr has been stationed in Chongqing since the beginning of this year. Even if he leaves in the future, there will still be appropriate personnel there to continue all negotiations." At this point, Davidson, a Labour MP from the opposition party, interjected, "Then is our country's policy towards China also 1,800 miles away from the Chinese government?" Undersecretary Butler replied, "No." (4th Havas Dispatch)

### Japan Has No Sincerity in Opening the Yangtze River; Hata Shunroku States That Japanese Military Must Decide

Tokyo: According to Japanese Minister of War Hata Shunroku in the House of Representatives Budget Committee today, if a third country takes a threatening attitude and hinders Japan's military operations and its actions to maintain peace and order in China, the Japanese army will not open the Yangtze River. He also said that Japan's expression of its intention to open the Yangtze River last December was a unilateral decision by the Japanese side and was not intended to elicit a good response from other countries. Because Japan's expression of its intention to open the Yangtze River was not an expression of a promise on the Japanese side, it is up to the Japanese army to decide when to open it. In other words, it must be opened after the Japanese army is properly prepared. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Japan Eager for Talks: Franco-Japanese Discussions

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Suma Yakichiro, stated today that the Japanese government is eager to hold talks with the French government to find ways to improve political and commercial relations between the two countries.

The Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada Renzo, has already held preliminary talks with the French Foreign Ministry, the contents of which have not been announced. (United Press, 4th)

### Major Changes Expected Among Close Advisors to the Emperor; Yuasa Feels Unease

Tokyo – It is widely rumored in political circles here that major changes may occur in the near future among the close advisors to the Emperor. The most significant of these is that Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei may submit his resignation. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Yuasa has been involved in manipulating the reorganizations of successive wartime cabinets, but now it is said that he has expressed to people his intention to retire. According to reports, this public figure has stated that since 1937, the cabinet has been changed four times, exposing the weakness of Japan's political structure. Although this situation is due to the war, he cannot absolve himself of responsibility. However, in political and parliamentary circles, it is rumored that the relationship between Minister Yuasa and the military has become increasingly delicate since the beginning of this year. The military's mouthpiece, Kokumin Shimbun, published an article on the day of the inauguration of the Yonai cabinet, attacking Yuasa, stating that Yuasa had launched a "conspiracy" around the Emperor, causing General Yonai to be appointed as Prime Minister, while other candidates who were closer to the military were excluded. Although this kind of criticism is not very public at the moment, it has not disappeared. Yuasa, in this delicate situation, should voluntarily retire, and the central authorities can thus usher in fresh air. In addition, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira Tsuneo also intends to retire. The reason for this is not yet clear. It is speculated that this public figure has always advocated pro-British policies and has often been criticized by certain parties, so he feels that it is necessary to resign together with Yuasa. Regarding this rumor, well-informed sources here recently said that it may not happen immediately, but one thing can be said with certainty, that Privy Council President Konoe Fumimaro, who has always had good relations with the military, is currently studying the situation. Regarding the issue of changing the close advisors to the Emperor, he may offer his personal opinion and recommend his close friend, Marquis Kido Koichi, to succeed as Minister of the Imperial Household, and have Goto succeed as Minister of the Imperial Household.

### Japanese Government Promotes National Savings; Practically Unfeasible; Economic Crisis Looms

Tokyo – In order to cope with the financial plans for issuing bonds and national production, the Japanese government has stipulated that the total amount of national savings for the fiscal year beginning April 1st should be 11,900,000,000 yen. In other words, all men, women, and children across the country must save an average of 119 yen each in the next twelve months. It is found that farmers account for about 74% of the Japanese population, and it is also found that the average annual net income of the 5.5 million farming households in 1935 was less than 102 yen. In the coming year, with the cost of living and tax burden higher than ever before, it will be difficult to achieve this level of savings without concerted national efforts. An official of the Ministry of Finance said that he knew it was extremely difficult for lower-level officials, low-wage earners, and those who depend on wages to make savings of 119 yen each, but the people must try their best to overcome the difficulty. Kokumin Shimbun said that if this amount cannot be reached, inflation cannot be stopped, and the streets will be filled with banknotes. Furthermore, if the people do not save and accumulate large sums, the structure of the expansion of production in Japan, Manchuria, and China will be as easy to collapse as a house built on sand.

### Japanese Diet Member Saito Dispels Resignation Intentions

Tokyo – Regarding the issue of the resignation of Mr. Saito Takao, Director-General of the Minseito Party's Parliamentary Affairs, Uchisaki, and fellow members Yatsunami Takeharu, Shian Shinkuro, and Okazaki Hisajiro have been working hard to mediate. However, the Seiyukai Innovation Faction, the Jikyoku Doshikai, and other factions have not joined the negotiations, insisting on their position and not making any concessions. They do not allow Saito to resign. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th, the meeting of Saito, Nomura, Yamamichi, Kawasaki, Yatsunami, Shian, Kudo, and Okazaki at Mr. Okazaki's private residence completely broke down. At this time, Saito retracted his previous intention and expressed his intention not to resign. He then left and took the train west to his constituency in Hyogo at 3:00 p.m. (Domei News Agency, 4th)

### Welles Arrives in Lausanne; Compiles Report on Visit to Germany; Will Soon Go to Paris to Visit French Authorities; Rumor that Hitler Made Five Points

Bern, Switzerland – U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here this morning from Berlin and immediately went to Lausanne, where he will stay until the 6th of this month to prepare a report on the details of his talks with the German authorities and send it by telegram to President Roosevelt. He will then go to Paris to hold talks with the French authorities. (Havas, 4th)

Berlin – U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles left here last night for Paris after discussing the possibility of peace in Europe with Chancellor Hitler. Welles passed through the "Western Front" of Germany's strongest region, Basel, on his train journey to France. When he left Berlin, he did not carry any hope for an early peace. Reliable sources claim that "Welles feels that the German people and leaders intend to abandon a long-term war and launch a fierce offensive in the spring under the cover of the air force." At this time, the German press broke its silence on Welles' visit to Germany. German newspapers warned that a new stable Europe and the restoration of peace can only be built after Germany's victory. Germany's victory will shatter Britain's attempt to subdue Germany. (United Press, 4th)

Rome – There is no criticism here regarding U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' meeting with Hitler, but the dispatches from Berlin carried in various newspapers reflect the German view that peace initiatives have absolutely no chance of success. (Reuters, 4th)

The Hague – According to a Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper, Hitler proposed five procedural points when he met with President Roosevelt's representative Welles on Saturday and Sunday: (1) Germany must possess Bohemia and Moravia and Poland (the annexation of Austria by Germany goes without saying); (2) Britain must not engage in conspiracies or exert influence in the Scandinavian Peninsula; (3) Britain's pirate nests in Malta, Gibraltar, and Singapore must be eliminated; (4) Germany applies the Monroe Doctrine in Central Europe; (5) Return German colonies. Hitler claimed that Germany could only cease fire after the above conditions were fulfilled. Hitler also strongly advocated that the United States should send an ambassador to Berlin again. Welles has now set off for Basel, Switzerland. German newspapers today only carried very simple news about Welles' talks with Hitler and Ribbentrop. No further official information has been announced, but Reuters has learned that a slightly more detailed communique will be issued soon. (Reuters, 4th)

Paris – Foreign observers here recently stated that after conducting talks in Rome and Berlin, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is taking a short break in Switzerland and telegraphing President Roosevelt about the situation. Although the outside world knows nothing about the content of his talks with the German authorities, one point has been confirmed, namely that German leader Hitler had a long discussion with Undersecretary Welles on the Finnish issue. Hitler is eager for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union to end as soon as possible so that the Soviet Union can provide economic assistance to Germany in the spring of this year. In other words, if the Finnish army holds out for a few more weeks, the ice and snow in various parts of the country will melt due to the warming weather. At that time, military operations on both sides will inevitably be interrupted for several weeks. Since the war between Finland and the Soviet Union will have to be prolonged, the assistance that Germany expects from the Soviet Union will also become increasingly distant, which is not what Hitler wants to hear. (Havas, 4th)

Basel, Switzerland – A correspondent for the Basler Abendblatt in Berlin recently reported that when German leader Hitler met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday, it was only known that the scope of the talks was extremely narrow, and nothing else was known. As for the talks conducted today by General Göring, the dictator of Germany's Four-Year Economic Plan and Minister of Aviation, with Welles, it is said that they mainly focused on various economic issues. Undersecretary Welles also had lunch with former German Minister of Economics Dr. Schacht at noon today. As for the written reply that Hitler will present to U.S. President Roosevelt, it is said that it will be personally delivered to Welles by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Havas, 3rd)

Bern, Switzerland – The German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur recently issued a message stating that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles left for Basel, Switzerland, this afternoon after staying in Berlin for a day. German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker, Director of Protocol Toenpner, and the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Germany and various embassy staff members were all at the station to see him off. (Havas, 3rd)

Budapest – It is rumored that German leader Hitler told U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles that Germany not only wants to control Poland but also wants to control Hungary. Responsible figures here recently firmly denied this, saying that Hungary's independent sovereignty has a solid foundation and there is no room for borrowing. Foreign observers say that according to the repeated expressions issued by the German authorities, the space they call vital for survival includes not only Hungary but even the entire Central Europe.

### British House of Commons Questions Peace Proposals; Butler Replies, Saying They Lack Authenticity

London – The peace proposals initiated and published last week by Lord Tavistock and the British Christian Council for Reconciliation in Europe became the subject of questioning in the House of Commons this afternoon. Undersecretary Butler declared that the British government did not provide any special assistance when Tavistock went to Dublin. After Tavistock returned here, he immediately announced a proposal that claimed to be the conditions under which the German government could negotiate peace. Before this proposal was published, it was notified to the Foreign Secretary by Tavistock. Setting aside the merits and demerits of this proposal, it is quite clear that it cannot be proven to have been drafted by the German government or be considered authentic. He knows that the German government and the German embassy in Dublin have denied this proposal. A Member of Parliament then asked whether the government recognizes Tavistock's actions in this matter, or whether any individual can negotiate and submit reports to the government. Butler replied that Tavistock did not represent the government in any way. (Reuters, 4th)

### Soviet-Turkish Talks on Border Demilitarization; Near East Situation Eases

Milan – According to the "Stampa," Turkey and the Soviet Union have each sent representatives to negotiate and discuss the withdrawal of troops stationed near the border between the two countries to avoid conflict. (Haitong, 4th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia – There is currently great attention being paid to the political developments in the Near East. According to a report from the political newspaper's correspondent in Turkey, Turkish political figures believe that there may not be a war in Asia Minor. The reason is that from the perspective of the Allied countries, if the scope of the war expands to the Near East, the position of Britain and France will become worse. First, Britain and France will have to fight on foreign territory. Second, Britain and France will have a new enemy, Russia. (Haitong, 4th)

### Belgian Territory Must Not Be Violated; Belgian Foreign Minister Issues Statement

### Italy Protests to Britain over the Blockade of German Coal; Believes It Contradicts the Anglo-Italian Agreement and Violates the Spirit of International Law

Rome – After the British government decided to consider the coal shipped from Germany to Italy as contraband to be detained, the Italian government protested to the British government, stating that this decision is of great importance and is illegal. The coal shipped from Germany is of great importance to our country's economy. Your government's decision to blockade it contradicts the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16, 1938, and is sufficient to disrupt the political and economic relations between our two countries. Our government is eager to clearly explain the key points of the current situation in order to point out where the responsibility lies for possible developments in the future. (Havas, 4th)

Rome – The British government recently informed Italy, declaring that from the 1st of this month, the British Navy will also inspect German coal being shipped to Italy. The Italian government recently sent a reply to the Foreign Ministry, protesting, saying that current international law has provisions to protect the commercial interests of neutral countries. The British government's decision to inspect coal purchased by Italy is completely inconsistent with the letter and spirit of international law. Furthermore, the British Navy's inspection of mail on the high seas also contradicts the Hague Convention of 1907. (Havas, 4th)

London – Regarding the Italian government's protest against the British government's decision to consider German coal shipped to Italy as contraband, it has been delivered here. The government authorities will carefully consider it within the scope of considering Italian interests. However, Germany's methods of warfare are barbaric and arbitrary, harming most countries indiscriminately. Since Britain has entered into war with it and has decided to use economic warfare against it, in order to protect its own interests, it cannot abandon the various major rights permitted by international law. (Havas, 4th)

Rome – According to a report released by the Italian Bureau of Statistics, the coal-producing areas of Suisis and Alsace produced a total of 1,925,000 tons of coal last year, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. At the same time, 1,058,000 tons of soft coal were produced. (Haitong, 4th)

### Indian Muslim Leader Attacks the National Congress; Sir Haroon Appeals to America

New Delhi – Sir Haroon, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the All-India Muslim League, today published an article asking the American people to study the political situation in India in detail, saying that the American people's interest in Indian freedom is commendable, but we hope that before expressing opinions on Indian affairs, they will study all aspects of the Indian problem in detail, because the Indian problem has many difficulties that cannot be reduced by the current declarations made by the All-India National Congress to the United States. The 90 million Muslims and the Hindus are distinct from each other, but the All-India National Congress, which is purely composed of Hindus, wants to rule the Muslims with Hindus. This can be proven by the experience of the Congress's two years of tyrannical rule in various provinces. The National Congress advocates independence, and its purpose is to establish a majority of Hindus under a federation with the power to abolish Muslim independence, and it does not allow independence even in provinces where Muslims are in the majority. What the National Congress calls independence is nothing more than wanting to enslave 90 million Muslims. Muslims are determined to resist it. Muslims are not opposed to India's independence and are always seeking India's independence, but the main obstacle is that the National Congress cannot gain the trust of Muslims. American people should understand the basic points of the current dispute between Britain and the National Congress. The point of contention is how to control the 90 million Muslims. The National Congress is unwilling to address this issue, so Britain only has two options: either demand that the National Congress and the Muslims and other minorities negotiate a solution, or recognize the demands of the National Congress and plunge the Indian peninsula into civil unrest. Muslims and other minorities combined are stronger than those represented by the National Congress, so Muslims hope that those in America who love India will persuade the National Congress leaders to have an appropriate level of patience and understanding. The demands of the Muslims are very simple. The 90 million people want the right to self-determination and want to obtain separate homelands in the majority areas so that they can manage their careers and lives without being disturbed by others.

### Soviet Artillery Bombardment, Viipuri Falls, Finnish Army Moves Positions to Continue Fighting, Ice Broken to Prevent Flanking

Stockholm, Sweden - With Viipuri fallen, the Finnish army will now defend a new line that offers less cover than the front line before Viipuri. The next two weeks will be a severe test for the Finnish side. If the Finnish army can hold this untested line within these two weeks, the snowfall and melting snow in March may save their declining situation. The lack of Finnish soldiers and artillery are the two main reasons for the fall of Viipuri. The Soviet army is now occupying Viipuri. Once the occupation is complete, the Finnish army will be forced to retreat to a new line behind the city. The strength of this newly created line is highly questionable. The rapid advance of the Soviet army near the Karelian Isthmus is astonishing. Although Viipuri was heavily bombarded by Soviet aircraft and artillery a month ago, it was still a complete city. Now, it is a pile of rubble with smoldering fires. The Finns did not abandon valuable items, as large amounts of food and goods stored in factories and shops have been completely transported away, and all important buildings have been destroyed or burned. Viipuri Castle, which once served as the headquarters of the Finnish commander in the area, is now just an empty shell. To prevent the danger of a Soviet flanking maneuver, the Finns have completely shattered the ice along the coast of the Gulf of Finland. According to Finnish sources, the fall of Viipuri is important in terms of national morale, but not strategically, as the city itself is not a military defense site. (Reuters, 4th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Fierce fighting has been raging on the outskirts of Viipuri. The Soviet army is indiscriminately bombarding the town with artillery. Due to strict Finnish censorship, it is impossible to know how far the Soviet army has advanced. It is believed that Finnish defenders near Perkjärvi and the Heinjoki railway station may have been forced to retreat again in the last twelve hours. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Helsinki, Finland - Red Army troops have been attacking Viipuri urgently for days, but according to reliable sources, the city's 15th-century castle still flies the Finnish flag with a white background and blue cross. Today's battles are taking place on the northeastern outskirts of the city. The Finnish army is currently firmly defending the northwest line outside the city to resist the enemy's advance. This line is part of the Mannerheim Line and has been repeatedly strengthened in the past three months. Its sole mission is to protect the railway line from Simola to Imatra, which reduces the strategic value of Viipuri itself. As for this railway line, it runs parallel to the southern defenses of Finland and is of great military value. (Havas, 3rd)

Helsinki, Finland - Several Red Army soldiers parachuted behind Viipuri today in an attempt to attack the Finnish army from the rear. All of them have been captured. (Havas, 3rd)

Helsinki, Finland - The General Headquarters has just released a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army repeatedly attacked our troops yesterday but were repelled. However, in certain areas, our army has automatically withdrawn to new positions according to plan to continue fighting. Also, in the eastern part of the Karelian region, our artillery bombarded the Red Army, inflicting heavy casualties and destroying several tanks and artillery pieces. (2) In the Itäjoki and Kollaanjoki regions, the Red Army's attempts to advance have been intercepted by our army, resulting in over a thousand casualties and the loss of a large amount of military supplies. (3) In the Kuhmo region, the Red Army launched an attack but was repelled by our army. (4) Our planes attacked the Red Army on the front lines yesterday. Soviet planes extensively bombed the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, especially the Imatra area. Enemy planes also flew to Mikeli, Guovola, and other places in the Finnish interior, carrying out indiscriminate bombings, resulting in multiple casualties among the residents. Seventeen enemy planes were shot down by our forces. The wreckage of two enemy planes shot down by our forces on the first of this month was discovered yesterday. (Havas, 3rd)

Moscow - The Leningrad Military District Headquarters announced that yesterday, Soviet troops continued to encircle Viipuri in the Karelian direction. North of Viipuri, Soviet troops occupied Hämeenlinna, capturing the headquarters and four 76mm artillery pieces. South of Viipuri, Soviet troops occupied the island of Tuppura, capturing six fortresses, including five artillery batteries and several intact artillery pieces. In other areas, there were no significant developments. The Soviet air force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets. (TASS, 4th)

### Soviet Military Denies Bombing Civilians, League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Finland

Moscow - The Leningrad Military District Headquarters has just released the following statement: "Recently, the so-called Finnish government submitted a 'memorandum' to the League of Nations condemning the 'war methods used by the Soviet Union.' This memorandum has been published by foreign newspapers. Our military headquarters has carefully reviewed the entire text and believes that all the allegations are pure fabrications.

(1) The 'document' claims that 'the Soviet air force bombs Finnish civilians every day,' and states that 'hundreds of aircraft (500) participate in the bombing, dropping 20,000 bombs and firing machine guns.' The 'document' further falsely accuses the Soviet air force of targeting civilians.

However, the 'document' itself reveals the stupidity of Finnish storytellers, who, based on inaccurate Finnish communiqués, claim that '392 civilians were killed in air raids' (this figure is also recorded in the memorandum). Considering that the war has been going on for three months, if 'hundreds of Soviet aircraft bombed civilians every day,' then the number would be far more than '392.' This fully proves that the 'memorandum' of the bankrupt Finnish ruling class is pure fantasy and fabrication. This also proves that the Soviet air force bombed enemy troops, enemy fortresses, airfields, and military locations, and never civilians. As for civilian casualties, they may occur, but according to Finnish reports, they account for a very small number.

From this perspective, the falsity of the 'memorandum's' contents is extremely clear. Finnish storytellers have overreached themselves and further exposed their embarrassment.

(2) The fantastic delusion in the 'memorandum' writer claims that 'the Soviet army repeatedly uses Finnish civilians and prisoners as shields during charges,' and states that 'the Soviet army used nerve gas, resulting in eleven Finnish soldiers becoming ill.' At the same time, 'Soviet naval tactics also violate international law.'

This kind of unfounded report, as well as the memorandum's claim that the Soviet Union has violated the laws of war stipulated by the 1907 Hague Convention and the 1929 Geneva Convention of July 27, is completely baseless and purely a rumor created by the Finnish rulers who are in a difficult situation. The Red Army is strong and has no need to use nerve gas, and the Red Army believes that the use of nerve gas is a crime that must be immediately condemned by the whole world.

This kind of rumor cannot save the Finnish rulers from their demise. Currently, in the Karelian region, when Finnish officers are forced to abandon fortresses, they execute soldiers who are unwilling to fight against the Soviet army. The plight of the Finnish rulers is no less than that of these officers who are in a desperate situation.

(3) In addition, the aforementioned 'memorandum,' in order to conceal the plight of the Finnish White Guards, also states that 'the territory occupied by the Soviet army has no military value.' Our headquarters believes that there is no need to refute such foolish statements. This kind of lie is as obviously absurd as the recent fabricated victory reports of the Finnish White Guards." (TASS, 4th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to newspapers here, the League of Nations' committee to investigate the Soviet air force's bombing of undefended cities and Finnish civilians has been formed. Well-informed sources believe that the committee members are largely the same as those who investigated the bombing of Barcelona (Spain). It is reported that the committee members have arrived in Helsinki. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Britain's Attitude Towards the Soviet Union to Undergo Major Decision, Political Circles Believe Change is Possible, Calls for Military Aid to Finland are Rising

London - Political figures here recently stated that Britain and France have already decided to actively assist Finland within the scope permitted by neutrality. Therefore, while dealing with the war in Western Europe, they are also conserving military supplies as much as possible to support Finland. However, after the Red Army's continued progress in the Karelian Isthmus, Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union may change. Although there is no information to confirm this, most people believe that only by going to war with the Soviet Union can Finland be effectively assisted. Former War Minister Hore-Belisha recently published an article in the "World News Report," and The Times also published a special article on the 20th of last month, stating that Britain and France may not be able to tolerate the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany for long. Later, General Gough, the former commander of the Fifth British Army, also published an article stating that intervening in the Finnish-Soviet war to oppose the Soviet Union is indeed advisable. The "Nineteenth Century Monthly" further believes that this is essential for Britain and France to achieve victory. In addition, the "Time and Tide" magazine also expressed its agreement. Although the morning papers have not stated their position, they all reported that the current European war may expand to the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, or Norway. As for the Labour Party, opinions are still very divided on this matter. Several members of the party recently inspected the Finnish front line and, upon their return, advocated a strong anti-Soviet movement, but due to the opposition of most party members, it could not be put into practice. In short, the British government must make an important decision based on military, strategic, and moral considerations. Although British public opinion does not want the current European war to expand and go to war with the Soviet Union, if new events occur that provide a reason for actively assisting Finland, then the majority of the people will be willing to accept it, even if it means going to war with the Soviet Union.

### German Naval Chief Broadcasts Respect for US Neutrality, Specifies Targets for Attacking Merchant Ships, US Warns Captains Not to Approach Allied Ports

Berlin - Naval Minister Admiral Raeder delivered a broadcast speech last night, answering the question from Dr. Jordan, the European representative of the US National Broadcasting Company, namely, "Will naval warfare endanger American shipping?" Raeder declared, "Germany will respect President Roosevelt's neutrality policy of the United States. The German Navy has been ordered to pay close attention to American ships it encounters and avoid any adverse effects." Raeder stated, "The British blockade policy against Germany, which expands the scope of contraband, is tantamount to waging war against the entire German people. Therefore, Germany also has the obligation to use the same methods to retaliate against them, so that goods designated as contraband by Britain cannot reach England. Germany will only take certain actions against merchant ships under the following three circumstances: (1) armed merchant ships; (2) merchant ships escorted by warships or aircraft; (3) merchant ships hired for naval service. The above three types all lose their civilian nature and are the target of the German Navy to attack." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Washington - The US Department of Commerce has issued another instruction warning captains of North American ships not to call at Allied ports, and to adhere to North American neutrality. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Amsterdam - News from the capital of Uruguay states that major shipping companies in the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, have now decided to refuse to load goods directly bound for the United Kingdom, but goods bound for Amsterdam will continue to be loaded as usual, but the freight will be increased, so the price of goods will rise again. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### For Violation of Neutrality, Germany Apologizes to Belgium, Says Planes Crossed Border Due to Misunderstanding, Willing to Compensate for Loss of Shot Down Belgian Plane

Berlin - The German government issued an official statement last night as follows: "On March 2, a German reconnaissance plane, on its way back after completing reconnaissance in northern France, was pursued by seven British 'Hurricane' fighters. The German pilot believed that he was in French airspace and that the planes he encountered were British planes, so he pursued them, resulting in the shooting down of a 'Hurricane' fighter. It returned safely. After investigation, it was learned that the place where the air battle occurred was in Belgian airspace on the border between France and Belgium, and that the shot down plane was a Belgian fighter of the British 'Hurricane' type. The Belgian ambassador to Germany visited the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, and the German authorities expressed their regrets." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Brussels - Regarding the German plane invading Belgian airspace and shooting down a Belgian plane, according to official sources, the German government has acknowledged the mistake. The German ambassador to Belgium visited the Belgian Foreign Minister today, explained the German government's views, and expressed regret. In the future, the regulations prohibiting aircraft of belligerent countries from flying over the airspace of neutral countries will be absolutely observed. As for Belgium's request for compensation for losses, it is also willing to consider it. (Havas, 4th)

Brussels - Officials announced that yesterday several planes of unknown nationality were flying in Belgian airspace, and Belgian anti-aircraft guns opened fire.

### Indian Ship Sunk in English Channel, Two British Ships Hit Mines, Dutch Freighter Also Straffed

London - According to a British Admiralty communiqué, at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. on March 2, under a dim moon, two German bombers attacked the British-Indian merchant ship Dumana (8,441 tons) in the English Channel and dropped four bombs. Three bombs hit, the captain died, and the ship caught fire. The sea was dangerous, making rescue difficult. Although most of the passengers and crew were rescued by several British ships and a Dutch ship, 20 of the 48 British people on board were missing, and 88 of the 253 Indian people were missing, and are feared dead. Many of those rescued were also injured. This merchant ship had departed from Antwerp, Belgium. Among the British-Indian passengers it carried, 143 had previously been released by the German government. A casualty list is currently being compiled and will be notified to their families as soon as possible. The ship is now docked in the port. (Reuters, 4th)

London - Authorities issued a statement saying that the Dumana carried a total of 295 people, and a total of 100 were missing, including 19 European crew members, 36 Indian sailors, and 45 Indian passengers. The ship carried a total of 143 Indian passengers. Only two female servants were among the missing, and it is believed that they died immediately after the explosion. (Reuters, 4th)

London - The British ship "Albano" (1,176 tons) sank after hitting a mine in Scottish waters yesterday. The shipowner and chief mate were killed, but the rest of the crew were rescued. Also, the British ship "Cato" (710 tons) also sank after hitting a mine in western British waters. Two crew members were killed, eleven were missing, and only two were rescued and landed in a certain port. (Havas, 3rd)

Port of Ostend, Belgium - The Dutch freighters "Limborg" and "Aschland," which were loaded with coal from Newcastle, England, were strafed by German planes in the North Sea and suffered considerable damage. (Havas, 4th)

### Athens Sinking Case Litigated in US, US Demands Compensation for Losses of Passengers Killed

Washington - The British ship Athens, which sank in a mysterious explosion at the beginning of the European war, with 120 American passengers drowned, has now reportedly demanded US$700,000 in compensation from the British shareholders. The filing of this request allows the bereaved families of the deceased to resort to law to resolve the greatest mystery at sea in this war, namely, what was the true cause of the sinking of the Athens. Churchill claimed that the British Navy had obtained evidence that the German submarines were responsible for the incident, but the Germans said it was at Churchill's direction, that Churchill wanted to involve the United States in the vortex of the world war, and therefore deliberately created a second Lusitania incident. The representative of the claimants is George Natanson, an international lawyer from Washington. According to Natanson, the Federal Court in New York will be asked to determine who is responsible for the disaster, because neither the White Star Line nor the Donaldson Company has indicated any intention of settling out of court. As for the shareholders of the Athens, they said that since the blame lies with the Germans, they have no responsibility for the safety of the passengers. Natanson also said that at the beginning of the incident, he believed Churchill's words were true, and believed that the British Naval Intelligence Agency would disclose concrete evidence, but six months have passed, and no evidence has been presented to confirm Churchill's statement, so that the bereaved families of the deceased have the impression that the British Navy may have an unspeakable secret and may be hiding the evidence. Natanson continued, "Most of my clients sympathize with the Allied Powers, but they believe that if this matter was really done by the Germans, then the British Navy should have been able to confirm the Germans' guilt long ago within this long period of six months." According to reporters, some officials in the State Department also consider Britain's actions to be suspicious, because the State Department asked the British Admiralty about the nature of the cargo on the Athens and the condition of the boilers, but has not received a satisfactory response. The claimants in the Athens case can represent the American public, and it is heard that their plan is to invite anyone who can shed a ray of light on revealing the truth of the accident to appear in court for interrogation.

### Old Men Dominate British Politics, British Newspaper Points Out Current Situation

The Hague - The British Sunday Review, a widely circulated newspaper, published an article yesterday pointing out that the ages of key figures in British politics are too high and lack the ability to win victories. For example, former Prime Minister George is 77 years old, current Prime Minister Chamberlain is 70 years old, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon is 67 years old, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield is 66 years old, Naval Minister Churchill is 65 years old, Minister without Portfolio Lord Hankey is 62 years old, and Lord Privy Seal Lord Hailsham is younger at 58 years old. As for Secretary of State for War Stanley, at 44 years old, he is just a "little brother" in the eyes of the elders in the British wartime cabinet. Dutch business leaders discussed this article today, saying that this situation is even more prominent in British business circles. When the British famous "Great Western Railway Company" holds board meetings, most of those present are old men over 80 years old, and those in their 70s are regarded as juniors. None of the directors used by the management are under 75 years old. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Mumbai, India - Textile Strike

The Hague. According to news from London, 150,000 textile workers in Mumbai, India, have gone on strike demanding a 15% wage increase. Their slogans and leaflets express the hope of breaking away from British rule. (4th day, Reuters dispatch)

### Shanghai and Ningbo Organizations Rush to Handle Aftermath of Jing Sheng Ferry Tragedy, Ningxian Government Organizes Aftermath Committee, Hires Divers to Retrieve Bodies in Ningbo, Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association Sends 10,000 Yuan to Assist with Relief

The Jing Sheng ferry, a Ningbo barge, which was carrying passengers from the Moufu steamship from Benbo to Zhenhai outside the harbor, suddenly capsized the other day, causing a tragic incident. All parties are quite concerned about this. The Ningxian County Government has organized an aftermath committee and allocated funds to provide compensation to the passengers who died in the disaster. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association held an executive and supervisory meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss relief measures. The details of each situation are recorded below:

Moufu Steamer Crew Reports Details

The Moufu steamer arrived in Shanghai at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. According to the Moufu steamer crew who witnessed the capsizing and sinking of the Jing Sheng ferry, the Jing Sheng ferry left Ningbo at 7:00 AM on the 2nd, carrying over 250 passengers, to board the Moufu steamer bound for Shanghai outside Zhenhai harbor. At 1:50 PM, it carried over 300 passengers from the Deping steamer, which had arrived in Zhenhai from Shanghai, back to Ningbo. At that time, it was during a Japanese air raid, and the Ningbo air defense command issued an emergency alert. The Deping passengers disembarked one after another, and the second group of Moufu passengers on the dock also swarmed onto the Jing Sheng ferry. The ship's pilot was about to turn around and head to the opposite bank to temporarily avoid the air raid when it was surrounded by forty or fifty sampans. Over 200 passengers climbed aboard the Jing Sheng from the port side, and the passengers on board, fearing a repeat of the recent tragic bombing of the Zhenxin ferry between Ningbo and Yao by Japanese aircraft, were panicked and disorderly. The Jing Sheng ferry tilted too much and immediately began to sink. Within only three minutes, it had completely disappeared into the water, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The passengers all sank with the ferry. After salvage efforts, eleven bodies have been recovered, but all of them were beyond resuscitation despite being sent to Zhongzheng Huamei and other hospitals for treatment due to being in the water for too long. All the bodies have been moved to the Siming Public Hall for relatives to identify.

Partial List of Deceased Passengers

The list of bodies recovered in the past two days is listed below. Eleven bodies from the previous two days: (1) Yin Chang'an, male, 48 years old, residing at 6 Shishu Bridge.

Salvage of Bodies and Beginning of Aftermath

The Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, in order to actively salvage the bodies that have not yet been found, telegraphed the Moufu Steamer Shipping Department in Shanghai yesterday to find a way to hire divers to go to Ningbo to salvage them. The manager of the steamer, Zhu Meixian, hired three divers to take a special tugboat this morning, carrying salvage equipment, directly to Ningbo. It is reported that all the staff and crew of the Moufu Steamer were safe in this Jing Sheng ferry capsizing. However, there were seven relatives of Song Zhenfu, the chef in the steamer's kitchen, who were originally planning to take the Moufu Steamer to Shanghai for a wedding. They boarded the Jing Sheng ferry at the time. According to subsequent investigations, all seven are missing and presumed dead, which is also tragic. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Ningxian County Government, in addition to ordering the speedy salvage of the bodies that have not yet been found, has also jointly organized an aftermath committee with relevant agencies and local organizations. The personnel have already been decided, with Yu Jimin, the county magistrate of Ningxian, serving as the chairman, and Zhang Guiling, the deputy commander of the Ningbo garrison, and Zhou Dalie, the general manager of the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, serving as the vice-chairmen. The committee held its first meeting in Ningbo the day before yesterday and decided to allocate 10,000 yuan to handle all aftermath matters. The committee will provide compensation to the deceased passengers based on the circumstances, is currently investigating the names of the deceased, and notifying their families to identify them. The committee notified the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association yesterday by telegram (text omitted).

After all the workers of the British-owned Public Bus Company resumed work yesterday morning as advised, all bus routes have resumed operation yesterday. Regarding the conditions proposed by the labor side, Yu Qiaqing, together with the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department and the Police Department, mediated last night at 6:00 PM, and a resolution was reached at 12:00 AM. The details of each situation are recorded below:

All Bus Routes Fully Resumed

After the public bus workers accepted the advice the day before yesterday and agreed to resume work first, only routes 1, 9, 10, and 3 were resumed the day before yesterday because the workers had not all arrived and there were not enough buses to dispatch. As of yesterday morning, all buses have been fully resumed.

It is also reported that the workers at the Mechanical Department have also fully returned to the factory to resume work yesterday.

Conditions Negotiated and Resolved Satisfactorily

After the public bus workers resumed work, the twelve demands they raised were discussed yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM by Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing, together with representatives of the Concession authorities and both labor and management at the Sanbei Company. Liao Zhongqian and Mackay from the Police Department of the Public Works Department, Gu Bingyuan from the Industrial Section, Xiao Tuo, the general manager of the Chinese Public Bus Company, and Thede, the director of the Vehicle Department, and five labor representatives attended. The management representatives first responded to each of the conditions proposed by the labor side, and there were generally no problems. However, the two items of wage increase and rice subsidy were strongly contested by both sides. Finally, after much persuasion by the mediators, both sides expressed concessions, and a satisfactory resolution was reached at 11:00 PM.

Yu Issues Notice to All Workers

After the conditions were negotiated and resolved, Yu Qiaqing immediately drafted a letter to notify all workers, hoping that they would work with peace of mind. The original text recorded by the Daguan News Agency reporter is as follows: "To all workers of the Public Bus Company: Regarding the labor unrest in your company, all the demands of the workers have been discussed in detail by the company and the workers' representatives, and a resolution has now been reached. Regarding the living allowance, it has been decided to increase it from the current 10% to 30%. The current rice subsidy method has been changed to allow each person to purchase half a shi of rice per month at a price of 15 yuan. Regardless of how high the price of rice rises, all losses will be borne by the company. This is a satisfactory solution. We hope that all workers will work with peace of mind. Respectfully, Yu Qiaqing."

Labor Side Expresses Gratitude to All Sectors

A representative of the labor side told the Daguan News Agency reporter after the negotiations ended, "This time, all the workers of the Public Bus Company, unable to bear the pressure of living, put forward conditions for improved treatment to the company authorities. We are grateful for the sympathy and assistance of all sectors, and we are also grateful to Mr. Yu Qiaqing and the Concession authorities for mediating, and we are even more grateful to the company for understanding the plight of the workers and accepting our demands, resulting in a satisfactory resolution. All the workers express their deep gratitude. We have now decided to abide by the advice of Mr. Yu and the Concession authorities, work with peace of mind, and strive to serve the transportation work, so as not to fail the kindness of all parties."

### Another Assassination Case Yesterday, Wu Qilun Shot Dead, Wu, a Lawyer, Frequently Visited Entertainment Venues, Suddenly Assassinated at Home Yesterday Morning by Violent Attackers

At 11:10 AM yesterday noon, an assassination case suddenly occurred at No. 3 Qinyi Lane, Tongfu Road, Public Concession. The victim was Wu Qilun, a lawyer in this city, who was shot three times on the spot, injuring vital parts, and died immediately. The murderer escaped without a trace. The details are recorded below:

Unexpected Guests Arrive at the Office

Wu Qilun is from Guanyun, Jiangsu, 42 years old this year, also known as Shuyi, and is a lawyer. He has an office at No. 3, Alley 102, Tongfu Road. The upstairs is his residence. The house has two buildings and two lower levels. In addition to renting out the remaining houses, he lives in the rest himself. At about 11:00 AM yesterday noon, Wu was working in the office in the east wing. At that time, an unexpected guest arrived and knocked on the door. The maid opened the door and invited the guest in, who went straight to Wu's office.

Three Shots Fired, All Hitting Vital Parts

Upon seeing Wu Qilun inside, without asking anything, the guest took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired three shots at Wu. One bullet hit his waist, one hit his head, and one hit his right arm. The sound of the shots was like a string of pearls. Wu fell to the ground in response, blood gushing out. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately rushed out of the door and fled.

Died in Hospital Due to Excessive Blood Loss

Before the tragedy occurred, Wu's niece, Zhaohua, happened to be in the office and was just entering the back room when she suddenly heard gunshots. Looking back, she saw that Wu had been injured and was lying in a pool of blood, and the murderer had already left. Shocked, she shouted for help. Family members and neighbors gathered upon hearing the sound, and the Chengdu Road Police Station was immediately notified, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. An ambulance was summoned and Wu was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he was too severely injured and lost too much blood. He died shortly after, and his body was transferred to the coroner's office and reported to the court to send personnel to investigate.

General Speculation on the Inside Story of the Case

Regarding Wu's assassination, it is generally speculated that it was of a political nature, but the truth is difficult to ascertain at this time. Wu's first wife was the younger sister of Pu Yi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, named Jing Huifang. Later, they divorced for some reason, and Jing changed her name to Wang in Shanghai and became a female guide. Wu frequently visited singing and dancing halls.

### Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Again, Rice Prices Expected to Decline, Over 79,000 Bags Have Arrived

The source of foreign rice is abundant, so there is hope that rice prices in this city will decline. Over the past two days, over 79,000 bags have arrived. The Hualun Foreign Company's Dapu steamer brought 16,627 bags of No. 1 foreign rice and 12,654 bags of No. 2 foreign rice directly from Saigon, totaling 26,281 bags. It is reported that No. 2 foreign rice is subsidized rice, which arrived in Shanghai at about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (3rd) and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning.

More Large Amounts of贡米 Arriving Continuously

The Yisheng steamer of the Jardine Matheson Foreign Company imported 5,335 bags from Haiphong and 2,518 bags from Hong Kong yesterday morning, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession for unloading. The Wil Ford (Meifu) of the Danish firm捷成 Foreign Company also imported over 30,000 bags from Saigon at 11:40 AM yesterday noon, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that the irregular ship of the United States Post Steamship Company also loaded over 35,000 bags from Saigon, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to bad weather, it had not been imported as of 6:30 PM. It is expected to arrive this morning and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. A large amount of foreign rice is on its way.

New Pharmaceutical Industry Plans to Aid the Poor

The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in view of the recent soaring prices of all goods, especially food and fuel, which has made it increasingly difficult for the poor to make a living, specially convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members to discuss remedial measures. As a result, it was decided to jointly form a temporary assistance committee for the poor with the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, raise funds to assist, and publicly recommend Xu Guanqun to draft an organizational outline, and actively raise donations separately.

### Coal Reserves Replenished, 500,000 to 600,000 Tons in Storage, Purchase Prices Trending Lower, Approximately 100,000 Tons of Anthracite Coal Blocks Also Sold, Warnings Issued Against Raising Prices and Selling Coal Balls

The entire fuel problem in Shanghai has been caused by the control of spot goods, resulting in soaring anthracite coal prices. However, the source of coal blocks has not been interrupted. According to inquiries from the Jianghai Customs, a total of 201,852 tons of coal blocks were imported in January of this year, valued at 1,273,420 gold, equivalent to 3,446,396 national currency, with the largest amount coming from Japan, accounting for 50,917 tons, valued at 169,052 gold, followed by Annam, accounting for 42,546 tons, valued at 270,882 gold. Only 70 tons were sent to foreign countries, valued at 43 gold. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel needed daily by Shanghai citizens, whether it is anthracite coal blocks or coal dust and charcoal. The market price is gradually trending downward, and citizens' concerns can be eliminated.

Coal Block Transactions

Regarding the reserves of coal blocks in Shanghai, according to sources, they are indeed very substantial, with approximately 500,000 to 600,000 tons stockpiled in various warehouses in Pudong, and their purchase prices have slightly decreased. They have been continuously arriving in Shanghai in recent days. According to news from the coal industry in this city yesterday, approximately 100,000 tons of anthracite coal blocks from India and Annam have been contracted for delivery by telegram. It is reported that they will be shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned producing areas in the middle of this month for adjustment. It is hoped that all coal companies and firms will not hoard spot goods in coal warehouses, so that speculators will not be able to use their skills.

Door-to-Door Sales Situation

The door-to-door sales price of coal balls has been limited to no more than 5.80 yuan per hundred catties, with an additional two jiao for delivery. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and related organizations and companies have announced that all coal and charcoal shops in the city must comply. The Zhongxiangtai Coal Shop on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession sold two loads of coal balls and charged 6.20 yuan per load, violating the publicly set price. It has now been reported, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, considering that this is the first time the incident has occurred, has transferred a letter to the shop, giving it a stern warning and strictly correcting it. The subsidized sale of coal balls was on its third day yesterday, and the situation in each location was the same as the previous day. However, the weather was not good, and it rained lightly all day, causing the civilians who bought coal balls to get wet all over. However, the order was still well-maintained. The 27th subsidized sales location of the Xiexing Coal Shop at No. 270恺自 Road in the French Concession handled it for the first time yesterday, and it was also very crowded. According to the Coal Ball Association yesterday, it will continue to handle the subsidized sale of coal balls as much as possible. It also said that the Xiexing Coal Shop has no intention of refusing to sell coal balls.

Information on the Cooked Water Industry

The Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association, in order to discuss the entire fuel problem of the industry, has scheduled a temporary general meeting of all members for 9:00 AM today at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. The meeting order and the presidium have been determined internally. The agenda items are: (1) How to resolve the coal shortage problem for the industry. (2) Compliance with the water price stipulated in the association's articles of association to ensure uniformity. (3) The association's collection of membership fees will be based on the official receipt issued by the personnel designated by the association. (4) How to raise funds to address the association's financial difficulties. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Kui Yanfang, He Dekui, and other gentlemen have been invited by the industry, and it is reported that they will attend and provide guidance, and a letter has been sent to the police authorities requesting them to send police to protect the meeting to avoid accidents.

### Snatching People in Hongkou, Fish Prices Soar, Fishmongers Dare Not Go to the Fish Market, All Switch to Buying from the 16th Wharf

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury says that after the Japanese authorities repeatedly forcibly grabbed Chinese residents in Hongkou, fishmongers south of the Suzhou Creek today (4th) expressed their extreme reluctance to go to the Japanese fish market in Yangshupu to buy fish, for fear of being arrested even if they have proper permits. Although a few fishmongers still go to the fish market, most have switched to buying goods from the fish market at the 16th Wharf, causing fish prices in this city to soar. It is now reported that the Chinese who were arrested by the Japanese authorities since February 14 were not taken to Taiwan, but were escorted to the蕴藻浜 area to build a car road. The Japanese authorities' new declaration yesterday criticized the newspaper's report that the Japanese were rounding up Chinese in Hongkou, and Randolph denied "the unfounded rumors promoted by Chongqing." However, according to reliable sources, many Chinese have been snatched in Hongkou in the past two weeks.

### Jewish Immigrants, Relocation Dispute, Most People Unwilling, Now Postponed for One Week

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that about 130 European Jewish immigrants in the Ward Road shelter refused to comply with the order to move into the Pingliang Road shelter last Saturday and Sunday, causing a minor commotion, resulting in one person being slightly injured and treated.

The events were as follows: The Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee notified the refugees in the Ward Road shelter aged 30 to 55 a few days ago that they should move into the Pingliang Road shelter, so as to leave space for younger refugees. About an hour after lunch last Saturday and Sunday, a committee member asked the immigrants to pack their bags, but most of the immigrants said they were unwilling to leave, resulting in a dispute and commotion, resulting in an injury to a committee member. It is also rumored that this disturbance was caused by about 100 immigrants who were eating in the shelter opposing the increase in meal fees from 10 yuan to 22 yuan. However, the dispute quickly ended, and the shelter staff expected that the shelter would continue to be in an uproar yesterday. It is reported that the police department has been asked to assist in suppressing the situation in the event of a disturbance, but the committee has decided to postpone the relocation order for one week, so there has been no further disturbance.

### Customs Tax Police and Others Expected to Receive Pay Raise

Over a thousand tax police and other unranked employees in all departments of the Jianghai Customs, because of the rapid increase in living expenses, sent representatives to see the tax commissioner on the 18th of last month, requesting that the order limiting the amount of rice subsidies be withdrawn and that a temporary living allowance be added. The authorities expressed great sympathy, knowing that it is currently difficult to maintain a living, and the authorities have forwarded the request to the General Tax Office for approval. In addition to requesting that the order be withdrawn, it is also recommended that a temporary living allowance of 40% be added so that they can work with peace of mind and maintain the status quo. It is now reported that the request is likely to be approved and will be approved before the end of this month before the salaries are paid.

### Disaster Situation Still Severe in North China, All Parties Continue to Raise Funds for Relief

American Advisory Committee Continues to Allocate 200,000 Yuan for Relief. Last year's floods in North China affected the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Puyang, with tens of millions of victims, a disaster unprecedented in history. International charities in Shanghai have raised funds for relief. According to the investigation by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, relief work cannot stop for a day before this year's autumn harvest. Especially at this time, it is more important to loan money to farmers for spring plowing. After the disaster, if spring plowing is abandoned again, it will be even more difficult to continue in the future. The American China Disaster Advisory Committee in this city has specially allocated 200,000 yuan for relief the other day and entrusted the Beijing church organizations to handle the relief, focusing on assisting spring plowing. In addition, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and others are reported to be continuing to raise funds for relief.

### Purchasing Power Declines, Market Situation Sluggish, Citizens All Embrace the View of Saving What Can Be Saved, The Only Way to Save It Is to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

Companies and firms in all industries made profits last year because prices rose step by step. The more inventory they had, the thicker the profits they estimated. After entering the spring of this year, the price涨风 trend became even more intense, so most citizens could not bear it and lost their purchasing power. According to the investigation by the reporter, after the lunar new year settlement, the business volume of wholesale and retail stores in the industries of cloth, silk, leather, clothing, and department stores is not what it used to be. The vast majority of citizens are threatened by high prices and have embraced the attitude of saving what can be saved, resulting in the accumulation of goods and a gradual decline in sales. This is a clear example of the gradual impact of the loss of public purchasing power on various industries. In addition, although hotels, restaurants, and theaters have maintained prosperity in consumption due to the large population, according to those who are familiar with the inside story, the cost of a meal is often dozens of gold, and even a simple drink is quite expensive. Therefore, the situation is not what it used to be. Those who care about prices and the market all hope that the abnormal prices can be adjusted quickly, and at the same time, increase the treatment of employees as much as possible to cultivate their purchasing power. The direct beneficiaries are still the industries themselves. If this is not done, the higher the prices and the more purchasing power decreases, the consumers, sellers, and producers will perish together.

### Xueyuan Manager Yuan Zhizhuang Was Kidnapped Yesterday. Three Bandits Entered Xueyuan and Abducted Yuan. The Reason for Yuan's Kidnapping, Despite Not Being Wealthy, Is Unknown.

Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, a kidnapping case occurred on Jing'an Temple Road. The kidnapped person was the manager of the well-known Xueyuan Restaurant. The details are recorded below:

The History of Xueyuan

The Xueyuan Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road was founded by the famous amateur opera singer Yao Shaohua. It has been in business for many years. All of the restaurant's food is based on the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang style. It was originally located in the lane next to the China United Assurance Society. Although the scale was not very large, the business was extremely prosperous due to its meticulous production and capable chefs. Moreover, most of the customers were upper-class people.

Capable Manager

Last summer, the restaurant expanded its premises and moved from China United to the new building at No. 1225 Jing'an Temple Road, next to the Cangzhou Hotel. The position of manager has always been held by Yuan Zhizhuang (51 years old), a local. Mr. Yuan is skilled in social interaction and handles matters capably. Xueyuan's success today is entirely due to Mr. Yuan's efforts.

Three Bandits

Mr. Yuan lives at No. 2, Lane 169, Luban Road in the French Concession. He has accumulated some savings through diligence and thrift, but he has been coveted by bandits. At around 8:20 PM last night, three bandits dressed in Zhongshan suits, each wielding a handgun, burst into the manager's office of Xueyuan. Mr. Yuan was inside settling accounts at the time. When the three bandits saw Mr. Yuan inside, they immediately stepped forward and threatened him with their guns.

Abducted and Driven Away

At the time, Mr. Yuan knew that things were not good, but seeing that the bandits were armed with guns, he had no way to resist and had to let the bandits abduct him. He was dragged out and driven away in a car brought by the bandits. Although there were many people in the restaurant at the time, they dared not rashly call the police for Mr. Yuan's safety. Afterward, they urgently reported to the police.

Police Investigation

The police immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found one of Mr. Yuan's shoes on the road near Hardoon Garden, which was taken to the police station for investigation. At the same time, a large number of police cars were dispatched to patrol the area, but to no avail. The police are currently investigating the reason for Mr. Yuan's abduction. However, according to general predictions, everyone believes that Mr. Yuan is not very wealthy and is not qualified to be kidnapped. If we observe the clothing of the three bandits, there may be other reasons, which is unknown.

Yang Yueqing, from Longhua, is currently the manager of the Gongxing gambling den in Xinzhuang Town, Huxi, and also serves as the deputy head of the town's "Self-Defense Corps." The day before yesterday afternoon, Yang went to a gambling den in Qibao Town to gamble. Suddenly, several strong men entered and surrounded Yang, each with sticks, and beat him violently.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Regarding the news about fines for violating weights and measures published in the Local News section of your newspaper on March 2nd, the oil jugs in our store are purchased from a manufacturer specializing in weights and measures and have a stamping mark verifying their standards. When using them, we measure the net amount of oil to be 14 city taels and set the price accordingly. On January 28th, the French Municipal Police checked and determined that the volume was insufficient, violating the weights and measures regulations. At that time, we explained that the selling price that day was 84 cents per jug. If calculated according to the market price per catty, it should be sold for 1 yuan and 13 cents, a difference of more than 20 cents from our selling price. This is because our oil prices are calculated based on cost. Oil is a sacrificial product among the goods we sell, so the price is low and has been praised by all. We have been envied by our competitors as a result. However, we only focus on setting prices based on the actual quantity and are truly unaware of violating weights and measures regulations. The report in your newspaper stated that the oil scoops were filled with lead at the bottom for illegal profit, which does not match the facts of the case. Because this concerns our reputation, we are sending this letter to correct the record. We hope that you will publish it accordingly.

Sincerely,

Fuxing Sauce and Wine Shop

March 3rd

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Positions Are Doubly Abundant. A Selling Wind Enveloped the Market All Day. The Spot Market Was Loose, and the Forward Market Was Even More So.

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listing remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange, the situation throughout the day was loose. The spot market was particularly weak, and the further out the date, the weaker it was. As for the occurrence of the selling wind, the reasons were said to be: (1) the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other four countries gathered in Chongqing; (2) it was reported that the US President had approved a new loan of US$20 million to China. However, Sassoon once ate Weiqi Wang and aggressively absorbed US$300,000. Although it stabilized slightly, it ultimately closed at a lower price due to the emergence of speculative longs, especially in the afternoon. The opening price in the morning was average, around 4 shillings 1.125 and 6 yuan 75. Initially, there were some settlements from foreign firms, but they had no impact. Later, a certain Chinese firm on behalf of Hong Kong unexpectedly released spot US dollars, followed by favorable Dutch and other releases of US dollars for this month. Moreover, Chinese firms and a few speculators also sold, so the underlying trend was stable with a hint of firmness. The spot market was particularly weak, rising sharply by 0.03125 and 0.0625. However, Sassoon suddenly took the opportunity to aggressively absorb, in a large amount, so the downward trend stabilized slightly. After this, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and trading suddenly became quiet. Until the close, there was not much change. In the afternoon, the market initially reported a flat trend, but soon speculators came to sell again, and the outside firms were still full of selling intention, so the market dropped again. Extending to the close, it rose to 4 shillings 1.15625 and 6 yuan 8125, resulting in a jump of 0.03125 and 0.0625. The underlying trend for spot and forward British and American exchange both showed a convergence.

Sassoon Settled US$300,000

Initially, the London big strip and the prices of London spot gold and silver were all reported as unchanged. The exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French exchange, as well as US against British, Shanghai, and French exchange, were all stable.

The opening selling prices of spot exchange by the banks in the morning were British gold at 4 shillings 1.125 and US exchange at 6 yuan 75, which were unchanged compared to the end of last week.

After the opening, there were small settlements from foreign firms, but the supply from outside firms was still good, so there was no impact. It is estimated that foreign firms settled spot US exchange at 6 yuan 75 with a certain bank. At the same time, HSBC stuffed a certain bank with spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125. The HSBC listing was announced as unchanged, and the white silver equalization tax was also announced as unchanged. After this, a certain Chinese bank suddenly released spot US exchange at 6 yuan 78125 to Chase Bank and Hwa Bih on behalf of Hong Kong, so the process was stable with a slight firmness. During this period, the forward market also rose slightly. This month's forward was available for purchase at 4 shillings 0.078125 and 6 yuan 65625, and next month's forward was available at 4 shillings 0.015625 and 6 yuan 53125. Later, the favorable Dutch and other outside firms released more US dollars for this month, and Chinese firms and speculators also released them, so the positions were doubly abundant, causing the spot market to continue to weaken. However, the Western firm Sassoon suddenly took the opportunity to aggressively grab, absorbing a total of about 300,000 yuan in US dollars for this month's forward, at an average price of 6 yuan 6875, and settling a small amount of British gold for this month at a price of 4 shillings 0.09375. At that time, next month's forward also rose to 4 shillings 0.03125 and 6 yuan 5625 available. After 10:00 AM, both buyers and sellers suddenly watched from the sidelines, so the transaction suddenly turned quiet, and the market became stagnant. Until the close, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125, US exchange was 6 yuan 75, British gold for this month was 4 shillings 0.09375, US exchange was 6 yuan 6875, British gold for next month was 4 shillings 0.03125, and US exchange was 6 yuan 5625. Compared to the opening in the morning, the spot market was unchanged, and the spot market rose slightly by 0.03125 and 0.0625.

British and American Spot and Futures Converged

The state of the aftermarket initially remained calm, but spot continued to be slightly softer. Afterward, due to the continued efforts of Chinese merchants who had been long for spot, plus outside firms with favorable positions still willing to sell, the spot was soft up to 4 shillings 1.140625 and 6 yuan 78125 available around 3 p.m. Later, Chinese merchants continued to provide foreign firms with spot for the month at 6 yuan 71875 and 75, while foreign firms did US exchange between them for April at 6 yuan 6875, and money changers sold US dollar bills to Hwa Bih at 6 yuan 875.

Educational News

### Current Status of Implementation of Compulsory Education in Zhejiang Province (II)

Regulations have been established and promulgated regarding the custody and withdrawal procedures for compulsory education funds, with particular attention paid to the storage of dedicated funds to ensure their independence. Surplus annual funds must be included in the next year's budget and are not allowed to be used for other purposes. However, some county governments still use the name of unified collection and expenditure to actually donate and appropriate funds. Therefore, there are two points regarding this issue that are worthy of discussion: (1) Should a special accounting system be implemented for education funds? (2) How should we prevent and correct the abuse of arbitrary misappropriation? If these two issues can be thoroughly resolved, the independence of compulsory education funds will be guaranteed in fact.

(III) Teacher Training Not only is there a perceived "quantitative deficiency" in compulsory education teachers in the province, but also a "qualitative" one. It is imperative to provide appropriate training to incumbent short-term primary school teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills. In the 25th year (of the Republic), measures for training short-term primary school teachers in various counties and cities were formulated and promulgated. Twenty-six counties and cities, including Hangzhou, complied with these measures, with a total of 1,001 people receiving training (excluding the number of people in five counties that were not reported). The subjects were freely determined by the counties and cities based on their needs and submitted to the Provincial Department for approval. The training period ranged from a minimum of two weeks to a maximum of one month. The Provincial Department, fearing that counties with financial and human resource difficulties would be unable to hold training, also specially formulated measures for joint provincial and county short-term primary school teacher training to remedy this. Five locations were established that year, with trainees nominated by designated counties, totaling 705 people. The duration was three weeks, with subjects divided into eleven types, including spiritual lectures, an overview of compulsory education, teaching methods for short-term primary school Chinese language, teaching methods for short-term primary school arithmetic, implementation methods for short-term primary school civic training, teaching methods for short-term primary school inter-class exercises, small administrative affairs, child psychology, promotion of education, and the province's policy guidelines. Each also included a short-term primary school class for trainees to observe and practice. The effect was quite significant.

(IV) Experimentation and Supervision Short-term compulsory education is a newly created undertaking, and there are naturally many matters requiring experimentation in teaching, management, and administration. Since the second semester of the 24th year (of the Republic), the province has designated six primary schools affiliated with provincial schools to undertake this experimental research work. The implementation items include the experimentation and revision of the provisional curriculum standards and textbooks for short-term primary schools, the experimentation of the two-part system in ordinary primary schools, the experimentation of cost-effective teaching aids and other equipment, the problems of short-term primary school enrollment and retention, the concurrent implementation of one or two practical and effective social improvement activities, and the experimentation of various teaching methods, totaling more than ten items. Detailed reports were submitted to the Provincial Department one after another, and after review, they were introduced to various counties for reference in order to improve. Supervision occupies a very important position in educational administration, but it must have fixed personnel to be effective. In particular, the promotion of compulsory education requires universality, and the establishment of short-term primary school classes is very scattered. The original supervisory personnel of the Provincial Department were few in number and burdened with many tasks, making it difficult to take care of them. Therefore, from the 25th year (of the Republic), two compulsory education supervisors were specially appointed in order to improve the effectiveness of compulsory education implementation.

### This Year's Work Plan for the Central Museum

(4) Investigation of folk art in Guizhou. (5) Excavation of Dali. (6) Start the investigation of ancient sites in Sichuan.

### Appointed as Commissioner in Hong Kong to Supervise Chinese Education in Hong Kong

### A Study of Macau

Maritime trade between the South Seas and China began in the Han Dynasty, and the establishment of a customs office in Guangzhou dates back to the Tang Dynasty. These facts are clearly documented in historical records. As for the arrival of European nations, Portugal was the first. The Portuguese settlement in Macau began during the Ming Dynasty. According to Xu Song's "Brief Overview of the World," European countries had little contact with other lands after the Age of Exploration. The Portuguese were skilled in arithmetic, astronomy, and used instruments to measure sunrise and sunset, as well as the degrees of celestial bodies. They knew the directions and distances of land and sea. In the early Ming Dynasty, their king sent skilled sailors to navigate large ships southward, traveling west along the coast of Africa, then east, passing the eastern coast of Africa, reaching the western coast of India, and continuing east. Wherever they went, they established ports. During the Longqing era, they arrived at Macau in Xiangshan County, Guangdong, and requested land to build houses, paying an annual rent of five taels of silver. Lin Fu, a border official, petitioned on their behalf, and permission was granted. The Portuguese then established a port in Macau, marking the beginning of trade between European nations and Guangdong. According to Ling Yaoxhou's "Shao Bian," during the Zhengde era, foreigners began to privately build houses in the bays of Macau for trade. They were later moved to Gaozhou Dianbai County. In the 14th year of the Jiajing era, Commander Huang Qing bribed his superiors and had them moved back to Macau outside the Tiger Leap Gate in southern Xiangshan County. They paid an annual tax of 20,000 francs and were allowed to build houses and cities, standing closely together, dominating the coast like a sovereign state. Over time, more and more people came, and other countries feared and avoided them, leaving Macau exclusively to the Portuguese. During the Wanli era, they destroyed Luzon, monopolized maritime profits from Fujian and Guangdong, and their power grew. In the 34th year, they built a temple six or seven zhang tall on Qingzhou Island across the water. Magistrate Zhang Dayong requested to destroy its high walls, but it was not done. The following year, scholar Lu Tinglong, who was preparing for the imperial examination in the capital, requested that all foreigners be expelled to the outer seas, returning Macau to China, but the authorities did not act on it.

### The True Meaning of Freedom

— Huang Jiayin

The current society operates under a system of free trade. Freedom is a right that all humans should enjoy, and free trade can lead to progress through competition, which is originally a good thing. However, this current free trade system has led us into a dangerous situation of skyrocketing prices and impoverishment.

Freedom is good, but one person's freedom should not infringe on the freedom of others. This is the true meaning of freedom, so that everyone can enjoy true freedom.

The problem with the current society lies here. We have implemented a system of free trade, but we have not placed sufficient restrictions on this freedom. As a result, there is freedom to make money, freedom to speculate, freedom to hoard, freedom to manipulate, freedom to deceive, freedom to oppress, and freedom to exploit. As a result of this freedom, it has all ended up in the hands of a few, while the majority only receives the pitiful "freedom to starve."

If we want to put the current society on a rational path, we must first place sufficient restrictions on the freedom of trade, especially on the trade of goods that are directly related to the livelihood of the people, which should be strictly restricted and regulated. In this critical moment of poverty and exhaustion, if we do not implement restrictions on trade and plans to regulate essential goods, then our society will one day head down a path of chaos and destruction.

We can no longer let things take their natural course.

### Stardust

— Xiongsheng

The dust we see every day is nothing more than fine sand and soil, and most of it contains organic matter, which is different from what we see on the decks of ocean-going ships or on the snowfields of the North and South Poles. Because the oceans and the North and South Poles are places where ordinary land sand is not easily blown to, scientists have given this kind of dust a name called stardust. This stardust is magnetic and metallic. If analyzed by scientific methods, its molecules contain iron, manganese, magnesium, nickel, sulfur, lead, and other compounds. Because its mass is heavier than ordinary sand, when it falls on the surface of the ocean, it gradually sinks to the bottom and accumulates into rocks.

According to the research of astronomers, there are countless comets with extremely small volumes in the sky, which travel around the sun according to their fixed orbits. The length of the orbital radius varies, and the shape of the orbit is often elliptical, so it often intersects with the orbit of the Earth. On certain dates every year, when the Earth rotates to the intersection point, these comets also travel to the intersection point at this time, and then the two attract each other. However, the attraction of these comets is much weaker than the attraction of the Earth, so the attraction of the Earth will not be affected in any way, and the comets will be attracted by the Earth's attraction, and then break out of orbit and be sucked into the Earth's atmosphere. The speed of its flight to the ground is between ten and forty miles per second, and at this time, the comets and the air generate a great frictional force, generating heat and emitting light. This is what we usually see as meteors and shooting stars. These comets completely burn and decompose into fragments or powdery dust at a distance of about fifty to seventy miles from the ground. The larger ones become meteorites, and the smaller ones are as thin as needle tips, floating in the high air and gradually falling to the ground to become stardust. According to the research of astronomer Bolton, the weight of the earth increases by about 200 tons every day due to meteorites, and there are about 40 million particles of comet powder suspended in the sky every day.

Because the outer layer of the atmosphere often contains a large amount of solid stardust, when it is dusk, this stardust is subjected to changes in the temperature of the air, so it is attached with a large amount of water vapor, and the oblique sunlight is reflected by this vapor and reflected on the ground, becoming a brilliant glow. The evening glow is particularly obvious in October and November every year, because the amount of stardust is stronger than at other times, and the aurora of the North and South Poles is nothing more than the effect of stardust.

Education

### Seeking Knowledge

— Xiao Cen

Do not forget your self-study. Schools, books, and teachers are only there to help you; true knowledge must be sought by each individual.

You can gain knowledge from your own observations, experiences, reading, and conversations with others.

When you see a novel table of contents in a book, you should first have a reading goal in mind.

Concentrating your attention on several books with the same content in a period of time is easier, more convenient, and saves you time and energy than reading the same number of books with different content.

Pay attention to other people's conversations, you can get a lot of practical knowledge.

If you have knowledge that you cannot understand, or work that you cannot complete, do not be ashamed to ask others.

Indeed, those who can study on their own achieve much more in their reading than those who are forced to read, because they understand the reasons for reading and have definite aims and desires.

### Secret Laughter

— Ouli

Since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, it has produced many jokes. The following are some of the representative works:

(1) Jew and Tiger

One day, a tiger escaped from the Berlin Zoo and caused great terror in the countryside. The government issued a special notice, offering a reward for capturing the tiger, dead or alive.

Two Jews saw the notice. One of them suddenly turned pale and whispered to the other in a panic, "Let's run away quickly, lest we be shot dead."

The other man was a little puzzled and said, "Why? We're not tigers."

"I know," the other Jew said thoughtfully, "but what proof do we have?"

(2) Do Not Talk About Politics

One night, an old man was robbed and beaten on the streets of Berlin, so he shouted, "Help! Murder!" At this time, a policeman walked up to him and told the old man to stop making noise, saying, "Don't talk about politics so loudly!"

(3) Waiting for What?

One day, a man was waiting for a public bus on the streets of Berlin. A secret policeman ran up to him and asked, "What are you waiting for?"

The man replied, "I'm waiting for National Socialism to come to Germany."

(4) Eavesdropping

One day, Hitler and Goering were talking about state secrets in a car. When the car stopped at a red light at an intersection, a car followed behind and stopped next to it, with two people sitting in the car. At that time, one of them happened to yawn.

Goering saw it and immediately ordered the guards, "Arrest those two people, because they are eavesdropping on our conversation."

Random Thoughts

### Where Articles Come From

— Kan Xiwen

Since Shanghai was occupied, the cultural and publishing industries have encountered an unprecedented low ebb, and for a time almost fell into a state of stagnation; this is certainly a pity, but for the sake of the country and the people, it is extremely appropriate to suffer such minor sacrifices. Moreover, with Shanghai's cultural resources, it is scattered in the culturally backward interior, and from the perspective of the entire country, it cannot be said to be a loss. What's more, the future of Shanghai culture is still unlimited. Therefore, we should not be discouraged by encountering such an unprecedented low ebb, but should continue to work hard.

But since the last two or three months, the publishing industry in Shanghai has suddenly seen a resurgence. Whether this phenomenon is good or bad, I will not try to guess at it; just from what I have seen at the newspaper stalls on the side of the road, there are so many kinds of publications, of all kinds, that it is too much to count, and even at this time when paper prices and printing materials are strangely expensive, they are all printed very beautifully and carefully, which is really admirable for their determination to serve the culture at the expense of everything.

There are so many publications, they can't not print black words on them, so the demand for manuscripts is also greater than the supply, and the "writers" who often like to move their pens also have more opportunities; but I don't know if this is a good opportunity?

In many publications, just flipping through the table of contents, I sometimes find people I am familiar with. I firmly believe that they are innocent and naive, and only write words for the impulse of expressing themselves; but I can't suppress my surprise. If I were the editor of a magazine, then after this I would have to add another consideration besides the words to the manuscripts they submit.

I think writing articles is certainly a very interesting thing, but writing does not necessarily mean that it must be published (although I wrote this article, it must be published), and publishing does not do any good to a writer. A rigorous writer can write articles for ten years without being willing to publish them, but once they are published, they will be a hit, and their literary name will immediately spread like wildfire. But this method is certainly not something that ordinary people can do, and we cannot use the ways of saints and sages to govern the masses; if there is no other way, then we should also consider the place of publication. This is what the ancient scholars and gentlemen called "Chu Chu", and if "Chu Chu" is not correct, then it is a blemish for life, and we should also write articles in this way, especially in this difficult era.

### A Brief History of Humanity

### Eloquence

— Zhao Bing

Talent is the wealth of the poor.

Those who have not experienced suffering will not get true happiness.

Accepting advice is to increase one's ability.

The golden age is in front of us, not behind us.

Pitying the unfortunate is only human nature; saving the suffering is the way of heaven.

Clinging to one's duties while remaining silent is the best response to slander.

### Practical Religion (3)

If God is the spirit of truth, then being religious is practicing truth in all our relationships; if God is beauty, then religion is the act of beauty; if God is love, then religion is the practice of kindness in all relationships of life. Religion must always be practical, and the great difficulty for most believers today is that they only focus on one side of religion, and it is the easiest side to practice. Some say that the Puritans of America knelt down to worship God on Sundays, but on weekdays they knelt on black people for fun. Whether this criticism is true or not, we can put it aside for the time being, but we do have many believers who sing hymns, recite scriptures, and worship God on Sundays, but forget everything by Monday. Therefore, everyone, our belief in God is related to the way we treat God's children, our brothers and sisters. The purpose of religion is not to make people arrogant, selfish, or cold, but to make people considerate, loving, sympathetic, and understanding. You may know all the doctrines and philosophies, you may burn candles to pray, sing hymns and recite scriptures, but if all this cannot lead you to do something for others, all you do is in vain. Those who are worthy of the name of Christians are not those who only love God and do nothing for God, but those who love God and treat others with the spirit of service and kindness. The German Marx has a saying, "Religion is the opium of the people." All truly knowledgeable people will never believe this. However, when you think about it, his words are not without reason, because many people come into contact with bad believers, and their lives become melancholy and crippled. Our beliefs and rituals must be closely linked to our daily lives. What we need today is not more Christians, but better Christians. Now is the time for us to practice religion.

### Recent Anecdotes from the Peking and Tianjin Opera Circles: A Large Sum Stolen and Solved Without Investigation; Impersonating Famous Performers Not Uncommon

— Junmei

I received a letter from a friend in Peking and Tianjin, informing me of two recent amusing incidents in the theatrical circles of Peking and Tianjin, which are now being discussed in teahouses and restaurants. However, the newspapers do not provide detailed accounts, as these amusing incidents are also quite strange.

Everyone in Peking knows of "Commander Jin Bihui," who works for a certain party and travels to Peking, Tianjin, and other places beyond the Shanhai Pass. This is none other than Kawashima Yoshiko, the daughter of Prince Su of the late Qing Dynasty, who is known to the world as an extraordinary woman. Recently, Jin celebrated her birthday at her residence in Peking, with numerous guests and friends attending. Many famous performers came to offer congratulations, including a certain martial arts actor. After the banquet ended, Jin suddenly discovered that a leather suitcase was missing, containing banknotes amounting to over 40,000 yuan. A thorough search proved fruitless. On that day, the martial arts actor left early, so Jin did not suspect him. During the New Year, Jin visited her friends and relatives to thank them for their birthday wishes. When she arrived at the martial arts actor's house, only the actor's grandmother was at home. Seeing Jin, she appeared quite flustered and quickly brought out a leather suitcase, saying, "My grandson behaved badly and mistakenly brought this suitcase here the other day." It was indeed the missing item. Jin took it home and inspected it, finding over 10,000 yuan missing. That evening, the martial arts actor was performing at a certain theater and was arrested. After some intercession, the matter was dropped. However, the inside story remains a secret, and those involved are tight-lipped, suggesting that there may be other reasons. The martial arts actor is handsome and upright. Some say there was a romantic relationship, otherwise, for a famous performer to commit theft and for the case to be solved without investigation, it is truly a secret within the opera world.

A certain amateur opera singer in Tianjin, with a voice and manner that closely resembled Li Shengzao, recently had a whimsical idea. Knowing that a certain famous courtesan was fond of befriending famous performers, he impersonated Li Shengzao, claiming to have just arrived in Tianjin from Peking and was about to perform at a certain theater. The courtesan was deceived and, believing that Li had taken a fancy to her, tried to win him over, spending her days and nights with him. Before long, a knowledgeable person exposed the truth, and the amateur singer quietly disappeared, leaving the courtesan full of regret. Furthermore, a certain opium den recently had a customer who claimed to be Yuan Shihai, having just returned from Shanghai by boat and was about to perform at the China Grand Theater in Tianjin. Because his fee had not been paid, he repeatedly visited the den and smoked opium without paying a penny. The den owner initially did not suspect anything. One day, a customer who knew Yuan Shihai heard him claiming to be Yuan Shihai and was greatly surprised. He questioned him, and the man arrogantly acknowledged it. After being angrily challenged, it was revealed that he was an impostor trying to get free opium. The opium den owner could do nothing about it. Impersonating famous performers is not uncommon; it is truly a strange thing.

### On Kunqu Opera

— Yan Chengxi

Opera began in the Yuan Dynasty. Strictly speaking, opera evolved from lyrics. Starting with Dong Jieyuan's (Jin Dynasty) "Romance of the Western Chamber" ballad, Wang Shifu (Yuan Dynasty) was inspired to write "The Romance of the Western Chamber," which can be considered the ancestor of opera. Later, because the Mongolian dialect was difficult for southerners to understand, Gao Ming (late Yuan Dynasty) wrote "The Tale of the Pipa," which became known as Southern Opera. The division of opera into Northern and Southern styles began from this point. After the Jiajing era, Northern Opera declined to its lowest point, and Southern Opera evolved into a long-form drama called Chuanqi (romance play). During the Jiajing and Longqing periods, Chuanqi became even more popular, and writers like Liang Chenyu and Tu Long became famous for a time.

During the Yuan Dynasty, the singing of Northern and Southern operas already incorporated stringed instruments and clappers to some extent, but it was not formal but rather chaotic. It was not until the Ming Dynasty that Wei Liangfu of Kunshan reformed the old practices, equipped various musical instruments, and broke away from the styles of Haiyan, Yuyao, and Yiyang, transforming it into a kind of opera with strict vocal rules, complete musical colors, and not limited to regional styles. Because it originated in Kunshan, it was called Kunqu Opera. After Kunqu Opera, Southern Opera seemed to have a new look, and its influence gradually increased.

After Wei Liangfu founded Kunqu Opera, many people studied under him for a time, but the one who truly inherited his mantle was Liang Chenyu, famous for his Chuanqi "Washing Silk." Fangyu Poetry Talk says: "What the world calls Kunshan Melody started with Liangfu, but Bolong alone obtained its true transmission." Liang, whose courtesy name was Bolong, was also from Kunshan and was a student at the Imperial Academy at the time. He was elegant and self-admiring, and was revered by lyricists. So much so that "every time there was a citrus exchange gathering, a dragon boat race, or a display of stringed instruments, singers, and dancers, if Bolong was not present, they would consider it inauspicious." He wrote the scattered songs "Jiangdong" and "Baimian," the Zaju dramas "Hongxiannü" and "Hongxiao," and the Chuanqi "Washing Silk." He was the first author of a Kunqu opera script.

Kunqiang (Kunshan melody) spread quickly soon after its creation and became popular everywhere. Northern Opera was already declining, and by the Daoguang era, it had completely disappeared. At that time, Wu Zhong also highly respected Kunlu (Kunshan style). Shen Defu's "Random Words on Appreciating Opera" says: "Since the people of Wu valued Southern Opera, they all followed Wei Liangfu of Kunshan, and Northern lyrics were almost abandoned." Other books also record this. Some believe that Kunqiang is rigorous and profound, and compared to the immature opera of the Middle Ages, it seems much more advanced. Is this probably the reason why Kunqu Opera has been able to last for four or five hundred years?

### Cheng Yanqiu Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Ma Lianliang and Xun Huisheng Will Also Come South in Batches

— Chen Lin

The old male role actor, Xi Xiaobo, came to Shanghai this time to perform at the Golden Theater, and his performance was quite good. Due to contractual reasons, he will stop performing around the 20th of this month. After his performance, the Golden Theater authorities have already scheduled three batches of performers.

The first batch of performers is the Qiusheng Society led by Cheng Yanqiu. Since Yanqiu returned north with great acclaim in the winter of the 27th year, he has not come south. This time, he has accepted the invitation of the Golden Theater to make a comeback. Upon hearing the news, the general Cheng fans are all overjoyed. Yanqiu has now led the entire troupe to Jinan to perform, and after the performance, they will go to Qingdao, and then depart from Qingdao to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive around the end of this month. The old male actor that Yanqiu brought to Jinan for the performance is Chen Shaolin, but when performing at the Golden Theater in the future, he will still collaborate with his old partner Wang Shaolou. The other supporting roles are generally the same as the last time they came to Shanghai. The young male roles are Jiang Miaoxiang and Gu Yusun, the clowns are Cao Ergeng, Li Siguang, and Ci Shaoquan, the old male roles are Zhang Chunyan, the old female roles are Sun Futing, and the green female roles are Wu Fuqin. The only slight difference is that the painted face role of the Qiusheng Society, since Hou Xirui left, has been replaced by Liu Lianrong. Lianrong will come south with the Qiusheng Society this time. Yanqiu's masterpieces such as "The Story of Hongfu," "The Engagement of Gong Yan," and "Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" will surely be even more vivid. It is hoped that Mr. Cheng's newly written "The Swallow Letter" will also be seen by the people of Shanghai this time.

The second batch of performers is Ma Lianliang, who is most popular with the people of Shanghai. Lianliang has been arranging new plays and reforming costumes in Beijing, with great momentum. This time, he has decided to accept the invitation of the Golden Theater, and he will make many new contributions at that time. The newly compiled "Lintong Mountain" and the complete "Zhuangzi" will be performed in Shanghai in sequence. In "Lintong Mountain," Lianliang plays Qin Shubao, wearing an improved square-flag armor, which caused a sensation in the nine cities when it was performed in Beijing. The complete "Zhuangzi" starts from Zhuangzi's enlightenment and ends with the great splitting of the coffin. On the Golden Theater's side, Furong Cao will be paired with him to play Tian Shi. In addition to these two plays, Lianliang also has the "Five-Colored Sedan Chair," a secret book of the Fuliancheng Opera Troupe. He plans to perform several major plays in Shanghai continuously. The supporting roles that Lianliang has scheduled to come with him, in addition to his old partners Zhang Junqiu, Ye Shenglan, Ma Fulu, and Liu Lianrong, will also include Xiao Changhua and Yuan Shihai for the clown and painted face roles. The martial male role will be changed from Ma Junwu to Wu Yanheng. Lianliang has also ordered thousands of yuan worth of new costumes for performing new plays in Shanghai. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation.

The third batch of performers is Xun Huisheng. Huisheng has not come south to perform for eight years. Now, with the efforts of Mr. So-and-so and other friends of Huisheng in Shanghai, he has agreed to the theater's invitation to come south as soon as possible, but the date will be determined by Huisheng himself.

### Ma Lianliang's "Ten Volumes"

### Old Shu's Jesting Remarks: Examination Basket

— She Yu

Recently, there has been a debate about what kind of basket Wang Youdao should carry to the examination in the play "The Imperial Stele Pavilion." After the problem of boots and shoes in Xiao En's "Fishing and Killing Family," this is a material that dares to be discussed recently. The objects used in the play should be examined if necessary, as there is not much interest if they are all considered ordinary and passed over. The point of contention in today's examination basket problem is: one is to absolutely not use a net basket, and it is not allowed to use a net basket; it is believed that Wang Youdao should bring an examination basket with a larger capacity when entering the examination hall, which is more suitable for reason and sentiment. Moreover, most of the performers who follow the old rules use net baskets, even if there is no need to follow the ancient methods, those who must improve also believe that net baskets are more practical. It seems that net baskets are becoming more advantageous in the money array, and once the examination basket is broken, it cannot be returned to Wang Youdao's hands. Such liveliness is truly not inferior to the previous beauty of boots and shoes. I believe that those who use net baskets to bring to the examination hall can call this net-containing basket an examination net basket. I once remembered that a store selling baskets seemed to have the term examination net basket. If the examination basket is used for storing dishes, it may as well be called a food examination basket. In fact, it is already visible for use. The examination basket enters the kitchen as a container for food, so it is no longer necessary to think that bringing a net basket to the examination hall is an absolutely strange thing. I am using the examination net basket made in the play as an explanation for those who are arguing.

### Gu Eryi and His Wife Passed Away One After Another

— Zhi Ge

The film actor Gu Eryi was a basic actor of the Xinhua Company before the war. His acting skills were quite strong. After the August 13th Incident, he moved to the rear and worked hard in film and drama, declaring labor for the country, and his ambition is commendable. Recently, according to the bad news, it is said that he died of meningitis in January, and all who heard it expressed their condolences! Gu's wife, Ms. Du Xiaojuan, also died last winter due to illness from childbirth. This is the so-called "misfortune never comes singly," which is truly a double loss for the drama world!
