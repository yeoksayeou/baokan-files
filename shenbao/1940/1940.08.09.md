### British Somaliland: Garrison at Zeila Retreats Automatically; Italian Forces Attack Berbera in Three Routes; British Planes Attack Bardera Port in Libya

London: Responsible authorities here have recently confirmed that the garrison at Zeila in British Somaliland, under the command of Brigadier General Chater, has retreated automatically without resistance. This is because the defense forces there originally adopted a joint defense system with the French Somaliland garrison. Now that the French have ceased hostilities, the British forces in the port considered themselves too weak. After consideration, British military authorities decided to retreat to the line between Berbera and Bulhar, in order to extend the Italian forces' supply lines as much as possible and lure them into a quagmire. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

Cairo: A British Air Force communiqué stated that there was aerial activity on all fronts yesterday. British planes conducted multiple valuable reconnaissance missions. Ships and warehouses in the Libyan border port of Bardera were attacked by British aircraft, and a large building was destroyed.

Italian pilots stated that the newly installed British anti-aircraft guns were numerous. A Stefani correspondent reported that the Italian planes dropped several tons of bombs, hitting warehouses and port facilities. The large fire caused by incendiary bombs soared into the sky. Haifa was also heavily damaged in the previous two air raids. Many oil tanks of the Iraq Petroleum Company were set on fire. The destruction of the Haifa oil refinery is a heavy blow to the British military, as the British Air Force in the Eastern Mediterranean relies on the refinery for supplies. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)

British Forces from the Near East Head to Egypt

Athens: According to news received from Jerusalem here yesterday, a large number of British troops from the Near East, mostly motorized and mechanized units, boarded ships in Haifa yesterday to go to Egypt to reinforce the troops there. This is because some British troops have been transferred to Aden and Zeila. British authorities have been recruiting volunteers in Palestine, and thousands of Jews are expected to be enlisted. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)

Observations from The Times

London: The Times stated that Italy's forceful actions in North Africa were long anticipated. After long preparations, Italy chose an appropriate time to join the war. It is surprising that the war in Africa was delayed for so long. The Italian forces in East Africa are holding back on the Sudanese border, apparently because of the rainy season. The Italian forces did not immediately attack British Somaliland because they wanted to wait for the Vichy government to replace the governor-general of French East Africa. The original governor-general was ambitious. If he were still in office, the activities of the French forces in Djibouti would be a concern. The Times mentioned the threat to Egypt, saying it is expected that the British army will not rely on border defenses to resist the Italian advance. Given the small number and strong combat power of the British army and the local terrain, the British army seems to be actively utilizing the desert, relying on mobile warfare and raids to win, and not defending against the enemy at any designated location. The momentum of the Italian offensive there should not be underestimated, but the British commanders in the Middle East and Egypt have complete confidence in the test of strength. The preliminary victory gained by the Italian army will only bring trouble to itself, not blessings. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### Italian Naval, Land, and Air Force Casualty Report

### British Mail Ship "Anchorite" Sunk; Hit by Torpedo off the West Coast of Ireland

London: The British mail ship "Anchorite" (9,377 tons) has sunk off the west coast of Ireland. Over 450 survivors have landed at a port in northwest England, and 19 people are missing, including 11 passengers and 8 crew members. According to the Admiralty, there were no children on board. It has been determined that the ship was torpedoed on July 26th when an enemy submarine attacked the convoy and sank within half an hour. According to Captain Smith, passengers were having dinner when the torpedo exploded, and they boarded lifeboats in an orderly manner. Most of the fatalities were due to a motorboat capsizing and drowning or being killed by the torpedo explosion. Furthermore, a waiter on the ship had encountered torpedoes four times. It is reported that the ship shook from the torpedo hitting in the middle, but no submarine was seen. However, it is known that at least one submarine was sunk hours later. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### British-German Naval Battle off the Coast of Brazil; One German Ship Damaged

Rio de Janeiro: Yesterday evening, residents of the north coast of Rio de Janeiro heard the sound of heavy artillery in the sea, as a new clash was underway between the British armed merchant ship "Alcantara" and a German ship. Many believe that this German ship is the one that sank the British ships "King John" and "Twickenham." When these two ships first clashed on July 31st, this German ship was hit by shells from the British ship "Alcantara" and was forced to use heavy smoke to escape. Although the hull of the "Alcantara" was scarred by shells from the German ship, it quickly pursued until the German ship disappeared, and then stopped. This battle occurred just outside the neutral zone, which the American republics warned belligerents to avoid in the Pan-American Conference. The "Alcantara" docked at the Vienna shipyard here on August 2nd for repairs and will be able to go to sea in a few days. (International dispatch of the 8th)

Editorial

### The Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty

Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that the famous American political commentator Mr. Franklin commented on Pacific affairs, saying: "Japan wants to please Germany in form, but in fact, it retains its freedom of action." This is indeed a penetrating remark. Mr. Franklin also said that under the 1921 Four-Power Treaty, the United States has the right to protect the sovereignty of British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific. According to the current principles of international law and the national interests of the United States, the United States can exercise this right without declaring war. This also shows that his views are both calm and profound. At this time, when the British-German war is in a stalemate and the outcome is undecided, and the Pacific is turbulent and dangerous, just as French Vietnam is under severe pressure and it is reported that the French plan to concentrate their Far East fleet and mobilize the French-Vietnamese defense forces to resist foreign aggression, it is hoped that the American government and people can promptly promote the spirit of Christian engagement in the world, be alert to the illusion of self-interest, and for international justice and human civilization, that is, to create lasting peace in the Pacific and maintain long-term welfare for the United States, promote public opinion, promote justice, act promptly, and be proactive, so that the situation can be improved and the war can be shortened. This is inevitable.

It is not yet known to what extent the above-mentioned Mr. Franklin's remarks will arouse the attention of the American government and the public, but they will certainly be approved by most people in the world. Among them, the so-called rights of the United States under the Four-Power Treaty are particularly worthy of the attention of the American government and the public. We firmly believe that the American government and the public have not forgotten the Four-Power Treaty. As far back as 1932, Mr. Stimson advocated stopping aggression in the Far East, and as recently as the formal ultimatum to Japan at the end of 1938, all were based on the Nine-Power Treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty is a sister treaty to the Four-Power Treaty. Recently, the United States has been forced by the international situation to build an unparalleled navy and decided to fortify Guam. This is also closely related to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. With such stimulation, how can it be forgotten? Looking back nineteen years ago, after World War I, world leaders all took reducing armaments and guaranteeing peace as their mission. China, the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal held a nine-nation conference in Washington and resolved four key issues: (1) The naval ratio of the three countries was set at 5:5:3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan. At that time, there was a separate understanding between the United States and Japan; and today's increased naval construction and fortification of Guam by the United States are the consequences of Japan reneging on that understanding. (2) The Four-Power Treaty was signed by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, stipulating that the four countries should respect each other's Pacific possessions, and if attacked, they would jointly seek the most effective measures. Mr. Franklin's argument is based on this. (3) The Nine-Power Treaty was signed, agreeing to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity of China, and to maintain the open door and equal opportunity. (4) The Shandong issue between China and Japan was resolved. China recovered Qingdao from Japan and redeemed the Jiaoji Railway. After the agreement was reached, the world was pleased, and the situation was stable. This was in 1921 and 1922. At that time, the Soviet Union was in the middle of communist nation-building, and Germany was bound by post-war conditions. Neither actively participated in international affairs.

Looking back now, can one not feel a sense of deep emotion! Preventing trouble is better than dealing with it after it has happened, and stopping chaos is better than waiting for it to escalate. Missing the opportunity only increases regret. However, if the mistake has not yet been made, it is not too late to remedy it. The key is to catch up quickly. When a country makes a claim or takes action based on a treaty it has signed, it is both exercising a legitimate right and fulfilling a sacred obligation. Neither should be neglected. The United States has both an inescapable obligation and an inviolable right regarding the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. In reality, so far, the United States has only not denied its obligations and only not abandoned its rights. It has not actively pursued its obligations and rights. The so-called "non-recognition doctrine" is a product that falls in between. Using "non-recognition" to indicate the existence of a treaty and the existence of obligations and rights naturally has special significance and value from a certain international perspective. It is far superior to those who violate treaties and break faith. However, it is doubtful whether the "non-recognition doctrine" itself will have any practical effect. For example, regarding the Far East situation: Under aggression, the United States' non-recognition and China's sustained resistance complement each other under the Nine-Power Treaty. But suppose the United States tacitly accepted reality and China continued to resist, or the United States did not recognize reality and China stopped resisting? Comparing the two, one would doubt the practical effect of the non-recognition doctrine. Furthermore, under the Four-Power Treaty, if the Pacific possessions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands were actually invaded and fell, would the United States only apply the so-called non-recognition? Is this the so-called effective measure in the treaty? If China is overthrown, and the Pacific possessions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands fall, what would be the threat to the security of the United States? What would be the threat to the peace of the Pacific? Can this threat be effectively countered by non-recognition? Therefore, although the United States' non-recognition doctrine was painstakingly advocated and implemented by the wise authorities of the United States, bound by narrow isolationist fallacies, in terms of the actual interests of the United States and the Pacific, this non-recognition is still tantamount to isolation; and in terms of the rights and obligations of international treaties, this non-recognition still cannot resolve the matter. American national policy is strong and resolute, but it is often slow to act. Rescuing it halfway or afterwards, although not entirely too late, is more difficult and less effective. Preventing trouble and stopping chaos should be done today!

### Chinese Troops Concentrated on Vietnamese Border; Nishihara Flies from Tokyo to Hanoi; Japan Pays Attention to Freight Traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road

Hong Kong: According to a French person who recently flew here from Hanoi, the Japanese inspectors in Vietnam have submitted a memorandum to the Vietnamese Governor, the contents of which have not been disclosed, but it is heard that it has been sent to the Vichy government. At the same time, it is learned that China has concentrated troops on the Vietnamese border to be prepared. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)

Tokyo: Mr. Nishihara, the head of the Japanese observers sent to Vietnam, returned to Tokyo from Hanoi on July 30th. After submitting a report to the government, he returned to Hanoi by plane today. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Chongqing: The Chinese here are paying close attention to the Italian offensive in Somaliland and Egypt, believing that this may be a prelude to a joint offensive by the Axis powers against Britain. It is said that once the Italian offensive begins, Germany will attack Britain, and Japan will invade French Vietnam in the Far East in order to attack China and Singapore. People here also believe that during the recent visit of the Japanese delegation to Berlin and Rome, the military operations of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan against the British Empire have generally reached an understanding. Although Japan has denied this, Chinese people here say that they have received information indicating that Japan is now demanding the following two things: (1) establishing naval, land, and air force bases in Vietnam; (2) allowing troops to pass through Vietnam to fight against China, with Kunming as the objective. Chinese people here claim that once Japan establishes complete control over Vietnam, it will not be difficult for its troops to pass through, and it can even achieve the purpose of attacking Singapore from land, with Saigon as a base. The occupation of Singapore will give Japan complete control over the South Pacific, placing the Dutch East Indies and British and French Borneo under its control, and leaving Japanese troops only 350 miles from Australia. On the other hand, some people doubt whether Japan is willing to risk such a large-scale operation. They believe that Japan may temporarily be satisfied with occupying French Vietnam as a base for attacking Kunming, while adopting a wait-and-see policy towards the international situation. In short, the Chinese here all expect very important developments in the Far East and Europe in the near future. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Tokyo: When a Japanese Navy Ministry spokesman met with reporters today, he stated that although Britain had signed an agreement promising not to allow military supplies to reach Chongqing via Burma, Britain had not fulfilled its promise. A report from the Chongqing side of a British news agency stated that a document from the Chinese Ministry of Communications stated that medicine, chemicals, and military-related raw materials are still being sent here by the Yunnan-Burma Railway. Japan can only hope that the news agency's report is inaccurate. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that the movement of Annam troops towards the Guangxi-Vietnam border is sufficient to indicate that the French authorities are preparing to resist the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. He added that the Japanese military operations west of Longzhou have already failed, as the Chinese army has driven back all the Japanese troops. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry recently stated that Japanese authorities have received information that although Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road for three months, the transportation of military supplies on that road is still continuing. If this information is true, then it can be seen that Britain has not faithfully fulfilled its promise. The spokesman also cited news from Chongqing, saying that although other transportation has stopped, medicines and chemicals are still entering Yunnan from Burma. The spokesman believes that chemicals should be included in the list of military supplies. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Navy Ministry told reporters today that he had learned that the Burma Road is still transporting war supplies to the Chongqing government. If this statement is true, then Britain is currently not faithfully complying with its promises. He hopes that this statement is not true, but it must be investigated. According to the Chongqing Ministry of Communications, medicines and chemicals are currently being transported between Burma and Yunnan, while other items have been suspended. It should be noted that chemicals are also on the list of war supplies. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### US Ban on Oil and Iron Exports Sufficient to Stop Far East Aggression; No Response Yet to Japanese Protests; Two Oil Tankers Specially Permitted to Sail to the Soviet Union

Washington. The United States has taken active measures against Japan. Government officials implemented an embargo on Japan yesterday. At the same time, wartime raw material ships were specially permitted to sail to the Soviet Union. The US Naval Committee has strictly rejected two requests from US ships to transport steel and kerosene to Japan. However, two US oil tankers fully loaded with gasoline were specially permitted to sail to Vladivostok, Soviet Union. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

Washington. The United States has not yet responded after accepting Japan's protests against the oil and iron embargo. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

San Francisco. According to an authoritative petroleum expert who announced yesterday that the main raw material for the Japanese navy and army is oil. In the six months before President Roosevelt announced the ban on the export of aviation gasoline, the amount of oil ordered by Japan in California indicated that Japan had no intention of promoting a territorial expansion policy. In fact, California is Japan's most important source of oil. Since this year, Japan's purchases have been decreasing. Officials also said that two years ago, Japan purchased a large amount of oil from California to meet the needs of the navy and army in the Far East. The country's purpose was to obtain six months' supply, and its purchases were still based on this principle. Although Japan has stored a large amount of oil, because its oil is entirely purchased from California, the authorities have accurate statistics on the amount of purchases. Therefore, the petroleum industry here is closely monitoring this trend. In fact, they believe that Japan's oil purchases are an accurate measure of Japan's deliberate intentions, which can be used to predict the uses of oil by the navy and army in its future expansion plans. They argued that if Japan intends to launch an attack in the Far East, then Japan should have stored a large amount of oil in advance, and at the same time prevent the possibility of a US embargo. At present, Japan has not only failed to make such plans, but its purchasing power has also sharply decreased since the first year. The recent restrictions on the use of oil in the country further indicate the severity of its oil situation and the impossibility of making further attacks. However, they acknowledged that Japan, due to the lack of oil, may launch a military invasion of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. According to California oil statistics, in 1939, when Japan wanted to achieve the goal of accumulating six months of oil reserves, except for January, Japan purchased 2 million barrels of oil from California every month, increasing to 2.9 million barrels in April and 2,513,000 barrels in November. In January 1940, since Japan purchased 2,415,000 barrels of oil, the number of oil purchases gradually declined. In March and May, Japan purchased 1.8 million barrels of oil. As for the other months, Japan purchased more than 1.4 million barrels of oil per month. Pacific coast officials stated that Japan cannot produce oil domestically, and 10% of the country's oil needs must be purchased from California. Pacific coast officials felt that Japan could not attempt any serious territorial expansion movement. They acknowledged that the US embargo on oil exports is the best weapon for the United States to stop anything that would harm US interests in the Far East. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

### US-Mexico Property Dispute Expected to Be Resolved

### US Department of War Plans to Build Sixty Ordnance Factories; Capital of Approximately $700 Million Needed; Continental Army Also Being Prepared for Establishment

Washington. Undersecretary of War Patterson announced here yesterday that the Department of War is currently planning to build sixty ordnance factories so that the United States will not be threatened by arms, whether in peacetime or war. The arms manufacturing plants in the plan will require a capital of $700 million and are budgeted to produce enough arms to supply two million people. He said that the biggest problem is to allow private industrial plants to manage the factories. The funds will be unlimitedly allocated from the Joint Reserve Fund until the ideal goal is reached. Sites are being sought, and negotiations are underway with private commercial firms. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard University's "American Defense Group" announced yesterday a letter from a "senior" army officer stating that the US government is now planning to establish a continental army of 1.2 million men to protect Alaska, the Philippines, Hawaii, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the US mainland. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

Washington. The Senate Military Committee yesterday, based on a majority report, urged early approval of the enlistment bill amended by the committee. The report stated, "It is as useless to have weapons without soldiers as it is to have soldiers without weapons." At the same time, in order to improve the management of military preparations, Secretary of War Stimson ordered six arms manufacturing plants to implement the "three shifts per day, six days per week" system from August 10th. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Washington. Majority Leader Chandler, Democratic Senator Barkley, will request the Senate today to adopt rules to stop the debate at 4:00 PM so that the Senate can vote on President Roosevelt's bill to mobilize 360,000 National Guardsmen and reservists for one year of training, and also allow the Burke-Wadsworth conscription bill to be voted on. Mr. Barkley was overwhelmed by the fierce debates among the senators over the past three days, especially the arguments between Senators Sifford and Neerbelt and Senator Minton of Indiana. The House Military Committee voted to review the conscription bill and invited General Pershing, commander of the US forces in the last world war, former Secretary of War Woodring, and former Undersecretary of War Johnson to participate in the review next Tuesday.

### Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Concludes Successfully the Day Before Yesterday; Six Resolutions Passed in Seven Days; Federation Council Passes Constitutional Amendment

Moscow. The seventh session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded successfully last night amidst thunderous cheers. The following important resolutions were passed in seven days: (1) Report on the government's foreign policy; (2) Incorporation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina into the Soviet Union; (3) Incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union; (4) Incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union; (5) Incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union; (6) Approval of orders issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union since the previous session.

Guo Xinan Appointed as Vice Chairman of the Council

Yesterday was the last meeting of the session. The two chambers held separate meetings. The Federation Council meeting was convened at 2:00 PM to discuss the approval of orders issued by the Supreme Soviet since the previous session. Andreyev, Chairman of the Federation Council, introduced Ge Jin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, to speak. Under Mr. Ge's motion, the Federation Council unanimously passed the bill on amending Articles 13, 23, and 48 of the Soviet Constitution. The amendment of these constitutional clauses was prompted by the establishment of the Moldavian Federal Republic and the incorporation of the three Baltic states. The new clauses stipulate the election of sixteen Vice Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (according to the total number of Soviet republics, the Soviet Union has sixteen republics, in other words, each republic elects one vice chairman). At this point, the Karelian-Finnish Federal Assembly and the Elders Committee of the two chambers moved to elect Guo Xinan as the Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Federation Council immediately passed it, and the whole venue welcomed it.

The Federation Council Approves a Batch of Appointment Orders

Subsequently, the Federation Council accepted the request of Prosecutor Panlayev to relieve him of his post and, under the motion of the Elders Committee of the two chambers, appointed Bachkov as the Prosecutor of the Soviet Union. At this point, the Federation Council unanimously approved the orders issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on the establishment of the All-Union New People's Committee, the People's Committee of the Electrical Industry, and the People's Committee of the Fiber and Paper Industry. In addition, the council also approved the orders of the Presidium regarding the following appointment letters: (1) Voroshilov, in the capacity of marshal, was appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the National Defense Committee of the committee; (2) Malyshev, Popovkin, and Gusikin were appointed as Deputy Chairmen of the People's Committee; (3) Timoshenko was appointed as the Chairman of the National Defense People's Committee. The other approved appointment letters are as follows: Chairman of the Oil Industry Committee Sidin, Chairman of the Electrical Plant Industry Committee Laidekov, Chairman of the Electrical Industry Committee Bogatilov, Chairman of the Steel Industry Committee Tivasyan, Chairman of the Metallurgical Industry Committee Ramko, Chairman of the Shipbuilding Industry Committee Nosenko, Chairman of the Heavy Machinery Committee Yefimov, Chairman of the Fiber and Paper Industry Committee Chibatarev, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee Eskov, Chairman of the Textile Industry Committee Akimov, Chairman of the Timber Committee Sukiyev, Chairman of the Soviet National Bank Sukolov. In view of the fact that Timoshenko had been appointed as the Chairman of the National Defense Committee, the Federation Council decided to remove him from his post as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Federation Council also approved orders regarding the awarding of honors to senior generals of the Red Army and Navy, the establishment of an eight-hour day, seven-day week work system, the strict prohibition of employees from leaving their posts without permission, and poor production. At this point, the chairman announced that the seventh session had come to an end. (TASS dispatch, 8th)

### US Congress Watching Anglo-Japanese Dispute; British Actions Have a Calming Effect; Japanese Residents in Britain Have All Registered

Tokyo. Foreign Minister Matsuoka went to a seaside resort near Tokyo today to meet the Emperor and report on foreign affairs. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Washington. The US State Department is still observing developments in the Far East with great attention and is paying close attention to the Anglo-Japanese dispute. The arrests of Japanese residents by the British have had a calming effect in Tokyo. People here do not find this unusual and believe that the result of this move by the British further proves the general belief here that Japan wants to see the results of its political intimidation but does not want to take serious international action. Franklin, one of Washington's most famous political commentators, revealed a piece of information in the *Washington Post* yesterday that, if his statement is true, it can be seen how Japan's relationship with the Axis powers is progressing. He stated that General Ott, the German Ambassador to Japan, visited Konoe twice before his inauguration, requesting that Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, who advocated close contact with Germany and Italy, be appointed Foreign Minister and that moderate elements in the cabinet be eliminated, with the Axis powers' assistance to Japan in obtaining control of the Dutch East Indies as an exchange condition. Whether there are moderate elements in the current Konoe cabinet remains to be proven, but at least the request for Oshima to become Foreign Minister has been rejected. According to Franklin's opinion, Japan wants to formally please Germany while in fact maintaining its freedom of action. The German ambassador already had this request when Japan was not yet fully bound by the Axis powers. It can be seen how much freedom and independence Japan can have in the future if Britain fails and Germany establishes a new world order. Mr. Franklin also stated that the United States has the right to protect the sovereignty of the British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific under the Four-Power Treaty of 1921. The United States can exercise this right without declaring war in accordance with the current principles of international law and US national interests. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London. Undersecretary of the Interior Pick wrote in a written reply in the House of Commons yesterday to a question from Conservative MP Moore that 865 Japanese residents in Britain have registered with the police, including 762 men. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### US Intensifies Patrol of Greenland Coast

London. The *Daily Mail's* New York dispatch stated that the US Coast Guard has intensified its patrol of the Greenland coast to prevent Germany from establishing an air force base there. The Coast Guard cutter Campbell, previously equipped with heavy guns and anti-aircraft guns, is now patrolling off the coast of Greenland. The ship has enough food and fuel for one year. In addition, two more patrol cutters are on their way. According to a report from Danish Governor Brun, many German expeditions have arrived in Greenland. Brun is currently in the United States to discuss everything with government officials. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### British House of Commons Discusses Economic Organization Issues; Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood Presents Report; Labor MP Shinwell Expresses Views

London - Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood initiated a discussion on economic organization in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the economy is the lifeblood of war. Since the current government was established, it has been dedicated to strengthening the sinews of war. When the current government was first established, Britain clearly bore a heavy burden, but today's situation does not cause alarm. To achieve a swift victory, the military must receive full equipment, and the people must have full confidence. Aircraft, tanks, guns, ammunition all require different skills and various materials from all parts of the world. Since the range of aircraft has greatly increased, the war zone has expanded, so the war has become a

Total War

The so-called non-war term no longer has any meaning. This vast and complex war, involving the entire population, must have an unprecedented, large-scale economic structure. He admitted that this has not yet been achieved. Speaking of the enemy's economy, Hitler, in his recent speech, boasted of his economic strength, saying that the supply of supplies for his army and air force is now greater than before the attack on the West. This may not be wrong, as is the case in Britain, but Hitler is now troubled by serious problems within his new borders, and this difficulty will increase day by day. Hitler claims that food supply will not be interrupted for a single day until the war is over. This is also doubtful. The longer the war lasts, the more trouble Hitler will have, because aggression and war actions have turned fertile land into wasteland. Refugees flee, farming is abandoned, and fields are destroyed wherever tanks pass. In addition, Germany's agricultural harvest this year is not good, so next spring Hitler will feel more

Food Problems

The difficulty. Hitler will continue to manufacture war equipment, but his main industrial areas and aircraft fields have suffered heavy damage. Oil refineries, warehouses, railways, docks, and ships have now become the targets of British aircraft bombing day and night. In the future, the stronger the British bomber force, the more severe the enemy will be hit, so its production capacity has undoubtedly been greatly hindered. The damage to production facilities and transportation lines is difficult, if not impossible, to repair in a short time. Hitler must take supplies from storage to deal with everything. The fiercer the fighting, the more the stored items are consumed, and the more difficult it will be to replenish the losses. Britain has already tried to prevent Hitler from obtaining foreign assistance. Not only Germany, but also the areas under its control cannot communicate with the outside world. The blockade is extensive, and with trade routes cut off, the enemy will be even more embarrassed. Hitler will inevitably continue to seize food and raw materials from the occupied territories, but this supply will also be exhausted. Hitler boasts of having a lot of iron, which is inexhaustible. The enemy does have a lot of iron, and may not worry about the lack of aluminum supply, but its overseas situation is very different. In terms of supply, there must be a large shortage. Even if Hitler has mountains of iron, without good coal for smelting iron, the iron will ultimately have no highest military value. In peacetime, Britain annually exports 30 million tons of coal to Europe, but now not a ton falls into German hands. Hitler's land consumes 20 million tons of oil annually, but now Hitler can only hope to obtain half of it. Hitler is encountering such economic situations, which sooner or later

Will Worsen

At that time, the oppressed people of Germany and other places will wish that we could or could not endure this suffering, which is undoubtedly true. However, Britain should not underestimate its current power. Germany is single-mindedly focused on one thing, that is, preparing the strongest and most terrifying combat power the world has ever seen. The German economic system has been based on war for the past few years. The British must know that they have not yet felt the heavy blow of Hitler. The British have proven that they can be remarkably effective in war, no less than dictatorship, but the British are still in the process of transforming from a peaceful economy to a war economy. The British must make good use of their resources to support national life and national spirit and win the war. For the sake of victory, the British government will use all human, industrial, financial, and all foreign assets, so it must formulate an economic strategy in order to achieve the practical results of cooperation in all aspects, Greenwood said, and then elaborated on the various economic problems to be considered and

Adjust the Economy

A new approach to efforts is that each issue is now handled by a subcommittee composed of members of the War Cabinet and relevant ministers. One of the most important elements in the efficiency of economic warfare is the disposal of surplus overseas goods, so that they benefit Britain and do not benefit the enemy. After the collapse of France, production problems became more difficult. Britain gave priority to manufacturing the war equipment necessary to resist the enemy, while preparing for the possibility of a long-term war. It is now continuing to consider how to fully utilize raw materials, factories, and labor to carry out the production process, Greenwood continued

Industrial Capacity

The details of the organization, and said that measures have been taken to prevent air raids that destroy factories, and also said that since the dissolution of the British-French Joint Purchasing Commission in the United States, a new agency has been established to handle purchasing matters in the United States. This agency has been actively working for several weeks. The United States is now arming the entire country and mobilizing its industry. Months ago, Britain placed orders with American industry to make up for the shortage of Allied production. Now, it must embark on a larger program related to American national defense, so the complexity of the work of the British Purchasing Commission in the United States is self-evident. At the same time, Britain must adjust the needs of Britain, the autonomous territories, India, and the Allied countries that rely on British assistance in London and New York. Now the United States and Canada have become the most important suppliers of British war equipment. For the sake of effectively carrying out the war, people's consumption should be guaranteed and unnecessary hardships should be avoided. The rise in the cost of living is not as severe as the rise in prices. The government's goal is to curb prices, and this policy should maintain the health of the people. The government has tried to increase exports, but in the current environment, the possibility of increasing exports is not satisfactory. As for British shipping, it is still not bad. Britain should store food and raw materials to the best of its ability to prepare for emergencies. It is impossible for the enemy to starve the British to death. Unnecessary imports should be banned, and the rate of domestic aircraft and military equipment production has recently increased greatly, and there will soon be great progress. (Reuters, 8th)

London - After Greenwood spoke in the House of Commons yesterday, Labor MP Shinwell proposed that a very detailed investigation should be conducted into the economic possibilities of the country, and asked whether the government had assumed that the war would be extended for two or three years and estimated the needs of aircraft, ammunition, labor, raw materials, and exports. Is there a real allocation between true war necessities, exports, and civilian necessities? Shinwell also said that according to reliable estimates, Germany has 780,000 men and women receiving industrial training, while Britain has only 28,000 people who have already received industrial training, and 40,000 who can receive training this year. Rather than allowing British miners to be unemployed, would it be better to subsidize mine owners, continue working, accumulate more coal, or move miners into war industries? In order to develop export trade, manufacturers and export companies should be subsidized. All individual efforts and competitive behaviors must be replaced by a perfect system of cooperative production. Britain must rely on itself and not rely too much on the United States, because the United States may go to war with Japan. (Reuters, 8th)

### German Aircraft Groups Attack London Again on a Large Scale; British Aircraft Also Cross the Channel to Bomb

London - The "elastic springboard" prepared by the Germans in Europe to launch a blitzkrieg against the British Isles, after being heavily bombed by the British for days, the Germans launched an air raid on the entire British Isles yesterday in retaliation. Since Tuesday evening of this week, the activity of German aircraft has been greatly reduced compared to before. Unexpectedly, yesterday several detachments of German aircraft suddenly appeared over the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest regions of the British Isles, breaking the silent air. The British anti-aircraft defense team naturally made a lot of noise. The British Air Force also flew across the Channel yesterday, without stopping all day. British ships along the coast heard the constant sound of German anti-aircraft guns, but the nature of these British aircraft's actions is still unknown. (International Telegram, 8th)

London - An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on Tuesday night, British Air Force bombers had to abandon many planned bombing targets due to low cloud cover and poor visibility. However, the British aircraft still braved these difficulties and bombed oil refineries in Hamburg, warehouses in Hillte, anti-aircraft artillery teams in Hanpon, and a factory in Morse. At the same time, aircraft fields in the Netherlands and northern Germany were also bombed by British aircraft, causing multiple fires. One British aircraft was missing. (Reuters, 8th)

London - An Air Ministry intelligence office stated that on Tuesday afternoon, a British Air Force medium bomber, using floating clouds as cover, attacked the Bouchte airfield in Paris. At that time, there were several German twin-engine giant aircraft at the airfield, and several other medium aircraft near the aircraft hangar. The British aircraft launched a surprise attack, dropping bombs on the aircraft and near the hangar, and then retreated into the clouds. Only then did the ground anti-aircraft artillery team open fire. (Reuters, 8th)

London - Today, when German aircraft continued to attack British ships and cities, fierce air battles occurred over the English Channel. At least six German bombers and three fighters were shot down. Two British Air Force pilots were missing. (Reuters, 8th)

Berlin - This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that a German submarine sank three enemy merchant ships, totaling more than 16,000 tons. Last night, German aircraft laid mines outside British commercial ports and attacked several arsenals, as well as the locations of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, such as the industrial institutions in Plymouth, the anti-aircraft artillery teams and searchlight locations in Manchester, Cardiff, and Dolsthrough, all of which were bombed. Last night, enemy aircraft bombed western and northern Germany, but the German side suffered very little loss. Several private residences were destroyed near Aissen and Datoln. Fires initially broke out, but the fire brigade rescued quickly, preventing the fire from spreading. Two enemy aircraft were shot down. (Haitong Telegram, 8th)

### Hungarian-Romanian Negotiations Begin; Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations Scheduled to Take Place; Romanian Cabinet to be Reorganized

Hungary - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with Romanian envoy Posy yesterday evening, with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky also present. Direct Hungarian-Romanian negotiations have begun. Posy arrived here yesterday afternoon, and the Hungarian cabinet held a special meeting to discuss the situation after the arrival of the Romanian representatives. The meeting ended at 7:00 pm, but after meeting with the Romanian representatives, it continued to meet. Teleki has reported Posy's proposed Romanian proposals to the cabinet. Hungarian officials are strictly keeping silent about the content of the negotiations. Newspapers have not yet mentioned the news of Posy's arrival in the Hungarian capital. (Haitong Telegram, 8th)

Hungarian Capital - Romanian Ambassador to Italy Pose has recently arrived here and is expected to hold negotiations with the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister immediately. After Hitler's talks with the representatives of the Berschtesgarten and the Hohe Tauern, the Hungarian side, while holding the greatest hope, many people here have little faith in the outcome of the negotiations, and expect that these negotiations will proceed slowly until nothing is achieved. It is noteworthy that Germans here are currently trying to suppress the enthusiasm of Hungarians who advocate revising the border. For example, the German side has stated that Germany will cede part or even all of Slovakia to Hungary in order to compensate for Hungary's insufficient concessions in Outer Transylvania. Hungary's mobilization is almost complete, but people in the Hungarian capital have not yet seriously discussed the possibility of Hungarian-Romanian war. (Reuters, 8th)

Bulgarian Capital - According to a government publication, the issues of Dobrogea are currently developing normally. The negotiations on this issue between the Bulgarian and Romanian countries have been approved by the Axis powers, and their purpose is obviously to seek lasting peace in Southern Europe. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Bulgarian Capital - It is rumored here that the Romanian-Bulgarian negotiations on the division of Southern Dobrogea will be held in Craiova on August 11, and it is said that the Bulgarian delegation has already departed. Another source said that it will set off soon. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Romanian Capital - According to private sources here, the Romanian government will be reorganized soon. The cabinet will include several representatives from Outer Transylvania, such as former minister Pop, former deputy minister Scriden, and Professor Boskario, who are all expected to join the cabinet. They will generally be assigned to head the Ministry of Justice, Labor, and Education. Three members of the Iron Guard in the cabinet, namely Education Minister Butitesno, Culture Minister Hovenru, and Deputy Minister Betiru, will be dismissed for violating discipline. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will remain in office, and there will be other minor changes. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### German Military Department Announces Naval Achievements

Berlin - The German military department announced today regarding the achievements of naval operations, stating that not long ago, a large batch of goods was intercepted by German ships and escorted to German seaports. Several days later, the official gazette stated again that several enemy ships had been sunk by German ships. Today, the official gazette stated again that 30,000 tons of enemy ships had been destroyed in a very distant sea. This achievement is worthy of attention, because German ships are operating in the ocean without a base of operations. If they go to neutral seaports to add fuel or food, they are also easily detected by the enemy, and all enemy merchant ships are equipped with weapons, so it is not easy to sink merchant ships. Although the German Air Force was less active yesterday, the Taikoo Aircraft Field on the east and west coasts of Britain, the Amstong Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Chester, and the Xuansi Ordnance Factory were all attacked by the Air Force one after another.

### Central Daily News Publishes Editorial Warning Chinese People Not to Purchase Foreign Currencies; World is Unstable, All Foreign Currencies May be Devalued; Possibility of Decline in Value of Legal Tender Has Been Reduced

Chongqing - The Central Daily News here recently published an editorial warning Chinese people not to purchase foreign currencies and deposit them in foreign banks, saying that when the war was limited to China and Japan, capital flight from China was unnecessary, but when the war spread to the world, any foreign currency could be in danger of stopping market transactions at any time, causing holders to be affected. In this unstable autumn of the world, exchange controls or any currency devaluation are not limited to defeated countries. Even in the victorious countries, fearing that any extraordinary rise or fall in currency will cause confusion in the economic system and trade, they may also take such measures. The richest country in the world, the United States, has devalued the gold dollar, and due to the current decline in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound, there are rumors that the US dollar will continue to devalue. It is generally believed that the belief that currency deposited in foreign banks will remain in China forever is a mistake, because this currency must be moved to another country in order to avoid local control regulations and exchange rate increases. If a country to which the bank belongs participates in the war, the depositor will not be able to convert the deposited funds into legal tender or withdraw the funds from the bank. Some people also believe that storing foreign currency bonds is safer than opening a foreign currency account in a bank. This belief must be a mistake, because any foreign currency only circulates in the country of issue, and its value abroad only exists when there is an exchange rate. Once market trading stops, this currency will be worthless. During the last war, those who held rubles or marks outside of Germany and Russia suffered great losses, which can serve as a warning. Moreover, even in peacetime, the value of banknotes is often lower than the actual exchange rate, because interest, freight, and insurance costs must be deducted. Others think that storing gold bars is the best, which is also a mistake. Gold has now been nationalized. At present, the power of the Chinese authorities cannot temporarily reach Shanghai, so there is a black market. However, once the war ends, even if the Chinese government does not confiscate gold, it will definitely buy it at the official price. The article also lists the reasons for the current rise in the value of legal tender as follows: (1) The Japanese who previously purchased foreign exchange are now selling it, obviously wanting to obtain legal tender to purchase Chinese products for export; (2) Overseas Chinese are remitting funds back to the country due to fear of new local control regulations; (3) Banks of various belligerent countries are now selling foreign exchange to purchase legal tender to cope with possible withdrawals; (4) Imports to Shanghai are gradually decreasing, while exports are increasing. After settlement, foreign currencies will tend to be in oversupply; (5) As the confidence of the Chinese people has increased, the possibility of a decline in the value of legal tender is decreasing day by day. Once the war ends, holders of foreign currencies will inevitably be forced to settle at the official exchange rate. (Telegram, 8th)

### Hong Kong Refuses Entry to Japanese Ships Because Japan Violates the Okazaki-Bland Agreement

Hong Kong - According to reliable sources, the Hong Kong authorities, in accordance with the recent British statement to Japan that the detention of British ships in Guangzhou was a violation of the 1939 Okazaki-Bland Agreement, have refused entry to Japanese ships. According to the provisions of the Okazaki-Bland Agreement, if Japan closes the Pearl River and does not allow British ships to navigate, then Britain will not provide Hong Kong to Japan for transportation. At present, the British ship Fo Shan has been detained by the Japanese in Guangzhou. The Japanese side has declared that unless the ship pays HK$4,000 as a harbor pilot fee, it will not be given an export permit. The owner of the Fo Shan is unwilling to pay this fee, because the British crew of the ship already have a harbor pilot license and do not need a Japanese harbor pilot. The British authorities reported that Japan's detention of British ships was an indication of the blockade of the Pearl River, so they also did not allow Japanese ships to enter Hong Kong. (United Press Agency, 8th)

Hong Kong - The British authorities here have refused to allow two Japanese ships to enter Hong Kong. This incident occurred after the British had a dispute with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou over the Taikoo Company's Fo Shan ship sailing between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, because the ship had been blocked in Guangzhou since last week. Currently, this dispute is being resolved by British Consul General in Guangzhou Bland and the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. (Reuters, 8th)

### European War Records (4): The Retreat of the Anglo-French Allied Forces (Continued)

Until dawn, everything went smoothly. After that, for two consecutive days, we experienced the true taste of bombing. Enemy planes desperately bombed us. From early morning until dusk, bombers came in waves every few minutes to wreak havoc. They came in groups and then formed a straight line. The lead plane turned around and flew straight down. You could hear the sharp engine sound gradually intensifying, and then a loud bang, as if a bomb had exploded beside you. This terrible explosion made your chest wheeze and your head feel like it was about to burst. Soon we could distinguish the sounds of the bombs. A whistling sound meant the bomb was landing far away, while a tearing sound meant the bomb was very close. In this situation, I found that thinking about my brothers and walking around the positions helped a lot. So if you are afraid, it is better to find something to do. On the first day, when the enemy focused its bombing on the trenches, it was truly terrifying.

Once, I was crouching in a trench, and the vibration of the bomb overhead sent mud and debris raining down. I suddenly remembered a saying of the Commander-in-Chief, who said that war is woven from consecutive days of boredom and sudden tension. I suddenly felt that this was a profound truth, and I couldn't help but laugh. It wasn't until I turned around and saw a brother staring at me in a daze.

Under such circumstances, after waiting for half a day and still not seeing the enemy, we moved further to the right and dug trenches along the canal bank, passing two destroyed bridges. At that time, the German army was "miles away, hidden behind a small hill, with mortars set up on top, and they were opening fire. But they did not advance, only continued to bomb with planes, and the bombs gradually approached. We were well concealed, and the casualties were still relatively few.

We were stationed there for three days, and the enemy had crossed the flanks of our army, so our army quickly moved. We marched from 10:30 at night until 4:30 the next morning, when transport vehicles drove us straight to Armentières. The city had been severely bombed. Our army's transport vehicles passed through the city. Unfortunately, half of the vehicles went the wrong way and mistakenly headed towards Mont Cassel. They drove into the village and were heavily bombarded by the German artillery positions on the bridge, resulting in significant losses. This situation was only known by those remaining troops after we reunited in Dunkirk.

About half a battalion of soldiers marched directly towards Steenvoorde, and as they approached, they encountered the most intense bombing. In the afternoon, the sky was dark and obscured by countless enemy planes. Just as the brothers were about to run into the fields to hide, a bomb struck the front of a heavy vehicle. Everyone inside was either dead or wounded. I went forward to see what had happened and saw a sergeant in the vehicle severely wounded, his severed arm lying on the side of the road. As I approached, he shouted repeatedly, "Leave me, leave me!" A few soldiers from his unit braved the machine-gun fire and bombs to drag him to the side of the road, and in a bomb crater, they hastily bandaged his wounds in a minute or two.

It wasn't until dark that the bombers flew away. Then we walked into a village. After resting briefly, we were ordered to lead a team to guard the road again at midnight. In the darkness, we set up anti-tank guns and dug trenches. The officer told me that our army was now going to defend this road, covering the main force's retreat to Dunkirk. The road taken by the retreating troops was to our left, and we had to do our best to contain the enemy attacking from the right, so that they could not cut off the retreating troops.

We guarded the road junction until dawn. German planes came to bomb constantly again, and I was really exhausted. I even dozed off against the gun once or twice. At that time, a lost puppy was curled up under my arm, occasionally wiping my wrist with its cold nose, waking me up. There were about twenty of these dogs that had followed us all the way in retreat. At night, they slept with us in the barn. One of them, a mongrel puppy, had the ability to distinguish between bombers and other planes, so we called it "Air Raid Siren."

Before dawn, our army was ordered to join the elite French forces to serve as the rearguard on the right flank. The German army's several general attacks were all repelled. Finally, we charged with bayonets, fought hand-to-hand with the German army, and annihilated thousands of them. I saw the German army attacking to the left of my position, as if someone was forcing them from behind. Although they were mowed down in groups by machine guns, they still kept coming to attack all night long. The enemy was useless in bayonet fighting; that was what they feared.

Our army was ordered to retreat two miles further, only seven miles from Dunkirk. While digging trenches along the banks of the Bergues Canal, we also destroyed the sluice gates, and our front immediately became a swamp, which was indeed a natural defensive fortification. To the left of our position was the highway, and tens of thousands of the main force poured onto the beach from that road. The French soldiers near us were all good men and were also building trenches. Before long, our artillery units also passed through the pass we were defending, densely packed, batch after batch.

As soon as we got down into the trenches, the battle broke out again. First, there were continuous waves of German bombers, followed by our army's artillery fire. These two days were the worst, and our army suffered heavy casualties. On the second day, the German army suddenly appeared in the forest in front of the trenches, and our army greeted them with a machine-gun fire net, preventing the enemy from advancing. Our heavy artillery also continuously bombarded the enemy's positions from the rear, and the shells whizzed over our heads. The German army's several attacks all failed, and their losses must have been great. This was truly a pit of fire and proved that our army's firepower was indeed stronger than the enemy's.

At night, the endless stream of troops had finished passing through, and I was ordered to retreat towards Dunkirk. At that time, the range of the German artillery fire had reached the highway, and we had to rest temporarily three miles away from the highway. From there to Dunkirk, six miles away, it took us twelve hours.

Dunkirk had become a ruin, with flames everywhere. Tens of thousands of troops were waiting for ships on the beach. To the right was a mile-long pier, which had been bombed beyond recognition. In the darkness, thousands of people from my regiment groped their way to it in single file. If it had been dawn and the German planes had come to bomb again, that would not have been a joke. We moved forward all the way, everyone was quiet and orderly. Those who were not tired helped others to walk.

When we reached the beach, we saw two destroyers docked. In the pitch black night, the naval personnel calmly and quickly helped us onto the ships. In just half an hour, they had completely filled one destroyer. At this time, dawn was breaking, and we had already sailed out of the harbor, seeing a sea of fire from the coastal villages and towns, all the way to Calais. The inland sky was also reflected red by the artillery fire. This was the last glimpse I had before returning to England, and then I fell asleep. Although I heard the alarm bells and the "prepare for battle" command, I didn't care at all.

Looking back on these twenty-one days, the strangest thing was that our troops never engaged the German army once. Now I am really eager to try. In a few days, we will all recover and prepare to go to the front line again...

### Rampant Terrorist Crimes: Five Kidnappings Occurred Yesterday, with a Total of Seven Victims; Criminals All Hired Cars for Their Operations

Recently, kidnapping cases in this city have emerged one after another. The police authorities of the two concessions attach great importance to them and spare no effort in investigating the criminal gangs. Despite the authorities' efforts in prevention and investigation, the trend of kidnapping has not abated slightly. Yesterday alone, as many as five kidnapping cases occurred in succession. The victims were three rice merchants, two silk merchants, a four-year-old child, and an unidentified man. Details are as follows:

Two Rice Merchants Kidnapped Simultaneously

The first kidnapping case occurred at 6:30 AM yesterday. Prior to the incident, three criminals went to the Xiang Sheng Automobile Branch on Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road and rented a car with license number 18404, driven by driver Xu Arong, to the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. Upon arriving at the hotel, the criminals got out of the car one after another and went straight to Room 258 on the second floor of the hotel. At that time, a traveler named Huang Shengbai, a 30-year-old rice merchant from Jing, and his friend Shi Junde (some say his name is Zhu Zijun, 37 years old) were still fast asleep in the room. When the criminals entered the room, they immediately brandished pistols, threatening Huang and others not to make a sound. Under the criminals' threats, they were unable to resist and followed the criminals downstairs, got into the car, and the criminals forced the driver to drive to the Hongye Garden on Yuyuan Road. Then, they dragged Huang and Shi out of the car and abducted them. The driver reported to the police, and the Andong Hotel's accounting room also reported to the police. By the time the police arrived, the criminals had already fled far away. The police summoned the tea attendant on duty to the police station for questioning to assist in the investigation.

Child Kidnapped on Haifang Road

The second kidnapping occurred at 7:10 AM. At that time, the Yunfei Automobile Company on Jing'an Temple Road received a phone call stating that someone at 1075 Xiaoshadu Road wanted to hire a car. The company ordered driver Li Guanghua to drive car number 12285 to the location. When he arrived at 1075 Xiaoshadu Road, there were indeed two men and one woman waiting for the car. One of the men immediately drew a gun and drove the driver out of the car. Then, the criminals drove off themselves. It was later learned that the car drove to the intersection of Haifang Road, Jinghua Road, and Yanlingfang, and kidnapped a four-year-old boy into the car. At that time, the guard at the entrance of the lane saw the situation and tried to stop them. The criminals fired a shot as a warning, fortunately not injuring anyone. The criminals then drove away quickly. The kidnapped boy was the young son of Lu Jicheng, the owner of the Lu Xunji electroplating factory at 50 Jinghua Road, named Da Nv. He was being held by his nanny at the entrance of the lane yesterday morning when he was kidnapped. Later, the car was found in the area under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road Police Station.

Unidentified Man Forced into Car

The third kidnapping occurred at 7:35 AM at the Yuyuan Road branch of the Tailai Automobile Company. A man went to hire a car, and the company sent driver Chen Fugen, a native of Yancheng, to drive car number 12079. After the man got into the car, he first drove to the Lvfang Food Company at 952 Jing'an Temple Road, had breakfast, got back into the car, and asked the driver to drive to the front of 956 Kaixuan Road, where he ordered the driver to stop. Two men then got into the car and ordered the driver to drive to the back door of 11 Lane 159, Yidingpan Road. The criminals ordered the driver to stop and drove the driver out of the car, with one criminal guarding him. The other two criminals then entered the house. After a while, a man with black glasses on his nose was forced into the car by the two criminals and driven away quickly. The driver was guarded for four hours before he regained his freedom and reported to the police. It is still unclear whether this case is a kidnapping or a relocation of a hostage. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.

Two Silk Merchants Abducted Together

At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred at 470 Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. The kidnapped victims were He Shenzhi and He Lunzhang, who resided in the lane. Both He were engaged in the silk business and lived at No. 9 in the lane. They had their own car, license number 1446, and hired a driver named Luo Zhixiang. At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, the two He, accompanied by their friend Deng, left in their own car. As the driver, Luo Zhixiang, was driving the car out of the lane entrance, three kidnappers suddenly stopped the car, each brandishing a pistol, threatening the driver and He not to make a sound. They first drove He's friend Deng out of the car, and then two criminals jumped into the car compartment, monitoring the two He. One criminal sat next to the driver, ordering him to drive eastward. Under the threat of a pistol, the driver dared not resist. The car drove to the vicinity of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road, and the criminal monitoring the driver drove the driver, Luo Zhixiang, out of the car and drove off westward. After being driven out of the car, the driver reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge. At the same time, his family had also been informed. After receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the scene of the incident to investigate and telegraphed to all police stations for assistance in the search.

Another Rice Merchant Also Arrested

The fifth incident occurred at about 1:30 PM. Liu Litang, a native of Hangzhou, engaged in the rice business and had Room 4 at the Yuanyuan Shunji Hotel on Jiujiang Road for business negotiations. Liu had a friend, Han Xuewen, also a native of Hangzhou and also engaged in the rice business. Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, he went to the Yuanyuan Hotel to visit Liu. As soon as he arrived in the room and took off his long gown, three men suddenly appeared, one dressed in Chinese attire and two dressed in Western suits. The one dressed in Chinese attire was watching at the door of Room 4, and the two dressed in Western suits broke into the room, asking which one was Mr. Han Xuewen. Seeing that the two were well-dressed, Han did not suspect anything and replied that he was surnamed Han. Upon hearing this, the two men immediately brandished pistols, threatening him not to make a sound, and ordered Han Xuewen to leave with them. Because the two men were armed with pistols, Han dared not resist and had to go with them. As soon as he walked out of the Yuanyuan Hotel, he was forced into a Xiang Sheng car parked in front of the door and driven away quickly. Later, Liu Litang reported to the police station in charge and sent detectives to investigate. The police are still investigating the reason for the kidnapping.

### Qiongzhou Ship Loaded with Goods, Sailed to Haiphong This Morning; Reports of Disruption of Outer Shanghai Defense Line Are Inaccurate

Since the Japanese military threatened the Vietnamese authorities in early July, prohibiting military supplies from entering the mainland via Vietnam and stationed supervisors in Haiphong, Saigon, Hanoi, and other places in Vietnam, cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was immediately suspended. Shipping lines on the Shanghai and Haiphong defense lines were also suspended for a time, but resumed on the 8th. After the resumption of shipping lines, due to the disruption of cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, each ship sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong had no cargo to transport. It is now reported that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has resumed transportation of ordinary goods, except for military supplies. Therefore, the Qiongzhou ship of the Taikoo Company, which sailed to Haiphong this morning, had goods to transport. In the future, all goods except military supplies can be transported as usual. The rumor that the Shanghai-Haiphong line has been temporarily disrupted is absolutely inaccurate. Perhaps it is because the Taikoo and Jardine companies have no ships to dispatch in recent days that the outside world mistakenly believes that the shipping line has been disrupted.

### Wilson Elected as Director of British Residents Association General Assembly

The British Residents Association in China has seen a sudden increase in membership of 565 people in the past few weeks. According to reports, the total number of members has increased to 1,864. On the 6th of this month, the association convened a general meeting of members at the association's headquarters and elected Wilson as a director.

### Special Alert Commenced This Morning; Defense Forces Awaiting Orders to Mobilize; All U.S. Marine Corps Remain in Camp; All Shanghai Volunteer Corps Armed and Return to Units

The third anniversary of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War is approaching in an instant. The authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai have implemented special alerts since this morning. This special alert is even more severe than the previous two sessions. It has been implemented since this morning. All police officers in the two concessions' police stations have been mobilized. Special patrol officers in the Public Concession and French volunteers in the French Concession will also participate. At the same time, the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, such as the British Defense Force, the Seaforth Highlanders, the U.S. Navy's McClelland Detachment, and the defense forces of France and Italy, will be stationed in their original defense areas, assisting in the defense where strength is insufficient. Roads with unimportant traffic have been obstructed with obstacles since 1:00 AM this morning, cutting off traffic, as in the past. The Municipal Council's police authorities have also found that the barbed wire fences built in various roads and lanes are mostly rusted and unusable. To strengthen the defense within the concession, they have specially dispatched police officers carrying a large number of iron wires, adding them to the grid between the traffic intersections and unnecessary lane entrances and exits, strengthening the obstacle equipment.

All U.S. Marine Corps Remain in Camp

The Shanghai Times reported that the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai will remain in camp from 10:00 PM tonight (the 8th) to August 15th, and will not be allowed to leave, in order to cooperate with the Municipal Council's police department around the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai War and maintain治安。 It is heard that U.S. Marine Corps patrols will still defend their jurisdiction, the same as previous anniversaries, to ensure peace and prevent disturbances in the area. It is heard that the guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Shanghai are becoming more active on anniversaries. Therefore, all military organizations in the concession will cooperate with the Municipal Council to densely deploy a security line around the area to ensure peace within the concession.

Volunteer Corps Return to Units; Japanese Military Exercises

In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps has issued an order from the corps commander, H.P. Humphrey, yesterday, summoning all the corps' teams, including (1) the Cavalry, including the Light Cavalry and the American Cavalry, (2) the Regiment, including the Armored Car Team, the Machine Gun Team, and the Chinese Team, etc., (3) the A-Team Battalion, including the A Team, the B Team, the Scottish Team, the Jewish Team, and the Anti-Aircraft Team, (4) the B-Team Battalion, the American Team, the British Machine Gun, the Portuguese Team, and the Filipino Team. From 5:00 AM this morning, all troops will be armed and deployed. As for the white Russian troops, they will still patrol within the concession at that time, such as the Avenue Joffre east of Bubbling Well Road and the roads along the Huangpu River. The Japanese Marine Corps plans to conduct exercises starting at 10:30 AM on "August 13th". The exercise area will be from Yokohama Road via Bazih Bridge to Guangzhong Road, and a viewing platform will be set up on Guangzhong Road for Japanese residents to visit.

### Water and Electricity Workers Strike One Step Closer

Yesterday morning, Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, Chinese members of the Municipal Council, went to the Water and Electricity Company to meet with Chairman Cadbury to mediate the labor dispute between the company and its employees. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company originally insisted that workers who had been replaced by White Russians for strike action would not be allowed to return to work. Now the company no longer insists on this point. It is heard that Yu plans to visit the company again today for further negotiations.

### White Russian Association Under Protection; New Leader to Take Office; Most White Russian Residents Do Not Express Approval; Thousands of People Attend Mesila's Funeral

The Continental News reported that the White Russian Residents Committee in Shanghai has weakened due to the assassination of Chairman Mesila and will soon be absorbed by the "White Russian Immigrant Association" under the protection of the Japanese on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. The important work of issuing passports, etc., will be taken over by the new association, headed by White Russian lawyer Ivanov.

Mesila Case Not Yet Clarified

As for who assassinated Mesila, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has not yet found out. A Russian-language newspaper in Shanghai that supports the Soviet Union claims that the murder was committed by those close to the new regime, while the Russian-language Far Eastern Times claims that Mesila was killed by communist elements.

New Chairman Faces Many Difficulties

The English-language China Press also reported that according to White Russian sources in Shanghai, Ivanov, who served as a judge in the Russian Consulate in Shanghai during the Imperial Russian era, will succeed Mesila as chairman of the White Russian Residents Committee on Saturday. Many White Russians in Shanghai are opposed to Ivanov's succession to this position, but they will not strongly object.

Bishop John Receives Threatening Letter

According to news this morning (the 8th), Bishop John, who temporarily took charge of the affairs of the White Russian Residents Committee after Mesila's assassination, received a threatening letter stating, "You have presided over three funerals, and you will preside over seventeen more funerals. However, the twenty-first funeral will be recited by others." Yesterday afternoon, Mesila's coffin was buried in the Jing'an Temple Cemetery. Thousands of White Russian men and women attended the funeral, many sobbing uncontrollably.

### Salvation Army Is a Charitable Organization; Absolutely No Political Role; Newspaper Falsely Accuses It of Being a Spy Organization; Salvation Army Authorities Solemnly Deny It

Yesterday, the Japanese-language Continental News published a cartoon in a prominent position, falsely accusing the British Salvation Army of being a purely spy organization. Regarding this matter, a British major of the Shanghai branch office of the Salvation Army solemnly denied it to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency. He said, "The Salvation Army is a purely charitable organization and treats people of all countries equally. Not only does it provide relief to British, French, and Chinese refugees, but it also strives to help people of German, Italian, and Japanese nationality who need relief, without any distinction. Since its establishment, the Salvation Army has a considerable history, and its non-political nature is well known. The Japanese newspaper's claims are unknown."

Maurice Talks About Relief Work

According to Maurice, the district director of the Shanghai district of the Salvation Army, the army has issued a total of 8,000 rice tickets since it started providing rice to the poor in April of this year, with each ticket issuing five sheng of rice, totaling 40,000 sheng. Anyone who is determined to be poor and unable to purchase rice can go to the Salvation Army's office to request the issuance of the rice ticket. There are four rice collection points, including Yisheng Gong on Kangti Road and Baotai Rice Shop in Hongkou. Since the army started providing assistance to refugees returning home last month, more than 100 refugees have been left behind, and the army has given each person a discretionary amount of repatriation fees, approximately 25 yuan per person.

Assisting the Poor with Small Businesses

He also said that the army is currently providing subsidies for small businesses to the poor. Any poor person who is properly introduced and has no funds to operate a small business can go to receive a subsidy, ranging from 10 yuan or more per person. The army will also establish two shelters in the concession in October, one for orphans and one for widows, and will also establish a special school for refugee children. Finally, he said that the army's monthly operating expenses in Shanghai are approximately 8,000 yuan.

### Qian Hongye Honored in Death; Zhu Jiahua and Wu Kaixian Send Condolences

Since Qian Hongye, the chief judge of the criminal court of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, was killed in his residence on the 29th of last month, the Chinese people in Shanghai have mourned in unison. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency who inquired with his family, they have received telegrams of condolences from Chiang Kai-shek, Zhu Jiahua, and Wu Kaixian from Chongqing, expressing deep grief over Qian Hongye's death. The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) Chiang Kai-shek's telegram, seen in the 2nd issue of this newspaper; (2) To Madam Qian, Sister-in-law, Hongye's loyalty, love, chastity, and honesty have long been admired. He upheld righteousness and did not waver, and was killed by assassins. His noble spirit is vast and fills the world. I hope you restrain your grief and carry on his legacy. I pray for you, Zhu Jiahua, Weidong."; (3) To Madam Qian, Sister-in-law, Hongye's integrity and noble character are admired by the world. Shocked to hear the bad news, I am deeply saddened and grieved. I hope you restrain your grief and take care of yourself, so that you can avenge him. I send my condolences and wish you well, Wu Kaixian, Weidong."

### Shot Police Officer Dies of Injuries

On Saturday of last week, a gentleman residing on Huanlong Road was attacked by two thugs in front of his residence, but the attempt failed. At that time, police officer Li Liuru of the French Concession No. 1057, who was nearby, arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and was shot in the back by the thugs. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but his treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital last night (the 7th) due to his injuries. It is heard that the officer was selected for service last year and has not yet completed one year. He died in the line of duty, leaving behind an elderly mother, a weak wife, and a son who is still in diapers. In addition to holding a funeral on a regular basis, the police department has also requested the upper authorities to grant generous compensation to comfort his soul.

### The Japanese Fleet Again Shells Zhenhai, Yidao is Bombed, Zhenhai Refugees Desperately Await Relief, Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route Shows No Progress

According to reliable information from shipping circles in this city, the Japanese fleet outside Zhenhai fired six shells towards Jiangnan yesterday afternoon. The attack was fierce, but the shells landed in the mud, causing no damage. Since the Chinese army completely recovered Zhenhai on the morning of the 22nd of last month, local order has been restored. All government offices have returned to work, transportation has been fully restored, and the Zhenhai branch of the Zhejiang Local Bank has also resumed business. The market is gradually returning to normal. However, small ferries between Ningbo and Zhenhai have not resumed operations because the newly built Meilu dike blocks the river without leaving a gap. The damage from the war is severe both inside and outside the city. Although the shops along the main street are intact, everything inside and outside the West Gate has been reduced to ashes. More than 4,000 houses have been burned down, and residents are displaced, a truly tragic sight. Currently, all sectors of Zhenhai have established a refugee shelter at the Lanpu Temple outside the West Gate, and many soup kitchens have been set up inside the city to provide relief. Because the port of Zhenhai is under surveillance and blockade by the Japanese fleet, resumption of navigation is unlikely in the short term. Given that sailing vessels approaching the Zhenhai blockade are frequently shelled indiscriminately by the Japanese fleet, it seems unlikely that normal traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo can be restored in the short term.

Yidao Bombed with Four Bombs

A telegram from the Ningbo community in Shanghai reports that at 6:48 AM yesterday (the 7th), the sound of engines was heard in the Lingshan area of Yuyao. Three Japanese planes were then spotted over Baiguan, Shaoxing, Zhuji, and after passing over Yidao in Jinhua, they dropped four bombs on the southeastern outskirts of Yidao. After dropping the bombs, the planes returned along the same route.

Investigation of Bombings in Yongjia and Yuyao

Reports concerning the renewed bombing of Yongjia and Yuyao have also been received as follows: On the 6th, Yongjia, the leading county of Wenzhou, and Yuyao, an important town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, were bombed by Japanese planes. An investigation revealed that Japanese planes dropped two bombs on Yongjia and two bombs on Yuyao. One bomb landed near the Jiwei Bridge outside the Houqing Gate. At that time, the market was thriving and ships were setting sail, resulting in two sailing boats being sunk. The Jiwei Bridge was also slightly damaged, and teahouses, taverns, and shops near the bridgehead were destroyed. In this incident, two people were seriously injured and died immediately, and four others were lightly injured and sent to Huijing Hospital for emergency treatment. Another bomb landed outside the Xishui Gate, but did not injure anyone, and no other damage was sustained.

### Chinese Troops Near Suzhou Attack Qimen, Capture Lumu Police Station and Taipingqiao Town

A visitor from Suzhou reported that Chinese mobile troops have recently been very active in the suburbs of Suzhou. On the 28th of last month, the Provincial Security Corps, led by Yang Zhong, ambushed a vehicle of the "Central China Automobile Co., Ltd." in Weijingtang in the northern suburbs, capturing Weng Xuan, an important "official" of the pseudo "Suzhewan Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Suxiangchang District," and a lawyer registered with the pseudo "court." The company commander detained them.

The other dozens of passengers were escorted to the vicinity of the highway to facilitate their return by car. Commander Yang also gave a generous speech to the passengers, explaining the reasons for the inevitable victory in the war of resistance. Furthermore, at the end of last month, the unit attacked the pseudo "police station" in Qimen, Suzhou, and Lumu Town, capturing it for a time. On their way back, they had a small skirmish with the Japanese army, and the highway bridge outside Qimen

was destroyed by bombing.

Yang's unit safely returned to defense after completing its mission. It is also reported that Taipingqiao Town has been captured by the Chinese army, which has built fortifications and is holding it firmly. As for the New Fourth Army's action unit, it is developing rapidly in the Suzhou-Changzhou area, and its action groups are also active within the city of Suzhou. The assassination of the pseudo "County Magistrate" Guo Zengji is believed to be related to the activities of this unit. However, the rumor that the assassin Zhao Qiang has died for the cause cannot be confirmed.

### After Price Controls End, Rice Prices Soar, Coal Briquettes to be Sold at Controlled Prices Again

After the fourth phase of controlled-price foreign rice ended on the 5th, rice merchants resumed their speculative manipulation, causing rice prices to gradually rise again. Yesterday, the market price of Saigon No. 1 increased sharply by 2.2 yuan, and the prices of all other grades also increased by more than one yuan. The reason for this is that after the sale of controlled-price foreign rice was discontinued, purchases by the general public and poor people at rice shops increased sharply. Because of the increased demand, the merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. Although the authorities in the concessions have repeatedly prohibited illegal price increases, the profiteers are blinded by greed and disregard everything. Therefore, the authorities should take strict measures to reduce the burden on the common people.

The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association has decided to hold the eighth phase of controlled-price coal briquette sales and resolved: (1) to sell each five market catties for 0.3 yuan in national currency; (2) to limit each person to a maximum purchase of five market catties per day; (3) to start selling every day from 3:00 PM until supplies are exhausted. As for the date of the controlled-price sales, it was decided according to the previous meeting, starting from the 11th of this month and ending on the 20th, for a period of ten days, and it was internally decided to set up 60 controlled-price selling points in the two concessions. However, the prices of coal briquettes sold at the doors of shops have recently been quite inconsistent, and there may be no determination to suppress prices.

### Heavy Rain on the First Day of Autumn, Roads Flooded to the Shin, High Tide Makes Water Difficult to Recede Quickly

Yesterday was the lunar calendar's first day of autumn. At 5:40 PM, the weather suddenly changed, dark clouds gathered, and a heavy downpour began. The rain was heavier than any seen since the beginning of summer and lasted for two hours before stopping. Low-lying roads throughout the city, such as Jessfield Road, Thibet Road, Connaught Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Guangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Fuzhou Road, Yunnan Road, and the French Concession's Route Massenet, Rue Wagner, Ximen Road, Route Tenant de Tourville, Rue Lupan, Avenue Joffre and other roads

became swamps.

Vehicles traveled on them as if sailing on land, splashing water and causing pedestrians to complain. Among them, the areas around Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession and Route Pueyrredon in the French Concession resembled a wide river. The deepest parts were almost knee-deep. Looking at the Racecourse, it resembled a large lake. At the same time, rickshaw pullers were making ten times their usual profit, charging as much as two yuan per trip.

Sudden High Tide

Furthermore, yesterday coincided with the high autumn tide, so the water on the roads drained very slowly. It has not completely receded by this morning. Yesterday's high tide occurred at 3:45 PM, reaching a height of 10.0 feet, and this morning at 3:59 AM, another high tide reached 10.48 feet.

### Yang Jinrui Escapes After Being Kidnapped, Later Receives Threatening Letter Originated From a Dismissed Apprentice

Yang Jinrui, a Puxi native and owner of the Jin Tai Fashion Company at 301 Tongfu Road, was kidnapped by seven armed bandits at 11:50 AM on July 16th of this year. However, on July 18th, while being held in a shed on Route Cardinal Mercier in western Shanghai, Yang, while the kidnappers were asleep,

secretly escaped,

notified a patrolling policeman, who took Yang to the police station and escorted him home. Unexpectedly, several days later, Yang suddenly received a threatening letter signed "Lu Lin, Deputy Squad Leader of the West Shanghai Special Task Force." The letter stated that Yang should not have escaped on his own and that this letter was a warning, demanding that he contact Manager Yu at the Chinese New Musical Instrument Factory at 1234 Jing'an Temple Road within three days, or his life

would be in great danger.

After Yang reported to the police station, they ordered an investigation at the Chinese factory, where Manager Yu Yapei said that the handwriting on the letter was similar to that of Liu Yongsheng, a worker from Shandong who had been laid off from the factory. On July 31st, Liu was arrested at Route Foch and Weihaiwei Road, taken to the police station, and sent to the court for questioning and detention. Liu's handwriting was sent to the Public Works Department

handwriting expert

Mei for verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the criminal court to hear the case. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted on charges of kidnapping and demanding ransom, stating that, according to the handwriting expert's report, there were many similarities between the letter and the defendant's handwriting, confirming that the letter was written by the defendant. Moreover, Song Renfu and Lu Yuping, employees of the Jin Tai Fashion Company, testified that the defendant was present when the owner was kidnapped, and that the owner

had gone to Puxi.

When questioned, the defendant denied everything, claiming innocence and hiring lawyer Wang Xiubo to defend him. Police lawyer Li Zhishan argued that the nature of the case was serious and that the victim should be summoned to court for identification to finalize the verdict. Judge Fu ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days and summoned Yang Jinrui to court for further verification.

### Japanese Military Truck Crashes into Tram, Flees After Causing Accident

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, at 11:15 AM today (the 8th), a Japanese military truck, registration number 1724, disregarded traffic signals on Jing'an Temple Road near the Racecourse, causing it to collide with Tram No. 74 on Route No. 2. The tram door was damaged, and there was other minor damage. A Chinese policeman who witnessed the incident arrived at the scene and attempted to question the Japanese driver of the truck. However, the Japanese driver forced the Chinese policeman to give way and drove west along Jing'an Temple Road.

### Unseasonal Weather, Rampant Seasonal Diseases, True Cholera Cases Continue to be Discovered, Residents Should Pay Attention to Health Preservation

Since its opening, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has been crowded with patients seeking treatment. Yesterday, the number reached 675, and the doctors in the hospital were overwhelmed. Among the patients, in addition to cholera, various gastrointestinal inflammations were rampant. However, after being admitted to the hospital for treatment, their conditions improved significantly. Since the beginning of summer, the hospital has admitted patients, and as of yesterday, the number of confirmed true cholera cases by the Public Works Department's Health Bureau has reached 110. In addition, the hospital has admitted 146 patients with common seasonal diseases, reaching full capacity. According to Deng Qingshan, the medical director of the hospital, the reasons for the sudden surge in seasonal diseases are unseasonal weather and residents' carelessness in their diet. Now that autumn is approaching, various seasonal diseases will become more active, and residents should pay close attention to health preservation and take appropriate precautions. The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, jointly sponsored by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society at 730 Rue de Consulat, is a completely charitable organization that provides registered outpatient and inpatient services, with all consultation and medicine fees waived. The number of patients seeking treatment is around 300 to 400 per day, so the original 200 beds are not enough, and efforts are being made to expand the facilities. According to Dr. Tong Zhiqing, the medical director of the hospital, since the opening of the hospital last month to the 5th of this month, a total of more than 4,000 patients have been treated, most of whom have gastrointestinal diseases and dysentery. However, the number of true cholera cases confirmed by the Public Works Department's Health Bureau has reached 9. In the past two nights, there have been more than 20 cholera patients, and their stool samples are still being tested by the Public Works Department, so there may be a possibility of further spread. It is hoped that residents in the area will pay attention to summer hygiene. The hospital also provides free vaccinations for prevention. It is reported that the funds are being raised from the new pharmaceutical industry by the hospital's director Xu Xiaochu and deputy directors Xu Xiangsun, Yuan Hesong, Gao Peiliang, Xu Guanqun, and others, who are enthusiastic about charity, truly a blessing for the poor and sick.

### Killing Wife's Younger Brother Over Trivial Matter of Catching Bedbugs, Sentenced to Imprisonment, Seven-Year Sentence After Interrogation

Min Gengquan, a local resident who works as an advertisement painter, had a quarrel with his wife's younger brother, Xia Changsheng, over the trivial matter of catching bedbugs at the beginning of last month. Min stabbed Xia in the abdomen with a piece of broken glass used to scrape bedbugs, causing his intestines to spill out, resulting in death. Min was arrested by neighbors and sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for intentional injury resulting in death. Chief Judge Liao presided over the trial, and the verdict was delivered yesterday morning. Min Gengquan was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for intentional injury resulting in death, and the murder weapon, a piece of broken glass, was confiscated.

### Robbing a Policeman of His Gun, Two Defendants Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment Each

Lu Xiangsheng, a local resident residing at 16 Jinyu Lane, Rue Minti, was a Chinese policeman No. 542 in the French Concession. At 8:00 PM on the 23rd of last month, he was walking with his girlfriend past the Slaughterhouse on Rue Pissot, when two hoodlums, Wang Yulin and Zhou Quanbao, stopped them and attempted to snatch Lu's pocket watch. Lu resisted, and a fight broke out between the two sides. Lu was outnumbered and shouted for help. Vietnamese policeman No. 701 heard the cries and stepped forward to take Song and Zhou to the police station. Song and his accomplices then incited their companions to surround the Vietnamese policeman and try to rob him of his gun. Fortunately, a passerby telegraphed the police station, and Detective Qin Bichang rushed to the scene and arrested Song and Zhou. The other defendants are on the run and were jointly sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for prosecution on charges of robbery. The case was tried by Judge Sun yesterday morning, and Song Yulin and Zhou Quanbao, both repeat offenders, were sentenced to two years of imprisonment each for using violence and coercion to force others to hand over property.

According to the clerk, he is currently unemployed, so he collects stolen gasoline to make a living. Ten barrels of gasoline can earn a profit of 165 yuan, and then he distributes the profit equally with the car drivers according to the amount of gasoline they supply. The company's holder escaped when he heard the news. The police found an account book on the spot, recording the car numbers of the transactions.

### Guangxi Province Strives for Self-Sufficiency in Educational Supplies, Expands Supplies Manufacturing Plant to Meet the Needs of the Entire Province

(Guilin Correspondent) The Guangxi Provincial Government believes that most Chinese educational supplies come from foreign countries. After the war of resistance, due to traffic disruptions, sources were lacking, and prices were high, making purchases difficult. To achieve self-sufficiency, the Guangxi Provincial Science Experiment Museum was transformed into the Guangxi Provincial Educational Supplies Manufacturing Plant in March of last year. It is located in Tiandong and uses local raw materials to manufacture various educational supplies. In the past year, the products have included specimens, models, plaster portraits, children's toys, and daily stationery. The goods are of high quality, and the prices are lower than imported products. However, because the products are made by hand, large-scale production is not possible, resulting in insufficient supply. To meet supply and demand, it was decided to expand the plant and use machinery to produce some of the products. It is planned that starting from the next academic year, all educational supplies and instruments for primary and secondary schools in the province will be supplied by the plant to enrich them. All daily stationery required by various agencies in the province will also be supplied by the plant.

### Unified Enrollment, Exam Situation in Meixian, More Than 300 Examinees, More Than 200 Disqualified

(Xingning Correspondent) This year's unified enrollment for public colleges and universities has a branch in Meixian, which is convenient for students in the eastern Guangdong Han River area and the Fujian-Jiangxi border area. Therefore, those who went to register for the exam were extremely enthusiastic, reaching more than 500 people. However, because some students' graduation certificates indicated that they had studied in the senior high school department for three years, but had not obtained a certificate for more than a year; others had graduated for two years, but still had not obtained a certificate, and the school authorities falsely certified that they were graduating this year; some only had certificates issued by the school, but without the school seal and the principal's signature, but only the seal of the dean of academic affairs. After the examination committee reviewed and found them unqualified, they were not allowed to register. Therefore, only 332 people were able to obtain registration qualifications and have completed the examination on July 23. The remaining more than 300 students who did not obtain registration qualifications are awaiting other arrangements. According to Director Li Baihua, the details of the enrollment process will be reported to the authorities, and schools that indiscriminately recruit students for profit will also be asked to be rectified to prevent future problems and serve as a warning to others. Although there were many examinees this time, most of the students' test papers were not satisfactory. The quality of education needs to be improved urgently. Those responsible for education should pay attention at all times, and students in school should also work hard in time.

### Children's Education Institute Strives to Nurture Refugee Children, Each Institute Accommodates More Than 4,400 People

(Shaoguan Telegram) The Guangdong Provincial Children's Education Institute is making rapid progress in accommodating and nurturing refugee children from war zones. A reporter recently visited the person in charge of the institute, who said that the number of children in the institute is as follows: 962 in the first institute, 1,531 in the second institute, 1,125 in the third institute, 285 in the fourth institute, and 625 in the fifth institute, totaling 4,628 people. The children who first came to the institutes were mostly suffering from diseases and had bad habits. Starting the nurturing process was extremely difficult, but through the efforts of enthusiastic staff members, various tasks have gradually taken shape. The most obvious result is that the children in the institutes have become stronger, the mortality rate has gradually been eliminated, and bad habits have been completely corrected, gradually transforming them into well-disciplined and excellent children. The guiding principle of rescue education in the institute is to enable children to acquire the minimum necessary production skills, so special emphasis is placed on production education. The established classes include agriculture, agronomy, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, and industry, including weaving straw sandals, sewing, and other small industries. The monthly cost for each child is 12 yuan. Due to high prices, this is greatly insufficient.

### Gold Market Rise Is Sharp, Yesterday Breaking the 5,700 Yuan Mark, Many Outside the Industry Bought for Collection

Yesterday, the spot gold black market rose sharply, exceeding the 5,700 yuan mark. The market sentiment was exceptionally firm. In addition to bullish traders, there were many outside the industry secretly commissioning purchases for collection. After the rise, every setback was due to profit-taking by short-term traders. The market opened at 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, banks and gold shops bought in, and a certain currency exchange business covered its short positions, pushing the price up to 5,715 yuan. Before long, due to profit-taking sales by banks and other parties, and the currency exchange business subsequently reversed its position, the price fell back to 5,660 yuan. Before the close, gold shops alone snapped up gold, raising the price to 5,720 yuan. Although there was a slight retreat after the purchase, the market closed at 5,695 yuan. Market sentiment remained positive, and securities firms and gold shops bought again, pushing the price from the opening price of 5,705 yuan to 5,730 yuan. The closing price was suppressed by bank sales, but it was still 5,718 yuan, an increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume was strong, totaling approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was priced 10 yuan higher, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Rises Again by 68 Yuan

Since the start of the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) was raised by 30 yuan due to the tight exchange market. Securities firms sold 30 taels at 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, due to aggressive buying by both gold and silver firms, and a certain currency exchange business covering its short positions, and the continued healthy demand from Hong Kong firms, the price was pushed up by another 40 yuan. Securities firms traded 20 taels among themselves, raising the price to 5,720 yuan. Suddenly, a certain currency exchange business switched from buying to selling, and the foreign exchange rate strengthened, causing long-term traders to take profits. Securities firms, banks, and currency exchange businesses sold heavily. Although gold firms still bought in from time to time, the price was ultimately suppressed by selling pressure, falling to a low of 5,660 yuan. At that time, the amount of short-term selling decreased, and gold firms still had a strong appetite for buying, so the price reached the 5,700 yuan mark before the close, but the closing price was 5,695 yuan. The underlying trend was initially flat, then firm. Transactions were seen at 5,705 yuan. In the afternoon, securities firms first bought 10 taels from banks at 5,705 yuan, and banks traded 10 taels among themselves, retreating to 5,700 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms and securities firms bought in successively, gradually increasing the price by 30 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to gold firms, raising the price to 5,730 yuan. After that purchase, banks sold continuously, so the closing price retreated to 5,718 yuan, an increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the market showed some weakness due to the slightly stronger foreign exchange rate. The last transaction was at 5,690 yuan. The price fluctuated by 70 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was lowered by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few open transactions.

Jewelry Gold Prices Increased by Ten Yuan

### Hong Kong Dollar Notes Exceed 4 Yuan, Industry Agrees to Trade Large and Small US Dollar Notes Together

After currency exchange businesses learned that counterfeit 100 US dollar notes had been discovered in Hong Kong, some businesses refused to accept these large notes as a precaution, causing concern among those holding them. The industry also felt inconvenienced. Therefore, industry members convened a meeting to discuss the matter. It was agreed that all transactions would be allowed to trade large and small notes together. This measure is relatively appropriate, and public confidence can be slightly restored. At the same time, the circulation of funds will not be affected. Therefore, the market price should not change suddenly. As for yesterday's market conditions, spot gold rose to exceed the 700 yuan mark, and the British pound and US dollar also rose by 1.5 yuan. However, after the closing, as the gold price fell below 700 yuan, sentiment was particularly weak. Demand for British pound notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 0.3 yuan. The US dollar note once reached a high of 18.1 yuan, and was 18.05 yuan at 3:30 PM. After 3:30 PM, it was suddenly reported that a certain bank in the black market had sold spot US dollars at 5.5625 yuan, causing a sudden drop in confidence, and the price fell back into the 18 yuan mark. The final price was 17.95 yuan, still an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the price exceeded the 4 yuan mark. The trend of Japanese yen notes remained positive, and the evening market was 1.325 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.095 yuan.

### London Silver Prices Rose for Both Near and Far Terms, Indian Silver Also Rose by 4 Annas

The market was flat, with a total of 50 contracts traded.

### Discount Rate and Interbank Lending Rate Both Decline Slightly

Yesterday's bill discount rate declined slightly. In the morning, the discount rate was 47 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and the borrowing rate was 49 yuan. In the afternoon, it retreated to 48 yuan, and the discount rate was 46 yuan, down 1 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Currency Exchange Association suddenly decreased by 0.02 yuan. The morning and afternoon rates were both 0.15 yuan.

### Silver Reserve Association Reduces Exchange Clearing Interest Rates Again

### Food: Large Amounts of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive in Shanghai, Prices Continue to Be Manipulated and Rise, Japanese Merchants Transport New Wuhu Xian Rice to Port

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Wah Lun Shipping Company's vessel "Gelan" arrived directly from Siam with 26,018 bags at around 3 PM yesterday, docking at Wharf 15 on Renji Road to unload. Another Norwegian merchant vessel, the "Foch," arrived in Shanghai at around 7 AM yesterday, reportedly carrying a large shipment of foreign rice from Saigon, totaling over 20,000 bags, docking at the Longmao Pier in Pudong to unload. In addition, the "Kendi" (transliteration) vessel, managed by a French company, also arrived directly from Saigon with a very large shipment of foreign rice, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. (Zu)

Since the foreign rice market tightened again after the previous setback, the market opened positively yesterday. Local shops actively sold to inland merchants, and speculative traders were generally excited, absorbing short positions and taking profits at high prices in endless succession. As a result, prices rose by more than 0.5 yuan in the morning due to mutual speculation. Afterwards, the prices continued to rise higher, flying all the way up, and all prices rose by around 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. The price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was 59.5 yuan, No. 2 was 54.5 yuan. The prices of original-packaged re-exported goods were especially volatile, with B merchants and re-export traders actively trading. The asking price for re-exported No. 2 Saigon rice opened at 64.5 yuan, then rose to 64.9 yuan. The asking price for imported rice also rose from 64 yuan to 64.56 yuan. The asking price for re-exported No. 2 Siamese rice once rose to 65 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the selling price the day before. Saigon broken rice also reached 52.8 yuan. The market seemed to have the expectation of gaining a foothold. However, after the prices rose to high levels, actual sales were sluggish, and many long positions were sold off. The price of original-packaged Saigon and Siamese rice immediately fell to 64 yuan, and the asking price for imported mixed-grade rice was 63.5 yuan, but there were few buyers. However, both buying and selling were active, totaling over 500 tons. The price of spot rice initially rose, then fell, ultimately rising by about 1 yuan. Transactions totaled 8-9,000 bags, mostly by grain shops to fulfill orders from Japanese merchants for re-export to Shantou, Xiamen, and Nanjing.

New crops of Ke Xian rice have already appeared in the production areas, and they may be transported to Shanghai in the future. 2,200 bags of Anhui Wuhu Xian rice arrived yesterday, priced at 50 yuan to 48.5 yuan, slightly lower than the previous market by 1-2 yuan.

The arrival of glutinous rice was scarce, and sales remained broad, so the market was relatively positive. The price increased by 0.5 yuan. The asking price for Jinli premium glutinous rice was 62.5 yuan, 62 yuan, and Changdan glutinous rice was around 60 yuan, 59 yuan. The asking price for Hong Kong white premium glutinous rice was 61.5 yuan to 61 yuan, and Zhongguan was 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan.

6-700 bags of thick and thin japonica rice arrived yesterday. It was rumored that the off-market black market continued to follow the tight foreign rice market, and the price increased by 1 yuan. The asking price for premium fresh Chang-grade japonica rice was 69.5 yuan, 69 yuan, Wuxi fresh japonica rice was 67-68 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica rice was 66-67 yuan, second-grade was 64 yuan, and the asking price for thin rice was only 54.5 yuan, 54 yuan for old crops. Nangang early rice was 65-66 yuan, and per bushel was 51-52 yuan, and Jiangbei Kejian was 50 yuan.

Only 15 dan of new Zhoupu japonica rice were on the market, and due to the fresh goods, many shops used them, and they were quickly sold. However, the price had already been raised, and it was difficult to raise it further, remaining at 63 yuan.

### Securities - Domestic Bonds Continue to Fall, Wheelock Declares Dividend of Five Yuan

Share Market Dark Trading: Yesterday's market continued to decline. Although there was much short covering, both short sellers and long position closers were quite active. This was due to the sudden tension in Vietnam and the continued sharp rise in gold prices, which made people feel uneasy. Prices of Type A and E shares fell the most, because it was known that there were many receivers of Type A shares on the floor, who followed the trend and immediately disposed of their holdings when the market price fluctuated slightly, thus leading to small drops. Type B shares, on the other hand, did not show any trading throughout the day, indicating a stalemate between the two sides. Yesterday morning, Twelve and Sixteen sold Type A shares, and Hengfu sold Type C shares most actively. Jiufeng, Xinchang, and Wutai slightly covered their short positions, while the rest had sporadic transactions, which were also quite lively. In the afternoon, Yongkang bought Type C and sold Type A, Yuan Yu took in a significant amount of Type C, Gong Mao absorbed Type E, and Zhongyi and Hongda took advantage of the low prices to buy Type A. Hengfu, Lianyi, Chengkang, etc. sold a significant amount of Type C. The market fluctuated greatly in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon. As a result, except for Type B shares, which did not have any initial transactions, all other shares declined by a small amount, ranging from two to four jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock Trading: Thirty shares of China Banking Corporation were traded at a price of thirteen yuan.

Yesterday, the public utilities stock market was very stable, with many transactions and no significant price declines. Wheelock & Co. announced a dividend of five yuan per share for the previous term, which will be paid on August 30th. This seems to be quite attractive to general investors, so the price of the stock has been rising continuously. Due to the rise in Wheelock's stock, the shares of various trust companies have also become extraordinarily stable. Rubber shares are quiet, but the underlying trend is firm.

London, July 7th (Wednesday) Electric Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of British companies in the Far East were all calm, with no changes in the market.

Wheelock & Co., Ltd. will hold its ninth annual shareholders' meeting on August 30th to report on the business situation for the year ending March 1940, distribute the final dividend of five yuan per share in national currency, and re-elect directors and amend the articles of association.

### Yarn and Cotton - Large Investors Sell at High Prices, Cotton Yarn Chits - Increasingly Abundant

The yarn market started rising but then weakened, showing a sign of softening. Foreign exchange is still tight, and yarn prices have failed to track upwards. This is due to sluggish actual transactions and poor transportation from all sides, which has led to scattered morale. Moreover, many veteran players, seeing the situation as not strong, are instead selling off. The biggest reason for the recent weakness in the yarn market is that tea factories are selling on the market, making the floor looser. Although the majority are bullish, abundant chits are putting heavy pressure.

The yarn market opened this morning with a favorable mood among retail investors due to the continued contraction of foreign exchange, and buying interest was strong. Twenty-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1,020 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as this price was announced, certain firms rushed to sell their holdings. Although the bulls struggled to resist, the floor had already loosened. Small investors could not compete with large investors. Although gold is expensive, cotton yarn still cannot rise. The closing price was 1,014 yuan, but all subsequent floating profits were closed, gradually falling to 1,008 yuan. It is estimated that 2,020 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was about the same as the previous day. Today, 245 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 51 bales to Haikou. The quantities bought by various groups are listed below:

### Cotton Mill Demand - Gradually Becoming Active

Trading in spot cotton remains good. Various Chinese and foreign factories are gradually becoming active in purchasing, so people are somewhat more at ease. However, payments are all delayed by one to two months. Today, 85 bales of cotton were shipped to Haikou. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:

Yesterday, 1,000 bales of American cotton arrived in Shanghai on the Aquerius, a ship managed by the American President Lines. The ship entered the port the night before and docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning.

### Oil Market - Cooking Oil Continues to Rise

Yesterday's cooking oil market saw a generally optimistic attitude in the market. This was due to stable production prices, delayed sources, and the excitement caused by the rising gold price. As a result, prices rose by two to three yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions included 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 65.5 to 66.5 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil at 65.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 93.4 yuan, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 68.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at 70 yuan, 180 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at 94 to 96 yuan, 150 barrels of Dalian oil at 95.5 to 97 yuan, and 3,150 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil at 75.5 to 76 yuan.

### Proposal to Rebuild the Lian Lake in Danyang

Famous scenic spots throughout the country, whether a stream, a tree, a pavilion, or a platform, contemporary notables and prominent figures invariably desire to revive what has been abandoned and replenish what is lacking, in order to provide for leisurely contemplation and enhance the pleasure of sightseeing. How much more so when it is greatly beneficial to the people? The Lian Lake in Danyang stretches for dozens of miles and has four sluices for storing water to aid in the transport of tribute grain. It also has nine culverts for diverting water to irrigate fields. In times of drought, it provides sustenance to alleviate the hunger of the people, and in times of flood, it provides fish and seafood to relieve the poverty of the people. Its importance to the national economy and the welfare of the people is not like the Sacred Lake of Wulin, which merely possesses the beauty of mountains and waters, or the Yuan Lake of Zhuli, which serves only for the enjoyment of scholars. Within it, there are islands and pavilions suitable for singing and resting. The pavilion is dedicated to General Liu Meng, for his control of locusts. Since the wars, the pavilions have been destroyed and are overgrown with weeds, causing all who see them to lament the changes of the past. At the beginning of this month, local residents Mr. Lin Ziwan, Mr. Pan Xingu, Mr. Jiang Youtang, and Mr. He Runsheng toured the lake. The so-called Lake Pavilion consisted only of six dilapidated paper-covered rooms, not only with openings on all sides but also unable to provide shelter from rain and snow, truly causing sighs! Moreover, the work of dredging the lake has been neglected for a long time. In the future, if the lake is needed but unable to function effectively, how can it be blamed on the lake? County Magistrate Commander Gong is attentive to important matters of governance, and the people all appreciate him. If he can muster his remaining strength to revitalize the lake and restore its former state, his effort of one day will benefit the people for a hundred years. The people of this region are all watching and hoping for it!

Commentary

### Regarding "The Happiness of Apprentices"

— Editor

In three days, we received forty letters from apprentices. More than half of them seem to have only attended school for one or two years (mainly in rural private schools), and the rest are not much higher than elementary school level. However, their thirst for knowledge is equally strong.

We are very happy that they wrote many articles about apprentices, and even happier that this issue has attracted the attention of the apprentices themselves. However, due to space constraints, we cannot publish all the letters.

At the same time, Mr. Cao Lingyou also sent a letter: After reading the articles "Regarding the Happiness of Apprentices" and "After Reading The Happiness of Apprentices" on August 5th, I am very grateful to Mr. Shi Wei and Mr. Ding Ren for their kind criticisms and corrections to my humble work "The Happiness of Apprentices." However, I cannot help but say a few more words here. I wrote "The Happiness of Apprentices" entirely because I saw an article discussing apprentices, which said that apprentices are mostly depressed, selfish, and self-interested. Therefore, I wrote "The Happiness of Apprentices" with good intentions to encourage apprentices in general to know where to strive and where to work hard.

I am not only happy that my own articles have received criticism and gained progress. I am even happier for the tens of thousands of apprentices because this issue has attracted widespread attention.

Now we want to temporarily end this issue because Mr. Ding Ren and Mr. Shi Wei have already made very strong appeals in their articles for improving the lives of apprentices and how to seek the true happiness of apprentices. However, we still welcome discoveries from theory to practice.

### By the Side of the Old Zha Gate Bridge

— Ju Ju

This kind of thing may not be rare. Because I have been going in and out for several years, I see this kind of thing almost every day. There are certainly many pedestrians who often walk through the Old Zha Gate Bridge on Beijing Road, so their feelings may be even more profound than mine.

The things that happen in this area are—theft and robbery. Suppose it is morning. Look: housewives, maids, and mess cooks, are crowding into and out of this noisy vegetable market shoulder to shoulder. In their baskets, some place fish and meat, vegetables, and others chicken eggs and salted fish. The vegetable market is full of noise, and the outside is chaotic. Therefore, people buying vegetables, whether going in or out, have difficulty guarding against the group of thieves.

The three young bums in the crowd over there whispered for a while, and then another one tiptoed forward. A middle-aged woman was walking in front, with dishes in her basket that did not make him happy. He followed for a few steps, and suddenly reached out and a piece of meat was silently taken into his hand. As soon as he said it, he quickly turned around, with a slight look of panic on his face, and regardless of whether the other party chased him or had not yet noticed, he had already run away.

The pedestrians on the side smiled knowingly, watching the agile thief disappear from the crowd. And in front, the woman carrying the basket of lost meat was still walking slowly, unaware, and the pedestrians laughed again. This group of old and young, and female thieves, are constantly wandering there. They are working alone or together. Their hunger is maintained by this work.

A few hours after the vegetable market has settled, this place begins to squirm again. Large trucks, wheelbarrows, and vegetable vendors carrying vegetables, meat, and fish on their shoulders come in droves, which gives you another opportunity to see them acting.

A young thief with long hair closely followed a large truck. He ran hundreds of yards without discouragement, and finally the truck braked because there was an obstacle in front. Immediately, like an athlete in the final minute, he forcefully pulled at the accumulated target, got it, immediately stepped on the gas and ran away.

A rickshaw stopped in the crowd of vegetable vendors. The rural vegetable vendor sitting in the rickshaw untied the vegetables hanging behind, and found that the opening of the bag had been torn and a third of the vegetables were missing.

Old men and old women vegetable vendors are their best targets. They sometimes grab large cabbages, wild rice stems, lotus roots, etc., and sometimes cotton, melons, iron bars, etc., as their trophies. They hold the purpose of taking whatever they can, regardless of cars driving by, regardless of the sticks waved by the guards on the trucks, and ignoring the insults of the vegetable vendors. They do this year after year, season after season, living their lives.

This kind of thing is really too common, but every time I see it, I still hope that it will not be as common as it is now. The minimum hope is to turn the common thing into "rare."

### Little Sanzi and Master Wang

— Yu Yu

Little Sanzi has no relatives and no home. He has been living at the entrance of our alley for almost three months.

Alone, he goes to the newspaper office every morning and evening to wait for the newspapers. After receiving the newspapers, he returns to the alley to distribute them to the residents. This is how he maintains his life.

The residents of the alley always say, "Send it to Little Sanzi at the alley entrance" whenever they have leftover food, because people remember Little Sanzi like that, because Little Sanzi has none of the wildness of a street urchin.

But Little Sanzi was finally driven away by Master Wang. Master Wang is the big landlord in our village. He himself lives in this village. He usually goes in and out in a very extravagant manner, with bodyguards and a car. But for some reason, Master Wang recently dismissed the bodyguards and the chauffeur and started walking in and out. (Many people say that he is practicing a new life, but others say that Master Wang's "business" has been losing money lately.)

Little Sanzi had bad luck because Master Wang was walking. Because that day, when Master Wang walked into the alley panting from the speculative market, he saw Little Sanzi's torn mat and iron can containing a lot of smelly things at the entrance of the alley. So he roared at the watchman:

"Damn it, what are you in charge of? How did this kind of stinky thing get brought in by this bum?"

His tone was very fierce, and the watchman bowed his head and responded obsequiously.

"I don't allow bums to enter my alley! Look how filthy this is! If this happens again next time, you can get out yourself!"

Little Sanzi pouted and didn't dare to say a word. He just dragged his torn mat and other things out of the alley. Master Wang stroked his mustache, glared fiercely at the watchman, and then strode inside.

The next day, Little Sanzi was still holding a stack of newspapers and distributing them to each household, but after finishing the distribution, he quickly slipped out of the alley. People outside the alley asked him where he had stayed last night, and he said he had stayed on the cement road of a foreign house.

Some people said: Master Wang used to drive in and out, so he didn't pay attention to the bum Little Sanzi at the entrance of the alley. Now that he is running around on his own feet, he has become sharp-eyed. In fact, Master Wang wouldn't have missed this filthy little bum even when he was in the car, but at that time his nerves didn't care about these trivial matters.

So Little Sanzi's expulsion seems to be Little Sanzi's misfortune, but it is actually more unfortunate for Master Wang.

### Scaring and Defrauding Younger Brother

—

Qian Chunsong colluded with others to scare and defraud his younger brother by posting a notice demanding rent on the outside of the Dafeng Company. He was arrested after the matter was exposed. A poem:

Fratricide has been lamented since ancient times,
Even external enemies can be resisted in one battle.
Today, people's hearts have really changed greatly,
The notice demanding rent is posted on the wall of the Dafeng Company.

### Wait a Little Longer Before Leaving

— Mo Leng

To the students who came south from the former capital: Indeed, at a time when our country still attaches considerable importance to admission qualifications, it is indeed inconvenient for you in various ways, but from the situation you described, it does not seem to be a hopeless situation. It is just a question of whether there are other effective methods. Therefore, I firmly ask you to wait a little longer before leaving.

Have you tried the following methods?

1.  The Ministry of Education stipulates methods for those with equivalent academic ability. I believe you can at least prove that you have equivalent academic ability.

2.  Request to be a probationary student and participate in the screening test in the future (this method is stipulated by the Ministry of Education this year).

3.  Tell the person in charge of the school about your difficulties and ask them to temporarily accept you and submit it to the Ministry of Education for remedial measures.

4.  Directly request relief from the educational authorities.

5.  Temporarily enter universities such as Shengde and Han, and gradually seek to transfer schools.

Finally, I hope you have not left yet.

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 5: Bad News

As the elevator slowly ascended, Hawthorne pressed the bell on the steel door and turned back to the window. I saw that his face was somber, his brows furrowed, and his eyes stared out at the densely arranged rooftops of various heights outside the window. He reached into his pocket to pull out his cigarette case.

I leaned my elbow on the window sill and took the opportunity to ask, "Hawthorne, I think that girlfriend who stayed here for two nights, is she Wang Lilan?"

Hawthorne was still staring at the rooftops bathed in sunlight and nodded, "Of course, there is no doubt about that—but there is one thing I really don't understand."

I hurriedly asked, "What is it?—Is it worth your frowning and pondering like this?"

Hawthorne slowly replied, "Why did Wang Lilan come here to spend the night?"

I couldn't help but burst out laughing, "Do you need to spend time guessing about this? They naturally have their relationship—no, to put it bluntly, this cannot be considered a relationship. It is clearly for a kind of simple and shameless carnal desire."

Hawthorne shook the hand holding the cigarette. "That's not it, you misunderstood. Why didn't she let Zhao Boxiong stay in her own home? Since that Mr. Lu is very permissive of women and can openly spend the night at her home, why is she so particular about this Mr. Zhao?"

I thought for a while and of course couldn't come up with a reasonable answer, so I vaguely said, "Maybe it's a kind of special relationship that is viewed differently."

This explanation of course didn't satisfy Hawthorne. He puffed on his cigarette in silence. At this time, the elevator rose to the seventh floor, the steel door opened, and two male guests came out. Hawthorne glanced at them and then turned back to look out the window. The elevator continued to rise.

I said again, "Zhao Boxiong came back in the rain last night around one o'clock. In terms of time, he has a close relationship with the murder. After returning, he hurried off again. Can you admit that his suspicion is the heaviest?" (70)

Entertainment World

### The Patriotic Zeal of British Stars

— Yong Shun

Considering them, shouldn't we feel ashamed!

Since the war between Britain and Germany, British stars in Hollywood have been mindful of their homeland. As long as it is something that benefits their homeland, they do their best. Now, let's briefly describe their recent activities:

Colemen, Errol Flynn, and others recently formed the "British Army Service of Hollywood," whose main task is to raise medical supplies, etc. Colemen serves as the captain and engages in activities. French star Charles Boyer is also an honorary member of the team in the capacity of friendship.

Lee J. Cobb and Louis Hayward are within the age range for military service stipulated by the British government (21 to 31 years old), so both of them will return home after completing their new films.

Victor McLaglen, who is very fond of children, has funded the establishment of the "McLaglen Children's Club" and is now planning to expand it greatly in order to accommodate some of the refugee children from Britain, providing them with appropriate education and entertainment.

Cary Grant will also donate all of his 150,000 yuan in compensation from his new Universal film to refugee children from Britain.

Horror star Karloff also telegraphed the authorities, volunteering to bear the expenses for sixty refugee children to go to Canada.

Freddie Bartholomew is determined to join the army, but because he is too young, he has not been allowed to, so he has to stay at home and study books related to military affairs.

Basil Rathbone, Charles Laughton, Lee Silian Howard, etc., have also donated their salaries or designated them for refugee relief or for the treatment of wounded soldiers to show that they are not lagging behind in saving the country.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Listening to Opera

— Yu Chu

On the fourth of the month, Mao Shilai performed the "Article Meeting" and "Stabbing Ba Jie." I drove to watch. When I arrived at the theater, "Hanging the Seal and Sealing Gold" was already on stage. Little San Mazi's red student, is considered one of the best in the South with Lin Shusen. The two artists have their own strengths. Lin is good at singing, but his stage presence is slightly inferior to Little San Mazi. Unfortunately, the running horses and circling the stage in this play were all omitted. Only in the arrival scene and the farewell to Cao, there were a few movements and poses, but they were already extremely beautiful. Cheng Shaoyu is originally a skilled martial clown, but now he plays Cao Cao, directly imitating a maid learning from her mistress, not daring to look directly at him. Following was Wang Zhongchen's "Baisuitan." This play is a laborious play for short-hitting martial students, and now Gai Jiaotian is the best at it. From the self-curse hall onwards that day, when the eleventh son went on stage in the fourth scene, his appearance was still handsome. His dialogue cannot be compared with the northern Yang school martial students such as Gao Shenglin and Wu Yanheng. The baton dance and kicking belt all showed skill. The fight with the Blue-Faced Tiger should have been fierce and compact, without involving chaos. The fight that day was not exciting. Following was Chen Shaolin's "Selling the Horse." This play is regarded as a daunting task by amateur performers, because Qin Qiong's hands and horse-hoof sleeves are turned up, and there are no water sleeves to cover them, so they feel awkward and uneasy about where to put their hands. The shopkeeper's eastern section should be sung in a quiet and melancholic way, full of charm. At that time, Qin Qiong was ill and in distress, so he should not sing loudly, which would not conform to the plot. Shaolin sang this section without any flaws, but the breath was uneven. It was okay when it was high, but almost inaudible when it was low. "Article Meeting" is a playful comedy. The scene is too scattered and loose. The scene where the young master and the servant both suffer from lovesickness is laughable. Mao Shilai's Ping'er only has a section of the "Moonlight, Flower Shadows Shine on the Gauze Window" tune, and his voice is clear and bright, which is indeed much improved compared to his last visit to Shanghai. Therefore, this time he can perform the entire "Jade Hall Spring" and "Fourth Son Visiting His Mother." The closing act was "Stabbing Ba Jie." Shilai's Ma Jinding is indeed not weak in martial arts. She hit the iron threshold twice in a row, and the flying leaves were clean and neat, but sometimes it seemed too casual. Chen Shaolin's first part, Luo Hongxun, from the second yellow shake board in the store to the four sentences "Sitting in the recruitment store, tears are rolling down," the singing was resonant and smooth, which was the greatest gain from listening to the opera that day. His appearance with a beard is also better. The second part, Luo Hongzhu, was Wang Zhongchen, with only one fighting scene. Ai Shiju's Hu Li is just right for his role. His short steps and knife jumping over the iron threshold are extremely agile. He is a talented martial clown. Yuan Shihai's Bao Si'an has few scenes and could not show his strengths.

### Chaplin Photo Worth Millions

— Ming

Life magazine publishes Chaplin's photo without authorization - the verdict adopts a compromise

The sixth work of the comedy master Chaplin, titled "The Great Dictator," has been in production for years, and people are eagerly waiting for it. Now news has come that this film, which is about to cause a sensation in the world, is ready to be released soon.

Chaplin himself is keeping the film a secret, but a long time ago, news has been revealed that the content of "The Great Dictator" is that Chaplin plays both a prisoner detained in a concentration camp and his leader. Because of their similar appearance and small mustaches, somehow the prisoner and the leader become unrecognizable. Originally a prisoner, he actually became the leader, while the real leader was detained in a concentration camp.

The world has a general impression of the outline of the story of "The Great Dictator," but it is a pity that no one has seen a photo of Chaplin playing the leader Hitler. Until last month, the editors of the American "Life" pictorial weekly used all means to find Chaplin's precious photo of playing Hitler. In this photo, Chaplin is wearing a uniform, with a tall and majestic hat, and the national emblem on the hat is two diagonal cross shapes. The editors of "Life" weekly wrote a letter to notify Chaplin on the one hand and published the photo on the other hand, but unexpectedly, a major event occurred.

It turned out that two days after Chaplin's photography studio received the letter, it sued "Life" weekly in court, arguing that the publication of this photo, once published, would greatly reduce the five million yuan in profits that "The Great Dictator" could have steadily obtained. Therefore, it demanded compensation for losses of one million yuan.

"Life" weekly also hired a lawyer to defend, saying that this photo is currently of concern to the world, so it was published. Chaplin immediately ordered to stop the publication after receiving the letter, so there would be no problem, but unexpectedly, he sued in court. As a result, both parties negotiated a compromise solution. The court ordered a ban on the publication of Chaplin's photos of playing the dictator. More than 1.8 million copies of "Life" weekly with this photo printed had already been issued and could not be recovered. More than 1.1 million copies that had not yet been printed removed the photo and replaced it with a photo of auto king Ford visiting the army's destroyer. A lawsuit was finally settled.

(Editor's note) According to another rumor: "This lawsuit is a clever way for both parties to use it for publicity." What exactly is the case, we certainly do not know, so we can only report it later.

### How Are Movies Made?

—

Regarding the sound in sound films, many are faked. For instance, violently waving a thin sheet of lead with both hands can create the sound of thunder. The sound of a car engine is often produced by a specially made whistle. Striking a cloth covering with numerous rattan sticks can produce the sound of a volley of gunfire. Throwing beans into a very curved tube can create the sound of ocean waves. Recently, someone even invented an electrically powered machine that can produce many different kinds of fake sounds, so ingenious it's beyond description!

(8) Amateur Filmmaking
The materials required for amateur filmmaking are quite expensive. The cost of a camera is definitely beyond the financial means of ordinary people. Furthermore, the photographic accessories are numerous and bulky, making them difficult to carry. To accommodate ordinary people's amateur filmmaking, there are specially made cameras for amateurs on the market. These cameras are much simpler than those used by regular film production companies. The price is also much cheaper, and the volume is small, making them very portable. There are two types of film used: the first type is exactly the same size as the film used by ordinary film production companies. The second type is slightly smaller. The biggest limitation of these amateur cameras compared to regular cameras is that the length of the film produced is extremely limited. Some are only ten meters long, while others are forty, sixty, etc., with the longest being no more than one hundred meters. Therefore, the screening time is only very short. However, being able to film and screen on your own is already interesting enough!

Although movies have reached a very developed stage, their future is still limitless. Just look, stereoscopic movies are already emerging, and I'm afraid they will be available to the public in another year or two. According to current rough estimates, there are more than 60,000 movie theaters worldwide, with tens of millions of viewers, and movies are now recognized as the greatest tool for promoting culture and mass entertainment. Seeing such a grand scene, the founding fathers who spent their days hiding in laboratories researching and inventing movies, such as Edison, Muybridge, Plateau, the Lumière brothers, etc., must be smiling from their graves!
