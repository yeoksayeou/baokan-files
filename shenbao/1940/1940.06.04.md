### End of Decades-Long Battle: After the Recapture of Zaoyang by Chinese Forces, Remnants of Japanese Troops Completely Eliminated Following Fierce Street Battles; Some Fled to Tangxian Township Vicinity, Again Ambushed

Luoyang: Hubei Chinese forces recaptured Zaoyang on the evening of the 2nd (dispatch of the 3rd).

Luoyang: The decade-long struggle for Zaoyang concluded on the evening of the 2nd. Chinese forces stormed the city walls at noon on the 2nd, engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese. The Japanese army, relentlessly pursued and killed by Chinese forces, left rivers of blood. Some Japanese troops relied on the dense houses in the central district, putting up stubborn resistance. Chinese forces used dense artillery fire, launching forward assaults. Over 500 remaining Japanese soldiers were all killed without a single escape. Chinese forces completely recaptured Zaoyang on the evening of the 2nd and are currently pacifying the populace and pursuing the fleeing Japanese southward, seizing a large amount of spoils, which are being inventoried (urgent dispatch of the 3rd).

Nanyang: Japanese troops entrenched near Zaoyang have suffered countless casualties after days of fierce encirclement and annihilation by Chinese forces. On the evening of the 2nd, Chinese forces bravely charged, immediately breaking into Zaoyang. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the assault, mostly broke through the encirclement and retreated southwest, while a portion retreated southeast to the vicinity of Baxi Township in Tangxian County, where they were again intercepted by Chinese forces. The battle was still ongoing as of the evening. Remnants of Japanese forces near Zaoyang have now been eliminated. Chinese forces are both pacifying the populace and tightly pursuing the remaining Japanese troops (dispatch of the 3rd).

Nanyang: Japanese forces encircled and annihilated by Chinese forces in the northwest area of Dahong Mountain suffered countless casualties after being attacked from all sides. On the 31st, unable to hold out, the Japanese forces split into three groups, attempting to break through and flee. One group reached the vicinity of Shajiadian and Jiangjiahe, where they were ambushed by Chinese forces, suffering over half casualties. Another group was intercepted by Chinese forces near Quanshui River, suffering heavy losses. The remaining group fled from Majiachong to the vicinity of Wangjiadian, where they were attacked from the front and rear by Chinese forces. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops fled towards Yangzi, with Chinese forces in close pursuit (dispatch of the 3rd).

Chinese Forces Once
Stormed into Xindian

Nanyang: Chinese forces advancing towards the southern section of the Pinghan Railway successively recaptured Lijiazhai, Dongshuanghe, and Liuhe railway stations, seizing many spoils. On the evening of the 1st, they swiftly stormed into Xindian (north of Wusheng Pass). Fighting continued until dawn on the 2nd, resulting in over 200 Japanese soldiers killed and countless Japanese military supplies destroyed. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements launched a counterattack, and the Chinese forces then withdrew (dispatch of the 3rd).

Chinese Air Force Bombs
Northern Hubei

Chengdu: The brave Chinese Iron-Crow unit, led by a certain commander on the 2nd, flew to the Mingzhengdian and Oujiamiao areas north of Yicheng, discovering densely packed Japanese troops and vehicles loaded with supplies surrounded by Chinese forces. Chinese planes dropped heavy bombs, destroying the Japanese vehicles and hitting two strongholds near the area occupied by the remnants of Japanese troops, setting them ablaze. The flames soared into the sky, and the remaining Japanese soldiers scattered and fled. The commander, seeing that the mission had been accomplished, safely returned to base (dispatch of the 2nd).

Chongqing: Newspapers in Chinese today carried a report that the Japanese army on May 30th, taking advantage of the night, strongly crossed the Han River at two points downstream of Xiangyang in northern Hubei and were presently threatening Xiangyang. Reportedly, the Japanese army used fierce artillery fire to provide cover for the crossing between Xiangyang and Yicheng. Judging from the situation, the Japanese army intends to advance along the western bank of the Han River to probe north toward Xiangyang. Battles are currently taking place at Mingzhengdian (north of Yicheng) and Oujiamiao (south of Xiangyang). Chinese forces are besieging the Japanese army within the triangular area south of Xiangyi (Nanzhang). Furthermore, a Chinese bomber squadron yesterday heavily bombed Japanese troops gathered south of Xiangyang to assist the defending troops of Xiangyang (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd).

Fancheng: On the evening of the 31st of last month, a small detachment of Japanese troops crossed the river from Wangjiaji, north of Yicheng, and launched an invasion. They are currently trapped within the triangular area south of Xiangyi, heavily besieged. One group is surrounded near Mingzhengdian, north of Yicheng, while another is engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces near Oujiamiao, south of Xiangyang. At the moment, large Chinese forces are pressing hard on the Japanese from multiple directions (dispatch of the 2nd).

Chongqing: According to today's Chinese military battlefield dispatches, the Chinese Air Force today attacked Yicheng on the west bank of the Han River. Japanese troops and supply depots between that city and Xiangyang suffered heavy bombing (Associated Press dispatch of the 3rd).

### Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Close In on Jincheng Suburbs

Luoyang: The important Japanese stronghold of Tianjing Pass on the Jinbo Highway has been under fierce attack by Chinese forces. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. On the 31st, Chinese forces continued to occupy Donglingkou. On the same day, Japanese forces in Jincheng, traveling in over twenty vehicles, rushed toward Tianjing Pass to provide reinforcements. On the way, they were intercepted by Chinese forces. Many Japanese vehicles were destroyed, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese troops retreated towards Jincheng. One group retreated to the vicinity of Daokou (south of Jincheng), where Chinese forces are intensifying their efforts to annihilate them (dispatch of the 3rd).

Luoyang: In the past week, the Chinese forces have had a great advantage in the battles in southern Shanxi. The encirclement of Jincheng has gradually shrunk, and the Chinese have been very successful in closing in on the suburbs to encircle and annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. The Jin-Chang highways south of the city have been cut off in sections. After the Chinese army recaptured key locations such as Lanchezhen and Jinmiaoxing south of the city, the Chinese army tracked down and continued to recapture the highlands north of Xinfangyong, besieging Tianjing Pass and killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. At the same time, the Chinese army further attacked the Japanese army in the Gaoping area, going straight into the Japanese hinterland of Sanjiazhen and Misuzhen, annihilating even more Japanese soldiers. Starting from the 26th, the Japanese army used many airplanes to cover the infantry and attacked Longcong Mountain, but were bravely defeated by the Chinese army. On the 27th, the Chinese army used clever tactics to recapture Xianwengzhen and Zishayao and other places north of Yangcheng, and obtained a large amount of military supplies and provisions. The Japanese in Gaoping felt increasingly threatened (dispatch of the 2nd).

Luoyang: The Japanese army in Shanxi suffered heavy losses due to the continuous attacks by the Chinese army. On the 27th, the Chinese army took swift action to capture Chencun in southern Xiaxian. The Japanese army from Xiaxian rushed to reinforce, but were defeated head-on by the Chinese army (dispatch of the 2nd).

### Japanese Troops Southwest of Chenliu Flee North in Succession

Luoyang: The Chinese army in northern Henan continued to attack the Japanese army in the Jiulongba area southwest of Chenliu on the night of the 28th, fighting fiercely throughout the night, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers, destroying three Japanese artillery pieces, and capturing more than 100 rifles. After suffering losses, the Japanese troops fled north in succession (dispatch of the 2nd).

Zhengzhou: On the 28th, the Chinese army in northern Henan launched attacks on Japanese outposts in Xiaohucheng and Qilitun outside Qinyang, engaging in fierce fighting for three hours, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing many military supplies (dispatch of the 3rd).

### Latest News: Recapture of LiangKou

Wengyuan: Chinese forces recaptured LiangKou again at 10 a.m. this morning and continue to advance southward (urgent dispatch of the 3rd).

### Zhou Enlai Arrives in Chongqing, Raising Funds for Recovery, Temporarily Unavailable to Visitors

Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, who recently returned to China after visiting Moscow, arrived in Chongqing yesterday. He is temporarily not receiving visitors because he was injured in a fall from a horse in Yan'an, Shaanxi, and has not yet recovered (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd).

Chongqing: It was confirmed today that Communist leader Zhou Enlai has arrived in Chongqing. For the past four years, Zhou's primary task has been to promote close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Zhou's arrival in Chongqing will undoubtedly lead to greater unity between the two parties. All issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have been discussed in the recent National Political Council. Zhou's arrival is expected to achieve a final coordination (Associated Press dispatch of the 3rd).

### Wei Datong Appointed President of Shaanxi High Court

### Fighting Breaks Out in Jiaxing-Huzhou Area

Jinhua: Chinese forces are waging extensive guerrilla warfare in the Jiaxing-Huzhou area, launching fierce attacks on Wuzhen, Xiashi, Xinshi, and other places, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers and capturing many spoils (dispatch of the 3rd).

### Japanese Troops in Southern Shandong Repeatedly Intercepted

A Certain Place in Shandong: Over a thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry soldiers with three artillery pieces were ambushed by Chinese forces near Maling Mountain (southeast of Linyi) on the 17th and returned to Linyi. On the 23rd, they split into groups and invaded the Chinese forces. One group went to Xigoutou, and another went directly to Dongyi from Xiazhuang (both east of Linyi). Chinese forces met them on different routes, fighting fiercely all day. Another Chinese force circled the Japanese side, attacking from both sides. By dawn on the 24th, the Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated towards Huangye through Jiezhuang, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army and fled towards Zhubian (northeast of Linyi). In this battle, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were killed (dispatch of the 3rd).

### Soviet Union Fully Developing Far East Region

Chongqing: Moscow reports that the Soviet Union is actively implementing its third five-year plan. According to the plan, the Far East region of the Soviet Union will be fully developed to become an economic zone, thereby enhancing the Soviet Union's economic and defense capabilities in the Far East. In fact, the Far East region of the Soviet Union has long occupied an important position in the country's economic value. Although the climate and terrain of eastern Siberia are very suitable for the implementation of collective farming, the lack of labor and the full use of arable land still require the transfer of some labor from other parts of the Soviet Union to this area. Soviet industry is also currently in need of a large amount of manpower. Various newspapers here are paying close attention to the issue of the colonization of workers and farmers in various regions of the Far East. The government is encouraging and assisting in every way workers and farmers who are preparing to live in various regions of the Far East for a long time (dispatch of the 3rd).

### How Will the Third Phase of the European War Begin?

The European war situation over the past two weeks, in terms of the entire European war, is the second stage since the start of the war; in military terms, it is the first act of the main force engagement. In this act, Germany's strategy is to attack, and the Allied forces' strategy is to defend; and Germany's offensive has indeed achieved significant success. As for the battle results, of course, there are no credible and accurate figures available to explain them. It is said that 100,000 Dutch soldiers were killed or wounded and 300,000 surrendered; the casualties for the Belgian army were two or three hundred thousand killed or wounded with five hundred thousand surrendering; these are approximate numbers, and it is impossible to verify how much they differ from the exact numbers. As for the British and French armies, how many have died in this area, how many have been dispersed and missing, and how many have been captured, the British and French authorities probably have no way of knowing either; as for those who were wounded and rescued, and those who survived the crossing, although it is not difficult to count them, the time for public announcement has not yet arrived. According to the Associated Press, Germany's losses are about 500,000 killed or wounded; in addition, about three-fifths of the heavy tank army, half of the light tank army and other armored vehicles and mechanized equipment, and two to three thousand aircraft, accounting for about half of the total, were lost; we have no way of estimating the credibility of these numbers and ratios; however, this kind of all-out iron-blooded offensive requires extremely large sacrifices, which is the price that Germany expected to pay. The clear achievements obtained for this price are: first, controlling the entire territories of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium; second, bypassing the extreme end of the French Maginot Line and sweeping away the northwestern corner of France north of the Somme River; and third, acquiring a vast stronghold for attacking London and Paris. Among them, the two ports of Dunkirk and Calais are still held by the Allied forces; however, whether they are finally captured by the German army or finally abandoned by the Allied forces is only a matter of time, and now it is only the end of this bloody battle.

According to past war principles, after each major battle, first, frontline soldiers need rest; second, the front and rear teams need to be adjusted; third, the war zone needs to be arranged and the battlefield cleared; and fourth, military supplies need to be replenished. For all these reasons, whether on the side that wins the battle or on the side that loses the battle, both sides equally need a considerable amount of time before they can launch the "next act." Although we believe in the inevitability of these principles, because of the progress of human organizational power and the development of modern science; and because Germany is using a quick-win strategy and deploying blitzkrieg tactics, it is most unfavorable for Britain and France to have a moment to breathe and calmly plan their strategy; therefore, we do not believe that the current reality will be dominated by mechanical principles. For this reason, the "next act" may immediately follow the previous act... This is the third phase of the European war.

There are three possible scenarios for the third phase: first, "Heaven's heart repents of disaster," and waves of peace descend from the sky; this is a near-idiotic wish, a compassionate wish; it is not a fantasy, but it can be understood from the so-called peace offensive that has recently been reported; with the best conscience, we do not want to call the waves of peace in Europe a peace offensive, following what others say; what is regrettable is that the momentum shows that the chance of realization is extremely slim. Second, Germany launches a large-scale offensive against London or Paris, or simultaneously against both cities. Third, Italy launches its participation in the war. The first scene does not need to be discussed. The second and third seem to be imminent. In addition to these three, in view of the lessons of various unexpected changes in international relations in recent years, probably no one has the courage to assert that there is absolutely no fourth possibility; especially what is happening in Spain, Romania, and Turkey are all becoming issues. But based on common sense, even if Romania and Turkey have any determination to act, it will not be before Italy launches its participation. As for Spain, although the success of General Franco's revolution was due to the assistance of Italy and Germany, so there is a greater possibility of siding with Germany and Italy and opposing Britain and France; moreover, the long-term control of the Strait of Gibraltar by Britain is also something that some Spaniards have not forgotten, and recently they have even advocated its return; however, General Franco has his own soul in space and is a person with strength. Whether in his subjective consciousness or objective conditions, he is by no means a puppet manipulated by Italy and Germany; yesterday's dispatch from Madrid, the western capital, said that General Franco had already declared that "even if Italy participates in the war, Spain will not change its status as a non-belligerent country"; this kind of statement, of course, has its inevitable time limit, but at least in the opening act of the third phase of the European war, it can be used as a good source of information for judging that Spain is still on the sidelines.

Therefore, the so-called third phase, if there is no sudden wave of peace, is nothing more than Germany attacking the two capitals of Britain and France or Italy participating in the war. Regarding Italy's attitude, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed that Italy has a traditional desire in the Mediterranean, but lacks the determination to implement its desire with force; during this time, although the advantage of Germany's operation and the discomfort of Britain and France toward Italy make Italy feel more uncomfortable, so the angle is becoming more acute, almost causing Italy to immediately launch its attempt to stand out; however, according to our ordinary speculation, we still think that Italy is not the initiator of the third phase of the European war. We dare not assert that Italy will not launch its participation in the war when this article is published; however, the time when we imagine it will launch its participation is closer to when the German army is approaching the British mainland or launching a large-scale offensive in southeastern France!

### National Capital Holds June 3rd Commemoration, Generalissimo Chiang Delivers Address, Emphasizing Equal Importance of Opium Suppression and Resistance Against Japan, Expecting Further Progress After Term Completion, Instructing Six Effective Methods

Chongqing: All sectors of the national capital held an enlarged June 3rd Opium Suppression Commemoration Assembly at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, with over 500 representatives from various institutions, organizations, districts, towns, and baojia attending. Presided over by Gu Zhenggang, Minister of the Central Social Affairs Ministry, the assembly proceeded with rituals as per custom. It was reported that our country's implementation of opium suppression began on June 3, 1839, when Lin Zexu suppressed opium in Humen. It has been 101 years since then. As we are in the period of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, and it is also the final year of the six-year opium suppression plan, commemorating June 3rd is of great significance. Everyone knows the harms of opium. Resistance against Japan and national reconstruction depend on strengthening the body and improving the race. Generalissimo Chiang, in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, formulated a six-year opium suppression plan. This year is the last year of the prohibition period, only half a year away. To achieve its complete completion, we must mobilize social forces and cooperate with government forces to accomplish the task and strengthen the resistance and reconstruction work to combat the toxicification policy, which is especially necessary. Then, Minister of the Interior Zhou Zhongyue read Generalissimo Chiang's address, Vice Minister Zhang Weihan reported on the work of the Opium Suppression Committee, and Guo Yiyu, Director of the Political Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Chen Fangxian, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, and others delivered speeches. The meeting ended with slogans. At 6:00 p.m., the Municipal Police Bureau, the 3rd Regiment of the Military Police, and others publicly burned drugs in the Fuzichi Square, supervised by representatives from all walks of life (dispatch of the 3rd).

Chongqing: Generalissimo Chiang issued an address to the June 3rd Opium Suppression Commemoration Assembly, saying that this year is the last year of the six-year opium suppression plan. After the outbreak of the resistance against Japan in the 26th year [1937], everyone, both internally and externally, thought that military disturbances would affect administration, and that the places reached by the Japanese would actively implement a toxicification policy, which would easily destroy our original opium suppression achievements. All steps of the original six-year prohibition plan were affected, making it difficult to complete as scheduled, or it would need to be extended. However, we are determined to suppress opium in order to eliminate the toxic disaster of hundreds of years, and must make the addicted elements of the entire nation regain their health and achieve the goal of national revival. At the same time, we are fighting hard to resist Japan, also to strive for national survival and realize the great cause of revival. Although the two tasks are different, the goals are the same. While fighting hard to resist Japan, we must suppress opium to expand the effectiveness of the resistance. I, Chiang Zhongzheng, believe that the two tasks of resisting Japan and suppressing opium are equally important, and cannot be neglected or separated. Therefore, since the resistance against Japan, I have never slackened in urging opium suppression in all provinces of the country. Many of my party, government, and military comrades, as well as enlightened people from all over the country, are also able to deeply understand my humble intentions and work together. Up to today, the remaining opium and un-rehabilitated addicts in various places have not been completely eliminated, but because our opium suppression is thorough, there are few remaining, and the source will be cut off in the future, making it difficult to have a supply again. Secondly, the entire society of the country has deeply recognized the harm of opium, and has created a climate of deep hatred. In the future, all private traffickers, smugglers, and addicts who are not afraid of the law, in addition to the government's determination to severely punish them, will also be spurned by the society and can no longer find a place in the world. These two successes have laid a solid and great foundation for the six-year prohibition plan, and there must be no more talk of extension. This is an important achievement in our resistance against Japan, and can also be said to be a major victory in the resistance. The strong and decisive spirit of our nation is enough to drive away the remaining Japanese. However, to build a mountain is to fail if one basket of earth is missing; in a hundred-mile journey, half is seeing ninety miles. Our opium suppression work from now on, just like the resistance work, must continue to struggle to strive for the final victory. We must not think that the actual prohibition work has come to an end because the prohibition period has expired, and it is okay to treat it the same as ordinary administrative work. We must know that the harm of opium has a long history, and the remaining toxins are everywhere. In particular, the Japanese know that we are actively suppressing opium, and they supply as much opium as possible and manufacture and transport potent drugs, openly forcing sales everywhere, or secretly planting them. If we do not continue to work hard to eradicate and eliminate these internal and external toxins, we may allow them to breed and grow, making the six years of prohibition efforts come to nothing halfway. This is what we should be especially vigilant and vigilant about after the completion of the six-year plan, and we must not be negligent for a moment. The most important points: First, strictly prohibit planting and eradicate opium. Every year, we should concentrate all the power of the party, government, and military to seriously inspect. Once discovered, no matter what the reason, the planters will be shot, and the neighboring neighborhoods that guarantee them will be punished. At the same time, we should, at all costs, eradicate those remote and special areas that are accustomed to violating the prohibition. Second, apply strict laws to treat opium. Anyone who transports and sells opium drugs and opens opium dens will be executed without exception once found, according to the law. Third, for addicts who are secretly smoking, if they are found again after the expiration of the term, they will no longer be given medicine for forced rehabilitation, but will be punished with long-term labor service, forcing them to resist and quit naturally with physical strength. If they have been repeatedly rehabilitated without repenting and cannot be forgiven, then there is no need to tolerate them, and they should be punished with extreme punishment to show warning. Fourth, the important key to the construction and prohibition work from now on must be placed within the baojia. No matter planting, transporting, selling, or smoking, the baojia should be rewarded for reporting, and generous compensation should be given. At the same time, in accordance with the anti-spy and anti-bandit methods, they should sign a joint guarantee. If they hide and fail to report, then if one family is found to have committed a prohibited act, all families in the joint guarantee will be jointly and severally punished. Fifth, after the recovery of the occupied areas, all party, government, and military personnel in that area must first pay attention to the toxic substances left by the Japanese, actively investigate and prohibit them, and advise the people to report and eliminate them automatically in order to eradicate them completely and prevent them from spreading elsewhere. Sixth, after the expiration of the prohibition period in each province, all continued strict prohibition measures should be combined with party, government, military, and academic personnel to expand propaganda, penetrate into the people, and continue for a long time. Compared with the six-year plan, we should work even harder to ensure that offenders know to be vigilant and convey the government's original intention of loving the people, and other people should also know the government's determination to work together to eliminate the great harm of opium completely. All the above instructions are effective methods that must be further advanced after the expiration of the prohibition period. If all my compatriots and comrades from all walks of life in the party, government, military, and academia are sincere and vigorous, then by the end of this year, all opium will not be allowed to remain in my Chinese nation. At that time, the remaining Japanese army will no longer be able to poison my Chinese territory. Especially because today is the June 3rd Commemoration of my virtuous predecessors who took the lead in prohibiting drugs, I announce the key points to the whole country and encourage all my comrades and compatriots who are working hard to prohibit opium (dispatch of the 3rd).

### Internal Opium Suppression Committee Holds First Regular Meeting, Li Zhonggong Reports on Opium Suppression Work, Meeting Will Focus on Aftermath Issues

Chongqing: The first regular meeting of the Opium Suppression Committee of the Ministry of Interior was held on the afternoon of the 3rd.

The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The committee has received over 40 proposals and is scheduled to continue the meeting tomorrow to discuss them (dispatch of the 3rd).

### Recovering Strongholds Near Liang Kou One After Another

Wengyuan. Regarding Liang Kou, the Chinese army lured and annihilated Japanese reinforcements. For days, they lured them to the mountainous areas southwest of Niubei Ridge and northwest of Liang Kou. The Japanese, oblivious, advanced to the designated locations. The Chinese army then launched a full-scale encirclement, attacking from all directions. On the 1st, at 10:00 AM, the Chinese army fiercely attacked the Japanese at Dongdong Yayi Mountain. By 3:00 PM, the Japanese, unable to hold, bombed with aircraft and used poison gas as cover, retreating towards Mibu via Bainiao Lake and Sanjia Cave. The Chinese army successively recovered Dongdong, Chenwei, Yayi Mountain, and the highlands around Furong Ridge, continuing to pursue the Japanese. This morning, the Chinese army advanced on multiple routes towards Wangdaodi, Weinaoding, Weiyin (southeast of Qipan Mountain), Bainiao Lake, and Sanjia Cave, taking advantage of their victories. Despite the Japanese putting up a stubborn resistance and fighting fiercely until noon, they were ultimately unable to hold and sent several aircraft to bomb the Chinese army as cover, retreating towards Shilingxu. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese in the areas of Bainiao Lake and Sanjia Cave. Another unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Cuodongwei, Fenshuiao, and Huangniu Mountain southwest of Niubei Ridge on the morning of the 1st. Simultaneously, they joined forces with another Chinese unit to attack Weinaoding, Wangdaodi, and other places, engaging in fierce fighting for three consecutive days and nights. By noon on the 2nd, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and used aircraft for bombing and strafing as cover, retreating towards Liang Kou. The Chinese army then successively recovered strongholds north of Liang Kou, including Huangniu Mountain, Wangdaodi, Weinaoding, Damangao, Fenshuiao, and Yandongwei. Another large Chinese army, after recovering Feitianfengding, Sanfutian, and Yadong (southeast of Liang Kou) on the 1st, on the 2nd, the Chinese army also recovered Shiliuhuading (south of Liang Kou) and surrounded the Japanese at Wuzhi Mountain (east of Liang Kou), preventing them from escaping. Since successively capturing key points, the Chinese army's morale has greatly increased, and the remaining Japanese have collapsed. Summing up the battle results of the past two days, the Chinese army killed and wounded over 3,000 Japanese soldiers, captured over 1,000 military horses, and seized countless spoils of war. (2nd Dispatch)

Wengyuan. The Japanese who invaded Paitan suffered extremely heavy casualties due to the courageous resistance of the Chinese army. On the morning of the 1st, they reinforced with over 1,000 troops and invaded north again. The Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely. They are still fighting today. (2nd Dispatch)

### Chinese Embassy in Britain Releases External Telegram

London. The Chinese Embassy in Britain recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing and immediately released it. The content briefly stated, "Rome Radio Station once issued news from Hong Kong, saying that Chinese envoys to Britain, France, Germany, and other countries sent telegrams to Chongqing, urging the National Government to make peace with Japan in a short period and to unite with the European Axis powers. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government hereby firmly denies this. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has never received such telegrams. The above news is entirely fabricated and is likely issued by the Japanese side to confuse the world and achieve their conspiracy." (3rd Havas)

### Northern Front Battles Nearing End; Allied Forces Fully Defending Paris; Dunkirk Garrison Continues Resistance; Only Minor Contact on the Somme Line

Paris. Military officials declared that although there were no significant developments in land battles yesterday, air battles were extremely active. In Dunkirk, the German army relentlessly attacked, attempting to prevent the Allied forces from embarking. However, this action did not stop, but rather increased its speed. It is reported that German aircraft suffered heavy damage as a result of attacks by Allied air forces. Air battles also occurred elsewhere. Combat, reconnaissance, and bombing aircraft were very active over French territory. The Somme area was calm, with artillery fire only on the Aisne River, especially near Rethel. (3rd Reuters)

Paris. Military officials here recently stated that the front lines were relatively calm yesterday, as they were at night. There was some artillery fire between the Aisne River region, Rethel, the Aisne River, and the Chiers River. On the east bank of the Moselle River, two German attacks were repelled by our forces. Both sides' air forces were quite active. Our aircraft flew to the enemy's side for reconnaissance. Allied patrols encountered German aircraft groups over Dunkirk Harbor and inflicted heavy damage. German aircraft also carried out reconnaissance flights over various parts of our country and continued to bomb, with the Rethel area in the Aisne River valley being the most heavily bombed. At that time, the Allied forces were conducting large-scale movements there yesterday. German aircraft also attacked southeastern France, but the intensity was not as great as the previous day. Furthermore, regarding the German aircraft's attack on the Rhone River valley in France, it is closer to the Italian border, making its political significance greater than its military one. (3rd Havas)

Paris. The General Headquarters issued a war bulletin tonight stating, "British and French forces originally cooperated with Belgian troops in the Saint-Omer area near Arras, and on a line from Valenciennes to Courtrai, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, after the Belgian army ceased fighting under the order of its King, Allied forces had to retreat to Dunkirk Harbor. Our initial positions were between the La Bassée and La Lys canals. Later, we retreated to the line from the Lys River to Gravelines, Cassel, Ypres, and Nieuport. Finally, we retreated to Dunkirk Harbor. During the retreat, despite being heavily bombarded by enemy artillery, aircraft, and tanks, we were still able to counterattack from time to time to prevent the enemy from approaching. At that time, our army was surrounded on all sides, and due to the Belgian army's ceasefire, our left flank lost its protection. However, we were still able to break through the encirclement. Our combat bravery is unparalleled in the history of the British and French armies. Although the enemy has occupied some territory in northern France, they have paid a very high price for the Allied forces' bravery in combat. The enemy's morale has been shaken, unlike our army's strong morale, which is prepared to continue fighting. It is impossible to compare the two. As for our troops who have retreated to the coastal area, they have boarded ships in Dunkirk Harbor to go elsewhere. The port's defenses are solid, and the enemy's attack is unlikely to succeed. In addition, our enemy machine gun teams had contact in the Rethel area. Nothing else is worth mentioning. Furthermore, our aircraft flew to northern France last night to supply the local convoys with military supplies. Later, they flew to the Trier area and the southern Black Forest area of Germany for reconnaissance. Enemy aircraft bombed southeastern France. A total of twelve were shot down by our side."

London. A brigade of British infantry that landed on the beach north of Dunkirk yesterday morning had been participating in the Flanders campaign from beginning to end. The brigade was among the first to enter Belgium with other troops and then fought a rearguard action from the farthest point reached by the British Expeditionary Force until near Dunkirk. When the brigade returned to England and landed, the brigade commander said that his troops had never been defeated. They repelled every German attack and only retreated when ordered, and only to the designated locations. One day, the brigade marched over forty miles in twenty-four hours. (3rd Reuters)

Berlin. The Battle of Dunkirk is coming to an end. Yesterday, the Allied forces fought and retreated, and the territory they held became smaller and smaller. The German army will be able to completely occupy Dunkirk within days. The British Expeditionary Force was attacked again while retreating to its home country. Many enemy warships and transport ships were also bombed and sunk one after another. (3rd Haitong)

Paris. According to sources here, about 100 French warships and more than 200 merchant ships participated in the defense of Dunkirk and the evacuation of the Allied forces in the Flanders region. Among them, the larger ones were postal ships serving as auxiliary ships, and the smaller ones were fishing boats. (3rd Reuters)

Dunkirk Area Becomes a Marsh, Hindering German Advance

Berlin. Today's German war bulletin stated that the German army, advancing on Dunkirk from the east, west, and south, is making gradual progress. However, because the Dunkirk area has become a marsh and has many trenches, the German advance is slower. However, the German infantry, with the help of the air force, has deeply penetrated the town of Bourbourg, which has very strong defenses, making it difficult to enter. The Dunkirk area is still in enemy hands. German vehicles continue to bomb, and the artillery fire is very intense. Yesterday, German fighter planes and bombers bombed the enemy in the area all day and sank two destroyers, one other warship, and one cargo ship with a deadweight of 5,000 tons. They also severely damaged one warship, two destroyers, and ten merchant ships. German aircraft also flew south to bomb Marseille and other places. The enemy retreated along the Maginot Line, abandoning countless military supplies. Many soldiers were also captured. According to German estimates, as a result of the major battle of Flanders and Artois, the German army captured no fewer than 350,000 enemy soldiers. German aircraft bombed the radio station in Vadsø, northern Norway, and sank an enemy merchant ship near Vardo Bay. Last night, enemy aircraft continued to bomb non-military buildings in western and southern Germany, with no major personnel losses. In total, enemy aircraft lost 59 aircraft yesterday. 27 were shot down in air combat, 10 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed on the airfield by bombing. 15 German aircraft are missing.

Berlin. According to military correspondent Mittermann, who published the details of the German army's capture of Cassel, Belgium, this morning, the town was the location of the Allied command headquarters and had unusually strong defenses. The German armored vehicle team was ordered to attack and encountered strong resistance. The German army then sent a team to surround the town, while the main force continued to advance. The Allied forces ran out of food and ammunition and attempted to break through. The German army took the opportunity to defeat them and occupy the town. (3rd Haitong)

Germany Adds Fifteen Fresh Divisions, Pressuring Allied Forces in Dunkirk Area

Paris. Well-informed military sources reported last night that most of the 200,000 British Expeditionary Force troops in France had safely arrived in Britain over the past week, and another 100,000 British troops would be evacuated within 48 hours, ending the fighting in Belgium and northern France. On Saturday night and Sunday, the evacuation of British and French troops on the Dunkirk semi-circular line continued. Yesterday, Germany launched a fierce attack on the Dunkirk positions with fifteen divisions, attempting to prevent the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and to clear the Allied strongholds along the Belgian-French border. German artillery began bombarding the largest fortresses on the Maginot Line yesterday. Siege artillery deployed in the Serre area across the Moselle River heavily shelled the spine of the Maginot Line. As the German army gradually narrowed its iron grip around Dunkirk, the Allied forces concentrated their limited artillery outside the flooded area, attempting to control the last important road around the city within a twelve-mile radius. Behind the Allied artillery positions, small steamships and cruisers of the Allied nations continued to load evacuating British, French, and Belgian troops. The smooth progress of this evacuation was beyond the expectations of the Allied commanders, who had feared just a few days ago that the entire Allied force in northern France would be annihilated or captured. Yesterday afternoon, it was reported that the German pressure on the encircled Allied positions in Dunkirk had greatly increased. The German side even added fifteen fresh divisions and deployed long-range artillery to bombard the English Channel coast with large shells. German artillery was aimed at the sand dunes along the Dunkirk coast, where thousands of Allied soldiers were hiding in sand dune caves, waiting to board ships to return to England. General Polio's armored forces are currently engaged in a rearguard action, retreating to the flooded areas of the Yser and Aa rivers. A few small groups of Allied soldiers, each with hundreds of men, broke through the German lines and reached Dunkirk yesterday. The whereabouts of one part of the armored force is unknown, and General Polio himself is also missing. German reports say that General Polio has already been captured. Allied air forces continued to cover the evacuation ships yesterday, but French reports say that the Allied navies provided the greatest assistance. The navies not only patrolled the 40-mile-wide channel, resisting German torpedo boats and air raids, but also used their artillery to bombard German concentration points outside the twelve-and-a-half-mile semicircle around Dunkirk. German military officials declared last night that German losses in manpower and resources were "extremely heavy." They said that the Flanders campaign was nearing its end and that a rough accounting of the blood price paid by Germany in Flanders could be made shortly. It is reported that Germany has suffered 600,000 casualties in the 23 days since it invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, losing three-fifths of its heavy tanks and more than half of its light tanks and other armored mechanized equipment. The German Air Force's losses in the first line are about 2,000 aircraft. French estimates say that the German Air Force's first-line losses are about 50 percent, or 3,000 aircraft. As for the Allied side, it is said that the losses were tanks and other mechanized vehicles lost during the retreat from Belgium, in addition to "several hundred" officers and soldiers being captured. Allied Air Force losses were "minor" compared to Germany's. French officers said that as a result of the air battles, Germany's air superiority had been greatly weakened, but neutral observers do not currently believe so. (3rd Associated Press)

London. Soldiers of the Expeditionary Force who have retreated back to their home country continue to describe the circumstances of the retreat. One non-commissioned officer said that on Saturday and Sunday, when thousands of troops were waiting for ships to carry them away from the occupied territory, twenty people could not find a rowboat. While they were in the boat, German bombers suddenly flew in and dropped several bombs, all of which landed around the boat. Then they strafed with machine guns and poured gasoline around the boat, apparently angry that they could not sink the boat. Soon the gasoline caught fire, and flames erupted around the boat. None of these ten people survived. The German military tactics are mostly like this. (3rd Reuters)

London. Over a hundred Allied warships and two hundred transport ships continued to sail back and forth today under heavy German bombs and machine gun fire, attempting to rescue the last few thousand British Expeditionary Force and French troops from danger. The evacuation of troops is becoming increasingly difficult today because the Allied rearguard has withdrawn from Dunkirk, and the German pursuit has followed closely. The range of the German artillery has reached the place where the Allied forces are boarding ships. After the floodgates of the Yser Canal were opened, the water in front of Dunkirk had widened. Two-thirds of the Allied lines are protected by water. Although the German army is still attacking fiercely, it has been unable to advance. The evacuating troops praised the courage of the medics, who did not leave the Dunkirk beach even when German aircraft bombed. According to one officer, these medics have not taken a step from the beach since they arrived. One medic said that he would not leave, even if he were wounded and captured by the German army.

### German Air Force Bombs Paris and Marseille for the First Time; Several Bombs Fall in Paris; Merchant Ships Attacked in Marseille Harbor

Paris. The Paris city area was bombed this afternoon. Enemy aircraft dropped several bombs, hitting several civilian houses. The locations were very far from any military targets. The extent of the damage is still unknown. This is the first time German aircraft have bombed Paris. (3rd Havas News Agency)

Paris. Two large squadrons of German aircraft bombed the outskirts of Paris today, causing large fires in four places. The first squadron of German aircraft entered the airspace over the Paris area at 1:18 PM today, and the second squadron arrived at 1:50 PM. French anti-aircraft guns launched intense fire. The sound of the guns was as loud as the bombardment of a large heavy artillery. French fighter planes immediately flew into the air and fired machine guns at the German aircraft. French fighters and German bombers engaged in fierce fighting in the air for a long time before it subsided. US Ambassador to France Bullitt and US embassy personnel all went to the roof to watch the battle. (3rd Associated Press)

Paris. An air raid alert was issued in the Paris city area at 1:15 PM today and was lifted at 2:15 PM. At that time, anti-aircraft guns fired. The intensity and duration of the artillery fire was the most intense ever experienced in the Paris area since the air raids. (3rd Havas)

Paris. Six squadrons of German aircraft flew over Paris today and dropped dozens of bombs in and outside the city. US Ambassador to France Bullitt narrowly escaped death. During the 2:50 PM air raid, two places in the city area caught fire after being hit by bombs. One bomb landed only ten feet away from Bullitt, but fortunately it did not explode. Mr. Bullitt was not injured in the slightest. At that time, Mr. Bullitt was attending a banquet hosted by French Air Minister Laurent-Eynac. The bomb landed at the banquet location, so the US ambassador, the French air minister, and others moved the banquet to another location and continued. (2nd Associated Press)

Berlin. According to local newspapers, from May 31 to June 2, German aircraft sank a total of nine British warships and thirty-two cargo ships. Another twenty-seven warships and seventy-nine transport ships were also hit and severely damaged. The achievements of German torpedo boats have not yet been included. (3rd Haitong)

Berlin. Yesterday, the Supreme Command Headquarters here issued a communiqué stating that German air force squadrons recently attacked the port of Marseille for the first time, bombing two large merchant ships and setting them on fire, and damaging several points on the Lyon-Marseille railway line. German torpedo boats along the Belgian coast launched torpedoes and sank a fully loaded 4,000-ton transport ship. On June 1, the enemy lost 58 aircraft, and our aircraft were missing 15. German alpine troops advanced from Trondheim. On June 1, they occupied Bodo and captured a British artillery company. (3rd Reuters)

Berlin. Local newspapers reported that the air raid on Marseille was clearly of great significance. Marseille is a gateway to North Africa and the Near East. Moroccan iron ore and African indigenous troops are transported to France through the port of Marseille. The railway from Marseille to Lyon is also an important transportation route. (3rd Haitong)

### British and French Authorities Release Air Combat Results; Spitfire Squadrons Achieve Success

London. The Ministry of Aviation announced that from dawn to 7:00 PM on Saturday, British fighter planes shot down and heavily damaged a total of 78 Nazi bombers and fighter planes over the Dunkirk beaches. Sixteen British aircraft are missing. British Hurricane and Spitfire fighter squadrons flew in rotation over French territory throughout the day, protecting the ships carrying the rearguard of the British Expeditionary Force back home. A large number of Nazi bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attempted to sink these troop transport ships. At that time, the sea was densely filled with various ships, and there were no shortage of targets to attack. However, just as the German aircraft were about to attack, the British fighter planes intercepted them and drove them away. Most of the bombs dropped landed in the sea. Many German Junkers, Heinkel, Dornier, and Messerschmitt aircraft were shot down into the sea. It has been confirmed that 32 German fighter planes have been shot down. One pilot of a British Hurricane plane was forced to land on the beach after his plane was damaged in combat. He carried a parachute and walked fifteen miles to Dunkirk, where he was able to board a ship back to Folkestone. He rejoined the ranks the next day and was engaged in patrol flights. The most successful on Saturday was a certain Spitfire squadron, which shot down 12 German bombers and fighter planes in a very short battle. They rose into the air again at dusk and shot down another six German aircraft. German Messerschmitt aircraft had particularly bad luck that day. No fewer than 23 were shot down by two British fighter squadrons. (3rd Reuters)

Paris. The Ministry of Aviation recently issued a communiqué stating, "Yesterday afternoon, our bombers flew to the mouth of the Somme River north of Abbeville, bombed the roads, and strafed the enemy troops with machine guns. A total of no fewer than 25 tons of bombs were dropped, all hitting the target. Two columns of German baggage trains were destroyed, the local railway was also cut off, and the nearby roads were no longer usable. When our aircraft flew back to base after completing their mission, they encountered a group of German fighter planes on the way and immediately engaged in combat, shooting down one Messerschmitt Me 109. At night, our bomber squadrons flew to the Dunkirk area again to continue supplying the garrison with military supplies and medical supplies. This morning, our aircraft flew to the north for reconnaissance and have all safely flown back to base. In addition, one German Messerschmitt aircraft was forced to land in our positions, and the pilots were captured. Furthermore, a German bomber formation was attacked by our fighter plane groups and anti-aircraft guns. The outcome is still unknown. (2nd Havas News Agency)

### The Italian Cabinet Held a Meeting This Morning; the Question of Participation in the War Will Soon Be Resolved; The British Ambassador Met with the King of Italy, Hoping the Prime Minister of Italy Would Recognize His Responsibility; Hungarian Newspapers Reported that Italy Will Announce Peace Terms between Germany and Italy

Rome - Ansa Du, the chief editor of the "Telegraph," the official newspaper of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, declared yesterday that Italy is mobilizing its troops and must join the European war to keep pace with the changing situation. This clear declaration has led observers here to believe that Italy will announce its entry into the war on the side of Germany within this week. The Fascist National Congress, which met here last night, requested Prime Minister Mussolini to complete "Italy's maritime independence," in other words, to destroy the British and French control of the Mediterranean. The Italian cabinet will meet tomorrow morning, and the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party will be convened tomorrow evening to decide whether Italy will join the Axis powers in the European war, or whether the meeting is merely to confirm the Prime Minister's decision. Regardless of when or how Italy's final decision is announced, observers generally believe that Italy's entry into the European war will not be by way of a formal declaration of war, but by a surprise attack on the Allied lifeline in the Mediterranean. (United Press, 3rd)

Paris - Observers here are now saying that Italy's unwillingness to maintain contact with Britain and France indicates that the date for that country to make an important decision is not far off. The Italian Prime Minister has exchanged letters with the US successor, and is already confident about intervening in the current European war. However, it is still difficult to say in what way he will do so. As far as Italy is concerned, if it decides not to remain on the sidelines of the European war, or even decides to join the war directly, it must first make some indication, whether it puts forward peace proposals, or engages in armed mediation, or directly announces its territorial demands, is still unknown. Of the above three possibilities, the last one is the most likely. As for the rumor that Italy will make a decision on the 4th of this month, it is not entirely credible; at least, there will be no action in the next eight days. According to Vatican sources, Italy may not act rashly before the end of this month. However, judging from Italy's notification to the Yugoslav Ministry of the Army to stop supplying various firearms and ammunition to Yugoslavia, this statement may not be entirely true. (Havas, 2nd)

Rome - The "Calino Daily" recently published a statement saying, "French newspapers have said that Italy is prepared to participate in the war. We also agree with this statement, but to say that the date of participation is on the 4th of this month is not necessarily true. In short, French journalists want to know when we will participate in the war, and we will answer: the date is not far off." (Havas, 2nd)

Washington - The White House remains tight-lipped about the small details of communications between Washington and the capitals of European countries, especially Rome, but it is clear that President Roosevelt is trying various methods to prevent the war from spreading. According to general opinion, the hope of President Roosevelt's success may be diminishing. People here are now more convinced that Hitler is putting strong pressure on Mussolini to join the war immediately to expand the theater of war. (Reuters, 3rd)

London - It is reported that Sir Laurence, the British Ambassador to Italy, met with the King of Italy at the end of last week. There is no news of the outcome of the meeting here. It is understood that London still hopes that Mussolini will recognize the serious responsibility of joining the war against the Allies. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent stated that there are currently nine Italian journalists in London, all of whom are continuing to work as usual and have not received instructions to leave the UK, nor have they taken any steps such as applying for passports. (Reuters, 3rd)

Budapest - According to the semi-official newspaper "Magyarosza", Italy is preparing to announce the peace terms of Germany and Italy next week. If Britain and France do not accept them, Italy will declare war. The Hungarian Prime Minister declared two days ago that he personally supports the policies of Germany and Italy and does not want the war to spread to Southeast Europe. (Three Seas News Agency)

Rome - The newspapers here all prominently publish the statement that Italian Prime Minister Solini will take peaceful steps. According to the "Universe Daily", Italy can achieve its goals without resorting to force. The newspaper believes that Italy's goal is to resolve major issues related to the Mediterranean and France, and then other difficult problems can be easily solved. In short, general public opinion in Romania believes that the decisive actions of Germany and Italy, such as Germany's concentrated attack on Britain and France, and Italy's activities in the Mediterranean, will gradually become clear within a few days. (Three Seas News Agency, 3rd)

New York - A correspondent from the American Hearst newspaper in Berlin reported that the German air force is now arbitrarily bombing, and the scope of the war will expand to the Mediterranean due to Italy's participation. Germany is quite anxious about the reaction of the United States to these two events. Political figures in Berlin originally believed that Italy's participation in the war would threaten Britain and France and force them to sign a peace treaty with Germany. This hope no longer exists. Well-informed sources in Berlin also believe that Italy will join the war around the 20th of this month, or even launch it earlier. Therefore, if we want to avoid the expansion of the war and mediate peace, there are only three weeks left for intervention. However, neither Italy nor the Axis powers are in a position to launch this peace movement. The intention of this statement is obviously to encourage the United States to intervene. (Havas, 2nd)

### Italian Envoys to the Balkans Seek Attitudes of Various Countries; Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece Have Responded; Rumor Says Soviet Union Urges Germany and Italy to Maintain the Status Quo

Hungarian Capital - The "Hungarian People's Daily" recently reported that Italian envoys to various countries in the Balkan Peninsula returned to their respective governments to inquire whether those countries would remain neutral if Italy became embroiled in the war in the Mediterranean. It is reported that Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece have all given affirmative replies. The newspaper did not mention whether Italy had raised the same question to Turkey. (Havas, 2nd)

Budapest - Diplomatic figures here recently stated that if Italy does participate in the war, its scope will be limited to the Mediterranean region, and at least in the near future, it will not affect Southeast Europe. Even if it assists the Axis powers when it participates in the war, it does not mean joint operations, that is, each has its own goals. (Havas, 2nd)

Yugoslav Capital - People in Yugoslavia are closely watching Italy's attitude. Political figures here believe that the editorials in Italian newspapers and the speeches of Italian political figures can be believed that Italy is about to participate in the war, which is beyond doubt, and it only remains for the Italian Prime Minister to make this decision. Government officials believe that Italy's actions against Britain and France will not have any impact on the Balkans. Regarding the issue of Italy's participation in the war, according to a dispatch from Rome published in the "Political Daily", the Vatican believes that there is a 90% possibility that Italy will participate in the war, and the launch time will definitely not be delayed beyond the beginning of July. The "Vilerum Daily" also published an article discussing the issue, stating that countries in Southeast Europe have recently felt that the situation there has eased compared to before. At the same time, according to French records, Moscow has notified Germany and Italy that maintaining the status quo in the Balkans is in the common interest of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, people here all say that even if Italy participates in the war, the Balkans will not be threatened. (Three Seas News Agency, 3rd)

Turkish Capital - The Turkish Prime Minister broadcast a speech on Turkey's foreign policy, saying that Turkey will continue to strictly maintain neutrality. (Three Seas News Agency, 3rd)

Athens - Foreign reports say that British and French Allied forces are preparing to land in the Greek port of Salonica, and that all Greek ports and railways have been controlled by Britain. It is also reported that the Turkish radio station has been attacking Greece when broadcasting news. Therefore, the Greek authorities have banned the sale of Turkish newspapers in the country. Officials here have firmly denied all of the above, dismissing them as absurd rumors. (Havas, 2nd)

Athens - Foreign newspapers reported that Turkey has requested the Greek government to allow its troops to land on the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. Officials here have solemnly denied this. (Havas, 3rd)

### US Ambassador to Spain Suddenly Flies Back to Post; Reason Not Announced

Washington - US Ambassador to Spain, Whittell, suddenly left New York yesterday on a Pan American Airlines flight to Madrid. Apart from receiving news from Rome that Spain and Romania will agree to Italy's participation in the European war, nothing is known about the reasons for Whittell's sudden departure from the United States. (United Press, 3rd)

### Germany Renegotiates Trade Agreement with Switzerland After Expiration

Swiss Capital - Well-informed sources here recently announced that the trade agreement between Germany and Switzerland will expire on the 30th of this month. Representatives of both sides exchanged views in Berlin a week ago to renegotiate a new agreement. The meeting has now been postponed to allow each side to seek instructions from their respective governments. The Swiss representatives returned here yesterday and will continue negotiations as soon as they receive instructions. (Havas, 3rd)

### British Government Food Plan

London - Agricultural Commissioner Henderson gave a radio address yesterday afternoon, outlining the government's food plan during the war. He requested that because ships needed to transport munitions, the amount of imported fodder would be reduced, and priority would be given to cattle. The feed for pigs and poultry would be restricted, and farmers should gradually reduce the number of livestock they keep. By mid-autumn of this year, it would be necessary to reduce them to one-third. He also stated that since last September, British farmers had reduced by 70,000 people. Now it is necessary to prevent further reductions and to recall those who have left the farmland to increase agricultural production. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Spain Decides to Maintain Non-Belligerent Status; Prevents Anti-British Demonstrations

Responsible officials announced tonight that Spanish Head of State General Franco has decided that even if Italy participates in the war, Spain's non-belligerent status will not change. The anti-British demonstrations and demands for the return of Gibraltar that have occurred in Spain only represent the opinions of the radical faction of the Falange (Fascist Party) and cannot be regarded as the attitude of the Spanish officialdom. In order to avoid incorrect interpretations, the government authorities have ordered the police to disperse any such demonstrations immediately, "so that foreign elements cannot give them false goals." (Havas, 2nd)

Madrid - No further anti-British demonstrations occurred here today. After Interior Minister Su Nai returned to the capital yesterday afternoon, he strictly ordered the police to immediately stop any such incidents. Therefore, the crowds of demonstrators yesterday evening and at night were dispersed. According to responsible sources, this kind of movement is "childish." The "Aliba" newspaper (the Falange Party's official newspaper) has already explained how the country views British intentions in its articles, and there is no need to hold demonstrations, which would only hinder Spain's interests. The Aliba newspaper published an article on the 31st of last month, advocating that Britain should return Gibraltar to Spain. Today, it published another article, stating that the issue of the port of Gibraltar should not become a topic of discussion at a round table conference, but can only be resolved directly by Britain and Spain. To this day, the port has only emotional, not military, value, and should be returned to our country. Only after this issue is resolved can strong and practical friendship be established between Britain and Spain. (Havas, 2nd)

### Panama Elects New President

Panama - Arnulfo Arias, the brother of former Panamanian President Harmodio Arias, was elected as the President of the Republic of Panama yesterday. Today, officials announced that he received 90,000 votes. The country celebrated after the new president was elected. The new president declared that after taking office on October 1, he will do his best to eliminate the activities of the "Fifth Column." (United Press, 3rd)

### Japanese Prime Minister Yonai Delivers Speech

Tokyo - Prime Minister Yonai received reporters from various newspapers today, which was the first time since the adjournment of the Diet in March. It is said that after China and Japan conclude a basic treaty, it will be equivalent to Japan legally recognizing the "New Central Government." The Japanese government will continue to follow its policy of not getting involved in the whirlpool of the European war, and there may be a possibility of breaking the current unsatisfactory situation between Japan and the United States. Regarding the issue of the Dutch East Indies, the government policy remains the same as that announced by Foreign Minister Arita on May 11 and has not changed. The plan to resolve the China Incident is currently being carried out in accordance with the decided policy. He believes that negotiations between Japan and the "New Central Government" will proceed smoothly based on the basic principles agreed upon by the leaders of the "New Regime" and representatives of the Japanese government in December last year. The instructions given to Ambassador Abe, which were decided at the Xingya Academy meeting on May 31, will be sent out soon, and part of them may be announced. Yonai also said that the rumors that Japan is directly negotiating with the Chongqing government are completely untrue, but he acknowledged cooperation with the New Regime to overthrow the Chongqing government, because "the New Regime will be strengthened by the collapse of the Chongqing government. All the speculation from outside about the Four Ministers' Meeting is just worrying about nothing. The purpose of the meeting is only to exchange views on military and diplomatic affairs." Yonai finally said that although there are various rumors about the relationship between Chongqing and third countries, there have been no new developments in reality. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Tight Credit in Japanese Market; Ministry of Finance Notifies Banks to Strictly Restrict Loans

Tokyo - The major financial newspaper Chugai Business News reported that due to the tight financial situation, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has notified bankers throughout Japan to restrict loans to all commercial firms that do not have military certificates. Commercial firms that manufacture munitions and aircraft accessories but have insufficient capital of less than 500,000 yen are also included. The Asahi Shimbun also reported that the lack of funds may force the Industrial Bank of Japan, the financial cornerstone of Japan's industrial expansion program, to strictly restrict loans to industrialists who need funds to expand their businesses. The bank estimates that it will need 500 million yen in new funds this year, of which 200 million yen will be raised by issuing new bonds of the bank. More than 200 million yen will be taken from the deposit bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and part of its holdings of public bonds, totaling 100 million yen, will be transferred to raise the shortfall. However, this plan is difficult to implement because, due to the tight financial situation, it is believed that the Industrial Bank cannot raise huge sums of money in the Tokyo financial market. According to the current situation, it is difficult to ease the tight financial situation in a short period of time. The bank's directors are currently consulting with the Ministry of Finance and other parties to find a way to raise funds so that loans to industrialists implementing expansion plans do not have to be restricted. The number of people requesting loans from the Industrial Bank of Japan has decreased sharply in recent months due to the tight financial situation and because other major banks have received instructions from the government to further restrict loans, especially long-term loans. Judging from the current situation, the Industrial Bank of Japan's loans will reach 1.6 billion yen by the end of next month, and 2 billion yen by the end of the year. (Reuters, 3rd)

### US Considers Expanding the Scope of the Embargo Against Japan; Machine Scrap Iron and Other Items Will Be Included; to Avoid Obstructing National Defense Procedures

Washington - Reporters learned today that the US government is now considering implementing a moral embargo on machines exported to Japan to remove dangerous obstacles in the new national defense procedures. The wartime embargo that has already been implemented includes airplanes, metals for manufacturing airplanes, and gasoline. Previously, because Chinese civilians were brutally bombed, the US initially decided to implement a moral embargo on the tools necessary for manufacturing airplanes for the sake of humanitarian principles. Therefore, what the government is now considering is to expand the scope of the embargo. Japan has recently become one of the four largest customers of American machines. The value of machines exported to Japan has increased to $3 million per month. According to industrial leaders, a large number of machines are flowing out of the country, and there is a danger of shortages in the country, and the $500 million new national defense program is in danger of being hindered. They also hinted that the embargo may include the Soviet Union, because the amount of American machines imported by the Soviet Union is similar to that of Japan. Also, scrap iron exported to Japan may also be included in the embargoed goods. According to their opinion, the whole country should unanimously decide to give priority to domestic needs, followed by the Allied countries, and then foreign transactions. It is heard that the authorities of a certain factory have ordered their salesmen not to accept machine orders unless the machine is used in the new national defense program. If the large-scale export of machines does not stop for a long time, the indispensable tools required in the country will indeed become increasingly scarce with the surge in the production of airplanes, etc. It is heard that many people have raised this matter and requested remedies. According to current estimates, American machine production supplies $40 million per month to the UK, $6 million to France, $3 million to Japan, $3 million to the Soviet Union, and $3 million to the domestic market. In addition, the machines exported in April that require electricity to operate and manufacture metalware reached 21,281,332 units, an increase of 140% over the same month last year.

Mr. Chamberlain's trip to Berchtesgaden was decided upon hastily, but by the time he went to Godesberg, the German side had a week to prepare and arrange the reception. After Mr. Chamberlain arrived at the airfield, he and Ribbentrop drove to the Petersberg Hotel in Godesberg. The hotel was built against the mountainside, and looking out, the scenery was beautiful, with the Rhine River winding like a belt. The next morning, the Prime Minister and I strolled on the balcony, enjoying the pleasant autumn scenery, which broadened our minds, and the hotel owner was especially attentive.

Across the river was the hotel established by Mr. Treisen, an old comrade of Hitler's early struggles. Hitler frequently visited there, and it was also the source of the purges in June 1934. At 5 p.m. on September 22, Mr. Chamberlain crossed the river for the meeting. Hitler greeted him in front of the hotel and led him upstairs to the conference room, where they sat on opposite sides of a long table and began their talks. At that time, the people on the riverbank, knowing that the British Prime Minister was working for peace, were overjoyed, but Hitler himself still showed a stubborn attitude.

Mr. Chamberlain first stated that the principle of self-determination for the Germans in the Sudetenland had been agreed upon by the British, French, and Czech governments, and then he outlined the methods for a peaceful transfer.

After he finished speaking, Hitler asked again whether the British, French, and Czech governments agreed to the cession of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia. The Prime Minister replied, "Yes." At this point, there was silence, and Hitler seemed to be making up his mind. Suddenly, he said decisively, "I am very sorry, this is no longer helpful." The Prime Minister was greatly shocked and expressed his indignation, saying that this was not enough to meet Germany's expectations, and it was inappropriate to return home with new demands.

Hitler then claimed that these were the demands of Hungary and Poland. He was friendly with the Poles and should do his best to help them. The Prime Minister replied that the demands of Hungary and Poland were not as urgent as the problem of the Germans in the Sudetenland and that other matters should be discussed only after this problem was resolved. Hitler said that the delay was too long and flatly refused to consider it, and even demanded that all German-speaking areas should be immediately ceded for German troops to occupy. The Prime Minister also refused. After three hours of heated debate, they dispersed without any results.

The negotiations were at a complete stalemate the next night and the following day. Although the two sides had exchanged documents, the situation did not change. Hitler was getting more and more demanding and had no sincerity for reconciliation. Godesberg was the turning point in Anglo-German relations. Hitler had made a major political mistake here. Although the Prime Minister was deceived by him, the British people's anti-Hitler attitude was irreversible. At that time, British newspapers were already saying that the negotiations had broken down, and the British authorities had informed the Czech government that if Czechoslovakia mobilized, it might lead to war, but they were not in a position to dissuade it.

But the Prime Minister was still patient. At 5 p.m. that day, he instructed me and Sir Wilson to meet with Ribbentrop to ask Hitler to explain his attitude specifically in a formal document. He also expected that Hitler would still reject the request, citing the verbal suggestions he had made during yesterday's talks. However, the pro-war faction in Germany had not yet gained the upper hand, and Hitler, seeing the German people's high expectations for Chamberlain, was unwilling to break off negotiations, so he ordered Ribbentrop to come and inform us that a memorandum would be presented that evening. At 10:30 that night, talks resumed, lasting a long time. Hitler even slightly delayed the date of the occupation of the Sudetenland, personally deleted and revised the memorandum, slightly reducing its harsh demands, and said to the Prime Minister, "I only make concessions to you." (Note: Chamberlain returned to London on September 24 and wrote to Hitler himself on September 26. On September 27, Hitler replied, claiming that his proposal "did not harm the independence of Czechoslovakia.")

At 11 p.m. on September 27, I went to the German Foreign Ministry to meet with Foreign Secretary Weizsäcker to submit a reply to the German proposal, instructing him to translate it and present it to Hitler immediately. It stated that the French and Czech governments had agreed to the transfer of the Sudetenland on October 1, which was closer to Hitler's demands, and eventually formed the basis of the Munich Agreement. That night, when I went to sleep, I thought there was little hope, because without new developments, German troops would mobilize completely the next afternoon at 2 p.m. and enter Czechoslovakia.

At 7 a.m. the next morning, I received a call from French Ambassador François-Poncet, who said that he had received instructions to submit the same reply to Hitler. Three hours later, Ambassador François-Poncet called again, saying that the situation was dire, and he had not yet received a reply to his request to see Hitler, fearing that Hitler would not meet with him. I then called Göring and told him that the French ambassador's request to see Hitler had not been granted, which was the key to war and peace. Göring immediately asked to meet with Hitler.

I then visited the French ambassador, when news came from the Prime Minister's Office that Hitler had scheduled a meeting with François-Poncet at 11:15 a.m. I also received a telegram from London, instructing me to immediately deliver the Prime Minister's last personal letter to Hitler. The gist of it was that Germany could achieve its wishes without resorting to war, and Chamberlain would come to Berlin immediately to discuss the whole issue with Hitler and the representatives of France and Italy. Would Hitler not be willing to delay for a few days and bear the responsibility of starting a world war?

The situation was urgent and dangerous, and the events were worth recounting. Between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m., Göring met with Hitler, and Bodenschatz also arrived uninvited. Both Göring and Bodenschatz advocated a peaceful solution. Göring even shouted loudly, strongly criticizing Ribbentrop's arrogance, saying that war was dangerous and should not be fought lightly. However, if the Führer ordered an attack, he would not hesitate to personally lead the air force, and Ribbentrop should also go to the front line at that time. Göring's advice contributed to Hitler's abandonment of the use of force against Czechoslovakia.

Hitler then met with the French ambassador, and at 11:40 a.m., the Italian ambassador also arrived with an urgent appeal from Mussolini. Hitler left the room to meet with him. Mussolini called for a 24-hour postponement of mobilization. This was the last key to maintaining peace. Hitler then seized the opportunity to change course. I succeeded Ambassador François-Poncet at 12:15 p.m. Hitler's first words were, "I have agreed to my dear friend Mussolini's request to postpone mobilization for 24 hours."

When I entered the Prime Minister's Office, I saw the moderate military adjutants in the hall, all relieved. A friend even whispered to me, "The situation is improving, I hope you will work hard." When I entered the cabinet room, I saw Göring and Bodenschatz leaving. After seeing Hitler, I handed him the Prime Minister's personal letter. Hitler replied that he had to consult with Mussolini before he could answer. Then he discussed the recent replies from the British and French governments, which had to be harmonious. Although Hitler seemed a little aloof, his words were reasonable. After more than an hour, the Italian ambassador visited for the second time, saying that Mussolini had accepted the British proposal to convene a four-power conference.

While Hitler was in the room meeting with the Italian ambassador, I argued with Ribbentrop.

There were various factors that caused Hitler to pull back from the brink, but without Mussolini's mediation, no one could have made him change his mind. This can be seen from Hitler's emphasis on Mussolini's personal visit to Munich. On Wednesday, the situation was extremely dangerous. The Italian ambassador visited Hitler's door four times in three hours, and there were about 20 telephone calls to and from Rome. Afterwards, Mussolini gave the female telephone operator who managed the calls 2,000 lira, as a reward for her hard work.

### Prices in Kangding Rise Consistently, Rice at $200 per Dan

The North-China Daily News Kangting (Tachienlu) correspondent reported on April 23: Prices here continue to rise. Recently, I ordered my maid to buy , which weighed slightly more than two catties, and she was charged eight yuan, which stunned her. Dr. Barr, who resides in Ba'an (i.e., Batang, 20 days' journey west of Kangting), asked me to send some kerosene there. Currently, kerosene in this city sells for 250 yuan per can of 27 catties, and 11 yuan per catty retail. Buying four cans would cost 1,000 yuan, and hiring a cow to transport them would cost three yuan per day. Kangting has several military factories, and each lamp costs only 2.50 yuan per month, but other things are extremely expensive. Rice, 130 catties per dan, now sells for 200 yuan, flour 80 yuan per 100 catties, and corn flour, which is eaten by the poor, 60 yuan per 100 catties. Sweet potatoes from the French church are the cheapest food, and one yuan can buy four catties. A Chinese woman from Kuala Lumpur recently bought six eggs for one yuan. The poor must now be having a very difficult time. A year ago, corn flour sold for only one dime per catty, and sweet potatoes for a few cents per catty, so the average person could live comfortably on only five dimes a day. Now, due to the high cost of everything, hiring ordinary laborers also costs 1.50 to 2 yuan per day. A week ago, Dr. Agnew arrived here from Chengdu by sedan chair and returned by the same sedan chair, which was cheaper than hiring a sedan chair in Kangting. Mr. Grat went to Ya'an recently, and the sedan chair carriers charged as much as five yuan per day. Matches cost 1.5 dimes per box, and only one in five sticks is flammable. Poor quality candles cost four yuan per package of six. Sugar costs 2.60 yuan per catty, and some is mixed with corn flour. As for salt, coolies carry it from Tseliutsing for a month and sell it for 1.50 yuan per catty. Salt from Chagyarmu, Tibet, is carried by cows and also takes 30 days, costing one yuan per catty, but it is not very clean. In view of the high cost of living in the border areas, the post office has given very high subsidies to staff in areas where rice prices are high. Mail carriers have especially benefited. For example, a monthly salary of 30 yuan in Ya'an is sufficient to make ends meet, but it is not enough in Kangting. Now that they have received subsidies from the post office, postal workers are generally satisfied.

### Truth About the Dispute in the Sino-French International Mini-Soccer Match

Chen Youji Was Not Sent Off: Statement by the Chinese Team Leader

During the semi-final of the International Cup the other day, in the Sino-French match, during the final two minutes, unfortunately, Chinese team winger Chen Yuanji clashed with French Army right-back Wenqi while contesting the ball. At this time, the French Army, being behind in goals, became resentful and their actions grew increasingly rough. Mr. Wenqi even raised his hand to strike. Chen Yuanji, restrained by management, initially did not retaliate. However, this incident incited a confrontation between the audience and the French Army. A certain French expatriate even threatened Glee Club Chairman Yan Yongchang with a pistol, and the situation became quite serious for a moment. Referee Wang Shoufang, in order to avoid a major misunderstanding, continued the match and ordered the perpetrator, Wen, off the field. But at the same time, in order to divert the attention of the audience, he also ordered Chen Yuanji to take a temporary break away from the field. However, because the time was very short, exceeding the prescribed time by two minutes, Chen Yuanji was unable to re-enter the field. Therefore, some bystanders criticized Chen Yuanji for being unfairly sent off. However, there is a difference between being sent off and taking a temporary break, so Chinese team leader Pan Huifang issued a solemn statement yesterday to avoid unpleasantness.

### Finance: Buying Frenzy Intensifies, Foreign Exchange Rates Surge Sharply, HSBC Listing Revised Downward in the Afternoon

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's initial listing at 9:30 AM was even. The second announcement at 2:15 PM in the afternoon showed both British and American exchange rates revised downward by 125, calculated as 3 pence and 75 shillings for the pound and 5 yuan for the US dollar. There was no market for German and Dutch currencies. Other currencies also uniformly followed suit and were revised downward. The unofficial market situation changed suddenly today, with tight prices emerging one after another. The British pound had already entered the range of 4 pence, and the US dollar nearly broke the 5 yuan mark. This was due to the intense buying frenzy for British bank notes and strong demand from Chinese banks. Hong Kong Electric and local speculators followed the trend and competed to settle, causing the trend to tighten rapidly. Commercial banks dealing in Dutch, Belgian, and Italian currencies had no transactions, and other foreign banks also had little intention to sell. The short position was quite tight, which was also a reason for the tightening. The outlook is severe. Chinese banks continued to aggressively purchase, and the US dollar was already seen at a tight price of 5 yuan. Subsequently, speculators and exporters sold slightly, and a certain American bank sold more than 300,000 US dollars. It was reported that exporters also came to sell, which began to stop the tightening from slightly retracting, ultimately reaching 3 pence and 875 shillings for the pound and 5 yuan and 125 for the US dollar, calculated as 17,1875 for British and 2,125 for US. The market then turned to fluctuate and be uncertain, with extremely limited trading.

British Pound Enters 4 Pence

At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was unchanged. Compared with Shanghai, it shrank by 0.0625. There was no change compared with France. Compared with the British pound, the US dollar fell by 2.75. Compared with Shanghai, it was even. Compared with France, it was slightly less than 1.25. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's morning opening, the spot selling price was 4 pence and 0.046875 shillings for the British pound and 5 yuan and 40625 for the US dollar. Compared with last Saturday's close, the British pound was even and the US dollar was tight by 0.03125. This was due to the drop in the exchange rate. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric first came to purchase, and the market immediately softened. It was calculated that Zhejiang sold US dollars for June to Hong Kong Electric at a price of 5 yuan and 21875. HSBC's listing was unchanged upon the first announcement. The silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease. After this, Chinese banks, Chinese merchants, speculators, and Youli uniformly aggressively purchased US dollars for June, buying from American banks and foreign banks, with the price rising from 5 yuan and 21875 to 125. However, the trend continued to tighten because Chinese banks were still aggressively purchasing, and foreign banks were unwilling to supply. The spot pound was available for 4 pence and 0.03125 shillings and 4 pence when Chinese banks entered foreign banks. It was also reported that due to the strong appetite of Chinese banks, the tightening frenzy was even more severe at noon. Spot US dollars were traded at 5 yuan and 1875, and it was very difficult to settle. Spot pounds had already broken the 4 pence mark.

Compared with the spot price opened in the morning, the British pound was tight by 1 ()9375 and the US dollar shrank by 21875. Futures also softened.

US Dollar Nearly Breaks 5 Yuan

The tightening frenzy continued unabated in the afternoon. Chinese banks continued to aggressively purchase, and foreign banks also came to settle. The market price was extraordinarily tight. It was calculated that an American bank sold spot US dollars to Chinese banks and foreign banks, reaching 5 yuan from 5 yuan and 1875. HSBC's second listing was revised downward, with both British and American exchange rates tightening by 125. Fortunately, an American bank uniquely released 300,000 US dollars. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and speculators sold slightly, stabilizing the situation somewhat. At that time, foreign banks entered Chinese speculators for June at 5 yuan and 0625. Exporters also sold pounds for June at 3 pence and 8125. However, the trend remained strong before closing. As a result, the British pound was 3 pence and 875, the US dollar was 5 yuan and 125, the June pound was 3 pence and 78125, the US dollar was 5 yuan and 03125, the July pound was 3 pence and 65625, and the US dollar was 4 yuan and 78125.

### People's Hearts are Extremely Excited, Gold Market Rises Fiercely, Reaching a Maximum of 6,490 Yuan

The cash cooked gold unofficial market situation yesterday rose sharply, reaching a maximum of 6,490 yuan. This internal exchange market is extremely tight, and a gold rush is inevitable. It was reported in the morning to be 6,060 yuan, but it had already risen by 35 yuan compared with last weekend's close. After entering, the exchange market reported a softening, and money changers first entered, temporarily rising to 6,180 yuan. However, banks and retail investors were willing to sell at this price, causing the selling to be small at 6,125 yuan. Finally, due to the sharp contraction in the exchange market, gold shops and others aggressively searched, buying fever expanded, and sellers stopped closing. A small number of price adjustments were made to supply. By the time of the midday close, it had jumped to 6,320 yuan. The rising momentum became sharper in the afternoon. Initially, it was 6,380 yuan. It was further reported that foreign exchange continued to shrink, and gold shops and banks helped to aggressively absorb. The high price of 6,490 yuan was quickly realized. Subsequently, some negative news from Europe was rumored, and the eye exchange market also reported a rebound, suddenly stirring up powerlessness, and retail investors tended to sell. Also, securities firms, banks, and others also poured out. The lowest was once 6,250 yuan. As a result, it was 6,330 yuan, an increase of 305 yuan compared with the previous day. The total transaction volume was about 4,000 taels. Jewelry gold shops rose by 30 yuan. Customs gold and others remained level.

Cooked Gold Rises Violently by 305 Yuan

From the morning, a certain money changer initially came to aggressively enter each bar (ten taels), and it was raised by 35 yuan. Fifty taels were entered by banks and others, for 6,060 yuan. Subsequently, because a certain money changer continuously and forcefully purchased, and the exchange market tightened, securities firms also purchased, and it rose sharply by 120 yuan. Thirty taels were entered by gold shops and banks, for 6,180 yuan. Subsequently, the buying appetite gradually weakened, and banks helped to close first and then pour out, and it immediately returned by a small amount of 55 yuan. Twenty taels were taken by banks to securities firms, for 6,125 yuan. After this, because foreign exchange was still tight, the buying fever started again. A certain money changer, securities firm, and gold shops searched each other, and the price slowly rose again. Until the time of closing, it had rushed out of the 6,300 yuan mark. Thirty taels were taken by gold shops to banks, for 6,320 yuan, as the midday close price. The potential was even stronger after the close. There were transactions at 6,360 yuan. When the afternoon opened, the scene was even better. Gold shops did ten taels each, for 6,380 yuan. Following that, because a certain securities firm repeatedly poured out, and banks also sold at that time, it took a small step of 50 yuan. Fifty taels were issued by banks to gold shops, for 6,330 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, a certain gold shop began to aggressively purchase, and the banks also turned from selling to buying. And foreign exchange was extremely tight, and many retail investors firmly held on and refused to release. It also leaped again by 160 yuan. Thirty taels were taken by gold shops to banks, for 6,490 yuan. It was expected that after this, some negative rumors from Europe suddenly came, and the selling fever suddenly intensified. Securities firms and banks tended to compete to close first. Before long, it fell back by 240 yuan. Banks did fifty taels each, for 6,250 yuan. After entering, money changers bought in, and raised it again by 80 yuan. Twenty taels were entered by money changers into gold shops, for 6,330 yuan, as the evening close price. As a result, it squeezed up by 305 yuan compared with last weekend. The fluctuation was 430 yuan throughout the day. The cash price of gold sold by gold shops was higher than the cooked gold by several tens of yuan, and the closing was reduced by about 30 yuan. Currently, the standard gold price is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there are few open transactions.

Jewelry is Suspended High at 650 Yuan

When jewelry gold was initially exchanged per tael, Da Tong Hang still suspended at 620 yuan. By 9:30, it was raised by 10 yuan. In another 40 minutes, it was another 10 yuan. At 12:00, it was raised by another 10 yuan. At 2:00, it was also raised by 10 yuan. At 3:00, it fell back by 10 yuan. As a result, it rose by a good 30 yuan. It was calculated that Da Tong Hang changed to suspend at 650 yuan. The new peers have the same price as the previous price, and the closing was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Slightly Decline After Rising

The foreign currency market situation yesterday: cooked gold flew up sharply, and there was strong demand for British and American gold pounds. Market prices uniformly rose. British gold notes had an increasingly strong shrinking trend in the black market for British exchange rates, so demand from all parties was also high. The market price continued to rise very sharply. American gold notes still rose to 19 yuan and 8 jiao due to speculators aggressively purchasing foreign exchange. After 2:30, American commercial banks successively poured out American exchange rates, amounting to 300,000 US dollars. Therefore, speculators' purchasing intentions suddenly faded, and American gold notes therefore retreated to 19 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen. However, compared with last Saturday, it still squeezed and rose by one yuan. Hong Kong notes followed the Hong Kong exchange rate and rose sharply. In addition, the demand for notes such as the French franc, Annam, Canada, and the Philippines was also high, and market prices uniformly rose very sharply. The falling trend of Japanese gold notes has already been recorded. The evening market was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 and a half cents. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained even, and the evening market was still 9 jiao and 6 fen.

### Discount Rate Squeezes Up by Five Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for HSBC's drawn bills slightly increased. Initially, the rate for each thousand yuan was 121 yuan when entering in the morning, and it required 126 yuan to release. Later, it rose to 130 yuan. At noon, it was around 127 and a half. The afternoon trend stabilized at about 127 yuan, an increase of five yuan compared with last Saturday. The Money Industry Association's interest rate remained unchanged. It squeezed up five yuan. The Money Industry Association's interest rate remained unchanged. It was reported that both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 2 jiao and 5 fen.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks are Cold and Uninteresting, Domestic Bonds are Subject to Individual Preferences

The securities unofficial market situation yesterday completely rose or fell depending on individual preferences. It temporarily did not seem to shift with the environment. In addition to a few temporarily having some entry and exit due to loan relationships, the majority of purposes had not moved at all. Yesterday morning, number 14 was bought, and Shuntai was sold. In the afternoon, Shuntai was bought, and Lianhe was sold. The highs and lows of market prices were determined by their different purposes. Type A was superior, and there was quite a bit of collecting of Type A while abandoning the others. Type D was the most sluggish, so no one inquired about it at all. As a result, market prices were uneven. Type A was better by 2 jiao, while the rest were small by about 1 jiao. However, there were not many transactions, still less than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Revenue Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 59.95 59.75 59.95 Rose 0.20

Unified B 51.25 ...... 51.25 Fell 0.15

Unified C 49.40 49.30 49.40 Fell 0.10

Unified D ...... ...... ...... ......

Unified E 49.90 49.70 49.8 Fell 0.15

Stock trading: The Commercial Press set up 50 shares, priced at 75 yuan.

There are few transactions in public stocks, and such a desolate scene has not been seen for a long time. The total turnover for the whole day was only 227,900 shares. Operators seem to be awaiting the development of the situation, and there is very little to attract attention in the market. Prices are trending downward. Sellers have no selling pressure, and buyers are very hesitant. British Union shares opened at 31 and a half yuan, gradually falling to a low price of 28 yuan and 25. Later, they rebounded to 30 yuan and 25, and finally closed at 29 and a half yuan. The degree of rise and fall of Yihe shares was narrower than this. Rubber shares were completely ignored. Prices were stable, and shares at very low prices were not easy to buy.

### Grains: Large Siam Rice Order Confirmed, Another 8,710 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday, Changqing Special Japonica Rice Unofficial Market Actually Demanded 60 Yuan

The foreign rice market saw another rise yesterday. It was affected by the tightening of the exchange market in the morning, and people's hearts were unusually excited. Moreover, the appetite of the inland gangs of Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing has been enduring. Hangzhou and Shaoxing absorbed various types of short-grain Siamese rice, and Ningbo continued to handle Saigon. The early market once rose by more than two yuan. Then, because the telegram order for Siamese rice from last week was confirmed by telegram, the market suddenly rebounded. Short-grain rice opened at 52 yuan and rose to 52 and a half yuan. The midday close returned to 51 yuan and 8 jiao. However, it was again bought by actual consumers and floating households in the afternoon, and the market once again rose. Short-grain Puxi warehouses reached 52 yuan and 8 jiao, and East warehouses reached 52 yuan and 6 jiao. The Saigon No. 2 transshipment of the Yinghua Company was competed for by the Ningbo gang, with the price reaching 68 yuan, which was three yuan higher than Saturday. Hong Kong rice of Yinghua Company also reached 64 yuan and a half. It was calculated that the turnover of returned rice was more than 200 tons, and there were more than 10,000 bags of spot goods. However, the re-telegram confirmation of Siamese rice yesterday was 4,500 tons of No. 2 rice, priced at 59 yuan and 9 jiao, and 500 tons of No. 1 rice, priced at 57 yuan. In addition, there are still two or three batches waiting for telegrams. Shanghai's inventory is sufficient, and new orders are constant. The rise in market prices should not be sustainable.

In addition, foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yih Ho Foreign Firm's Mingsheng transported 8,710 bags from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (2nd). It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. (Zu)

Although the arrival of glutinous rice is rare, its sales are not as wide as other goods. Therefore, it is not able to compete with Japonica rice and high-quality rice, which are seasonal goods. It can only be sold as a follow-up product. It was calculated that special Jinli rice was sold at 47 yuan, Changdan white rice at 45 and 6 yuan, and Jiangbei white rice at 43 and 4 yuan.

The source of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice is still difficult to connect because the rough price in the production area is soaring, making it even more desolate. No goods from the southern gang have arrived at the port. Only 600 to 700 bags of goods from the northern gang have arrived. It is rumored that the outside unofficial market treats all goods as rare, and is tighter than foreign rice. The asking price is flying wildly, and it has completely lost its standards. The Chang gang's clean special Japonica rice has been shouted to the 60 yuan mark, but it has not been realized. Later, it opened at 59 yuan and 58 yuan and 6 jiao. Chang Kun Japonica rice was 57 and 8 yuan. The next batch of old goods was 54 and 5 yuan. Qing Si ordinary thin rice was 55 and 6 yuan. Nangang early rice was 55 yuan and 7 jiao. It seemed to rise sharply by varying degrees compared with the previous market, with some rising by as much as three yuan.

### Flour Market Customer Disk Rises Frequently

Nearly Two Yuan Difference from the Local Disk

Yesterday, the current flour trading was still lively. In addition to the zero-volume demand in this street, both the northern and southern gangs had scattered additions. However, the amount of transactions was not large. The customer disk rose frequently, reaching a high price of 15 yuan and 7 jiao. There was a difference of nearly two yuan from the local disk. The No. 2 flour local disk was still 13 yuan and 8 jiao. In order to maintain its nature, each factory temporarily did not increase the price, so local sales were also more greedy. The stock of inland flour arrived in two dries. There were only shouting prices, and there was no formal market. The market atmosphere was still prosperous because the gold market and rice prices were high and the problem of transporting new wheat from the mainland to Shanghai had not yet been resolved. There was still no market for wheat. Also, 14,360 bags of flour and 1,300 bags of bran, and 1,480 bags of wheat were shipped to Xiamen.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation is Active, the Yarn Market Rises Sharply

The yarn market is trending upward, and the rising trend is gradually emerging. This is because the foreign exchange, which has been stable for a long time, has seen a rebound. The tighter gold prices have made speculators more active. At the same time, although the Hong Kong gang has no large demand, sporadic purchases continue unabated. Therefore, the market is one step tighter. However, a certain yarn trend has not yet been resolved, and the selling price is cheaper by 200 yuan to 300 yuan.

The current yarn opening in the morning was because the foreign exchange was revised down the day before, and the popularity has been tight and hovering for a long time. It was reported that the exchange rate was firm and rising, and the buying wind did not decrease. It was directly priced at 1,360 yuan. However, some profit-takers closed, and it fell by 10 yuan to 20 yuan. The closing was one step better. It was found that the turnover statistics for half a day were 1,405 packages. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan. Today, 124 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Peers 70 Hong Kong 625

Xiamen 10 Statistics 1,405

### Although the Yarn Market Rose, Cotton Prices Remained Ordinary

There were very few transactions in this cotton, but foreign cotton mills had a slight need. However, the market remained ordinary. In recent days, there has been a large overseas source, so although the yarn market rose, the cotton market was unable to follow. The current cotton transaction situation is as follows: Omla 203.50 Peers enter 100 pieces Kangjianghua 20.00 Yufeng enters 200 pieces Brazilian cotton 78.00 Yongan enters 200 pieces

Another message: foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, was quite tired in the early morning due to the pressure of selling efforts. Later, spot merchants sold, and some bulls closed. As a result, the closing prices of each month all fell by one pound sound. The Indian cotton market was still stable. Yesterday, including the forecast, it rose by more than one rupee.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions rose sharply again yesterday due to the fall in exchange rates, and the cotton price converted was huge. The intentions of all parties were quite firm, but transactions were very thin. Transactions in the Tianjin gang have gradually loosened, so all parties are quite optimistic about the future of raw cotton. The cotton market yesterday, converted at a US exchange rate of 5 yuan and 125, the futures are sent to the factory as follows:

20 count US meter Turin 20.80 Also Also Lower Grade 310.20
32 count Also 342.20 Also Also Lower Grade 331.00
42 count Also 346.60 Also Also Lower Grade 335.70

### Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Beans are Gradually Launched

Yesterday, the Minhang new green broad beans were allocated by peers because the amount that arrived was only a small number of packages, and they were not openly traded in the market. It was heard that the price was still 19 yuan. Currently, the Nanyang gang is asking about it, causing the market to secretly show a tight trend. Other new broad beans from various regions have also gradually been launched. The Jiading white new broad beans have already been seen in sample yesterday. The products are still excellent, and the market is about 20 yuan. However, it is necessary to look at the Northern Ocean gang's purchasing appetite as a target. Also, 2,836 packages of beans and 182 packages of sorghum were shipped to Xiamen today.

### Oil Cake: Oil Cake's Rising Trend is Vigorous

Yesterday, the oil cake market situation was greatly shaken by the encouragement of the rising price of gold. The inland route for soybean oil was not weak. The actual sales of soybean cake were only a small number of inquiries with the chemical gang. The overall situation was because of the line-up push, so the price was tightening more and more. As a result, oil rose by four or five yuan, and cake continued to stand firm by two or three jiao. It was calculated that 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded. The price is detailed in the market price column. 500 cans of Jiangbei local workshop raw oil, 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, 600 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybeans, 210 cans of Yantai Qilu soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil, Dayouyu four-brand cake, 48,000 cake pieces, and 2,000 pieces of Tongsheng Shengji cake and 5,000 pieces of Changji cake.

Also, 600 cans of raw oil and 13,010 sheets of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen today.

### Silk and Tea: High Price of Native Raw Silk in the Interior, Extremely High Price of Cocoons in Wuxi

Yesterday, the spot price of raw silk in Yokohama was 1495 yuan, the near-term price was 1500 yuan, and the long-term price was 1535 yuan, a decrease of 10 to 20 yuan compared to last week. In the local silk market, 20 dan of "Xinfu" brand white silk from the Bai factory were priced at 5200 yuan at 70-80% quality, and grade B uneven silk was priced at 5050 yuan. Although the price of "Jili" silk with secondary brands had been raised to 2400 yuan by foreign firms, no one was willing to trade due to the high price of native raw silk in the interior. Recently, white native silk from the Nanxun area was priced at 135-140 yuan per 100 taels, an increase of 10 yuan compared to last week, which is equivalent to an increase of 160 yuan per dan.

Furthermore, regarding cocoon news, cocoon prices in Wuxi are expected to be very high. Improved breeds from the Northeast Road are priced at 400 yuan, and those from the South Road are priced at 450 yuan. This spring, cocoon prices, whether in the Zhejiang Road or the Beijing-Shanghai area, have increased nearly tenfold compared to the previous year. Therefore, the cost of silk is high, and although there is still a substantial profit, the risk is also greater than in previous years.

Regarding artificial rayon from Hong Kong, it continues to arrive in a steady stream. Yesterday, 285 cases were transported by the Yih Ho & Co.'s Ming Sheng steamer.

### Tea Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai Both Decline

Due to the expansion of the European war, shipping disruptions, and a sharp decline in sales by foreign firms, the foreign trade of Chinese tea has been affected. In the Shanghai market, only a few dozen to a hundred or so boxes of new and old red and green tea are traded daily. The selling price of new tea, especially premium grades, has fallen from 570-580 yuan to 450-460 yuan, and standard premium grades have fallen from 470-480 yuan to 350-360 yuan. The selling price of old tea, especially premium grades, has also fallen from 420-430 yuan to 280-290 yuan, and standard premium grades have fallen to 150-160 yuan. In Hong Kong, there are still over 100,000 boxes of red and green tea from various regions. The market prices of tea from Qimen and Tunxi have also plummeted by 20-30 yuan to 40 yuan or more.

### Piece Goods: Strong Sales of Local Ramie Cloth

Ramie and hemp cloth manufactured in Shanghai has been selling quite well recently. Due to the high price and shortage of imported goods, sales have been particularly brisk. The "Yinfeng Xing" brand can also obtain transportation licenses, leading to strong demand in the interior. Yesterday, the guild reported sales of 80+ bolts. Yellow cloth was priced at 1.6 yuan, and white cloth at 1.7 yuan. "Zhenxin Jinxing" brand cloth sold 20+ bolts to tailors on this street, with the top grade priced at 1.75 yuan and the second grade at 1.5 yuan.

### Southern Cloth Sales Show New Activity

The cloth market has been stimulated by the sharp rise in raw materials and yarn prices, but actual sales remain weak. Wholesalers are also less active, and the volume of transactions has increased slightly. The upward pressure on selling prices is weak. Some fine cloth and fine twill have increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt, while coarse cloth has increased by 2.5 jiao. The price increases of bleached and dyed cloth also vary. Local dealers are more active, selling over 500 pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Ningbo dealers sold over 200 bolts of coarse cloth, fine twill, and colored twill. Singaporean dealers sold several thousand bolts of bleached and dyed cloth and printed cloth. 30 pieces of cloth were shipped to Xiamen on the 4th.

On East Cloth Street, trading was brisk throughout the day among fellow traders and dyers. Fine cloth rose by 1.5 to 1.75 yuan per bolt, and serge rose sharply by about 1 jiao per yard. Twelve-pound "Longtou" fine cloth was offered at 43.25 yuan for future delivery. "Four Gentlemen" serge was priced at 1.185 yuan. The East Cotton Mill offered over 200 bales of this month's "Lan Shuang Yu Baobei" brand fine twill. Local buyers purchased nearly a thousand pieces of spot fine cloth and fine twill.

### Sugar Market: Prices of Both Raw and Refined Sugar Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market turned firm due to the tight foreign exchange situation. The guild's listed price for spot No. 24 raw white sugar from local warehouses was 72 yuan in the morning, up half a yuan. The price for foreign warehouses was 72 to 72.35 yuan in the morning. The market was even tighter in the afternoon, initially at 73 yuan, and then reaching 73.4 yuan, an increase of 2.2 yuan.

The National Sugar Company had 93 bags of "Dia Qing" sugar arriving by ship, priced at 62.5 yuan, only slightly less than before. The market may continue to tighten.

### Metals: Cheap American Bar Iron is Selling Well

The market for American bar iron has been quite active recently. Local canneries, cigarette factories, toy factories, and printing factories have considerable demand, and small retail buyers are also making occasional purchases. After prices in various trading houses eased, the price of American bar iron also fell, making the cheap goods a target for various manufacturers, leading to a lively market and optimistic sentiment. Yesterday, the quoted price for assorted grades was 145 yuan per case, small assorted grades were 125 yuan per 200 pounds, and large sizes were priced at over 160 yuan per case. It is estimated that about 200-300 cases were traded yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Red Dates Expected to Tighten

According to a letter from a Qingdao trader, all the local "Fu" red dates, etc., are controlled by a certain party. Since the first of this month, foreign exchange must be purchased for export. Even if there are other flexible arrangements, the cost will inevitably increase. Therefore, miscellaneous grades of red dates are expected to tighten. Yesterday, "Fu" red dates from neighboring counties were sold for 28 yuan, and ordinary red dates for 20 yuan, and further increases are anticipated.

28 cases of dried longan arrived from Xiamen yesterday.

Hygiene for Both Sexes

### The Strength or Weakness of a Husband's Reproductive Function Can Affect His Wife's Happiness at Any Time

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science, Russian Labor University

No matter how eloquent the reasons given for a couple's harmony or discord, they are always closely related to the strength or weakness of the husband's sexual function.

How to Achieve Marital Love? This means that a couple can indeed be harmonious and inseparable after marriage. However, this love is not easy to obtain, so many couples end up in discord after marriage, with no happiness at all. Or, although they appear harmonious, they secretly complain and sigh. Or, although they are nominally husband and wife, they are not as close as nodding acquaintances. Or, they even argue and quarrel, even going to court for separation or divorce. Therefore, once a couple becomes estranged, tragic events of separation or death can occur, which is extremely dangerous!

Therefore, to study the issue of marriage, one must first understand the reasons for their harmony and the factors that lead to their estrangement. However, based on observation of the facts, no matter how eloquent the reasons given for their harmony or discord, they are always related to the strength or weakness of their sexual function. Because if there is a lack of sexual mediation between men and women, they certainly cannot cooperate. Especially when the husband suffers from kidney deficiency, impotence, and other problems, it is simply more bad luck than good!

Therefore, if there are phenomena such as kidney deficiency and impotence during intercourse, one should quickly seek reasonable treatment and not randomly use medication. One must avoid purchasing and taking pills. Only by taking "Bouti Kang," a German strong animal youthful glandular preparation for men, can one restore their reproductive function, increase essence and replenish blood, strengthen the brain and consolidate the kidneys. This preparation is also effective for treating brain weakness, insomnia, back pain, and everywhere else. Because "Bouti Kang" contains not only chimpanzee testicular extract, but also brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-replenishing iron, and bone-strengthening calcium, it can provide comprehensive nourishment. To know that love between men and women depends entirely on the coordination of both sexes. If the husband's performance is weak and cannot satisfy his wife's emotions, how can they respect each other as guests and love each other like glue? As winter ends and spring arrives, women's need for love becomes more urgent due to physiological reasons. At this time, if a husband has the above shortcomings, quickly supplement with "Bouti Kang" to achieve miraculous effects. The women's "Bouti Kang" is a true strong animal ovarian endocrine preparation, which functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, and treats anemia and premature aging. Its effects are miraculous and are praised by renowned gynecologists around the world as the most advanced gynecological medicine.

### Case of Cured Kidney Deficiency from Early Marriage

— Zheng, German Doctor of Medicine

Patient Shi Xueyi, 21 years old, from Chang'an, Zhejiang Province, suffered from kidney deficiency and physical weakness due to early marriage. Not only could he not perform the duties of husband and wife, but he was also excessively weak, with frequent seminal emissions and a withered appearance. (Self-description) - At the age of sixteen, I was ordered by my parents to marry a certain woman. Four months after marriage, I felt weak. Before marriage, I had engaged in masturbation, but it was not excessive. Although I had seminal emissions, they were only once or twice a week. After marriage, the seminal emissions worsened, reaching five times a week at most and at least two or three times. But I also knew that it was caused by physical weakness and excessive sexual desire. Now I have completely lost my sexual function. (Treatment Process) - I diagnosed that Mr. Shi's problem was due to early marriage and the destruction of his reproductive glands. He should strengthen the sperm duct and cultivate the prosperity of the reproductive glands. I used the famous German medicine "Nai Ersi Seminal Emission Tablets" to stop seminal emissions, and the testicular endocrine tonic "Bouti Kang" to replenish his losses. I also administered electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day. In less than two months, the seminal emissions were cured, and his essence was sufficient, his brain was healthy, his appetite was strong, and his weight increased by seven pounds. He was also able to perform complete reproductive functions.

Medical Science of Gonorrhea

### The Complete Solution to the Rampant Gonorrhea

— Dr. Wang Ke, German Physician

Why is gonorrhea so rampant? Whether in Eastern or Western countries, wherever there are people, there are traces of it. The reason for this is related to economics. Looking at cities with economic competition, the number of people suffering from venereal diseases is much larger. So, when the economic downturn sweeps across the entire land and people have no way to solve their food problems, how can they have the strength to seek sexual desire and marry a wife? Therefore, under capitalism, mankind deeply feels the threat of economic panic. Marriage can only be enjoyed by the propertied class. These vast masses of poor people or the petty bourgeoisie can only regard marriage as a burden and dare not even think about it.

But physiologically, people with and without money are no different. They all seek comfort from the opposite sex, so prostitution has become a widespread phenomenon in society. It is no wonder that gonorrhea is becoming increasingly prevalent. According to research by renowned scholars, the first and most terrible crisis for people with gonorrhea, whether men or women, is periostitis and arthritis. This often causes disability of the limbs and hunching of the back. Secondly, gonorrhea further enters the bone marrow, which can lead to sudden death. Regarding the treatment of such gonorrhea, according to a world-renowned paper published by Dr. Kolmann, the most famous gonorrhea expert in Germany, in 1932, the most effective treatment for all new and chronic gonorrhea is "Kelinong," invented in Germany. Because "Kelinong" is made of a mixture of protein and yellow pigment, its bactericidal power directly reaches the lesion and surrounds the gonococci. Therefore, its bactericidal power reaches the superficial mucosa externally and the blood, muscles, bones, and joints internally. Therefore, any stubborn gonorrhea can be completely cured by taking "Kelinong," and the disease is no longer as rampant as before. As for leukorrhea in women with gonorrhea, "Ka Erxuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to clear the discharge.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Discussion on the Treatment of Leukorrhea

Dr. Yao Juyan, Consulting at: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sima Road

Only Makes Leukorrhea Patients Suffer

To radically cure a difficult disease, it is certainly not enough to simply shout out some new treatment and expect the disease to disappear out of thin air. Recently, there has been a surge of new gonorrhea treatments like bamboo shoots after rain. What's even stranger is that some doctors in the market today claim that their method of treating gonorrhea is the newest and most effective, but tomorrow they change to a new name and criticize their own treatment from yesterday as outdated and obsolete. I think that although medicine is said to be progressing rapidly today, it is probably not progressing that quickly! What suffers is the general gonorrhea patient, wandering around in confusion, not knowing what to do, mistakenly delaying their condition. Isn't this caused by those dazzling and flamboyant market doctors who give false hope to pitiful gonorrhea patients?

Eliminate Toxins Completely - The Radical Cure

Our treatment of gonorrhea is always based on practical experience. Any treatment with practical experience for radical cure must conform to scientific standards, and what conforms to scientific standards is not effective today and ineffective tomorrow. The so-called "rivers flow forever" is exactly what this means. I have been in clinical practice for nearly twenty years, and I can't say that I haven't tried the new treatments that come out every year, but most of them are just for show. In my nearly twenty years of experience, German static electrotherapy is the most effective in killing bacteria in terms of electrotherapy. If X-rays are used as an adjunct, the effect is even better. At the same time, the world-renowned holy medicine for gonorrhea, "Kelinong," is taken internally to promote the body's cells to produce anti-gonorrheal phagocytes, so that the gonococci scattered everywhere can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Therefore, all those who use these scientific treatments will not relapse after recovery, because the intention is to eliminate toxins completely. Consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Registration starts at [blank] every day, and each registration fee is only 5 jiao.

### Treatment in Hot Weather

— Doctor Qiang

The tubercle bacillus is covered with wax, which is highly acid-resistant. No internal medicine can remove this wax, only increasing nutrition, so the effect is not very reliable. Since Dr. Tume of Germany adopted the latest theories and prepared "Bu Fei Na Er" from various mineral and plant ingredients, significant progress has been made in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. This medicine not only has the nutritional power of cod liver oil, but also has a mild medicinal nature. Taking it in hot weather will not cause stagnation. The special effect of this medicine is to enhance resistance to remove the waxy layer of tuberculosis, so that the incomparably violent tubercle bacilli cannot stand and are completely eliminated. Therefore, no matter how difficult to treat lung disease, taking "Bu Fei Na Er" will completely eradicate the root. It is also effective for children's whooping cough, senile asthma, and all kinds of influenza.

### The Shaoxing Rice Famine is Severe: The Entire Territory is in a Tragic State, with Prices Soaring to 100 Yuan per Stone; Epidemics are Rampant, and Corpses Litter the Roads; An Urgent Appeal is Made to the Authorities to Lift the Rice Ban Immediately to Alleviate the Crisis

Telegrams from various counties in eastern Zhejiang indicate that the food panic has reached its peak, with Shaoxing County being the most severely affected. Shaoxing County's rice production has always been insufficient to meet its needs, relying on transportation and assistance from Jiangxi Province. Since the fall of Xiaoshan last winter, the Hangzhou-Jiangxi transportation route has been cut off. Shaoxing, closely connected to Xiaoshan, has experienced a severe grain panic. Since the beginning of spring, famine victims have been everywhere, starved corpses line the roads, creating a terrifying situation.

Rice Prices Soar Madly

According to rice merchants from Shaoxing, rice prices in the area have been exorbitantly high since the weather warmed, rising like crazy from 50 yuan, then incrementally to 60 and 70 yuan. When the merchants left their hometown (around the 20th of last month), prices had already broken through 80 yuan. According to recent arrivals in Shanghai, prices have even soared to 100 yuan per stone. Such figures are unprecedented and shocking. Shaoxing was originally a prosperous area, but now rice has become a precious commodity. Most residents mainly eat wheat flour as their staple food, with those less fortunate consuming bran and soybean, and even those are limited, barely enough to supplement and not enough to satisfy hunger. Further down the scale, people eat wild vegetables and grass, and dig up Guanyin clay. There is a popular saying in the area, referring to "getting by," meaning just making it through the day. The tragic situation is imaginable.

Famine Becomes a Disaster

In this situation, those who can fill their stomachs are like the favored children of the world. People dying of hunger are everywhere. Every morning, residents run around telling each other, "So-and-so from so-and-so's family is bedridden." This became a daily occurrence, gradually becoming something people were no longer surprised to hear. When the Japanese army attacked Shaoxing last winter, areas such as Keqiao and Anchang suffered greatly. Now, at the beginning of summer, epidemics have broken out. The general population, already teetering on the brink due to famine, collapses upon contracting the disease, like a broken bamboo. It is common for entire families to perish one after another. The visitor gave an example of his neighbor, saying that the neighbor's family was somewhat well-off but recently could not sustain themselves. The husband first died of the epidemic, and his wife followed less than half a month later. As soon as she closed her eyes, her three children wailed around the bed, their cries piercing the clouds. After a long time, the wife also died. Scarcely ten days passed before the three children also died of starvation. Such tragedies are heard every day and have become commonplace.

Extinction of Fires and Smoke

Now, at the end of spring and the beginning of summer, it is time to transplant the early rice crop, but the weather has been dry for a long time, lacking rainfall. Farmers have no way to start. If another poor harvest occurs in the fall, the people of Shaoxing will have no one left alive. This dark shadow has already terrified people, creating a state of great unrest. Rice prices have also been stimulated by this, boiling and leaping upward without end. Currently, beggars are constantly on the roads throughout the territory. The former blessed land is no longer a human realm. Young men and women, driven by hunger, have crossed the Qiantang River, sneaking across to the Shanghai occupied areas of western Zhejiang. Although the Zhejiang provincial authorities have reportedly taken relief measures, nothing has been implemented yet. Pingtiao (price stabilization) has been implemented in the counties under Ningbo's jurisdiction, but even this news is absent in Shaoxing County. It seems that there will be no pedestrians in the fields and starved corpses in the houses, becoming a human dead zone where fires and smoke have been extinguished. We deeply hope that the government authorities and people from Shaoxing living in Shanghai will quickly devise relief measures. The starving people are crying out for food, their situation more urgent than a fire burning their eyebrows.

Appeal to Lift the Ban

According to a letter from the people of Shaoxing detailing the reasons for the rice famine, our county is inherently a rice-deficient area, relying on Jinlan in eastern Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiaxing in western Zhejiang, and Wuxi and Danyang in Jiangsu Province for assistance. After the August 12th Shanghai Incident, the roads in western Zhejiang were cut off, and transportation in eastern Zhejiang was mostly blocked, leading to a lack of supplies and difficult access to food. According to population statistics, Shaoxing has more than 1.2 million people. Calculating six ge (合) per person per day, the annual rice requirement is more than 2.6 million stone. The county has 1 million mu of land for rice cultivation.

In years with good harvests, each mu yields two stone, for a total harvest of about 2 million stone, still lacking more than 600,000 stone. Last year's harvest was poor, lacking about 1 million stone of rice. The food for hundreds of thousands of displaced compatriots is not even included. Since the Xiaoshan Incident, transportation has been even more obstructed, rice transport is even more difficult, and prices have risen step by step, as is the general trend. Recently, it has been heard that Gan (Jiangxi) rice is still around 8 yuan per stone. Some say that the purchase and sale prices in Jiangxi are high and low, so rural households are unwilling to sell rice to Zhejiang, leading to a shortage of rice. Others say that the Zhejiang Grain Management Office operates according to Jiangxi Province, and the same is true for other counties. Scarcity drives up prices. Others say that rice merchants are intentionally hoarding, and calculations move past actual numbers. These are all

external speculations. Whether they align with the facts, we do not know. Today, reading the newspaper, it is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Management Office is paying close attention to people's food and taking great pains. In the 27th year, there was a surplus of 2 million [yuan]. The Shaoxing Grain Management Office was originally run by officials overseeing gentry. It was heard that there was also a surplus of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in the 27th year. In the 29th year, it was changed to official management, and staff salaries were increased to show encouragement. The prohibition of ordinary people from transporting goods into the territory and the strict ban on rice shops and stores from transporting supplies seems proper under the unified system. When the Xiaoshan Incident occurred, government military affairs were widespread, so there were four to five thousand common peddlers

carrying rice into the territory, each carrying five dou (斗), which was a small help. However, since the restriction ban, assistance has been impossible, rice is extremely scarce, and prices have reached more than 80 yuan per stone, and there is still no goods. People are stretching their necks and yearning, enduring hunger and calling out. It's always scarce. It has been heard that rice has been shipped and has arrived in certain places. These good news are nothing more than echoes in an empty valley. Even though the authorities are racking their brains, sending personnel to search tenant farmers' granaries and rice in the countryside, and imposing criminal charges, they are advocating food conservation in the hope of making up for it.

Although the matter is well-intentioned, and the intention is to avoid disturbing the people, hundreds of thousands of people are in a time when every grain of rice is like a pearl, crying with hunger, suffering hardship, and are as thin as firewood. Abandoned children are seen on the roads, and starved corpses are on the roads. The haggard situation is too unbearable to look at. We deeply hope that our fellow villagers will make reasonable representations, requesting the highest leaders to promptly grant practical measures.

Stopping the restriction ban will make sources abundant and transportation convenient, so prices can gradually decrease, and the people will all be able to get food and implement grace, solving the people's crisis. Also, please do not leave out those who only have empty reputations, showing the utmost sincerity in being practical.

Ningbo Price Stabilization

The Ningbo natives in Shanghai are organizing price stabilization for Ningbo. The first batch of 18,000 bags of rice transported from Hong Kong arrived in Ningbo yesterday on the Glen Line ship, Shan Gang. Coordinating everything, the mass meeting to solicit donations for price stabilization is scheduled to be held on the 7th of this month in the assembly hall of the Ningbo association. Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, and Mu Zixiang have been appointed as the presidium of the mass meeting.

### 38 Days in Transit: French Postal Ship Arrives in Shanghai

There were reports of turning back midway

The French postal ship D'Artagnan, which sailed from Marseilles via the Mediterranean in late April to the Far East, arrived in Hong Kong last week. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday, berthing at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. It carried more than 100 passengers, including more than 20 overseas Chinese businessmen and students from France. According to a reporter from the Overseas Chinese Voice News Agency, "The ship set sail from Marseilles on April 26th, taking 38 days en route, an unprecedented delay. The reason is that there was too much cargo, and delays occurred while stopping to load and unload along the way. When the ship arrived in the Mediterranean, there was news that it had been ordered to turn back. It then anchored midway, later receiving orders from the French government.

Permission was granted to sail to the Far East, and it continued its voyage. Regarding French postal services, it is heard that France has decided to continue to maintain them, but due to wartime, schedules cannot be predicted, so there is no fixed time for the voyage. Since France banned foreigners from engaging in hawking businesses, Chinese merchants have been greatly affected. However, Chinese are happy to work in factories for French wartime work, and the French government treats Chinese workers well. Therefore, in recent months, the number of Chinese entering factories to work has

greatly increased." Also, the British Changxing Company's Empress of Russia has also arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday, berthing at the Gonghexing Wharf. The ship is scheduled to sail to Little Luzon in Hong Kong this morning, returning to Shanghai on the 16th of this month, returning to Vancouver. The Zeba Company's Zhibade ship also arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday and is scheduled to return to Surabaya on the 6th.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Ship Transportation Costs Reduced

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping costs had previously increased step by step due to delays in loading and unloading, scheduled shifts, and increased costs. Now, the number of ships outside Zhenhai Port has decreased, schedules have accelerated, and life in the mainland is becoming increasingly difficult. To maintain the flow of passengers, goods, and local products, it is appropriate to reduce prices appropriately. It is learned that the Zhongyi Company's Deping ship will reduce all import and export shipping costs by 30% from the next trip, and the Hualun Company's direct import ship, the Ruikai, will also temporarily reduce prices by 20% from the next trip to show maintenance.

### Yesterday Was Anti-Smoking Day; The Special Court Burned Confiscated Narcotics; The Authorities are Determined to Eradicate Drugs, and the Public is Automatically Rejecting Drugs; The Burning of Narcotics at the Special Second Court Has Profound Significance

Yesterday was the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Day, coinciding with the expiration of the six-year anti-smoking plan. The government is determined to eradicate drugs as scheduled to clear the toxic atmosphere. All sectors of Shanghai are also following the national policy and resolutely implementing drug rejection. The Special Second District Court burned confiscated opium yesterday, and the concession authorities will step up the search and arrest of drug offenders. The details are reported below.

Government Determination

The government authorities, recognizing that the harm of opium and drugs to the nation is worse than floods and ferocious beasts, established the National Anti-Smoking Committee five years ago, with President Chiang himself as the Director-General, ordering the entire country to completely eradicate drugs within six years. After receiving the order, various places acted vigorously and achieved significant results. However, since the war, the Japanese have transported and sold large quantities of drugs in various occupied areas to numb the people, attempting to destroy the Chinese nation. It is learned that the central authorities have the greatest determination to eradicate opium and drugs. This year is the year the six-year plan expires. The central government is determined to resolutely ban drugs according to its established policy. Starting next year, if there are still people trafficking, selling, and smoking drugs throughout the country, they will be punished with extreme penalties in accordance with the Anti-Drug Crime Regulations, and no leniency will be shown.

Public Awareness

All sectors of the city, in view of the special environment of the isolated island, have caused the toxic atmosphere to permeate the western, southern, Zhabei, and Hongkou districts of Shanghai, numbing the people and harming the nation. The government's withdrawal to the west has made it impossible to investigate and ban drugs, which is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, in order to implement the central government's anti-smoking policy, they have decided to automatically assist the government in promoting the anti-drug movement. All fathers, brothers, teachers, and senior officials should strictly warn their children and colleagues to avoid bad habits. If they are addicted to smoking, they must quit within a limited time, otherwise, they will be severely punished to completely eliminate the toxic atmosphere.

Burning Narcotics

The Second Special District Local Court publicly burned confiscated opium, smoking paraphernalia, narcotics, and drug-making equipment seized from January to the end of June in the 24th session in the open space east of the court at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Judicial Administration Department sent Zheng Xun, the Chief Prosecutor of the Gao Second Branch, to represent the supervision nearby. After Mr. Zheng and representatives from various agencies arrived on the scene, they were invited to sit by Chen Maoxian, the President of the Special Second Court, and Sun Shaokang, the Chief Prosecutor. The yamen runners were ordered to burn all the opium and other items first, followed by gambling equipment and other items. It is estimated that 1,973 taels and 1 mace (錢), and 39 pounds of opium, 4,291 opium bubbles, 578 sets of smoking paraphernalia, 8,947 packets and 164 taels of morphine, and morphine, smoking pipes, morphine needles, and equipment for making red pills were burned, as well as countless other items. Next, 5,239 gambling equipment, lottery tickets, 90 lottery books, 58 lottery books, 32 pairs of Pai Gow, 81 dice, and 21 other items such as gambling equipment wooden boards were burned. It lasted for more than three hours before it was completed. The representatives bid farewell and dispersed.

### Hoarding and Monopoly Finally Failed; Yarn Companies Collapsed One After Another; There Have Been Reports of Speculators Committing Suicide and Going Bankrupt; Concession Authorities are Even More Severe in Stabilizing Prices

Since the sharp drop in gold prices and the extension of foreign exchange, the authorities of the two concessions have been making every effort to suppress and stabilize prices in various ways. The Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession Board of Directors, yesterday, along with representatives from the French Concession Police Department and the Health Department, organized an inspection team to inspect bakeries and daily necessities stores. The team paid attention to whether stores that greatly increased prices last month on the pretext of the depreciation of the French currency had adjusted those prices. There were multiple cases of on-the-spot fines. The Price Stabilization Committee of the Public Concession is still paying close attention to the effective implementation of the price stabilization laws and regulations. Recently, six stallholders from the vegetable markets on Xiaoshadu, Seymour Road, and Racecourse Road, including Xu Fusheng and Yu Zhiliang, were fined ten yuan each on May 31st by the court for failing to affix price tags and price lists as required by the Municipal Council.

The European War Worsens

The Chinese government has declared its utmost effort to maintain exchange rates. At the same time, news of victories by the Chinese army has been frequently reported. The concession authorities are stabilizing prices and strictly enforcing crackdowns on hoarding. Citizens are practicing thrift and frugality. Therefore, the market is oversupplied, and hoarders have been severely hit. Recently, several cotton yarn firms have gone bankrupt due to customer liabilities. The Shanghai market has shown signs of the 1929 American

economic panic. Hoarders want to sell their goods, but it is even more difficult than when they first bought them. They are severely hit and unable to cope. Some have gone bankrupt, and some have committed suicide. Several yarn flower firms, which usually specialize in speculative trading on behalf of customers, have suffered from customer liabilities and closed down one after another due to the inability to recover funds. Advertisements by lawyers representing firms for liquidation are often seen. More than twenty cotton yarn firms have closed down, such as Fuda Yarn, Zhixiang Yarn, Rongchang Yarn, Hongsheng Yarn, Wufeng Yarn, Tongyuxiang, Yuxing Yarn, and Ruichang Yarn.

### Speculation and Rumors are Groundless

Yesterday, in the local financial market, rumors spread that Italy was about to join the war and that the British and French defense forces stationed in Shanghai were preparing to withdraw. As a result, the foreign stock market was weak despite the tightening of the black market. In fact, this was purely a rumor spread by speculators and is not credible. A spokesperson for the British Embassy's Office in Shanghai called it groundless and completely fabricated. Regardless of how the European war evolves, Britain will never give up all its rights and interests in the Shanghai concessions. A spokesperson for the French Embassy's Office also said that the rumors circulating in the market were absolutely untrue.

### Unwilling to be Exploited by the Japanese; Russian Émigrés Gather Today; Resolutely Opposed to the New Japanese Organization; Russian Émigré Leaders Declare They Have Never Participated

According to investigations, the total number of Russian émigrés in Shanghai has exceeded 25,000. There has been an organization called the White Russian Émigré Committee. The Japanese, seeing the failure of the recent Municipal Council director election due to the failure to win the support of Jews and White Russians, began to prepare for next year's election after the failure, striving to control these émigrés for their own assistance. The first step of their plan, scheduled for the 15th of this month, is to dissolve the original White Russian Émigré Committee and establish a new White Russian Émigré group in the Huishan District, under the command of the Japanese. Most Russians, fearing the harsh treatment they received from the Japanese in North China in the past, are unwilling to join this new organization. The White Russian Émigré Group has scheduled an emergency meeting today to decide its attitude.

Unanimous Opposition to the New Organization

It is heard that the White Russian Émigré group launched by the Japanese advocates the "anti-communist" banner, which has a strong political color. Yesterday, it was widely rumored that several pro-Japanese White Russian émigrés had come to Shanghai from Harbin to be driven by the Japanese to establish a White Russian name. Luo Ji, in the Huishan area of Hongkou on the 15th, will serve as the "advisor" of the new organization. The White Russian commercial groups and charitable organizations in Shanghai are all members of the White Russian Émigré Committee. They believe that once this force of pro-Japanese Russian émigrés from North China invades, their future situation will be the same as what they encountered in Tianjin and Harbin in the past. Under control, they fear they will lose all their freedom. Therefore, they are very worried and unwilling to participate in this new organization. They have scheduled an emergency meeting today to decide their attitude.

Many People Declare Unwillingness to Intervene

Yesterday, the reporter met with Mr. Manzhula, Chairman of the White Russian Émigré Association, to inquire about the truth. He stated that he had not heard any news that the association was forced to disband and that he had not participated in the matter. Another person named Kachakov, who was rumored to have been internally appointed as the "Director of the Welfare Department" of the new organization, also officially issued a statement to the Russian émigrés yesterday, saying that he opposed the new organization and did not agree to take on the position. Yakofxin, the secretary of the Russian Émigré Committee, stated that he had heard that he would be appointed as the "secretary" of the new organization, but also stated that he had not participated in the matter.

The Japanese Have Political Conspiracies

According to another report, in order to easily complete their conspiracy, the Japanese visited Mr. Grebov, the chairman of the current White Russian Émigré Association's council, and sincerely asked him to serve as the "chairman" of the new organization. Mr. Ge is the leader of the White Russian émigrés in Shanghai. He expressed his agreement to the Japanese request, but put forward five conditions to the Japanese, which must be fully accepted before he is willing to serve. The important conditions are: (1) The new organization has the same nature as the old organization, and absolutely does not have a political relationship, but is only an émigré management agency; (2) The Russian émigrés in Shanghai will absolutely not be burdened with heavy burdens to the association, such as paying high membership fees. The Japanese did not agree to Mr. Ge's request at all, so they retreated and sought the next best thing, that is, visiting Jiumengnago and sincerely asking him to serve as the "chairman." However, Mr. Jiu's position in the Russian émigré community is not as high as Mr. Ge's.

Russian Émigrés Express Indifference

Since the Russian newspaper Russ, under the wing of Japan, announced the central figures of the new organization and set up the hall at No. 409 Xihua Road, Kachagov issued a statement saying that he had nothing to do with the new organization, and Yakofjin also said that he had not made contact. The newspaper also claimed that the Russian émigrés in Shanghai must join the new organization as natural members, otherwise their residence permits would be revoked. All those who join the new organization must be led by the association under the banner of anti-communism. All Russian émigrés believe that this news is a method used by the Japanese to induce them to join the new organization, so they intend to ignore it.

### Daylight Savings Time Fully Implemented

Since the authorities of the two concessions jointly announced the implementation of daylight savings time starting on June 1st, all sectors of the city have unanimously responded and gradually implemented it, conducting business and office hours one hour earlier according to the new time. However, June 1st happened to be a Saturday, and the next day was a Sunday, so most agencies, groups, and businesses implemented it starting yesterday (Monday). According to a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, the curfew time will be implemented starting at 12:30 AM every night (that is, 11:30 PM original time).

Tofu Industry Requests Night Work

The Shanghai Tofu Industry Association has resolved to request the French authorities to provide flexibility for the fact that the French authorities prohibit tofu merchants from working during curfew hours. The work of making tofu is most suitable for the evening. If work is stopped after the curfew, business will inevitably be hindered. Especially since the recent implementation of daylight savings time has advanced the curfew time by another hour, business is even more difficult. However, as of yesterday afternoon, the association had not received a response from the French authorities. It is also learned that the labor-management dispute between the tofu workers in the two concessions and western Shanghai had not yet been resolved as of last night, and the opinions of the labor and management sides were still difficult to reconcile. For this reason, the capitalists have set up a committee to improve the treatment of trade union workers in the Dazhong Hotel, striving for a satisfactory solution.

### Intention to Join the War: Signs Observed in Shanghai; Caused by Italian Ships Anchoring in Nanshi; British King Orders Birthday Celebrations Suspended During Wartime

According to foreign sources, there are increasing signs in this city that Italy is about to join the European war. The Italian Consulate's sale to the animal protection society is one such sign. Yesterday, three Italian ships, the "Alarqi," "Ankeratai," and "Glenardella Pandula," as well as the Italian warship "Anmano Carlo Tuto," were moved to the Jiangmian River off Nanshi, attracting attention from both Chinese and foreign residents. Furthermore, the Italian ship "Conte Verde," arriving this time from Manila, did not stop at the port. Another Italian warship, "Le Panto," is docked at the naval buoy in the Huangpu River. The Sino-Italian Shipping Company is changing its asset settlements to US dollars. It is widely believed that Italy will soon join the war, and the timing is imminent.

Suspension of Birthday Celebrations for the British King

The British Consulate in this city issued a statement yesterday, stating that in accordance with the British King's decree, during the war, the King's birthday will not be celebrated with receptions or other celebratory activities.

British Army Thanks Shanghai Overseas Chinese for Donations

The British community in Shanghai and their friends are being thanked by the British Army for the donations received during this year's King's birthday. The donations have been separately remitted to the Queen Mary Hospital in Roehampton and the Louise Hospital in Erskine Road. Gratitude is also expressed for the assistance of various Western newspapers.

Rumor of Dutch Queen Going to India is Untrue

Last night's news reported a London telegram from the Tongmeng News Agency stating that Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands left the country and resided in London after the German invasion of the Netherlands. According to well-informed sources, she will travel to the Dutch East Indies in the near future. The reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired about this matter with the Dutch Consulate in this city, and was told that as of now, no such information has been received, and it is likely inaccurate.

Czech Compatriots in Shanghai Share Hatred of the Enemy

Although the Czech Republic has fallen, its national spirit has not waned. There are already 50,000 Czech volunteer soldiers joining the British and French forces. This news was received by overseas Chinese in this city from letters from the European front. The Czech soldiers participating in the war are sincere and volunteer. Their only wish is said to be to achieve victory. According to a telegram received in this city last Saturday, Czech troops joined the French squadron and helped shoot down 41 German aircraft in the sky. The Czech community in Shanghai was very excited by this news.

Grand Celebration of Portuguese National Day by Portuguese Community

The French Shanghai Daily reported that the Portuguese community in this city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of their nation yesterday (the 2nd) with a Mass at the church on Rue Lupan. Many Portuguese attended. The Portuguese team from the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Portuguese Boy Scouts, lined up at the entrance of the church. The Portuguese Ambassador to China, Le Pré Lima, accompanied by his wife and the embassy secretary, Bertrand Guerlain, as well as the Consul General in Shanghai, Mai Luo and his wife, and Vice Consul Zai Gela, arrived successively. The Mass was presided over by Father De Nishi.

German Ship's Reception Has No Special Intent

The German ship "Rames," docked opposite Gaochangmiao, was the subject of much outside attention when the shipowner sent invitations the day before yesterday (the 2nd) to German, Italian, and Japanese residents. The general public was particularly interested in what this meant. According to sources at the German Embassy in China, the reception was purely a social gathering aimed at promoting friendship among the expatriate community in Shanghai and had no special purpose.

Dramatic Increase in Deposits at American Banks

Since the expansion of the European war, banks of the warring countries in China have seen instances of withdrawals. Generally, depositors are concerned about the financial exhaustion of the warring countries and are transferring their deposits to American or Chinese banks. It was previously rumored that the Sino-French Bank in Tianjin had experienced a run and suspended operations, but this was officially denied by the Belgian Embassy. In Tianjin, because the "Joint Bank Notes" are not trusted by the local people, many Tianjin residents deposit legal tender into foreign banks in the concession so that they can freely withdraw legal tender in the future. Foreign banks in Tianjin receive more legal tender deposits. As of recently, the deposits in European and American foreign banks in Tianjin totaled 250 million yuan, and in the Sino-French Bank, about 45 million yuan. The situation for legal tender deposits in foreign banks in Shanghai is different because the financial situation in this city is different.

### British Vice Consul to Shanghai to Go to Chongqing Soon

Ms. Graham is the second foreign female reporter from Shanghai to join a Chongqing news service. The first was Ms. Emily Hahn, who recently accepted a position at the Havas News Agency's Chongqing branch.

### Japanese Soldiers Break Into German Factory; Moving Furniture and Equipment; Police Detectives Arrive to Stop Them But Are Unsuccessful; Claiming the Factory Was Owned by Chinese Before the War

The Zi Lin Evening News reported that, according to eyewitnesses, at nearly 10 AM last Friday (the 31st), several soldiers claiming to be from the Japanese Naval Landing Forces' Reconstruction Team broke into a German-owned factory at 537 Liaoyang Road in eastern Shanghai, and proceeded to move the factory's furniture and equipment onto two trucks waiting outside, which then drove east. The soldiers did not explain their reasons to the Chinese employees of the factory. Detectives from the Yulin Road police station arrived at the scene, and the soldiers claimed that the factory was owned by Chinese merchants before the Shanghai war in 1937 and during the war, and therefore it was treated as enemy property. The detectives did not want to cause trouble, so they did not interfere. It is noted that the factory was previously owned by Chinese merchants, but has now been resold to the German company Zen Chen.

### Shanghai Suburban Disaster Relief Association Decides Not to Postpone Establishment

Although the Japanese soldiers forced their way ashore under the cover of dense machine gun fire, they suffered heavy casualties. Moreover, Daxie Island is small in area and isolated overseas, so it has no value.

### Principal of Sanji Wireless School Zhang Zhaoyun Shot; Two Bullets Hit Vital Parts and Life is in Critical Condition; One Student Injured and One Suspect Arrested

At about 8:50 PM last night, four thugs broke into the office of the Sanji Wireless School at 211 Mahou Road in the Public Concession and shot at Zhang Zhaoyun, the principal of the school, injuring student Jiang Zhengming. Zhang was seriously injured and his life is in danger. The shooter fled the scene. One suspect was arrested. The details are as follows:

Bullets Hit Vital Areas

The victim is Zhang Zhaoyun, the 42-year-old principal of the school, a native of Songjiang. Dressed in a gray parish suit, he was chatting with three or five people in the downstairs office at 8:40 last night when suddenly one thug dressed in a long gown and three thugs dressed in short attire broke into the school. The thug in the long gown went into the office without asking any questions and opened fire on Zhang Zhaoyun with a gun, firing four or five shots. Two bullets hit him, one in the back, piercing the chest, and one in the neck. He fell to the ground. At that time, the people in the room quickly closed the door, intending to surround and capture the bandit. The three bandits outside the door were anxious and tried to force the door open to rescue the shooter.

One Student Injured

When the thugs walked out of the office to the outer reading room, student Jiang Zhengming, a 21-year-old native of Wuxi, was being watched by another bandit. He was also shot once, hitting his right leg. The bullet did not pass through. Then the bandits left in a hurry. One suspect, about thirty years old, dressed in a blue cloth shirt and pants, was apprehended by the school staff. He is currently being held at the Chengdu Road Police Station.

Life in Danger

After the incident, the Chengdu Road Police Station, being nearby, quickly dispatched armed Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, but the bandits had already fled without a trace. They then summoned an ambulance to take the two injured people to Baolong Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Jiang's injuries were not serious, but Zhang's life was in critical condition because the bullets had hit vital areas. Around midnight, he was in a dying state.

Flourishing School Affairs

The Sanji Wireless School was originally located at 180 Tianjin Road. It was moved to 211 Mahou Road in September of last year. It occupies three Western-style buildings, which are newly renovated and conveniently located. There are about 300 students studying at the school, of which more than 30 are boarders, and the rest are day students. Classes are divided into morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. The teachers at the school are all well-known scholars of the time. The school enjoys a good reputation in Shanghai, so many people study there.

### Concubine Flees With Her Lover; Both Are Arrested; Adulterous Couple Detained for Investigation

Cai Yingyi, a 37-year-old native of Ningbo, was a mechanic on the Yangtze River shipping route of the China Merchants Bureau. After the August 13th Incident, the bureau shut down and Cai was employed by the Ministry of Communications and assigned to the transportation team, still performing his old job. Cai has a wife and a concubine. His wife lives on Route Lafayette in Shanghai, and his concubine, Yao Yunmei, a 24-year-old native of Cai's hometown, has one child with him.

They lived in Hankou. When the Chinese army withdrew from Hankou two years ago, Cai was ordered to go to Chongqing to work. Unable to take his family with him, he ordered Yao to take her children from the Yuehan Railway to Hong Kong and return to Shanghai, instructing her to live with his first wife. However, after Yao arrived in Shanghai, she lived with her mother in the Yunsheng Medicinal Material Store, which was set up by her family in No. 2 Tianhui Lane, Baxianfang, Lane 89, Rue Caserne, in the French Concession. She then had an affair with Shen Jiele, a 32-year-old neighbor from Ningbo who lived upstairs and was unemployed.

Private Acquaintances

The first wife found out and sent a letter to Cai Yingyi. Cai received the letter and took leave from Chongqing to return to Shanghai to deal with the matter. When he arrived in Shanghai recently, he discovered that his concubine, Yao Yunmei, had taken all of the cash, 3,900 yuan, and gold jewelry, 2,000 yuan, from her mother's home on the afternoon of the 20th of last month and fled. He immediately reported the information to the French police, who found that after Yao fled, she was living with Shen in the Qiantai Hotel at 208 Tianjin Road, going in and out together.

Seeming Like Husband and Wife

The detectives, together with detectives from the Public Concession, dispatched men to the Qiantai Hotel the day before yesterday and arrested both Yao Yunmei and Shen Jiele. They were taken back to the French Police Station and detained. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiadan, explained the case, requested an extension of the investigation, and then requested a trial. The court verified the report, questioned the defendants, and heard the plaintiff, Cai Yingyi.

Pleading Everything

The judge approved a change of date for further investigation. The defendants were detained. It is said that Yao Yunmei has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Cai, seeking a separation. The trial is scheduled for the 7th, it is said.

### Hot Weather in This City; Already Showing Signs of Sweltering Heat; Since Spring, There Has Been Little Rain, and Drought Conditions Have Developed

The weather in this city has been quite hot recently, especially at noon when the sun is directly overhead and the temperature rises sharply, reaching a maximum of 99 degrees, creating sweltering conditions. Parts of the asphalt roads are also melting due to the high heat. Also, since the beginning of spring this year, there has been little rainfall and the climate has been dry. Infectious diseases are very prevalent. In many areas of farmland near Shanghai, the land is cracking, making it difficult to transplant rice seedlings, and drought conditions have already developed, it is said.

Administering Cholera Injections

Because cholera has been discovered in Shanghai, transmitted by two people from Shaoxing, residents should be vaccinated as a precaution. The French Concession authorities have taken measures to prevent the spread of cholera. People who have been in contact with the cholera patients from Shaoxing have been vaccinated. In addition, the water supply is being disinfected and inspected. Neighboring households are currently undergoing health inspections. All residents within the concession can receive free vaccinations at the following locations: (1) 630 Route Frelupt; (2) 840 Avenue Dubail; (3) The Health Office at the corner of Route Tenant de la Tour and Route Haig.

### Young He Erkang Frauds and Takes Money; Chen Zuhuai Cheated Out of Six Thousand Yuan

He Erkang, a 21-year-old native of Shaoxing, residing at 28 Hongqing Lane, Route Meadow, was introduced by a Mr. Liu to Chen Zuhuai, a native of Ningbo (20 years old, currently studying at Vincent's English College) who lived at 11 Puqing Lane, Route Marne, in the French Concession. The two were young and more emotional, so they became very close friends. On the 28th of last month, when He and Chen had dinner at the Da San Yuan restaurant, He asked Chen for a loan of 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Chen agreed and delivered the full amount on the evening of the 29th. Unexpectedly, on the 30th, He suddenly said to Chen, "The price of gold fluctuates greatly now. I have a good grasp of this market. You might as well do some speculation, and you will definitely make a profit." Chen was moved by this and asked how much money he would need to operate. He replied, "At least 6,000 yuan in legal tender." He instructed Chen to raise another 4,000 yuan. Chen did not have any cash on hand, so he managed to obtain 4,000 yuan from the Taichangxiang Steamship Bureau on Tiantang Street (which was set up as a partnership by Chen's father) and handed it over to He on the 31st. However, Chen's mother, Sun, found out about this and thought it was inappropriate to hand over the money without any evidence, so she ordered Chen to recover the money. However, she could not find He anywhere, so she reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhu Shuling captured He at the Gao Yong'an in the Xinxin Restaurant. Over 3,700 yuan of the stolen money was recovered. According to He's confession, the remaining 2,000 yuan had been lost in gambling dens such as Rongsheng opened by Gu Wenda and Yuyuan opened by Rong Binggen. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin prosecuted him for fraud. Because further investigation was needed, he requested a change of date for the interrogation. Judge Dai Rongduo, after questioning him, ordered that the date be changed for further interrogation.

### Armed Men Captured on Route Pili Nanz

At 9:30 yesterday morning, several police officers from the Public Concession Police Department were searching pedestrians on Route Pili Nanz when they suddenly saw two rickshaws passing by. The passengers sitting on them looked flustered when they saw the detectives. The police officers stepped forward to search them and found a pistol on each of the two passengers. The two suspects were taken to the police station for questioning.

### Female Bandits Arrested for Kidnapping a Young Girl; Separate Interrogations Conducted and the Date Changed for Further Investigation

Zhang Jinshi's sixteen-year-old daughter, Shanlan, who lived at No. __, Jiwei Lane, Route Marne, in the French Concession, worked at the Huayang Socks Factory at the end of Route Frelupt. After finishing work on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, she suddenly disappeared and did not return home. The French Police Station was notified, and detectives found that she had been kidnapped and hidden in Room 414 of the Great China Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road by the bandits Chen Rongsheng (27 years old, local) and Li Zhiming (37 years old, from Wuxi), in collusion with the women Chen Amao, Xia Juxiang, and Chen Yuemei.

After preliminary sexual assault failed, they planned to take her to Tianjin for sale. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, detectives from the Laozha Police Station went to the Great China Hotel and arrested Chen, Li, and the three women, Xia Lanxiang, Chen Amao, and Chen Yuemei. Ma Shanlan was rescued and taken back to the police station. They then proceeded to Xinxin Lane on Route Amiral Courbet and arrested the Suzhou women Fan Wengshi, Ma Hanshi, Huang Zhengshi, and Wu Chenshi, who were involved in the sale. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang said that the defendants requested a change of date for the case of slight abduction.

After a detailed investigation of the case, he requested a trial. Judge Sun Pengxian conducted separate interrogations of the defendants and the victim. Because the case involved morality, it was announced that no one was allowed to listen. After about an hour of interrogation, the court approved a change of date for further investigation. The defendants were detained. The victim was ordered to be examined by the Forensic Department and then returned to await further interrogation.

### Chen Ruiliang Arrested and Sentenced for Extortion

Chen Ruiliang, a native of Changzhou, worked at the Senji Transportation Company, which was opened by Chen Senshi, a native of Qingpu, in Room 10 of the Shanghai New Hotel at 421 Hankou Road. The company's business mainly involved transporting goods from Shanghai to Qingpu, so it made a lot of profit. Chen Ruiliang was dismissed from his job by Chen Senshi on the __ of last month. Chen Ruiliang, seeing that Chen Senshi was making a lot of profit, repeatedly went to the Senji office after being dismissed and demanded that Chen Senshi pay him 5,000 yuan in legal tender, refusing to give up. Otherwise, he would take drastic measures to endanger his life. Because he was refused, Chen Ruiliang had successively sent letters to the pseudo-Qingpu County government and a local gangster, accusing Chen Senshi of being a guerrilla, causing Senji to be unable to operate. At 3 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Ruiliang went to the Senji Company again and demanded at least 300 yuan to settle the matter. Chen Senshi reported this to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese Detective Zhang Keqin went and arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for attempted extortion. Chen Ruiliang completely denied it and claimed that he was going to collect his wages. However, witnesses proved that he had indeed engaged in intimidation. Judge Feng Shide sentenced Chen Ruiliang to six months in prison as a warning.

### Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning in French Park

At 1:40 PM the day before yesterday, an unnamed man, about twenty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt, white cloth pants, bald, and barefoot, suddenly committed suicide by swallowing poison in the French Park in Gujiazhai. He swallowed as many as two bottles. He was discovered by tourists in the park, who informed the patrol officers stationed in the park and reported it to the French Police Station. The man looked like a worker and was unable to speak, so it was impossible to understand the reason for his suicide. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 7 PM that night because he had swallowed too much poison. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary for examination. It was impossible to trace the family to inform them. It was confirmed that the deceased had died by poisoning. The body was handed over to the charity for burial, awaiting identification.

### Thailand Motor Company's Car Hired Out and Robbed Yesterday

At 7:55 AM yesterday, someone called the Thailand Motor Company to hire a car. The company dispatched car number 12117. It was driven to the intersection of Avenue du Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Route du Consulat. When the car arrived there, two men suddenly called for the car to stop. They then took out pistols, claimed that they needed help, and forced the driver out of the car. At that time, two more men arrived to watch the driver's actions. The car was driven away quickly by the two bandits who had boarded the car. At about 8 AM, the original car returned to its original location and was handed back to the driver. The driver reported this.

### Social News

Gan Shidong of the French Concession... The wife of Zhang Daijian, the owner of the shop, had several dozen yuan in Hankou provincial banknotes stolen on the 13th of last month. It was later discovered that the thief was the apprentice Chen Hexi (17 years old, from Nanjing). She slapped Chen twice and ordered him to return the stolen banknotes. Chen was so frightened that at 12 PM the next day, he poured kerosene on the firewood and placed it in the attic, setting it on fire. Fortunately, a tenant discovered it and put it out, preventing a disaster. The police were notified and arrested Chen, escorting him to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court and prosecuting him for endangering public safety. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian made a final decision and sentenced Chen Hexi to two years and six months in prison for arson.

Yang Youliang (also known as Minglin), a beggar from Tianjin, went to the US military barracks at 372 Rue de la Caserne on the 19th of last month and stole a pistol, 21 bullets, and three magazines, intending to go to Nanjing to do something. On the evening of the 1st of this month, at 8:30 PM, he went to Tongfu Restaurant at 532 Avenue Edward VII to order a meal, which cost 30 cents. But Yang had no money, so he tried to escape. However, he was caught by the waiter, Tang Zaiqin, who searched him and found no money. Unexpectedly, he discovered that Yang was carrying weapons. He then called Chinese Detective Zhang Keqin No. 662, who arrived and arrested Yang. The stolen pistol and bullets were found at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for endangering public safety. After questioning by Judge Feng, he was ordered to be detained and the date changed for further interrogation.

### Black Clouds Across the Sky

On the evening of April 26th, two streaks of black clouds suddenly appeared in Suzhou, like a rainbow, extending from east to west across the sky. They did not disappear until late at night. Those who saw them thought they were strange! We do not know what omens they indicate, and wish to ask the astrologers about them.

### Large Turtle Appears in the Sea

On the 20th of this month, people in Osaka, Japan, suddenly saw a large turtle floating in the sea, about 24 feet long. The fishermen discussed wanting to catch it, and twenty or so people went to do so. Suddenly, the turtle opened its eyes and jaws as if to devour people. The fishermen were afraid and retreated. The turtle then dragged its tail and sank into the sea, never to be seen again. On the same day, in the distance, someone saw a very large object in the sea, with its head out of the water, about five feet long. No one knew what it was. Some said it was the same turtle.

### Red Carp Communicate with Spirits

A certain fisherman, 甲, outside of the Suzhou胥 Gate, caught two red carp in his net. He carried them to the market, but no one cared to buy them, so he took them home. Coincidentally, a certain 乙 from a neighboring boat was taking his sick child to the city for medical treatment. The child's condition was grave, making progress or retreat difficult. That evening, 乙 dreamed of two children in scarlet robes, who earnestly asked him: "Save us! We will heal your child." After waking up, he couldn't understand the dream. When he saw the red carp, he felt a connection, bought them, and released them. The child's illness immediately improved.

### Star of Life (II)

Third, the stars are very far away from us. We are ninety-three million miles away from the sun, and it takes eight minutes for light to reach us from the sun. It takes three and a half years for light to reach the earth from the nearest star, eleven years from the next nearest, hundreds of years from most stars, thousands of years from some, and tens of thousands of years from others. Such a great distance is truly unbelievable. The largest telescope in the world cannot see the specific shape of any star. We can only see the light it emits. Only those who specialize in research, using observation and measurement methods, can know a little more, such as the size, movement, interrelationships, weight, etc. of the star. Furthermore, with a spectroscope, they can even know what substance the star is made of. It is said that some are made of hydrogen, oxygen, gas, lead, iron, and other substances, while others are made of carbon, silver, copper, lead, and other substances. Christ is also like this to us. He is in heaven, an immeasurable distance away from us. However, for the sake of teaching, he descended into the world as a human, so that people could know him, love him, and understand him as a brother. Jesus is not only a star, but also the Morning Star. Everyone, in summer, sees the sky full of brilliant stars. Sometimes, black clouds suddenly rise and obscure the sky, making the stars invisible. But everyone understands that the stars are still there. But look a few hundred feet above the ground, and you can see the stars shining brightly as before. Our lives are also like this. Sometimes, sorrow, illness, doubt, and sin cover us with a layer of black clouds, making us unable to see God. But we understand that this is just a membrane of life's black clouds, and God is always close to us. Even more, sometimes we see a star shining exceptionally brightly through the gaps in the black clouds. This is just like when we are in extremely difficult times, we see Heavenly Father God, from some point, caring for us even more deeply than usual.

Historical Anecdotes

### The Price of Freedom and Independence

— Bi Ya

"Freedom" and "Independence," these two bright and great terms, are now being used as clichés! Unknowingly, the true meaning and value of these terms are gradually being neglected. Thus, shameless and unscrupulous people, without any sense of shame, serve the enemy, betray the country for personal gain, and steal the names of "freedom" and "independence" to deceive the public, flatter their masters, and achieve their own desires.

In reality, true "freedom" and "independence" must be obtained through hardship, pioneering, clearing thorns, with a spirit of perseverance, and after a long period of struggle. It cannot be achieved by empty talk and armchair strategy. For example, the independence of the United States went through eight years of fierce battles, lack of supplies, backward military equipment, fighting the many with the few, and using diplomatic means to win the assistance of France. In the first few years, they suffered repeated defeats, but their morale grew stronger with each battle. Finally, they defeated the British army and gained independence from their mother country. The unification of Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century was also a very difficult task. At that time, the two countries were divided into small states, each governing its own territory. Various powerful figures divided the land, and Austria secretly manipulated and monopolized everything. Iron Chancellor Bismarck and the famous Italian Prime Minister Cavour assisted each other, with foresight and flexible tactics. They reformed internal affairs and reorganized military equipment. After the Crimean and Franco-Prussian wars, Germany and Italy leaped into the ranks of powerful nations. The revival of Russia and Turkey after the European War was also full of hardships. Russia resisted foreign interference on the one hand and annihilated domestic counter-revolutionary forces on the other, facing enemies on both sides. At the same time, it had to stabilize the people's livelihood. The danger, difficulty, and precariousness of the situation can be imagined. However, without fearing great difficulties, it finally eliminated the root of the disaster and created the Soviet Union, a socialist republic. Turkey, on the other hand, suffered the punishment of a defeated country. Its territory was almost completely lost, its sovereignty was damaged, and the signs of division were completely exposed. Fortunately, General Kemal rose up, struggled tirelessly, and led the people. On the one hand, he obtained assistance from Russia, fought bloody battles for many years, defeated the Greek army, and drove them out of Asia Minor. Finally, he signed the Treaty of Lausanne with the great powers and obtained true freedom and independence.

From this, we can see that freedom and independence must be obtained through a long period of struggle and countless obstacles, with blood and heads. Only then can true freedom and independence be achieved!

Military Affairs

### Sky Interception Umbrella

— Xin

In order to prevent the dangers of air raids, various countries are making every effort to design various air defense methods. Recently, an American inventor has created a new type of "sky interception umbrella," which has been practically adopted by the French army as the main air defense equipment for various fortresses and cities. It is said that this air defense device is simpler and more economical than the air defense nets over London, and the results are even better.

This type of "interception umbrella" is no different in appearance from a cannonball and can be launched by anti-aircraft guns to different altitudes. When it reaches a suitable altitude, the outer shell immediately explodes, releasing a series of parachutes. Hanging below the parachutes are extremely long iron cables, and at the bottom of the cannonball is a heavy hammer attached to the bottom end of the iron cable; when the cannonball flies straight up, the bottom is gradually detached from the shell, suspended in the air. If an enemy aircraft touches or collides with the iron cable supported by this parachute, it has no chance of escaping. Either its wings will be broken, its propellers snapped, or it will be entangled by these 'interception umbrellas' and fall. Therefore, the efficiency of the "interception umbrella" group is higher than that of the air defense net of balloons.

The structure of the 'interception umbrella' is quite ingenious. A huge parachute is folded to the smallest possible volume and placed inside a cannonball-shaped outer shell, connected to an anchor filled with cable and a shell bottom acting as a hammer. The tip of the cannonball contains a time-sensitive explosive. When launched, it is only necessary to adjust the combustion, and after launch, it will explode at a certain height. This is determined by the height of the enemy aircraft.

When launching "sky interception umbrellas," they are usually launched in rows, creating an extremely high and wide wall. In this way, one row to the east and another row to the west are arranged in the air, and the aircraft will have no way out, colliding and stopping. Moreover, these 'interception umbrellas' can be launched like anti-aircraft guns, following the tracks of the aircraft, unlike the fixed air defense net of balloons, which can be avoided by aircraft. Therefore, when the 'interception umbrella' group appears in the sky like shooting stars and fireworks, the aircraft's doom has arrived.

Now that the European war is in full swing, the German air force's terror to the Allied air defense forces makes the Allied people uneasy day and night. But with the invention of various new weapons, I am afraid that aircraft will also have no way to cope. This terror will probably slowly disappear!

Psychology

### Imprisonment and Ghostly Possession

— Quan Shui

Some daughters from wealthy families in our country suffer from severe psychological illnesses due to being unable to bear the oppressive atmosphere of their homes. Within the embroidered boudoirs, apart from their mothers and a few others whom they can regularly contact, they cannot see anyone throughout the year, and even flies have no chance to fly in. Although they are said to be free people, their actions are simply devoid of freedom. Although they have plenty of food and clothing, their lives lack meaning and happiness. The imprisoning family created by the remnants of the old ethics, however, buries the youthful and lively happiness of young women. In the eyes of enlightened people, this is certainly considered a harm.

In the author's hometown (Pudong), although it is only separated from the prosperous Shanghai by a strip of water, one often hears of incidents of fox spirits possessing people, especially women. Patients with this disease are absent-minded all day long, as if thinking of something or encountering something. Or, every night, they dream that a man comes to meet them, indulging in extreme pleasure. After a short period of time, they inevitably become thin and exhausted, seeking help from shamans and witchcraft, eventually reaching a point where medicine cannot cure them. People suffering from this disease are generally silent and taciturn, with few social opportunities, or their families are strictly controlled, and their marriages are not fulfilled. The great German poet Goethe said it well: "Which young man would not fall in love, which young girl would not cherish spring?" It is not that the author wants to advocate modernity or romance. According to the actual situation, unless they are mentally retarded or ill, when human physiology or psychology has reached the stage of development, they will eventually have the desire to seek a partner. "Eating and sex are human nature." More than two thousand years ago, Mencius was able to honestly say this truth. If we analyze it from the perspective of modern psychology, the more mysterious the riddle, the more eager they are to understand it. Because human beings are curious. If desires or emotions are not satisfied, diseases are likely to arise because the desire is repressed. Although they feel they have forgotten it and no longer think about it, the emotion does not diminish because of it. Sometimes it still appears in dreams at night. A worse effect is that fantasies arise because they cannot get what they want to satisfy their desires. Ghostly possession of women or nocturnal emissions and masturbation of men are based on the above reasons. Therefore, today, if we want to talk about curing such diseases, it is not about taking tonics and pills, but about enlightened parents and teachers having an enlightened understanding of young men and women, especially actively guiding young men and women in social interaction and correcting their attitudes and concepts. In this way, not only can psychological ailments be reduced, but also secretive behavior, misconduct, and events that damage social morals can be reduced. In this way, schools can have fewer unfortunate expulsions of young men and women, families can have fewer sick children, and the social atmosphere can be changed. "Flirting" and "scandalous news" can also be greatly reduced.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Ballerina's Destination

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One "A Very Pretty Lady!"

At this time, most of the embarrassment I felt earlier had disappeared. I began to speculate on her social status. Perhaps she was not even from the bourgeois class. But, she was pretending to have that aristocratic demeanor, instead lost her original self, which was very pitiful. I ignored her, and opened my briefcase, taking out a silver cigarette case. She took a cigarette, but had no matches--clearly she was in the habit of not carrying matches. Her eyes fell on my face again. I suddenly involuntarily handed her a box of matches, but still let her strike them herself. With this closeness, my nostrils caught a captivating fragrance.

"When will Hawthorne come?" She showed a resentful look, exhaling a puff of smoke.

"Probably soon, what is it you want?!"

Is she Hawthorne's friend? No. Is she here to consult Hawthorne about a difficult case? Her demeanor did not seem like it. Before my question could be answered, Hawthorne suddenly appeared at the door of the office.

When the woman saw Hawthorne come in, she did not stand up, but nodded slightly.

"Hawthorne--Mr. Hawthorne." Hawthorne, hearing her reluctant use of "Mr." looked at her with a glance, and shifted his gaze to my face. I coldly didn't react, and continued to eat my half-bowl of porridge.

Hawthorne sat down in another armchair, and asked: "I am honored, I didn't realize I'd be acquainted with this lady. May I ask for your name?"

"Anna." (Four)

### Farewell to "May"

— Ya Gu

As the early summer breeze quietly slipped across the fields, we laughed and sang happy songs to bid farewell to "May."

Farewell, bloody days.

Although separation is sad, today we want to sing happy songs.

There is a more bloody reality in front of us. The glorious survival and the humiliating fall have fiercely begun their decisive battle. We are ready to grit our teeth and endure all hardships because everyone believes that "Dawn" is coming, and the day that the whole world will forever sing will come.

"May" has left us peacefully, see you again next year. We sing cheerful songs to send you off.

Next year, next year, we will welcome you under the banner of freedom!

In the past, you brought us "lessons," and next year you will bring us "achievements."

### Phenomena in the Isolated Island Theater World

— Jun Mei

Today's isolated island theater world, due to the special circumstances, has many phenomena that cannot be harmonious, especially with Peking opera. Peking opera itself occasionally has points that cause controversy, but Peking opera is purely impressionistic, dealing with the seemingly true and seemingly false, and neither true nor false. From an artistic point of view, it cannot be overly criticized. Therefore, the many discords between actors, audiences, and critics are perhaps caused by emotional effects.

Peking opera is originally one of the local operas, so the words and sentences of the old scripts are superficial, only seeking popularity. If there are difficult to understand parts, they are passed down through generations. It is impossible for actors to correct them overnight due to their limited education. The new scripts written by contemporary actors often come from the hands of idle literati, who strive to make the words beautiful and the forms beautiful, resulting in a gradual trend towards aristocraticization. As for whether the scripts are good or bad, actors focus on understanding the plot, not on emphasizing meaning. This is why today's isolated island Peking opera is easily questioned and criticized. I have often thought that Peking opera has been popular for hundreds of years, subject to criticism and attacks at all times, but it can still stand firmly because every Peking opera script has a moral concept of suppressing evil and promoting good, which leaves a deep impression on people. It is not accidental. Today's actors can certainly take this as their goal, carefully examine themselves, abandon things that go against the times and are enough to corrupt people's minds, and abandon content that is obscene and has more flaws than merits. Then it may not be enough to survive. In ancient times, actors were prepared for satirical admonitions, was there no reason for it?

Listening to and watching operas is for regulating the spirit and appreciating art. When the art is exquisite, the audience can be pleasing to the eye, and cultivate the body and mind. If the art is bad, it wastes time and money, and tastes like chewing wax. As for the effect of the performance on the audience, opinions vary. Since understandings are different, they cannot be agreed upon. What A calls meaningful, B may think is mysterious and insignificant. What C calls deafening, D may even think is rude and unsympathetic. In the theater, after a song ends, this kind of phenomenon often occurs, thus guiding people to the right path or leading them astray. The difference is due to the person. Cheng Yanqiu's *Spring Boudoir Dream*; those who praise it call it "skillful and amazing," while those who belittle it condemn it as "absurd consciousness." I have not seen this play by Cheng Yanqiu, and I do not want to add arbitrary comments, but I feel that today's actors from the north are already trapped in the enemy's territory. Hoping that they will adapt to the needs of the times is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish. Moreover, actors are often limited by their education. With the flames of war filling the sky, they should only persevere through hardship, seek pleasure in suffering, and seek stimulation. How can they plan? Watching and listening to operas for the appreciation of art, I want to say nothing, but because of the time and place, we must make expedient measures. How to improve the latter, the society must teach them!

### About "National Spirit"

— Xin Ying

Not long ago, we saw a film starring Henry Fonda, "Young Lincoln." Recently, Nanjing also premiered a film depicting Lincoln's life fragments, "National Spirit" (Abe Lincoln in Illinois). The following is a special introduction to the film:

The Original Work Won an Award

The story of "National Spirit" is adapted from the original stage play, a recent work by the American contemporary playwright Robert Sherwood, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for this work.

Story Content

The story depicts Lincoln's early life and success. It begins with a tall, 21-year-old young man, and the last scene depicts Lincoln as president, leaving Washington station for the Civil War. In between this beginning and end, it depicts how Lincoln grew from a doubtful, shy person into a president. On a March evening, he bids farewell to friends at Springfield Station. Some romance is also inserted, because Lincoln fell in love with Ann Rutledge, but eventually married Mary Todd. At that time, he had experienced great pain in his heart because of love.

Public Screening Success

The original play has had considerable success on stage. This time, RKO Pictures made this film and went to look for the stage actor Raymond Massey, who is good at performing this play, to play the leading role. The performance was quite outstanding. Especially when Lincoln suffered inner pain for the love problem, his expression was profound. After the film was made, when it was screened on Broadway in New York, the seat price was increased to four dollars and forty cents, and it was performed for 472 times. The American film audience's praise for this film can also be seen!

### After Watching Three Episodes of Swordplay of Gods and Monsters

— Lan Shan Ke

I haven't seen a machine-based opera for a long time. Yesterday, at the invitation of a friend, I went to the Grand Theatre to watch three episodes of Swordplay of Gods and Monsters. The Grand Theatre has a new atmosphere since the reform and the introduction of assigned seats. The three episodes of Swordplay of Gods and Monsters intersperse a meaningful story, which is the story of Zheng Chenggong's martyrdom. At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the Qing had conquered the whole country, and all the generals had surrendered. Only General Zheng Chenggong, with an indomitable spirit, led the isolated army, retreated to the Six Union City on the corner of Taiwan, and refused to surrender to the Qing, wanting to restore the Ming Dynasty. It happened that one of Zheng Gong's subordinates, Lang Tingzuo, suddenly rebelled, attacked the governor's office at night, and captured Zheng Gong and his son. Lang's old mother was very virtuous, and immediately came to teach her rebellious son. Lang wanted to kill his mother, but fortunately his cousin Lin Sumei came to save her aunt. But a weak woman was no match for Lang, and in the midst of danger, a dart came from the air, and Lang was injured on the spot. Then came the old hero Sheng Ying, who killed Lang and released Zheng Gong and his son. At that time, the Qing soldiers attacked the city very urgently. The subordinates reported the danger. Zheng Gong and his son led the isolated army to fight bravely. Lin Sumei led her aunt, Lady Lang, to break through the encirclement. Zheng Chenggong was injured by an arrow, but fortunately, the old hero Sheng rescued Zheng Gong and his son. Zheng Gong, because of the serious injury, the Qing soldiers had entered the city and set fire to kill people. Zheng Gong entrusted his orphan on his deathbed, wishing the generals would continue to work hard to restore the Ming Dynasty and avenge him. The story above is truly worth singing and crying. It is now performed in a machine-based stage opera, which is really rare. Chen Xiaomu's Zheng Chenggong, although fiery, is still competent. Xiao Wenlin's Lang Tingzuo is too slippery, and the old actor Yang Xiaoting's Old Lady Lang is the most competent, with skilled acting. Zhang Shuxian's Lin Sumei is petite and exquisite, and her martial arts are also deep. Lin Shusen's typical old hero Sheng Ying is quite suitable, although his voice is low, it is gratifying that he does not use his left voice. The night tour of the Governor's Office is quite realistic, with stars and moon, and the lighting is also good. In the Battle Outside the City, before the Qing soldiers entered the city

### Gone With the Wind

The release date of Gone With the Wind, according to the latest confirmation, Dahua decided to make the Far East premiere at 8 pm on June 18th. According to the original book of Gone With the Wind, the Western text is "Gone With the Wind", which is a famous novel that sells the most and is well-known in every household. The various propaganda materials shipped by MGM Company do not have a brief story, and they do not mention the plot of the whole film at all. Therefore, the Dahua Propaganda Department had to read the 24-book giant film to write a more detailed Chinese synopsis. The Qing soldiers have already left the city from inside, which made the audience panic, thinking that the city has been broken. Although it is a small matter, it should also be noted. This paragraph is the most exciting in the three episodes, the rest is not recorded in detail.

### A Solemn Warning to Wartime Artistic Comrades

— Feng Hezi

—Don't Be a Begging Mendicant—

Ms. Hezi (i.e. Fengzi) recently published the following article in Chongqing, which was written out of emotion. Haixing Society obtained the original manuscript and sent it out to inform the men and women of the wartime art world.

Wartime artistic comrades:

I am always thinking about a problem.

Each of us seems to be living in an uneasy, irritable, and contradictory spiritual life, mutually shouting emptiness and disappointment—melancholy locks every brow, and melancholy has become a symptom of the current illness.

Obviously, comrades who are engaged in artistic work in the rear during this great era are mostly reluctantly staying behind. Naturally, if the work can progress as ideally, it may not be comforting! Unfortunately, in the rear where various conditions are lacking, coupled with the limitations of the objective environment, we will inevitably suffer many small stimuli. Moreover, our artistic workers themselves are too scattered, and the institutions are not sensitive. Much time and opportunity are slipping away in waiting and watching. Time that has slipped away will not come back, and we cannot forgive ourselves for this.

Many people are fighting desperately and enduring hardships in the front, even sacrificing themselves, but most of us are waiting in vain. We are not unwilling to work, let alone unable to work, so why do we let ourselves sink into emptiness and dissatisfaction? Work is multifaceted, especially the cultivation and training of our art departments are endless. People engaged in art should have the enthusiasm of a religious faith and should be deeply saddened to forget everything about themselves, otherwise they will always be a mendicant ridiculed by others, masquerading as beggars, and perfunctorily living.

### Opinions on Song Lyrics

— Wang Rong

Songs have a great relationship with life: when feeling annoyed, singing two lighthearted songs will sweep away worries and bring joy and happiness; when feeling disheartened, singing two impassioned songs will bring excitement. At the same time, constantly singing those cloying "lang ya mei ya" songs, even if initially aspiring to something noble, will gradually erode one's ambition. France's success attributed to the Marseillaise and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang neglecting state affairs due to his love for the "Rainbow Skirt Feather Dress Dance," leading to the An Lushan Rebellion, are both good examples.

The decline of some domestic films on the isolated island has drawn considerable criticism, because the decline of movies has led to movie songs becoming vulgar and unbearable. Opening up popular song collections on the market, you are met with things like "Brother Loves Me" and "I Love Brother." What difference is there between these kinds of songs that only anesthetize people's minds and the music of a fallen nation? In this autumn of national survival, instead of creating songs that can invigorate the people's hearts and are similar to the Marseillaise, they specialize in creating decadent sounds. This is truly a disgrace to the Shanghai music scene. I send a message to the composers of Shanghai, do not just anesthetize people because the government has not been able to take care of it. It is not only letting down the country and the nation, but also letting down yourself.

### A Meeting with Director Fei Mu

— Hai Xing

Yesterday I happened to meet Director Fei Mu. Talking about the film "Confucius," Mr. Fei immediately began with humble words, saying, "This decision was bold and reckless, bold and reckless!" Speaking of the working situation of the film, it is said that all of it has been filmed and completed, waiting only for editing. It is inevitable that there are still places that are not satisfactory, and perhaps a few more shots will be filmed. It will take about a month to complete the editing. The reporter asked about when it would be released. He replied, "Mr. Li Shimin has this intention, but I don't think it is necessary to force it. As far as I know, most American cinemas are directly under the jurisdiction of production companies, and foreign films are not easy to insert. If it is taken to Chinatown for screening, naturally there is no problem, but it is probably not easy to show it in mainstream theaters that are exclusively for people from that country." Later, Mr. Fei expressed a lot of emotion about the Chinese film industry today, because the environment is so bad and the material conditions are so poor, and it is not easy to discuss. Finally, he spoke frankly and said: "However, this period is temporary. In the future, the workers of all departments will be re-evaluated, and movies are certainly no exception!"
