Editorial

### Shanghai's Spring Festival This Year

Regardless of who it is, assuming that they do not regard life and the functions of society as merely mechanical, then the national new year is just the national new year. But one should still not overbearingly disregard the Spring Festival, or too lightly scorn its meaning. Of course, deliberately resisting government orders and excessively advocating the Spring Festival is unnecessary and unacceptable.

During the Spring Festival, the entire society takes a break following custom; therefore, people in all professions are also on vacation; the society becomes a sleeping state, and the season becomes a time for special consumption. What is striking is the completely new Spring Festival couplets, chanting good wishes; young men and women in brightly colored clothes, walking in groups; game parks announce they are full, and thoroughfares also announce that they are crowded. The usual habit of complaining at every turn, even throwing punches, is replaced these days by casually spoken blessings and polite bows; the evil mother-in-law who is stern all year round may have a hint of a smile these days; the cold-hearted procuress may have some warmth these days; street beggars, of course, these days are likely to meet a temporary small philanthropist; those who toil like oxen and horses all year round can also get a little respite. In short, the Spring Festival has all these natural blessings; regardless of who it is, one should not disregard these blessings, as they have their own value. One must admit that the Spring Festival generally creates a temporary zest for life. What's more, yesterday it was confirmed that the Chinese army had officially recovered Xiaochu, adding even more splendor to the Spring Festival!

But one must also remember: in the midst of the War of Resistance, the generals and soldiers on the front lines, braving wind and snow, sweating and bleeding, are striving for the survival of the nation, for the final victory, they have no time to enjoy the natural blessings of the Spring Festival! The survival or destruction of the nation, the life or death of the race, and the success or failure of the war are not the sole responsibility of the generals and soldiers on the front lines; sweating and bleeding are not their sole obligations. The arrival of the final victory is bought with their blood and lives, but everything after the victory is not for them to enjoy alone! Remembering this, how should the average person spend this Spring Festival?

Now, the Chinese authorities are promoting a widespread "Spring Gift Military Appreciation Movement," intending to express the people in the rear's remembrance of the soldiers on the front lines and to comfort them; this is a duty, and it must not be regarded as a mere seasonal decoration. Chairman Chiang himself has set an example, sending a large sum of money through representatives to the Spring Gift Military Appreciation Association to commend the soldiers fighting in the War of Resistance; people everywhere have also followed suit and responded enthusiastically. Since the National Army moved west, Shanghai has become an isolated island, and the Chinese people on the isolated island naturally have many differences from those in the interior; but the bloodlines are the same, and their consciences are the same. The relationship between the prosperity or decline of the nation and the success or failure of the War of Resistance is exactly the same. Therefore, this "Spring Gift Military Appreciation Movement" has also risen up in response, organizing a fundraising committee to solicit donations from all sectors of industry and commerce, setting a goal of 500,000 yuan for the comfort fund, which will be apportioned among the various industry associations to contribute to the country. From what we can see, we believe that with the scale of Shanghai's hundreds of industries, and with last year's abnormal special prosperity, the amount of 500,000 is actually too small; and we also believe that apportioning it among the various industries will easily gather the sum, but its meaning should be shared by every Chinese resident of Shanghai; so how can we, in addition to apportioning 500,000 yuan among the industries, see the automatic donations and enthusiastic contributions of Chinese residents, so that the results far exceed expectations?

We do not deny that the Spring Festival is a good festival, we do not oppose the liveliness of the Spring Festival, but the residents of the isolated island have long been criticized for being addicted to pleasure, and many people have earned a bad reputation for making a fortune from the national crisis, so how should they save a portion of their Spring Festival spending and contribute it to the War of Resistance, to the country? Then, as the results show, the Spring Festival, while playing with gongs and firecrackers, will be even more impressive!

Most notably, French Prime Minister Daladier concurrently holds the positions of Minister of Defense and Minister of Foreign Affairs, which is inevitably too much to handle, especially during this time of war, making it even more difficult to attend to everything. Therefore, political figures generally expect Daladier to resign from his concurrent positions as ministers soon. It was previously rumored that the current Foreign Minister, Deli Bo, would be promoted to Foreign Minister, but Deli is not well-known abroad. There is talk of choosing one of the three people to succeed him: former Prime Minister Naval, former Foreign Minister Taylor Bos, and the current Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Missetler. Secondly, both the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Aviation are rumored to be replaced. In particular, Interior Minister Sarraut is older and there is more possibility of change. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier is preparing to expand the foundation of the cabinet during this cabinet reorganization to include both the Radical Republican Party led by Marin on the right and the Socialist Party led by Blum on the left, but the general policy will not change.

### US Government Decides to Continue Economic Aid to China - New Loan of $20 Million Negotiated - A Powerful Reply to Japan's Infringement of Rights

Washington. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday passed a bill to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by one hundred million U.S. dollars, so that the bank can further provide economic assistance to China. At the same time, it also amended the loan bill to China, allowing China to obtain an additional loan of 20 million U.S. dollars. According to Biderman, the proposer of the bill, "The U.S. authorities are now very willing to provide more loans to assist China." According to Jones, the director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the U.S. is currently conducting new loan negotiations with China. China has applied for a credit loan of 75 million U.S. dollars, secured by tin exports. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)

Washington. Amidst the U.S. government's plan to lend the National Government another new loan of 20 million U.S. dollars in the near future, officials announced last night that China has already exceeded the original amount due for the repayment of the 25 million U.S. dollar loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to China in 1928. Jones, the chairman of the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, declared that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had planned to approve the Export-Import Bank to lend China another 20 million U.S. dollars, but that the loan could not be used to purchase military supplies. Jones denied that part of the 25 million U.S. dollars in 1938 was used to purchase munitions. It is said that China did not use the loan proceeds to purchase aircraft and other military equipment. China's purchases were limited to non-military items only. Jones also announced that in addition to the 25 million U.S. dollar loan granted to the Universal Trading Corporation, which represented the Chinese government, in 1938, the Export-Import Bank had received an additional 16 million U.S. dollars in outstanding Chinese loans, of which 6 million U.S. dollars had already been repaid. The loan was originally 26 million U.S. dollars, divided into two parts. The first part was a 17 million U.S. dollar loan directly granted by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Chinese government for the purchase of cotton and wheat. The second part was a 9 million U.S. dollar loan granted to China by the Food Relief Commission after the Chinese flood in 1931. China is about to exhaust the 25 million U.S. dollars in 1928, but has repaid 2.2 million U.S. dollars with the proceeds from tung oil exports, which is more than the repayment schedule. It is currently in contact with Chinese officials about China repaying the new U.S. loan of 20 million U.S. dollars with tin. China's loan negotiations with the U.S. amount to 75 million U.S. dollars. (Associated Press telegram, 9th)

Chongqing. This morning, the Chinese newspapers here all published the news that the United States intends to lend 20 million U.S. dollars to China in a prominent position. The newspapers believe that the United States is now giving a concrete response to Japan's discrimination against its rights in China. (Reuters telegram, 10th)

Japanese Government and Public Are Unusually Concerned, Considering It an Unfriendly Act

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro stated that the Japanese government is extremely concerned about the possible news of the United States lending soft loans to China. If the U.S. loan is used for military needs, "the Japanese government will regard this as an extremely serious matter." (Associated Press telegram, 9th)

Tokyo. This morning, newspapers expressed indignation at the United States' policy of "obstructing Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia," and criticized the United States' plan to lend Chongqing a new loan of 20 million U.S. dollars as an unfriendly act towards Japan, and severely criticized U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson for contacting other third countries to conduct a movement to refuse to recognize the regime. "Hoochi Shimbun" stated that the 80-year-old friendly relationship between the United States and Japan is now in danger of breaking down. The Japanese government is preparing to take countermeasures to cope with the changes. It is now closely watching the future trend of U.S. policy. It is expected that Baron Sakatani Yoshiro will speak out against the U.S. policy toward East Asia at the House of Peers meeting this morning. (Reuters telegram, 10th)

### US Far East Policy - Its Position Remains Unchanged - The So-called "New Order in East Asia" - Is Incompatible with the Open Door

Washington. During the consecutive meetings of the Japanese House of Representatives, some members and Foreign Minister Arita have been involved in the unilateral abolition of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Officials here remain calm after hearing the news, and said that no matter how Japanese members make inappropriate remarks or issue threats, the policy that the United States is pursuing on the Far East situation is still as described in the note delivered to Japan on December 31, 1938, and will never change. In other words, the rights enjoyed by the United States in China based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty will still be maintained and will not allow Japan to undermine them with unilateral actions. This position remains unchanged to this day, and there is no change. Moreover, after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce in 1911, the U.S. government has been imposing embargoes on Japan at any time, so it can be more calm about the Far East situation. American officials are unwilling to criticize the debate in the Japanese House of Representatives, and only said that this is an internal affair of the country. The U.S. government would rather have Ambassador Grew stationed in Japan explain the situation to the Japanese government authorities at any time, rather than issue a public statement here, so as not to cause repercussions in public opinion and make the tense situation between the U.S. and Japan more severe. (Havas telegram, 8th)

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita told the Diet Budget Committee yesterday that we must study the issue of abolishing the Nine-Power Treaty to determine whether the issue hinders or promotes the construction of the "new order in East Asia." Kiyose Ichiro's suggestion in the Japanese Diet on Wednesday, the Soviet Union put Outer Mongolia under the Soviet sphere of influence, first "infringed the Nine-Power Treaty," so it is necessary to demand that the government abolish the Nine-Power Treaty to adapt to the "new situation" in the Far East. Japan can abolish the Nine-Power Treaty for the same reason. On Thursday, the "Asahi Shimbun" published a new movement in Japan, arguing that if the United States implements a ban on the import of munitions raw materials to Japan, Japan will announce the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty.

### New York Financier - Sues Chen Guangfu, etc. - Demanding $1 Million in Compensation

New York. New York financier Hirshutt yesterday sued the Universal Trading Corporation and the Chinese financial study group to the United States, including Xi Demao, Chen Guangfu, and Ren, etc., in the Supreme Court's appellate court. In Hirsch's lawsuit, he filed a claim against Xi Demao for damages of one million U.S. dollars as compensation for conducting a 30 million U.S. dollar loan to China in 1938.

### Focus of Japanese Diet - Shifts to Budget Committee - Minister of Finance Explains Additional Military Expenses - Spending 16 Billion Yuan on the Invasion of China

Tokyo. The dates for the review of next year's budget in the Japanese House of Representatives have been decided as follows: February 5 to 12 will be for questioning by the General Budget Committee, February 13 to 19 will be for questioning by the subcommittees, February 20 will be for discussions and decisions by the various factions, February 21 in the morning will be for decisions by the subcommittees, and the General Budget Committee will decide in the afternoon. Therefore, the submission of the budget proposal to the plenary session of the House of Representatives will be on February 22. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

Tokyo. This morning, Minister of Finance Sakurai explained the special military budget of 4,460,000,000 yuan for the war against China in 1940-41 at the plenary session of the House Budget Committee. He said that the special military budget for the next term includes 2,973,000,000 yuan for special army expenses, 737,000,000 yuan for special navy expenses, and 750,000,000 yuan for reserves. Of the above-mentioned 4,460,000,000 yuan, 3,673,000,000 yuan will have to be raised by issuing public bonds, 600,000,000 yuan will be allocated from general revenue, 158,000,000 yuan will be paid from the special tax levied due to the North China Incident, and the rest will be withdrawn from other revenues. The Minister of Finance also submitted about 11 supplementary budgets. The first item aims to increase the pensions for families of army and navy personnel. The Minister of Finance agreed to economize on the expenses of various government departments to transfer them to the expenses of the various supplementary budgets. (Reuters telegram, 5th)

Tokyo. According to the statistics of the temporary military budget submitted by the Ministry of Finance since the outbreak of the incident until this parliamentary session, the total amount reached 16.455 billion yuan. The source of funds for the 16.491 billion yuan exceeded the amount by 33.6 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance also announced at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 10th that the total amount of government funds paid since the outbreak of the China Incident was: 1.285066 billion yuan in "Showa 12," 4.714387 billion yuan in "Showa 13," and 5.334262 billion yuan in "Showa 14." Government expenditures have been increasing rapidly in recent years. The total amount in the past year was more than four times stronger than the year the incident occurred.

### Wartime Tax Increase Plan - Strong Opposition from Diet Members

Tokyo. At yesterday's meeting of the House of Representatives, members strongly criticized the 32 bills proposed by the government regarding wartime tax increases, which contained many controversial points. Those who questioned were all worried that after the tax increase, the expansion of industrial production would be hit and fall into crisis. They do not want to see this happen today. It is said that when a secret meeting was held yesterday, the Planning Agency's explanation of the government's material mobilization plan has aroused even more acute disputes. The contents of this plan have not been disclosed so far. According to "Nikkan Shimbun," members of the House of Representatives yesterday felt that the Planning Agency Director's explanation of the material mobilization plan was too abstract and unsatisfactory, so they stopped continuing the discussion and requested that another secret meeting be held today, with government representatives explaining the main details of the plan. The members insisted that the plan was related to the huge 100 million yuan budget proposal and could not be separated. Therefore, they must first know its main contents before they could start discussing the budget proposal, so that they would not be clueless. After the secret meeting yesterday, the president of the Seiyukai and chairman of the House Budget Committee asked the government to provide a detailed explanation and not be too secretive. It is said that the main questions today are whether the expenditures in the budget proposal can be increased and whether the required materials can be purchased with the earmarked funds. It is also said, "We are not asking the government to disclose national defense secrets now. What we want to know is whether the entire industry, and focusing on the materials expected to be used, is sufficient to compensate for the huge and amazing budget proposal. I hope that the government will think from a larger perspective and clarify everything so that the people will be more satisfied. Today, everything is wrapped in secrecy. If such a simple matter is also kept secret, how will the country survive the current emergency?" According to the Ministry of Finance, of the 5,925,000,000 yuan in public bonds that were allowed to be issued within the current fiscal year ending on March 31, 3,078,000,000 yuan has not yet been issued. A total of 1,700,000,000 yuan in public bonds that were allowed to be issued in the previous fiscal year has been transferred to the current fiscal year, roughly half because of the lack of necessary materials, resulting in the failure to use the allocated funds. Therefore, the House of Representatives is requesting the government to provide a more detailed explanation of the material mobilization plan. Hoochi Shimbun today published a photo showing seven members of the Diet sleeping soundly in their seats while the Minister of Finance was speaking in the House of Representatives, and added a comment: "Please pay attention to this unintentionally captured photo, knowing that the 500 million yuan tax increase bill was proposed during this nap."

### French Protest to Japan Over Bombing of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway - US Regards It As a Transportation Artery - Ambassador Grew Urges Japan to Pay Attention

Tokyo. It has been learned that French Ambassador to Japan Henri has filed a protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft on Thursday and Saturday. In the air raid on Thursday, five French people were killed or injured, including two women and one child. (Reuters telegram, 5th)

Chongqing. The latest news from Kunming regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway last Thursday has confirmed that the three trains bombed were slow trains, not the "Michelin" express train. The train's locomotive was destroyed, causing several passenger cars to burn. The number of casualties may reach two to three hundred. As far as is currently known, more than one hundred and ten people have died. The news that a French railway employee and his mother and children were killed is particularly tragic. Their names have not yet been announced. According to witnesses of the tragedy, in addition to those who were killed or injured by the bombing, there were quite a few who died from steam flames, boiling water, and landslides. Yunnan-Vietnam passenger cars often have first-class and second-class cars close to the locomotive, so the dead and injured are all foreigners and upper-class Chinese. Chinese sources said that Chinese and Japanese aircraft had several dogfights in the airspace over Kaiyuan (transliteration) on that day, shooting down a Japanese bomber. However, this news has not yet been officially confirmed. (Reuters telegram, 5th)

Tokyo. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew clearly notified the Japanese government last week that the United States was quite concerned about the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft. Grew informed the Japanese government that although it could not be regarded as a formal protest, the notification was meaningful because the relationship between Japan and the United States was already tense. It is said that Grew informed the Japanese government that the U.S. government regarded the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway as a transportation artery for goods shipped to the United States and as an important route for U.S. nationals and diplomats to travel. A reporter learned that the United States used the same notification to arouse the attention of the French Foreign Ministry. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)

Tokyo. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today while hosting newspaper reporters that French Ambassador to Japan Henri submitted a formal note to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki yesterday, protesting the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by aircraft on February 2, which resulted in the death or injury of a number of French people. The Vice Minister replied at the time that the departure of Japanese aircraft was purely for military and strategic necessity. The spokesman continued that if French people were killed as a result, the Japanese government was extremely regretful. The Japanese government will take a reasonable and fair approach to compensate for the loss of life of the people of third countries. The Japanese government's protest to the French government will be given a written reply after further study. (Reuters telegram, 7th)

### Japan Is Willing to Sign Non-Aggression Treaties with the Philippines, India, and the Dutch East Indies - It Does Not Mention Annam Alone - Revealing Its Ambition to Invade Vietnam

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita told the Diet yesterday that Japan is willing to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, India, or any South Sea country, but only on the condition that each country intends to conclude such a pact with Japan. In response to questions about Japan concluding a non-aggression pact with the Dutch East Indies, Arita stated that Japan's southward advance policy does not harbor territorial ambitions, but only wants to develop the resources of the South Sea countries. He said that it is quite reasonable for Japan to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Philippines, the East Indies, and India. (Associated Press telegram, 10th)

Chongqing. Arita suggested yesterday in the Japanese Diet that non-aggression treaties be signed with the Philippines, India, and the South Sea countries, but did not mention Annam at all. Observers familiar with current affairs here believe that this is an indication that Japan is preparing to take aggressive action against Annam. If Japan can conquer the wealthy Annam, it can lay a solid foundation for its southward advance policy. Furthermore, after Japan occupied Hainan Island, the Xinnansha Islands, Zhou Island, and recently invaded Guangxi, it felt that Annam was already in its grasp. Japan's ambition is obviously to cut off the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands' assistance to France. (Associated Press telegram, 10th)

### The Japanese Military Is Deeply Mired; Eager for Peace; Yonai's Delusional Hopes for Cooperation Between Chiang and Wang

Tokyo: The Japanese government has decided to hold a secret meeting in the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 10th to explain the peace terms concluded between the Japanese government and the "new Chinese government" and other issues related to the handling of the situation. (9th United Press)

Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Yonai stated in Parliament today that Japan hopes that the leaders of the Chongqing faction will join the "New Central Government" of Jingwei in their individual capacities, and that Commander-in-Chief Chiang is also welcome. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese officials have consistently stated that they do not want to have any relationship with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Yonai's statement can be described as the first time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Yonai made this statement in response to a question from Representative Kuboi Michiyoshi. Yonai also stated that Japan can also make considerable concessions to third countries in China, but they must be in line with the spirit of the "New Order in East Asia." If a third country intends to hinder Japan's progress in China, Japan will take a resolute attitude. (7th Associated Press)

Chongqing: Officials here believe that Yonai's statement in the Japanese Parliament yesterday, hoping that leaders of the Chongqing faction would join the organization of Jingwei and saying that Commander-in-Chief Chiang would be welcome if he could join, is "delusional" and not worthy of criticism at all. Yonai's statement either shows a complete lack of understanding of the true situation in free China, or it is intended to deceive the Japanese public, or it is a sign that Japan is eager for peace and compromise. Two years ago, the Japanese government obtained the Emperor's permission to no longer have any dealings with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Now that Yonai has clearly stated that he welcomes Commander-in-Chief Chiang to cooperate, it is clear that he can no longer maintain his past position. (8th Associated Press)

London: Regarding the rumor from Tokyo that Japan does not oppose Commander-in-Chief Chiang joining a government that includes Wang Jingwei, someone asked a responsible spokesperson in London yesterday whether the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had mentioned this matter when he spoke with Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Chongqing. The spokesperson replied that London had not received information on the events discussed in Chongqing, but felt that this suggestion may not have been mentioned, as the Chongqing government is the one that can respond to this suggestion, and the Chongqing government has repeatedly made clear its attitude towards cooperation with Japan. (9th Reuters)

### General Stern Is Transferred Back to the Far East, Proving That Japanese-Soviet Relations Are Not Entirely Satisfactory

Finland: General Meretskov, Commander of the Leningrad Military District, was originally the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Union's war against Finland. However, due to his lack of success, he was dismissed by the Soviet government and replaced by General Stern, Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, to continue the battle. According to the "Iltasanomat" newspaper here, General Stern has recently been transferred back to the Far East, proving that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are not entirely satisfactory. (8th Havas)

Tokyo: Army Minister General Hata Shunroku recently declared in the House of Representatives that since Japan and the Soviet Union signed the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement on September 16th last year, "illegal actions" have continued to occur on the Soviet and "Manchurian border," and everything has not been entirely satisfactory. (7th Havas)

### Asama Maru Incident: Anglo-Japanese Compromise; Nine Detained Germans: Britain Agrees to Hand Them Over to Japan

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro stated in the House of Peers today that the British government has the desire to resolve the Asama Maru incident peacefully. Therefore, in a letter received on February 5th, it agreed to hand over nine Germans captured from the "Asama Maru." The date and location of the handover will be agreed upon by both parties. The Japanese government is not satisfied with handing over only a portion of the Germans and will continue to demand that the British side hand over the other twelve Germans. (6th Reuters)

London: Last night, both the British House of Lords and the House of Commons raised questions about the Asama Maru incident. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax made the same remarks in their replies. The Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Lords that after the British and Japanese governments exchanged documents, "After the twenty-one German passengers of the 'Asama Maru' were arrested, their training and experience were investigated, and it was found that some of them were relatively unsuitable for military service. The British government, while reserving its legal rights, is prepared to release nine Germans. These nine people will be handed over to the appropriate Japanese shipping authorities. At the same time, the Japanese government has instructed its shipping companies to no longer allow people of belligerent countries who belong to the military or are suspected of being military personnel to travel on Japanese ships. The British government maintains its view of its legal position in this matter, but it is expected that incidents similar to the Asama Maru incident will be avoided in the future." (7th Reuters)

### The United States Promotes Peaceful Diplomacy; Begins Contacting Neutral Governments; US Secretary of State Issues Statement on Adjusting the Economy and Reducing Armaments

Washington: Secretary of State Hull issued a written statement last night stating that, in view of the fact that the neutral countries all show a strong desire for the restoration of world peace, the United States has begun informal diplomatic talks with the governments of the neutral countries. These talks do not involve any specific plan, and their nature is only a preliminary inquiry on (1) a sound international economic system and (2) worldwide arms reduction. These talks can also be extended to belligerent countries, but only limited to the above two common issues related to future peace, and do not include events related to the current war situation. Furthermore, these talks are not related to Under Secretary of State Welles' trip to Europe. It is reported that Hull has summoned the ambassadors and ministers of various countries to the United States and started these talks. According to a representative of the State Department, the talks are not aimed at promoting peace in Europe, but focus on what kind of organization the post-war world should have. Well-informed sources generally believe that it would be a mistake to regard the peace talks with neutral countries as an effort to end the current European war. The purpose of the US government's move is obviously to provide assurances to the neutral countries, especially the smaller ones, that their interests will not be ignored when peace is discussed in the future. The United States will strive to achieve a truly lasting peace, so that it can reduce armaments and restore international commerce. Regarding this point, all the dignitaries have stated in recent public speeches that when the war ends in the future, the United States and other countries will encounter extremely serious difficulties due to the necessary adjustments in commerce and finance. (10th Reuters)

New York: According to a statement from Washington, the US government has decided to do its best to no longer send sharp notes on the issue of neutrality to Britain. All issues between the British and American governments can now be resolved through private talks between American officials in Washington and British Ambassador Lord Lothian, or between British officials and American Ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy. According to some officials, in the past two months, the United States has continuously sent strongly worded notes to Britain, which has aroused British feelings to an alarming degree. In fact, the dispute between the two countries is useless and only provides direct encouragement to Hitler. This new policy of the United States naturally depends on whether serious incidents of British infringement of American neutral rights will occur in the future. (6th Reuters)

Washington: After issuing the communique, Secretary of State Hull immediately invited the relevant ambassadors to the State Department in stages for talks. This morning, he first met with the Dutch Minister to the United States, Loudon. According to a spokesperson for the State Department, these talks are not aimed at restoring peace in Europe, but are actually related to the issue of the post-war world organization. However, if all the belligerent countries can participate in the talks together, peace may not be impossible to achieve. (9th Havas)

Washington: According to a recently published report, Secretary of State Hull stated to the House Appropriations Committee when he expressed his views on the State Department's annual fee of approximately 20 million yuan that there is no hope for an early peace in Europe at present. Judging from the phenomenon, tension and danger will continue indefinitely. (7th Reuters)

### The US President Sends Welles to Inspect Britain, France, Germany, and Italy; Officials Say He Does Not Have a Formal Negotiation Mission; Only Aims to Obtain Information on the European Situation

Washington: US Under Secretary of State Welles will now depart for Europe immediately as a personal representative of President Roosevelt in order to seek the most reliable information on the overall situation in Europe. He is scheduled to depart on the Laconia on February 17th, going directly to Italy and then to London and Paris. Berlin may also be visited. The general impression in Washington is that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull want a detailed report from an unbiased source, but this move may not be a prelude to a peace movement. (10th Reuters)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently issued a written statement to the press stating, "Under Secretary of State Welles, at my request, is scheduled to travel to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy for a short period of time. The sole purpose of his trip is to inspect the current situation in Europe and submit a report to me and Secretary of State Hull, but he has no authority to make suggestions to other countries in the name of the US government or accept any constraints. The statements made to him by the authorities of various countries should also be kept absolutely confidential, and only reported by him to me and Secretary of State Hull." After the President read this written statement, a reporter asked whether Welles intended to meet with German leader Hitler on this trip. The President replied that he did not know. Another asked whether Welles intended to inspect other countries besides Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. The President replied that it had not been determined. A reporter also asked whether Welles was "carrying a letter from the President" on this trip. The President answered no. Finally, the President also stated that Welles was traveling to Europe alone this time, and that no one would be appointed to act as Under Secretary of State during his absence. It is reported that Welles is scheduled to take the Italian mail ship "Rex" to Italy on the 17th of this month. Myron Taylor, the President's personal representative to the Vatican, will also travel with him on the same ship. (9th Havas)

Washington: The Washington "Times" published an essay today explaining the reasons for the US government's dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to various European countries for investigation. It is said that (1) President Roosevelt deeply fears that Europe will face a serious crisis this spring. If it can be avoided, not only will the entire Europe not fall into chaos, but also the United States' foreign trade will not be affected. (2) Secretary of State Hull believes that the existence of the world's four major commercial groups affects the security of the US commercial treaties and large amounts of reserves. The so-called four major commercial groups are as follows: A. Countries that have signed clearing agreements with Germany, B. The British Empire and the Sterling Area (including Argentina and Uruguay), C. The Yen Area, and D. The Dollar Area. Hull intends to persuade the neutral countries to restore the international gold standard and unanimously demand a sound economic organization at the future peace conference. (10th Haimun)

London: The local morning newspapers have all praised the fact that US Under Secretary of State Welles will visit Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, but they said that Britain and France have already had a clear idea of the preliminary conditions for peace negotiations and will not change them. (10th Havas)

Berlin: Responsible officials in Berlin expressed great surprise at the United States' dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to visit Europe. As of last night, the German Foreign Ministry had not received a formal note. People in Berlin are not commenting on Welles' trip for the time being. (10th Haimun)

New York: Today, local newspapers printed the news of Under Secretary of State Welles' mission to Europe and the State Department's announcement of "peace talks" with various neutral countries in large print. The New York Times' correspondent in Washington called it a "dual offensive for European peace" and the "President's long-awaited peace offensive," and said that if Welles made practical progress in Berlin, it would not be impossible for the US Ambassador to Germany to return to his post. (10th Reuters)

Amsterdam: Today, a correspondent in Berlin for the local radio news agency stated that official circles in Berlin were keeping silent about the fact that US Under Secretary of State Welles was about to visit various European capitals. The correspondent also said that because the warring parties each have completely different goals, it is unlikely that peace can be achieved without a decisive military battle. The Nazi regime has announced that its sole war aim is to destroy Britain's "world hegemony." (—— Reuters)

Rome: Officials here have expressed satisfaction with the US announcement that Under Secretary of State Welles will visit Europe and that the US has begun informal diplomatic talks with the governments of various neutral countries. It is expected that Welles will have a slightly longer stay in Rome in order to meet with Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (10th Reuters)

### US House of Representatives Reduces Navy Budget

Washington: The House Appropriations Committee yesterday cut $100,000,000 from the Navy's budget for 1941. However, according to a member of the committee, although the Navy's budget has been reduced, it will not hinder the current shipbuilding program (that is, the program to build 19 ships in 1941). The $20,000,000 for purchasing harbor defense submarine nets was also cut. The purpose of this move is to avoid the $460,000,000 in new taxes estimated by the President. (9th United Press)

### The United States Is Reluctant to Sever Relations with the Soviet Union Prematurely; Hull Writes About Relations Between the Two Countries; American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow Closes

Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the US government firmly believes in "the obligations assumed by the Soviet Union when it resumed diplomatic relations." Hull wrote to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, describing US-Soviet relations and explaining that the relations between the two countries are "not entirely consistent with the US-Soviet Treaty." In the treaty, the Soviet Union promised not to conduct propaganda in the United States, but on several occasions, the US government believed that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled its promise. When the United States negotiated with the Soviet Union, "satisfactory results were obtained on several occasions, but on several occasions, the Soviet Union's explanations conflicted with the treaty." (9th United Press)

Washington: Senator Vandenberg (Republican), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently requested that Secretary of State Hull sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Hull recently replied in a letter, stating, "When the United States and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations in 1933, the then Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, provided several guarantees, which the Soviet government did not fully comply with." However, in the US government's view, the issue of maintaining US-Soviet diplomatic relations should not only depend on whether the Soviet Union complies with the guarantees it has provided. According to custom, whenever the US government believes that another government is not complying with its obligations, it will draw its attention through diplomatic channels. (8th Havas)

Moscow: According to news from here today, the American Chamber of Commerce in the Soviet Union closed its doors today.

### French House of Representatives Holds Secret Meeting; Banning Observers

Paris: The Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this morning. First, the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, raised questions about the measures that the government intends to take to maximize France's military strength, and requested that observers be banned. Although Prime Minister Daladier expressed his opposition, the Chamber of Deputies ultimately decided to do so by a majority of 262 votes to 227. As a result, all the people in the audience and the journalists withdrew, and the Chamber of Deputies immediately held a secret meeting. In addition, five members of parliament raised questions about the government's general war policy. Prime Minister Daladier immediately revealed the activities of the German political police in France, saying that the local authorities had recently seized many documents, including a questionnaire, which should be answered item by item by the staff of the German political police. Thereupon Prime Minister Daladier presented the questionnaire and read it out. The most important questions were "Is Daladier loved by the French masses?" "What is his prestige like?" "When the Chamber of Deputies votes on a motion of confidence, how many votes can he get?" "Who are his political friends and who are his political enemies?" "Does France trust the Arab and black soldiers in its colonies?" "What is the number of French police and how is the National Directorate of Investigations organized?" The Prime Minister finally added, "There are quite a few German political police officers engaged in espionage in France. These people's attempts to undermine our national morale will surely fail." (9th Havas)

Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies met today, the Presidium issued a bulletin stating, "The Chamber of Deputies held two secret meetings today to discuss the issue of national defense organization. All the members were driven by patriotism and a spirit of harmony. Therefore, nothing untoward happened during the discussions. The Chamber of Deputies has now decided to continue holding secret meetings tomorrow." (9th Havas)

### The Balkan Consultation Countries Continue to Unite and Extend the Consultation Convention for Seven Years, Changing Economic Ties and Transportation

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - The Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries held its eighth meeting this afternoon in the Yugoslav capital. Afterwards, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu read a public statement, the full text of which is as follows: "The Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries, in this meeting, the representatives of each country were able to exchange opinions in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual trust, and the following results have been achieved: (1) The consultation countries all recognize that maintaining peace, order, and security in Southeast Europe is in their common interest; (2) Regarding the current European war, the consultation countries have decided to continue to implement a peaceful policy, maintain the current status, and ensure that the war does not spread to Southeast Europe; (3) The Balkan Consultation Convention was not initially concluded to target any other country. The consultation countries have decided to continue to unite within the scope of the convention and pay joint attention to the protection of the rights, independence, and national territories of each country; (4) The consultation countries are willing to maintain and develop friendly relations with all neighboring countries in a spirit of mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation, and compromise; (5) The consultation countries all recognize that it is necessary to improve the economic ties and transportation of the Balkan Peninsula countries, and in particular, the Balkan Consultation Countries should seek economic and transportation improvements by developing mutual trade; (6) The Balkan Consultation Convention will expire on February 9th of next year, and it has now been decided to extend it for seven years, until February 9th, 1948; (7) The next Standing Political Council meeting is scheduled to be held in the capital of Greece in February of next year. During this year, the foreign ministers of the consultation countries have decided to maintain close contact and exchange opinions at any time." (Havas News Agency, 4th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - The public statement issued today by the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries has just been commented on by observers here, who say that Southeast Europe is about to establish a true "regional consultation." Because the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin are inherently united in terms of interests and form a separate region, a regional consultation must be established sooner or later. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has already expressed this intention in his speech yesterday. In addition, there is a sentence in the public statement that says, "The four consultation countries have decided to unite and pay joint attention to the protection of the rights, independence, and national territories of each country." This sentence is extremely important. The public statement does not use the phrase "territorial integrity," but instead uses "national territories," which is actually a major concession in spirit to Bulgaria and Hungary. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

Turkish and Bulgarian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

Sofia - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived here today from Niš. When Saracoğlu passed through here on his way to the Yugoslav capital, he held talks with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. He decided to come here to continue the previous talks. It is also reported that Bulgarian King Boris will invite Saracoğlu to lunch at a suburban palace. People here generally believe that the time for concrete developments is not far away. Although Bulgaria is disappointed with the results announced by the Belgrade meeting, it still earnestly hopes that Saracoğlu can bring a promise of support from the Balkan Consultation Countries, so that Bulgaria's territorial demands can be met through local negotiations. (Reuters, 6th)

Germany and Italy Express Satisfaction

Berlin - German officials are very satisfied with the results of the Balkan Consultation Conference, as the countries declared their intention to maintain peace and neutrality, which has been the goal of Germany's efforts for months. Germany is extremely concerned about peace and neutrality in Southeast Europe and is willing to do its best to help the Balkan countries achieve that goal. Germany is a major buyer of products from Southeast European countries, especially Romanian oil. Therefore, purely for economic reasons, Germany also hopes that peace in Southeast Europe can be maintained. According to recent comments and observations in the British and French press, the British and French governments deeply hope that as a result of this Balkan conference, the Southeast European countries can form an anti-German bloc under the leadership of Turkey. However, this attempt has clearly failed. In order to maintain neutrality, Romania and Yugoslavia have pressured Turkey to adopt a more conservative attitude. Therefore, this Balkan conference was a failure for British and French diplomats. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Rome - After the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries closed its meeting, political figures here expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting and agreed that the consultation countries had repeatedly declared their intention to maintain neutrality and independence. They also said that the countries' declaration of willingness to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries and to find ways to improve diplomatic relations was probably referring to Bulgaria and Hungary. However, empty words are of no use. The consultation countries, especially Romania, should make concessions to Bulgaria and Hungary as soon as possible in order to establish lasting peace in Southeast Europe. In addition, the "Fascist Labor Daily" stated, "At this moment, the impact of the current European war on the neutral countries, especially the economic impact, can no longer be ignored. Therefore, the desire of the Balkan Consultation Countries lies in organizing peace and thereby maintaining it." (Havas News Agency, 5th)

Paris - News from Germany claims that the Black Sea coastal countries, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania, are about to sign a so-called Black Sea agreement to deal with the Soviet Union. This statement has been denied by French diplomatic officials. (Havas News Agency, 8th)

Greek Prime Minister Delivers a Speech

Athens - General Metaxas, the Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, who recently attended the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries in the Yugoslav capital, has now returned here via Thessaloniki. Before departing from Thessaloniki, he delivered a speech, saying, "The period we are currently experiencing is full of difficulties and there is a risk of being drawn into the vortex of war. Fortunately, we have a firm will and would rather be shattered jade than whole tile, and we are able to stay out of the war. I do not mean that we will necessarily be able to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war for a long time (this is what I deeply desire and will do my best to achieve). However, even if we are unfortunately drawn into the storm in the future, we will certainly be able to reach the other shore safely and gain the respect of people all over the world. The recent meeting of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries was successful because the Balkan Consultation Countries do not want to provoke any country, nor do they want to harm anyone. On the contrary, they are extremely willing to cooperate with other countries in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin. In short, we are united, unafraid of storms, and determined to maintain peace, but we are also determined to make others respect our national survival and independence." (Havas News Agency, 9th)

London - According to news from neutral sources here, the Soviet army has resumed its massive efforts to break through the Mannerheim Line and is currently developing the most intense offensive since the beginning of the war. The recent Soviet offensive has spread throughout Karelia, and there are fierce battles on all other lines. According to a semi-official announcement issued by the Finnish army, the Soviet army launched an offensive yesterday in the weakest area of the Mannerheim Line, the Summa sector, but made no progress. The Soviet army has also launched new offensives in Perkjärvi and Pasuri, first with long-range artillery fire, then with aircraft bombing and strafing Finnish positions, and finally with tanks and infantry launching ground attacks. The front line along the Taipale River, which has been quiet for a long time, is now also under attack, which shows the scale of the current Soviet offensive. There is new activity further north in Salla and Sakkijärvi. The Finnish army believes that the Soviet army's large-scale offensive is intended to show Finland the Soviet power before the end of February, as snowfall will occur again by the end of February and the war will be temporarily suspended. (Reuters, 10th)

### The Soviet Union's Armistice Conditions for Finland Are Transferred to the Finnish Government by the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Stockholm - This morning, high-ranking political figures here said that the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has met with representatives of the Soviet government and obtained the conditions that the Soviet side intends to propose to Finland. It is reported that Steinhardt first went to Tallinn, then flew via Riga and Stockholm to Helsinki to deliver the Soviet demands to the Finnish government. It is expected that he will arrive in Turku on the 12th. Because Steinhardt was previously the U.S. Minister to Sweden, people here hope that he can stay in Stockholm for a day to have contact with Swedish government officials. Regarding the nature of the Soviet demands, all well-informed sources are taking a silent attitude. Some say that its main purpose is to negotiate armistice conditions. Diplomatic officials here point out that the Soviet Union has recognized the so-called "Finnish People's Government" and may want to extend the authority of that government to the territory that the Soviet Union demands Finland cede. According to diplomatic observers, the territory that the Soviet Union wants Finland to cede should include Hanko Port and Hogland, Lavasaari, Tytärsaari, Koivisto Island, and the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Union may cede territory in the north to compensate Finland. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

### British Prime Minister Reports on the Military and Diplomatic Situation in the House of Commons. The Link Between Britain and France Is Becoming Stronger. Britain and Greece Establish an Economic Agreement.

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, as usual, reporting on the military and diplomatic situation last week. First, he said that the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France recently held another joint meeting in Paris. He felt that the importance of this type of meeting was increasing day by day. It was not only a medium for communicating the views of the two countries, but also a major tool for conducting the war and seeking victory. He also believed that this meeting was not only of greater value than previous meetings, but also more pragmatic. In short, Britain and France have established an understanding, which is a major factor in achieving ultimate victory. Although the enemy is trying to alienate Britain and France, it is actually in vain. It should be known that the link between Britain and France is even greater than a close alliance. In addition, both sides share the same goals and share weal and woe, so this link is becoming stronger. In terms of the international situation, the Balkan Consultation Countries held a meeting in the Yugoslav capital at the beginning of the month and decided to do everything possible to maintain the stability of Southeast Europe, which is most welcome. In addition, the British government has conducted negotiations with a Greek delegation, and the process was extremely harmonious. Both sides have reached a satisfactory agreement on a number of financial and economic issues, which is gratifying. In terms of the war, German aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked small ships of various countries off the coast of Britain. This deliberate and barbaric means of aerial attack is not war, but massacre. As for our country's air force, with the assistance of naval patrol fleets, it recently sank a German submarine, which is vastly different from the German aircraft's attacks on neutral ships. Moreover, this kind of bandit behavior by Germany has little impact on the outcome of the war. The revulsion and anger it has aroused in all civilized countries has made our determination to fight to the end, to eliminate this ferocious evil for the sake of human civilization, even stronger. It is difficult to predict at this time how much longer the war will have to continue and how many difficulties we will have to encounter, but we have no reason to express dissatisfaction with the initial stage of this war. Therefore, we still look forward to the future with calm determination and firm faith. (Havas News Agency, 8th)

London - During the House of Commons meeting yesterday, a question was raised as to whether the government would consider sending bombers and fighter jets, as well as pilots, to assist Finland. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that the government had previously stated that it had taken measures to supply Finland with military supplies. According to what he heard, Finnish pilots can operate any aircraft currently available. Butler also said in response to various supplementary questions that the British government is very aware of Finland's need for assistance. (Reuters, 8th)

Love During the Joyful Spring Festival

…Should grow vigorously!

Love seems to have a close relationship with the season and environment. Because our hearts are most flexible, they have a responsive effect with the outside world at all times. If in a barren and lonely desert, any lush sprout of love would probably be subject to destruction and wither! Then, in this Spring Festival where thousands of families are brightly lit and everyone is happy, the sprouts of love in the hearts of young men and women will surely grow vigorously and be filled with splendid flowers!

Friends! Speaking of this, I hope you don't think that love is a luxury! Although it grows in a relatively comfortable environment, it is an essential thing in a healthy life. This is like a seedling that must go through a period of flowering and fruiting. If it cannot flower or bear fruit, that is its defect. Defects cause pain in life, leaving behind eternal regrets!

There is evidence to prove that during this happy Spring Festival, if there are couples or lovers who are healthy and beautiful, they will definitely live a lingering and sweet life, having sons and daughters, and a happy family. How happy life is! But if a man has committed masturbation in his early years, early marriage and indulgence, or is out of balance after illness, worry and new injuries, and has damaged the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, then symptoms such as kidney deficiency and impotence, incomplete development, loss of energy, kidney deficiency and infertility, and neurasthenia will abound. Such a sick man, even if he encounters the Spring Festival with a beautiful wife in his arms, he will certainly not be interested. As for the sexual life that is the foundation of love between husband and wife, it is always like a flash in the pan, or even completely powerless. How can this not make his wife hate him and plunge love into destruction? A couple without love is like living with an enemy, and there is no greater pain in life than this!

To remove pain and enjoy happiness, it is essential to cure the disease and improve health. To achieve this goal, according to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking "Shengzhi Su," a preparation made from healthy animal reproductive gland essence, is the most effective treatment. Because this agent has precious materials, excellent supervision, and sure effect, its tonic power is great, and it is unmatched by all similar preparations. Therefore, it has the widest sales and the longest history, and is unanimously praised by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, patients can produce essence, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote development in one day and night. Taking it continuously for one month will surely cure all symptoms, double energy, and middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those who suffer from spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine "Ximitushi Gujing Pian" (available at Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Wuzhou Huaying Taihe and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, priced at two yuan per box) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, and the effect will be even faster.

### Spermatorrhea Can Make Young People Dull

– (Venereal Disease Physician Nian Zeng)

Many parents are surprised to say: Why is our child getting more and more stupid? In fact, according to psychological arguments, there is no reason for a child to become more stupid as they grow older. The development of intelligence can be roughly divided into five periods: one to five years old is infancy, six to twelve years old is childhood, thirteen to eighteen years old is adolescence, nineteen to twenty-five years old is adulthood, and twenty-six to forty years old is prime of life. Among these periods, the fastest development of intelligence is during adolescence, and the highest point of development is during adulthood. The intelligence of prime of life may decline slightly, but the decrease is very small. After that, during middle age and old age, it will gradually decline. According to this, a child from infancy to childhood to adolescence to adulthood, intelligence only continues to grow and increase, especially in adolescence. At this time, it is the period when spring passion is activated, and the endocrine fluid in the reproductive glands in the body is extremely active. Therefore, it stimulates the development function, the body suddenly grows taller, the complexion glows, the voice increases, the beard gradually grows, and the temperament turns to be brave and generous. Seeing healthy and beautiful women, there is a desire to court them. At this time, intelligence also greatly increases. Problems that were considered difficult to solve in childhood can be easily solved at this time. Thoughts are rich, and memory is strong. …With the above evidence, we have clearly known that reproductive gland endocrine fluid (i.e., semen) has a great relationship with intelligence. However, young people do not cherish themselves, commit masturbation, or have early marriage and indulgence, or worry and hurt, destroying the sexual nerves, and causing the sperm gate to relax, then spermatorrhea will follow. If suffering from spermatorrhea and delaying treatment, the nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual organs will be in a state of atrophy due to lack of nourishment, developmental function will stagnate, and metabolism will decrease. As a result, brain power weakens, memory loss and insomnia occur, and thoughts become muddled. Those who were smart in the past are now dull and stupid. At the same time, they must have a sallow complexion and thin muscles, an unattractive appearance, or even waist pain and back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development and other symptoms will arise one after another. Such young people not only have difficulty in studying and no hope in learning a trade, but are also abandoned by women and hated by wives and concubines, falling into the most tragic situation in the world!

Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. Just take the special medicine "Ximitushi Gujing Pian," and it can consolidate the sperm gate that night, calm the nerves, and have the effect of sleeping and stopping spermatorrhea, nourishing the mind and strengthening the brain. If spermatorrhea has been for a long time and has the above symptoms, you must also take "Shengzhi Su," a preparation made from healthy animal reproductive gland essence, to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves, and you will definitely be able to cure all symptoms. However, if patients can come to our clinic in person and apply new therapies such as electrotherapy and injection, it can be guaranteed to be cured.

### From Congratulating the Spring New Year to Women's Breast Development and Good Fortune

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

In the happy Spring Festival, when meeting each other, one must say, "Congratulations on the New Year," or "Welcome fortune in the New Year." Today, the author meets you for the first time, and not only must say to you deeply, "Congratulations on the New Year," and "Welcome fortune in the New Year," but also say to the female compatriots a sincere and earnest "Breast Development and Good Fortune"!

What is the meaning of "Breast Development and Good Fortune"? You may have some doubts, but please close your eyes and think for a moment, and you will know that what the author calls "Breast Development and Good Fortune" is to have all female compatriots get real happiness from today onwards, and the so-called real happiness must first start with breast development. Because the times are advancing, and health is the source of all happiness. In today's aesthetic concepts that are very different from the past, if the breasts are destroyed by tight breasts, self-indulgence, leukorrhea, infertility, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, multiple births and weakness, forming looseness, atrophy, or flatness like a man, then not only is health and beauty lost, and there are no curves in the social arena, and there is no way to look around and win the favor of men, but even in the Spring Festival, there is only sorrow in the heart, and feelings arise from seeing the scenery, sighing that I was not born at the right time! What happiness is there to speak of? To seek remedy, I deeply hope to take the opportunity to rise up and, at the beginning of the return of spring to the earth, actively take the reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation "Shengzhi Su" for women, then it can nourish the ovarian function in one day and night, enhance metabolism, regulate menstruation, and warm the uterus to stop leukorrhea. If you continue to take it and persevere, not only can the atrophied breasts be made to bulge high, firm and elastic, but also the thin buttocks can become plump. In addition, it can also darken hair, beautify the face, eliminate disease and strengthen the body. The effect is great, and the tonic power is magnificent, which is unmatched by any organ and life-saving preparation. It has been proven by Chinese and Western doctors, so it has been popular for ten years, and it has become more and more popular over time.

Full of Vigor

This month, the 8th to the 10th is the 29th year of the Spring Festival. Citizens from all walks of life believe that the military situation of the War of Resistance has entered a favorable stage. The Japanese army is deeply mired and unable to make progress. The national belief in the War of Resistance is becoming more and more firm. It is deeply believed that the final victory will surely come. As the Spring Festival begins, the spring sunshine is bright, the warm wind is gentle, and the earth is full of vitality, which further symbolizes the bright future of China. Therefore, the general emotions of the citizens are extremely excited and enthusiastic.

Telegraph to Chiang Kai-shek to Express Respect. Various organizations in this city, taking February 10 as the date for the general mobilization of the Spring Festival Army Appreciation in various parts of the country, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express respect, and expressed their support for the national policy of resistance to the end. The original text said: "Chongqing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, since the July 7th Incident, Your Excellency has led the military and civilians to carry out the sacred all-out War of Resistance. For more than two years, relying on the hard work of the heroic soldiers and the common hatred of the enemy throughout the country, a foundation for the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction has been laid. All of us descendants of the Yan and Huang emperors are energized and redoubled our efforts to always support the national policy of resistance to the end. As the Spring Festival begins, we hereby send a telegram to express our respect and wish for victory. Shanghai various organizations kowtow."

Spring Festival Army Appreciation. According to the Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Fundraising Committee's regulations, the fundraising procedures are as follows: The Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Movement stipulates that the comfort money is 500,000 yuan in national currency, which is jointly and separately apportioned by various industry associations in the Shanghai business community. The amount is determined by the fundraising committee and issued to each member store and firm by the industry association in accordance with the number. After collecting the donated funds, each industry association or organizing body shall transfer the funds to the Central Bank for remittance. For convenience, the fundraising committee will attach a remittance slip from the Central Bank to each association, which can be filled out and sent directly to the bank. However, the receipt stub shall be submitted to the fundraising committee for verification.

Enthusiastic Ticket Subscriptions. The Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Movement will be held from February 1st to February 29th. However, in fact, the "January 28th" Shanghai War Memorial Day has already begun to be promoted. Currently, the subscribed amount for each industry has exceeded 300,000 yuan. At the same time, individuals are also very enthusiastic in making automatic contributions. The industry associations are actively conducting fundraising from member stores and firms in order to concentrate and transfer the funds, and with the enthusiastic participation of all parties, it is expected that the full amount of fundraising will be completed as scheduled to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers fighting in the War of Resistance.

Refugees Seeking Help. As the old lunar year draws to a close, various charitable organizations have unanimously and earnestly appealed for assistance due to the high prices and the difficulty in providing relief to refugees. At the same time, in the severe winter, refugees still lack supplies to protect themselves from the cold. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Civil Group, Hometown Group, Industry Group, Amateur Troupe Group, Dance Hall Group Fundraising Committees, and the Shanghai International Relief Committee and Charity Federation have received a large number of donations in recent days, and have not taken a holiday during the Spring Festival.

### It is Reported that Xiaoshan has been Recovered. The Whole City is Delighted. Shipping Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Normal. The Haiford is Sailing Smoothly to Zhenhai.

A certain shipping company in this city received a telegram from Ningbo at 10:50 AM yesterday, which briefly stated, "The Chinese army recovered Xiaoshan on the afternoon of the 9th. Ningbo heard the good news and the emotions are excited," etc. People from Zhejiang Province in Shanghai immediately spread the news, and their spirits were joyful. All walks of life in the city were also extremely delighted. As for the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, it has been smooth and unobstructed since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang. The Haiheford of Lihe Foreign Company is scheduled to set sail for Zhenhai at 3:00 PM on the 12th. The Deping of Zhongyuan Company is also scheduled to open Zhenhai on the same day. However, due to the suspension of goods by merchants in eastern Zhejiang, the above two rounds only carry passengers and do not carry large quantities of goods.

### After a Smooth Passage Through the General Closing Period, Various Industries Will Open Tomorrow. The Abnormal Development of Shanghai has Benefited Greatly. The Financial Market is Sound and Stable as Always.

After a smooth passage through the general closing period of the 28th year of the Republic of China, money houses and money exchange houses will be listed on the market on the 12th, and banks will open at the same time after the spring holidays. Various stores, factories, companies, and firms will resume business after the God of Wealth Day. Last year, due to the abnormal development of the concession area, various industries have benefited greatly. The details of the people's emotions are recorded as follows:

Money Houses and Money Exchange Houses Report Listing. The members of the Money Industry Association, including Huihua Qianzhuang Xianyuan, Yida, Baofeng, etc., and the Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen Qianzhuang will report to the Ningbo Road Association Market for listing from the 12th (Monday). The Market Management Committee will publicize the listing of each Zhuang for public knowledge. The members of the Money Exchange Industry Association, Fu, Lu, Shou, Xi, Qian Exchange Zhuang, have been engaged in various speculative matters since the war, such as buying and selling black market foreign exchange and remittance of discounted currencies of various countries, securities, dark markets, etc., so that they have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. These Qian Exchange Zhuang will also be listed and operated from the 12th.

Banks Resume Business and Various Industries Open. The member banks and trust companies of the Banking Association will take a spring holiday for four days from February 8th and will open for business after the spring holiday on the 12th. As for various companies, firms, factories, stores, etc., they will all take a holiday for four days after the general closing and will fully open for business after the God of Wealth Day. Regarding the business of various industries last year, according to the New Voice News reporter's inquiry to the parties concerned, the war-torn concession area has undergone abnormal development, and various industries have benefited greatly due to hoarding of goods and other reasons, especially the textile, cotton weaving, yarn flower, silk weaving, flour, grain, Western medicine, paint, foreign sundries, cotton cloth and other industries.

Financial Market. Sustained Stability

The Shanghai financial market has remained stable and unchanged after the regulation and adjustment by the four banks of China, Central, Transportation, and Agriculture and the preparatory committee of the silver and money industry. There is no tension at all. The deposits of the silver and money industries have increased sharply, and the overall capital has become surplus, creating various speculative businesses, such as buying and selling foreign exchange securities, hoarding goods, real estate businesses, etc., which have caused prices to skyrocket, affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Although the financial market has been subjected to rumors by speculators and certain parties in an attempt to disrupt and profit, the destruction plan has ultimately failed due to the sound and effective financial policy of China during the war.

Silver and Money Industries Have Made Great Profits. A reporter from New Voice News inquired in the financial community yesterday about the business situation of the silver and money industries last year: (1) In addition to the four banks of China, Central, Transportation, and Agriculture, other commercial banks earned profits ranging from 50,000 to 10 million yuan, but the most formal reported profits were only more than 1 million yuan, and the dividends issued ranged from 5% to 10%. Some major banks even earned huge profits by operating black market foreign exchange. (2) Money houses mainly focus on credit lending. Last year, due to the abnormal development of various industries, the accounts released were all recovered, so all houses were able to make profits ranging from 5,000 to 500,000 yuan, and only a few reported flat profits. Under the permitted business conditions,

### Understanding Employees. Under the Permitted Business Conditions, Treatment Must be Improved Appropriately

On the fifth day of the lunar New Year, commonly known as the God of Wealth Day, on the eve of that day, various companies and firms often set up banquets to entertain colleagues, which is called the God of Wealth Wine, and the advancement and retreat of employees are also determined at this time. The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sincerely and respectfully informs the capital parties of various industries not to dismiss employees at will during this extraordinary period, briefly stating that in this extraordinary period, coordination between labor and capital is the most important thing. After the Shanghai war, due to the special environment and concentrated population, the business of various industries is still not bad. It is hoped that the capital parties will remember the shared hardships and give preferential treatment to the employees, and do not make too many changes or dismiss employees at will, and under the permitted business conditions, improve the treatment appropriately. The same is expected.

### Asama Maru Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from the United States. Will Sail to Hong Kong This Morning

The Asama Maru, a passenger ship of the American-Asia Line of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company, was searched by the British Navy and arrested 21 German passengers on the British sea last month and escorted to Hong Kong for detention. The Japanese side had raised a protest with the British Navy authorities on this matter. It is learned that the Asama Maru arrived in Shanghai from Los Angeles via Honolulu. San Francisco. Yokohama. Kobe yesterday afternoon at 1:30, and is now docked at the Huishan Wharf. The ship carries a large number of American mail items and is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning at 10:00 to sail directly to Hong Kong.

### The Chinese New Army Has Received Excellent Training. Prepared with New Weapons to Open the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River. Jardine Matheson's British Ship was Again Bombed by Japanese Aircraft. An Expatriate from Yichang, Xue Fa Xun, Talked About It in Shanghai

The Mainland Daily reported that Xue Fa Xun, an expatriate from Yichang, arrived in Shanghai on Thursday. According to him, the national spirit in western China is high, and the river transportation between Yichang and Chongqing is endless. Wounded soldiers are attached to the cotton transport ships upstream. The new army coming downstream has received the best training and is equipped with new and sophisticated weapons. The troops are dispatched without any mess. After landing in Yichang, they take trucks to Shashi and then transfer to the front line of the Han River. Xue had inspected a batch of new machine guns with friends and claimed that they were reported by Sweden. It is common for Japanese planes to fly over Yichang. On August 6, Xue saw two British ships of Jardine Matheson being hit by Japanese bombers who dived and dropped bombs, causing a fire. Japanese aircraft constantly bombard the Yangtze River traffic, so the navigation of ships is very cautious. According to Xue, he is the owner of an oil tanker and left Yichang for Chongqing at the end of January, and then flew to Hong Kong to Shanghai, and will return to Yichang soon.

### Negotiations for Road Construction Beyond the Settlement: Announcement to be Released Next Week - What Philippo Spoke About After Returning from a Trip South - Announcement Will Contain Mutually Agreed-Upon Recommendations

The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Philippo, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), told reporters yesterday (the 9th) that an announcement regarding the negotiations between the SMC and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" would be released early next week. He did not wish to comment on the negotiations at this time because, since his return to Shanghai from a vacation in the south, he was

somewhat unfamiliar with the city's development. He would need some time to familiarize himself with these developments. When asked about his impressions of Singapore, Mr. Philippo replied that he had nothing to report, other than that he had enjoyed a good rest. Sources close to the SMC stated that Mr. Philippo, after returning to Shanghai on the afternoon of Thursday the 4th, had

held multiple meetings with the acting officials who had been in charge during his absence, and had received detailed reports. It is widely rumored that the SMC and the puppet municipal government have already reached a compromise regarding the road areas outside the settlement. Although this has not yet been officially confirmed, well-informed sources believe that Mr. Philippo's upcoming announcement will reveal that both parties have

agreed on recommendations. According to the Continental Daily News's earlier predictions, this agreement will stipulate the establishment of a joint committee to manage police affairs in the road areas beyond the settlement. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" will appoint a police chief, and the SMC will appoint a deputy police chief. The headquarters staff will consist of 40 people, with each party appointing half. All personnel appointed by one party must be approved by the other party.

Negotiations Stalled Regarding Police Rights in the Northern District: The SMC has been negotiating with the Japanese regarding the signing of an agreement for the northern district, encompassing Hongkou and Yangshupu. The SMC hopes to restore the situation as it existed before the August 13th Incident. It is reported that negotiations stalled last week and are on the verge of collapse. The negotiations regarding police rights and the agreement for the northern district have been conducted in great secrecy, much like the issue of road construction beyond the settlement. Regarding the northern district agreement, in addition to Director-General Philippo, who returned to Shanghai on the 8th,

the decision-making process depends on the arrival of Chairman Fessenden in Shanghai. Regarding the agreement, the SMC insists on restoring the police rights it held in the northern district before the August 13th Incident. The Japanese side claims that the Japanese sentry posts on the North Sichuan Road Bridge must be withdrawn by May 1st of next year. After the withdrawal of the Japanese sentry posts, the Japanese authorities reportedly demanded that the SMC increase the number of

Japanese police officers in order to strengthen their presence in the northern district, as the Japanese side deems it necessary. It is understood that the area north of the Suzhou Creek was almost completely destroyed by artillery fire during the street fighting that followed the August 13th Incident in 1937. The Chinese army retreated westward in November.

### Employees of Two Railways Borrow Living Subsidies

Employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been suffering from prolonged unemployment and hardship. They requested that the railway management office find a way to provide relief. It was agreed, after discussion with the savings fund association, that each person could borrow ten yuan from the association's remaining funds as a relief loan. This was previously reported. It is now learned that the deadline for these loans will be the end of February. Any employees who have not yet applied for a loan can directly submit an application to No. 39 Beijing Road, requesting approval for the loan.

### Lunar New Year: Foreign Vessel Voyages - Scheduled Arrival of Postal Ships in Shanghai - Sluggishness of Yangtze River Vessels

A record of the movements of Chinese and foreign routes during the Lunar New Year: For the Europe-Asia route, the French postal ship "D'Artagnan" of the French Mail Steamship Company is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 12th). The Italian Mail Steamship Company's unscheduled ship,

the "Himalaya," is also scheduled to arrive tomorrow. The exact arrival times of both ships have not yet been determined. For the Pacific route, the American President Lines' "President Taft" previously suffered damage to its propeller on its return voyage from Manila and entered dry dock in Hong Kong for repairs. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong for Shanghai around the 12th and is expected to arrive on the 15th. The company's

"President Cleveland" is also returning to Shanghai from Manila and is expected to arrive on the 14th, departing for Japan and returning to the United States on the 15th. The schedules of British ships operating on the Chinese coastal routes have not been announced due to the European war. It is learned that the Danish company Jebsen Shipping's

"Meihing," managed by the Qiaocheng Shipping Company, is scheduled to sail directly to Hong Kong on the 15th. All ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are in Zhenhai. The Sino-Italian Company's "Deping" may arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, and if so, it will sail to Ningbo on the 14th or 15th. Navigation to ports on the lower Yangtze River (Jingjiang County) and (Taizhou County, i.e., Longwukou) is entirely monopolized by Japanese merchants. Ships operating to the above ports cannot load or unload cargo unless they fly the Japanese flag. Even German ships such as the "Haikang" and "Luan" are experiencing sluggish business. Consequently, after

suspending service at the end of the lunar year, their resumption is uncertain. The "Haiyi" has already changed its route to Lihu, and ships operating to Hai (Beihe) and Qidong are also facing considerable threats. These situations have been reported in previous issues. Therefore, the Swire Company's "Wulin" returned to Shanghai empty yesterday morning. The Jardine Matheson Company's "Tonghe" sailed empty to Beisha in order to maintain the route. It is not possible to predict when it will return to Shanghai. Therefore, the schedules of these two

British ships are uncertain. The German company Jebsen & Jessen's "Kastell," which originally operated to Hupu, Changyinsha, and the new ports north of the Yangtze River, has changed to the Beisha route due to difficulties in cargo transportation. It is now scheduled to depart tomorrow evening. The sailing date for the "Lisha" has not been determined. The Fuhua Company's "Dingjiang" has not yet determined when it will resume service due to boiler repairs.

### American Ambassador to Chongqing: Meeting with Central Authorities - Returned to Shanghai on the 5th, Departed for Hong Kong on the 8th, and Transferred to Chongqing - Will Stay in Chongqing for an Extended Period

U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, inspected the affairs of overseas Chinese along the Yangtze River. On the 21st of last month, he, along with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol; his private secretary, Mr. Lafon; Military Attaché Major Oley; Army Attaché Major Max, and others, boarded the Jiangfang Command Ship "Luzon"

upstream along the Yangtze River. The ambassador arrived in Nanjing on the 23rd, departed Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 24th, passing Xunyang, and arrived in Hankou on the 29th. He met with the Consul General in Hankou, Mr. Davis, to hear a report on the affairs of overseas Chinese, and after meeting with the main American businessmen in the area on the 30th, he returned on the 31st on the same ship, accompanied by the American ship "Guam" for

protection. The ambassador and his party arrived here on the afternoon of the 5th of this month and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. However, because Chongqing was eager for him to return to his post, he, along with Mr. Hemmick, a judge of the U.S. Court for China, left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the Dutch mail ship "Cheshire" at 2:00 PM on the 8th and flew to Chongqing on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. As for Military Attaché Major Oley, Army Attaché Major Max, Military Attaché Meyer, and others, after arriving in Hong Kong, they will

change their route to Hanoi and travel to Chongqing via the Yunnan-Burma Road. During the ambassador's trip to Hankou, the Japanese deliberately made threatening statements. The American community in Shanghai believes this to be absurd because of the extremely friendly relationship between China and the United States. It was rumored that the American ship "Luzon" was hit by an explosion resembling a bomb when the ambassador was returning to Shanghai near Wuhu. The U.S. Navy Department claimed that it had

no official report. Even Admiral Horder, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, which is based in the Philippines, vehemently denied this rumor on the 9th. Admiral Horder dismissed the rumor that the "Luzon" was bombed in Wuhu as unfounded. The ambassador's return to his post will involve meetings with central authorities and a reunion with British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme. It is said that he will stay in Chongqing for an extended period.

### Post Office Temporarily Suspends Acceptance of Airmail to Austria and Czechoslovakia

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1602 states: This office has suspended the acceptance of airmail to Germany, as announced in this office's Notice No. 1596 of January 5, 1940. Now, this office also temporarily suspends the acceptance of airmail to Austria and Czechoslovakia. This is hereby announced for general information.

### Norwegian Fundraising Dinner: To Help Finland's War Effort - Also Held a Dance Party: To Raise Funds for Disaster Relief in War Zones

The Norwegian Night Banquet Association in China held a night banquet and gathering at the French Club on the evening of the 9th to donate to Finland's wartime expenses. The event was presided over by Mr. A. Algot. From 11:00 PM that evening to 2:00 AM the next morning, a dance party was held, with tickets costing five yuan each. The proceeds were used for disaster relief in war zones around Helsinki. The launch of the association was reportedly supported by Mrs. Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador.

### Japanese Ships Prohibited from Carrying Military Personnel of European Warring Nations: Japanese Shipping Companies Receive Instructions from Japanese Government - Germans Can Only Travel on American Ships, etc.

The Shanghai Times reports that Japanese shipping companies in this city have received instructions from the Japanese government prohibiting them from carrying people serving in the armed forces of European warring nations, in order to avoid a recurrence of incidents similar to the "Asama Maru" affair. However, pending further detailed explanation of these instructions, Japanese shipping companies in this city, such as NYK Line, will still allow British, French, and German nationals to travel to Europe and America on Japanese ships.

As for Jewish refugees fleeing Germany, since they are unlikely to be conscripted, they will also be allowed to travel on Japanese ships. British, French, and German nationals wishing to travel on Japanese ships must sign a declaration stating that they are not in active service nor have they been conscripted. If the ship is intercepted by a warring nation exercising its rights under international law, the Japanese shipping company

will not be held responsible. Therefore, it is very difficult for British and French nationals to depart Shanghai on Japanese ships, but this is not the case for Germans. If they depart Shanghai on Japanese ships, they will receive a notification that they are assuming the risk. Germans of military service age in Shanghai can only depart on Greek, Norwegian, and American ships.

American shipping companies in this city have not yet received instructions prohibiting them from carrying Germans or other nationals of warring nations, so they will continue to carry passengers with passports and other proper documents as before.

### Declared Value Should be Clearly Stated When Reporting Re-Exported Goods

The Jianghai Customs Trade Licensing Office announced yesterday that, from now on, when merchants report re-exporting goods that were originally imported, they must clearly state the value of the goods when applying for a trade license, in order to facilitate review. This is announced.

### Salvation Army Relief Efforts for Two Months - Second Round of Price Controls Planned - Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived This Week - Donations for Price Controls Expected to Reach Full Amount Soon

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. This week, a total of 44,336 bags were shipped from Hong Kong: 12,512 bags arrived on the "Jinan" on the 5th, 18,695 bags arrived on the "Taiyuan" on the same day, and another 13,129 bags arrived on the "Chengdu" yesterday. Yesterday was the Lunar New Year, so the foreign rice that arrived on the "Chengdu" will not be unloaded until tomorrow (Monday).

Over 10,000 Bags of Relief Rice Distributed Daily

Since the Salvation Army began its winter relief feeding program two weeks ago, it has been distributing food twice a day, at 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM, throughout the city. The details of this program have been reported extensively and have been praised by people from all walks of life. Since the start of the program, beggars have generally been able to maintain order. Officers of the Salvation Army have selected capable beggars to direct the queues, allowing them to receive food in an orderly manner. Therefore, the amount of food distributed daily has now increased to over 10,000 bags. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the Salvation Army, feeling that these impoverished people who beg year-round have not tasted meat, specially donated a large quantity of salted meat, as is customary in Chinese tradition. It also made tens of thousands of steamed buns, packed them into over 10,000 bags, and loaded them onto three trucks at 6:30 PM, departing from Dunxin Road and passing through Avenue Edward VII, Avenue du Grand Conseil, Datong Road, Xiamen Road, north of Suzhou Creek, and the Wai Nan area to distribute food to impoverished beggars. Over a hundred people participated in the distribution, including Lieutenant-Colonel Ma Ruishan, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Baotian, and all the officers of the Salvation Army. It is reported that this feeding program will continue for two months, while the distribution of meat and steamed buns has been stopped. It may be resumed later depending on the situation.

Second Round of Price Controls: Date of Commencement: The first round of price controls began on January 21st, with 50 price control points set up in the two settlements. It ended on February 6th, with a total of 34,070 bags of Saigon broken rice sold. The second round of price controls is scheduled to begin on February 23rd. The locations and prices for the second round will be decided at a meeting of the Price Control Committee. However, it has already been decided to continue to entrust the member rice shops of the Shanghai Rice Industry Association with the management, and the police departments of the two settlements will continue to be responsible for maintaining order. The association's second order of 11,000 bags of broken rice from Saigon has already been shipped to Shanghai in two batches and is temporarily stored in warehouses for the second round of price controls. It has also purchased 30,000 bags of spot goods on the Shanghai market, which were finalized before the general closing. Including the forward contracts and spot goods from the first time, the association has purchased approximately 80,000 bags of broken rice for price controls in total. After selling 34,070 bags in the first round, there are still 45,930 bags remaining.

Fundraising Must Reach Full Amount: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the association's secretariat yesterday that, given the rising rice prices on the Shanghai market, the association has incurred significant losses in implementing price controls. Without substantial donations, it fears that it will be difficult to sustain the effort. Therefore, it hopes that enthusiastic people will donate generously so that the price controls will not be interrupted. The original target for price control donations was one million yuan, but only over 500,000 yuan has been confirmed to have been received. Therefore, it is hoped that the full amount can be raised in the near future.

### Japanese Troops Ambushed Near Xiashi: Japanese Troops Panicked, Over 30 Killed or Wounded - Japanese Artillery Fired Indiscriminately from Both Mountains All Night Long

Around 8:00 PM on the 9th of this month, Chinese guerrillas near Xiashi took advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to launch a large-scale attack. At Siguan, they used machine guns, small steel cannons, and rifles to attack the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops were unprepared and panicked. The Japanese artillery on the east and west mountains fired artillery indiscriminately, and the fighting continued until 1:30 AM, when it finally stopped. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppet troops conducted a large-scale search, and over 200 passersby were arrested. On the morning of the 10th, they forcibly conscripted over 200 farmers to reinforce the fortifications at various passes, causing widespread panic and seclusion. The market was deserted. After investigation, it was found that over 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded.

### Relief Situation in Hangzhou: Report from Jisheng Association

In Hangzhou, there are approximately 60,000 to 70,000 disaster victims relying on relief. A household survey was conducted using the Baojia system, dividing the city into three districts inside the city and three districts outside the city. The third district is the most severely affected. The local Red Swastika Society, together with enthusiastic merchants, supervised the distribution of relief rice, with each person receiving several Sheng. However, the disaster is widespread, and the funds are limited, making it impossible to provide relief to everyone. Only those deemed eligible were given relief. 9,726 people received relief in the first district, 7,774 in the second district, and 6,311 in the third district. Work is underway in the other districts. However, after hearing the news, the disaster victims outside the city anxiously awaited food. They sent representatives, along with the Jia chiefs, to beg for relief, standing in the ice and snow all day without dispersing. The situation is extremely tragic. However, the funds entrusted by various charities in Shanghai amount to less than 50,000 yuan. Rice in Hangzhou costs around 40 yuan per Shi, making it difficult to provide widespread relief. It is reported that the number of people dying from cold and hunger is increasing daily, and they cannot survive without continued spring relief.

### Shanghai Workers' Living Conditions in 1939

Wage Rates and Actual Income of Various Workers: After the outbreak of the war, the wage rates and actual income of male and female piece-rate workers in various industries were low, especially for male workers. This year, the wages of various workers in all industries have increased. However, the wage rates and actual income of male workers are still lower than those of the pre-war year of 1936. The following table compares the wage rates and actual income of various workers this year with those of the previous year and 1936, showing the trend of increase and decrease:

Working Hours: This year, the average daily working hours in various industries were the longest in the silk reeling industry, followed by cotton spinning, flour milling, and cotton weaving. The above industries were generally very busy this year, often extending working hours and increasing output. Due to slightly weaker business, tobacco factories averaged only seven hours of work per day. For all industries combined, the average was 10.92 hours, slightly lower than the previous year. However, the number of working days per month this year was slightly higher than the previous year, averaging 23.78 days, compared to 22.48 days in 1938 and 23.66 days in 1936. Generally speaking, all industries were busy this year. The paper industry had the most working days per month, averaging 28.59 days, followed by oil pressing at 27.81 days, and then flour milling at 27.22 days. Work in the match industry was intermittent, with weather changes and raw material supply having an impact. In the second half of this year, the silk reeling industry was most affected by the inability to transport autumn cocoons to Shanghai, and most factories had to shut down, reducing the number of working days.

### Coal Prices Rise Uncontrollably: Over a Hundred Boiled Water Shops Close Down - Association Earnestly Urges Compliance with Association Rules

Over 500 boiled water shops in this city have been unable to resolve the issue of coal supply and high prices, despite the Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association's repeated efforts to dredge coal supplies and appeal for assistance to lower coal prices. Coal prices continue to soar, with the highest price breaking a new record of 200 yuan per ton. Boiled water shops with less capital have been unable to maintain operations due to the high expenses and have temporarily closed down one after another. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited various districts in the British and French Concessions yesterday and saw notices posted at the entrances of the closed boiled water shops stating, "This shop is affected by the soaring coal prices, resulting in significant losses. It is forced to temporarily suspend operations. This shop will suspend water sales from now on. It will resume operations as soon as coal prices drop." It is understood that the total number of closed shops has reached over a hundred, mainly due to the impact of expensive coal prices. Shops that are still selling water as usual will sell water at the prices stipulated by the association. Representatives of the industry association are now earnestly urging compliance with association rules, waiting for a solution, and not raising prices without reason to avoid affecting the livelihood of the common people and maintaining security within the settlements. The Boiled Water Industry Association is actively seeking solutions and continuing to appeal for assistance from all sectors to maintain the entire boiled water industry.

### Liu Haisu Sells Paintings Overseas: 100,000 Yuan Donated for Disaster Relief

A letter from the Java Charity Painting Exhibition Association yesterday stated that the famous painter Liu Haisu recently traveled south, bringing with him hundreds of modern masterpieces. The China Modern Painting Exhibition Charity Fundraising Conference, organized by the Charity Painting Exhibition Association and held at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, was an unprecedented success on its opening day. The overseas Chinese community and local political, business, and diplomatic circles warmly supported it. 150 paintings were sold in three days, earning 13,000 guilders, equivalent to over 100,000 legal currency, all of which were donated for disaster relief. It is expected that the number will exceed this before the closing.

### Refugee Area in Nanshi Continues to Operate as Usual

After the opening of Nanshi, there were rumors that the refugee area would be designated as a commercial area by the Japanese puppet regime and that all refugee shelters would be taken over and relocated to Caohejing in western Shanghai. Gu Lun, director of the Refugee Area Supervisory Committee, stated that he had heard of these rumors beforehand. Father Jacquinot, the founder of the refugee area, had no comment. There are still 91 refugee shelters in the refugee area, housing over 20,000 refugees, all of whom are homeless and destitute. All supplies are being maintained as usual, and there are no problems. As for the rumors of being taken over, no one has approached us to discuss this as of recently.

### Chamber of Commerce Spring Holiday: Four Days - Resumed Actual Work Yesterday - Certificate Applications for Cotton Cloth Factories: Approximately 4,000 Items Still Outstanding

All industries require a certificate list to be released to transport goods to the inland areas. This list includes cotton cloth for the most part. Because the method for obtaining certificates was required to be changed during the Lunar New Year, the dyeing and weaving factories were coming to hurry up to receive their list, so those coming could not be given in time. In particular, the Xin Xin Zhen, Lun Hua, and Hua Feng factories accounted for the largest number. The association worked day and night, even on Sundays. There were still nearly 4,000 items outstanding until the Lunar New Year's Eve. Therefore, although there was a four-day spring holiday from February 8th to 11th, the internal work actually started on the 10th, limited to clearing and expediting the outstanding items. However, no documents were accepted from the outside.

### Norwegian Government Donates: Pure Cod Liver Oil Arrives in Shanghai - Total Amount is 6,000 Pounds - Reportedly the Second Time

### Roosevelt Wharf Drug Case: Perpetrators Sentenced - Eight Suspects Released

On the evening of December 28th of last year, at 11:00 PM, the Louza Police Station of the French Concession cracked a major drug case at Wharf No. 5 on Roosevelt Road. At that time, 160 kilograms of opium, totaling 2,460 taels, were confiscated. The three main culprits, Yang Tianxiang and Ma Ji from Shandong, and Li Huaian from Tianjin, were arrested and confessed that the main headquarters was located at No. 32 Baoxingli, Dongxin Bridge. The detectives immediately rushed there and arrested ten more people, including Li Shufang, Wang Jinhai, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Sun Zhaozhong, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai. They were all sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 2 Court. The police lawyer found no connection to Li Shufang, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai and did not prosecute them. Judge Miao Qingbang released them in court and rescheduled the case. The trial continued yesterday morning, and the court ruled: Yang Tianxiang and Ma Ji are sentenced to two years imprisonment for helping to transport drugs. Sun Zhaozhong is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment. Li Huaian is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Wang Jinhai is acquitted.

### Cost of Living Index in This City: Reached New Peak Last Month - Purchasing Power of Currency Greatly Reduced - One Legal Tender Yuan is Worth Only Slightly More Than 3 Jiao

At the beginning of the year, the cost of living index reached a new peak. The total index for January was 325.44, 225.44% higher than the average index for the base period of 1936, and 114.57% higher than January of last year. It was also 7.03% higher than the highest index to date, December of last year. As a result, the purchasing power of currency decreased. In December of last year, one legal tender yuan was equivalent to 3 Jiao 2 Fen 8 Li 9 Hao of 1936, while this month it is equivalent to only 3 Jiao 0 Fen 7 Li 3 Hao. The classified indexes were all higher than last month, as excerpted below:

The end of the month coincides with the end of the Lunar New Year. Every year, citizens will prepare for the Lunar New Year, and prices will inevitably be high. Furthermore, in the last week of the month, the weather turned cold, with rain and snow covering the roads, having a serious impact. In addition, speculation and manipulation were also important reasons for raising general prices.

The average price of Japonica rice on the 2nd of this month was slightly lower than last month, but the future of rice is not optimistic. The rice market was very manipulated at the end of the month, attempting to privately exceed the limit and secretly sell first-class goods, opening a limited price of 40 yuan for first-class goods. The high prices were hoarded and speculated by manipulators, and retail rice shops often mixed second-class goods to meet the market.

The price of flour increased this month. At the beginning of the month, the price per bag was less than 9 yuan, but by the end of the month, it had reached more than 11 yuan. Recently, rice prices have been high, and citizens often eat pasta as well. Although Yunnanese people eat rice, the crazy rise in the flour market has had a great impact on the people's food.

### The Secretary of the Ham Industry Association, Cai Xiaohe, Assassinated; Three Shots Hit Vital Points; The Reason for the Murder is Under Investigation

Yesterday, at around 12 noon, at the Ham Industry Association's premises located at 77 Race Course Road (near Longmen Road) in the Public Concession, a sudden

assassination bloodbath occurred. The person who was shot and died on the spot was Mr. Cai Xiaohe, the association's secretary. Cai was a native of Jinhua, Zhejiang, 46 years old, and lived alone in Shanghai without family. His residence was in the pavilion room at number 77. He was usually an active figure in society. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, someone carrying a weapon went upstairs, pushed open the door of the pavilion room, and without asking any questions, fired three consecutive shots at Cai. Cai was caught off guard and was hit once in the right chest, once in the left shoulder, and once in the right neck. He immediately fell into a pool of blood with serious injuries. The assassin, seeing that his purpose was achieved, turned around and went downstairs, fleeing through the door. Afterwards, the association's tea servant reported to the Chengdu Road police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. At the same time, Cai Xiaohe, who was severely injured, was rushed to Baolong Hospital for emergency treatment. However, all three bullets hit Cai in

vital points, and he died due to excessive bleeding before he could be saved. The body was then transferred from the hospital to the coroner's office for examination. It is reported that Cai was wearing a dark blue leather robe, lined with silk cotton jacket and trousers, gray socks, and black shoes when he was attacked. He had a flat-top haircut and was not wearing a hat. The detectives only found his personal card near his body, and nothing else. As for the reason for his murder, whether it was a personal vendetta or some other political motive, the police authorities are currently conducting a detailed investigation.

### Dismissed Apprentice Extorting Money by Intimidation; Repeatedly Demanding Money from the Shop Owner; Finally Reported, Arrested and Detained

Fan Jiashan (19 years old), a native of Chongming, had been an apprentice at the Most Fashionable Leather Shoe Store at 200 North Jiangxi Road for several years. Recently, due to his gambling habits, he was fired by the store owner, Chen Wenqing, a native of Ningbo, and became a vagrant. Between January 20th and 23rd of this year, he went to the store twice to borrow 15 yuan in legal tender from Chen, threatening to take drastic measures if refused. As a result, after persuasion, Chen gave him seven yuan to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, the apprentice Fan took the money he got to a gambling den in West Shanghai and lost it all. Yesterday, the 5th, at 11:15 PM, Fan encountered Chen Wenqing at the entrance of Lane 132, North Zhejiang Road. He drew a knife and demanded another 500 yuan, threatening Chen's life. Chen Wenqing immediately took out a police whistle from his pocket and blew it, while running and shouting "Robbery," finally escaping safely. The next day, he reported the matter to his introducer, Nie Youliang (a native of Nanjing), who at 7:30 PM, twisted Fan Jiashan over to Chinese Detective Huang Siming on Niuzhuang Road. He was taken to the Old Zha police station, then transferred to the Hui Division police station, where the case was reported to the police chief for detention. On the morning of the 7th, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution against the apprentice Fan for extortion by intimidation. Subsequently, the owner of the Most Fashionable Leather Shoe Store, Chen Wenqing, and his introducer, Nie Youliang, testified about the incident. When questioned, the apprentice Fan stammered and denied using a knife to threaten and demand 500 yuan. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.

### Four Strange Men in West Shanghai Kidnap a Pedestrian

Near Wujiaochang in West Shanghai's Caojiadu, at around 11 PM the night before last, a pedestrian dressed in a Zhongshan suit, wearing a black wool overcoat, about thirty years old, and speaking with a Cantonese accent, was walking along the road when four strange men jumped out from the side of the road. Each of them took out a Mauser pistol and said, "We have been waiting for you for a long time. Please come with us." The pedestrian spoke a few words in Cantonese with the group, and the four strange men said, "Don't dawdle. Be sensible." After saying this, the four strange men grabbed him and went north. Arriving at the entrance of Garden Lane on Bailinan Road, they forced the pedestrian to board a car that was parked there, and drove away. According to witnesses at the time, the four strange men were wearing different clothes, but all had on uniform trousers. It is expected that the kidnapping of the pedestrian is politically motivated, and he may be arrested by some party.

### Shocking Robbery on Shanxi Road; Another Arms Dealer Captured; Robbers Confess to Buying Arms; Three Russians and Two Chinese Arrested; Injured Western Detective Chief Recovering

The Shanghai Times reported that detectives from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, in cooperation with the police of the French Concession, arrested three Russians and two Chinese in the French Concession on Wednesday night. It is said that the three Russians sold two Mauser pistols and 150 rounds of ammunition to the robbers who engaged in a shootout with detectives at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Beijing Road on February 1st. The two Chinese acted as

intermediaries in the sale of guns. These five people are now being held in the Central Police Station and the Chengdu Road Police Station and will be brought before the First Special District Court for questioning on Monday morning. Previously, the robbers who exchanged fire with the detectives were arrested and confessed that in mid-January, they bought two Mauser pistols and 150 rounds of ammunition from a Russian in the French Concession for 50 yuan. They did not remember the exact address of the Russian, but they were willing to lead the detectives there.

After obtaining the confession, the detectives went to a house on Ya'erbei Road at around 7 PM on Wednesday night and arrested three Russians: Huo Jueji, 57 years old, unemployed; Naqiefu, 57 years old, a mechanic; and Yalabai Xifu, 29 years old, a car salesman. The detectives then went to a house on Huanlong Road and arrested the two intermediaries, Cao Zhang and Yang Sen (both transliterations), and took them to the police station. At first, the five people categorically denied knowing the robbers or selling guns. Later, Huo Ciji confessed that he bought two guns and ammunition from Yalabai Xifu through Naqiefu's mediation. Afterwards, the guns were resold to several Chinese through the mediation of the two Chinese. He did not know who the Chinese who bought the guns were, nor did he ask their purpose for buying the guns. Naqiefu then also confessed to mediating the sale of two guns to Huo Ciji and receiving a commission. However, Yala Xi Baifu alone still categorically denied participating in the sale of guns, saying that he had nothing to do with the matter. Since being arrested on Wednesday night, Mr. Ya has refused to eat or drink. Thus, the

shocking robbery case has implicated more criminals. The police are continuing to interrogate them in the hope of capturing the two lookouts who fled before the incident occurred. It has been learned that the arrested robbers have committed several robberies in the Public Concession this year. (Another report) Western Deputy Detective Chief Moore of the Public Concession's Police Department was shot and injured during a fight with bandits in Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, Shanxi Road, last Thursday. After Mr. Moore was injured, he was sent to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. It is now known that the wound has healed and he will return to work at the Central Police Station next week. Police Chief Kak, was also hit by a bullet in this battle, but has also recovered, but still needs recuperation. Two robbers died and nine were captured in this battle. One of the robbers was only 15 years old. He was blinded by tear gas smoke and surrendered.

### Stabbing Incident; Wang Wenqing Seriously Wounded

Wang Wenqing, 36 years old, lives at 126 Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, while passing near Xiaohuayuan on Sanmalu Road, he suddenly encountered Cao Donglai, whom he knew. However, without asking any questions, Cao drew a knife and stabbed Wang Wenqing four times, once in the back, once in the head, and once in the left shoulder. The wounds were very deep, and he collapsed in a pool of blood with serious injuries. When Chinese police officer No. 306 arrived after hearing the alarm, he arrested the murderer on the spot and took him to the police station. At the same time, he called an ambulance to send the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger.

### North Goods Company Staff Embezzles in Collusion with Apprentices; Forged Invoices Embezzle More Than Ten Thousand Yuan; Mastermind Flees to Ningbo, Two Apprentices Arrested

Zheng Shangen, a native of Ningbo, around 30 years old, worked at Zai Xin North Goods Company at A-52 Yanghang Street in the French Concession. With the support of his cousin, shareholder and manager Zheng Hegeng, he was promoted to accountant and given the power to manage money. Recently, he became involved in gambling dens, incurring huge debts. At the end of the Lunar Year, unable to make up for the losses, he colluded with his colleagues Zhang Minghong (29 years old, from Jiading) and apprentice Shen Wenkui (also known as Pin Hai, 19 years old, from Ningbo) to privately engrave a seal,

forge invoices, and collect payments from customers. After slightly splitting the profits, the rest was used to pay off debts. Furthermore, fearing that customers would reconcile accounts during the Lunar New Year and that they would not be able to escape detection, he entrusted Shen Wenkui to deposit 10,000 yuan in cash into the Four Banks Savings Society on the 2nd of this month, using the pseudonym Wang Hengjiu. On the 3rd, he took a boat to Ningbo. Manager Zheng Hegeng discovered that 5,700 yuan was missing from the invoices and 1,700 yuan was missing in cash. On the Lunar New Year's Eve, it was also discovered that

customer payments had been collected, and it was observed that Zhang and Shen had sent Zheng Shangen off on the boat and that their attitude was unusual. Knowing that there was collusion, he reported it to the French police, who arrested Zhang Minghong and Shen Wenkui. The next day (Lunar New Year's Eve), they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. After police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan explained the case, he requested a postponement for further investigation before interrogation. The plaintiff Zheng Hegeng also stated that it was now determined that about 11,000 yuan had been embezzled, and that the remaining amount would only be clear after settling accounts tonight.

When questioned, Zhang Minghong confessed that Zheng Shangen gave me 200 yuan and also repaid 500 yuan of my debts to the company. Shen Wenkui confessed that he used 200 yuan and deposited 10,000 yuan into the Four Banks Savings Society for Zheng Shangen. After reviewing the confession, Judge Peng Xian ordered that the case be adjourned to the 16th for further questioning. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Case of Murdering Father An; Revokes Closure of Arguments; Further Detailed Investigation Required Before Final Verdict

Father An, a Frenchman who was the head of the orphanage and workshop of the Catholic Church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, West Shanghai, was robbed and strangled to death on August 30th of last year. After the case occurred, the French police dispatched detectives to investigate the murderers. Later, a Catholic robber named Ju Bolu surrendered himself to the police. Then, four accomplices and suspects were captured, including Jiang Yunqing, Lu Gendi, Shen Xingtang, and Wang Guirong. However, the main criminal, Zhou Yuelou, fled to the guerrilla area.

Ju and the five criminals were sent to the Second Special District Court. After investigation, they were publicly prosecuted for robbery and murder. Because the location of the incident belonged to the Chinese territory, the court submitted a request to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate the Second Special District Court to manage and try the case with regard to jurisdiction. Liao, the head of the Criminal Court in charge of the case, believing that the case was important, was not afraid to seek details. He held a hearing more than ten times and appointed Wang Hengyi, Yu Zhaolin, and Tao Ran as defense lawyers for the defendants. Originally, he had announced the closure of the trial and scheduled the sentence to be announced on the 7th of this month. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Judge Liao, in order to be

cautious, still had several points regarding the evidence in the case that needed to be investigated in detail before a final verdict could be made in order to be convincing. Therefore, on the 7th, the date of the sentencing at 2 PM, he ordered the defendants to be brought to the court and announced the revocation of the closure of the arguments. He scheduled a retrial and reopening of the arguments on the 22nd. The defendants were transferred to the detention center.

### Chinese Detective Chief of Five Continents Detective Agency Sentenced for Fraud; Three Pairs of Handcuffs Confiscated

Qiu Haitao, the Chinese detective chief of the Five Continents Detective Agency, led detectives Gao Wenbing and others, along with Western detective Ma Ying, to 408 Julida Road on December 23rd of last year at 9 AM, using the pretext of searching for contraband to extort 600 yuan in national currency from Du Shaoru, a wealthy merchant from Chongming. Du's daughter reported the matter to the French police, who arrested them. Apart from Ma Ying, who was handed over to the French Consulate for questioning, the other criminals were all sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang announced the sentence: Qiu Haitao, Wang Qiwen, and Gao Wenbing were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for using intimidation to cause others to hand over their property.

### Interport Football Match; Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong; One Goal in Each Half; Hong Kong Team Loses Due to Weak Forwards

The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match, which had been suspended for two years due to the war, was finally resumed this year after much effort. The Shanghai and Hong Kong teams met at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the Lunar New Year. The Hong Kong team's weakness was as expected, and they suffered a 2-0 defeat. Shanghai scored one goal in each half, retaining the "Hong Kong Telegraph Cup." As it was the first day of the Lunar New Year, tickets for Yiyuan, even the most expensive seats at two yuan and two jiao, were snapped up, and the stadium was packed. The occasion was no less grand than a charity match, with an estimated attendance of over 15,000 people. The lineups for the two teams on that day were as follows:

Shanghai Team

Qi Lihuate

Hailieson Ke Laituo

Jiemu Huate Li Yicheng Xigelun

Cao Qiuting Sun Jinshun Lao Bashi Tuofu Maikelade Fu En

Hong Kong Team

Moshi Xian

Da Shidu

Lan Zhi Xia Xian

Hannibal Lu Da Gaoshan Nu Gan Shi

Xiao Shidu Lan Zhi Hua Lu He Xi Li Anna Mai Yiyun

Hong Kong Team Mediocre; Defense More Important Than Offense; The Hong Kong team was quite weak in strength due to the refusal of Chinese players to participate in the northbound journey, and the fact that some of the best Western players were unable to come due to official duties. Before leaving Hong Kong, they lost 3-0 to the Hong Kong Chinese League in Hong Kong. Therefore, Shanghai's victory this time was expected. The Hong Kong team itself was aware of this, so on that day, it temporarily changed its lineup, replacing Da Gaoshan Nu with Qian Zhongjian, focusing all its efforts on keeping a close watch on Lao Basituofu, and adopting a strategy of combining offense and defense. Da Shidu Lanzhi were veterans of the interport match, and together with Indian Xia Xian, the two fullbacks were indeed extraordinary. Central defender Gan Shi was also very good. Therefore, although the Shanghai team was in full offensive mode, they repeatedly failed to score, and only scored two goals because of this. However, the Hong Kong team's forwards were extremely mediocre. They lacked a central figure as leader, and right-winger Mai Yiyun was a third-tier player. The entire line was like a plate of loose sand. The only one who was most active was left-winger Xiao Shidu Lanzhi. The Shanghai team's performance was also greatly reduced. The two fullbacks and three central defenders were the best, especially Ke Laituo and Xigelun. Willy Huat was not as stable as in the trials, and Jiemu Huat even missed a penalty kick in the first half. The five forwards were completely inferior to their usual selves. The excellent connection between Fu En and Mai Kelade was not seen, and Cao Qiuting had very few chances to get the ball, so he could not show his color.

The other semi-final match between Surveying and Jardine Matheson is scheduled for today, with the winner facing the Italian Navy for the championship.

### Last Two Minutes See Breakthrough; China United Draws with Hong Kong; Second Interport Match Ends in a Tie; Huang Kehou's Goal Saves the Day

The second act of the interport football match, a friendly between the Hong Kong team and Shanghai's China United team, was held at the Recreation Ground on the afternoon of the day after Yuandan. Despite being called "China United," it was not a united team. In fact, it was represented entirely by the top-tier regular champions, the Lidu team. It was unprecedented for an independent club to compete against an interport representative team, so the Recreation Ground was filled with fans eager to see the spectacle, with a crowd as large as the official interport match the day before, estimated to be over fifteen or sixteen thousand. The battle ended in a 1-1 draw, to the great joy of both sides, especially China United. In the first half, Dasagnu headed in a goal, but it was disallowed due to a foul, so both teams went scoreless. In the second half, Meng Yiliang committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Hong Kong took the lead, but Lidu's counter-attacks were ineffective. Until the last two minutes, Wang Kehou received a pass from Cao Qiuting and scored, resulting in a draw. The lineups for both teams were as follows:

Shanghai China United:

Lu Zhongen

Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen

Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng

Hong Kong Interport:

Mosham

Li Anna, Xia Xian

Hua Lu, Gan, Hanibolu

Sturridge, Gastelo, Fox, Dasagnu, Heshi

Hong Kong Changes Lineup: Seven minutes into the game, Hong Kong's goalkeeper Mosham was injured in the face, leading to significant changes in the lineup. The revised lineup was as follows: Goalkeeper Mosham, defenders Xia Xian and Hua Lu, midfielders Gastelo, Gan, and Hanibolu, forwards Li Anna, Dasagnu, Fox, Heshi, and Little Sturridge. China United kicked off, playing against the sun, which seemed disadvantageous. Furthermore, Li Yichen was injured from the previous day's strenuous match, and right-winger Zhang Mingsheng generally appeared weak, leaving Xu Wenkui isolated. Only he was seen rushing back and forth, and the right wing was completely disadvantaged. Hong Kong, on the other hand, switched from defense to offense, so Hong Kong was particularly rampant after the start of the game. China United immediately stood up to meet the challenge. Qiuting advanced along the side and passed to the center. Xu Wenkui took a shot at the goal, but it flew high and missed. China United continued to attack. A-kui passed to Sun Jinshun, but Gan cleared it. Qiuting received the ball and charged forward. Mosham rushed out to save, but Qiuting's shot hit Mosham in the face, and he was unable to continue. After being helped up and treated, the game was paused for three minutes before resuming. Hong Kong's lineup was then significantly changed.

Goal Disallowed: As the battle resumed, the actions of both sides became increasingly rough. Although the referee Shen Huichun repeatedly penalized them, the roughness continued, which negatively impacted the excitement of the match. Both sides exchanged attacks and defenses, resulting in a evenly matched game. Hong Kong's forwards were not as gloomy as the day before. Li Anna and Dasagnu were extremely active. China United's repeated mistakes by Zhang Mingsheng were also a pity. The stalemate continued until the fortieth minute, when a new situation developed. Jinshun passed to Qiuting, who passed to Huang Kehou. Mosham saved it, but Little Sturridge got the ball and charged forward. Zhang Linggen was unable to catch up, and the ball flew to the right corner. Dasagnu jumped up and headed the ball into the net. The Hong Kong team shook hands and celebrated, but the referee Shen Huichun ruled it invalid, as Dasagnu had committed a foul before heading the ball. It was a celebration for nothing. The first half ended with no score.

Penalty Kick: After the band played and the teams rested, the two armies met again. Hong Kong's attacks became even more intense. Little Sturridge made a solo advance, with Dasagnu and Li Anna attacking from the left and right. Lu Zhongen immediately responded to both sides, taking desperate measures. Lidu's ball movement was lacking, causing them to feel out of sync. Zhang Mingsheng and Xu Wenkui moved down together but were blocked by Hua Lu. Qiuting crossed, but Tie Tui missed again. Huang Kehou added a shot, but the ball flew past the gate. Hong Kong's attacks continued unabated. Meng Yiliang tried to stop Fox, but he pushed him and committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Dasagnu gently kicked the ball in, and China United conceded the first goal.

A Stroke of Genius: The attack and defense of both sides were mutual, and the situation became extremely tense. Li Yichen was unable to run due to his injury and was anxious. Fortunately, although Hong Kong attacked, they could not find the door to score again. China United's defeat seemed inevitable. Sun Jinshun, Xu Wenkui, and Huang Kehou tried their best to counter-attack, but they could not turn the tide. More than ten thousand fans were drooping their heads in dismay when, unexpectedly, a stroke of genius occurred. In the last two minutes, Cao Qiuting went straight down the side and crossed, and the ball landed right in front of the goal. Huang Kehou jumped up and kicked the ball into the right corner. The defeated situation was suddenly turned into a draw. Zhong Qian kicked off, but after a few passes, the final whistle blew.

### Long Yun Allocates 50,000 Yuan to Relieve College Students

(Kunming, 10th) Since the War of Resistance, many domestic universities have moved to Yunnan. However, most students come from war zones, and their economic sources have been cut off, resulting in a sudden feeling of financial difficulty. For this reason, Chairman Jiang once allocated 100,000 yuan for the relief of poor students above the college level in Yunnan. Yunnan Chairman Long Yun, in view of the daily increase in living expenses and the difficulty of living for the students, also specially allocated 50,000 yuan in national currency, which was handed over to the various schools for relief.

### Industry and Commerce in 1939: Every Industry Profitable...Every Path Earns Money; Millions...Nothing Strange

Spring is the beginning of the year, and the plum blossom occupies the first place among all flowers. In this accounting period, the current yarn market situation will start business as usual from tomorrow. Judging from the recent foreign exchange situation, people's hearts are very good, and the market should have an advancing trend. Upon investigation, industry and commerce last year were all profitable. The net profit of the cotton industry alone was unexpectedly abundant. Profits of millions of yuan and bonuses of dozens of months are not uncommon. According to the market, last year was the first year of the prosperity and development of speculative business. The most profitable were (1) the operation of foreign exchange cash, (2) metal materials, rayon, natural silk cotton, (3) cotton yarn, (4) cotton cloth, (5) flour industry, (6) oil, beans, grains, and (7) rice industry. The order listed above is not entirely the order of profit thickness, but for the convenience of accounting. Roughly speaking, last year, as long as you bought goods once, you could earn money once. Therefore, anyone who hoarded goods, regardless of the thickness of the profit, a small hoard earned a small amount, and a large hoard earned a lot, and there was no one who did not "earn money all the way and benefit in every industry." Therefore, the hoarding trend became more intense at the end of the year, and stocking up over the year (not storing cash) has almost become a creed. The surplus of flour mills is also very considerable. One factory has more than 10 million yuan, and the price of flour has risen to 13 yuan. Some people say that everyone makes money, where does this money come from? This requires readers to go to the next translation.

### Foreign Exchange Market During the Holiday Period: Rumors Surrounded It; Market Situation Step by Step

February 5 (Monday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not change. The black market trend of British and American exchange rates tightened. Until the evening close, the tight price of 401625 for this year's British gold four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125 for American exchange rates was discovered. Fortunately, HSBC slightly came to sell, and the potential was slightly settled. The result was 40625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 3125 for the close, tighter than last week by 09375 and 15625. The early tension was due to the eagerness of importers to settle payments, and the strong appetite of foreign firms such as China-Belgium Beneficial.

6th (Tuesday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not rise or fall. The black market of British and American exchange rates continued to report tightness. Once again, the tightest price this year was seen. From the beginning, it was accepted by Hong Kong speculators entrusting Chinese firms to rush in, causing it to soften to 375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 25 shortly. Later, Sassoon vigorously sold in the near future, and foreign firms Yuntong and a small number of speculators also sold, so at this time it had rebounded to 421875 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 34375. Later, because there was a rumor from the electrical transmission that the "New Central" bank was preparing and issuing banknotes, speculators started to move around, and Sassoon also came to repurchase futures in the afternoon, so it was once again tight to 359375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 21875. Later, because China-Belgium and the American Bank were willing to supply during the expensive period, it rebounded slightly until the noon close, and remained at 390625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125. As a result, it was tighter than the previous day by 015625 and 03125.

7th (Wednesday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not change. The black market of British and American exchange rates only had half a day of trading. The potential trend slightly stabilized, but the morning was slightly softer, and it was tight to 375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 25. Later, because Chinese merchants came out with profits, it grew to 40625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 2503125. However, HSBC had a very strong appetite, absorbing a lot, and at this time there was a sudden rumor that Europe had peace, so people's hearts turned, and retail investors stopped selling. Furthermore, the demand from Japanese yarn mills was very strong, so the initial looseness completely disappeared by the end of the day. The result remained at 390625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125 for the close. It did not distinguish between honor and disgrace compared to the previous day.

### Gold Market Rises Before the Holiday; Top Plate Reaches 4,395 Yuan; Qian Rises by a Huge 160 Yuan; Silver and Money Industry Approved to Open Tomorrow

Now that it is the winter vacation, this newspaper will be suspended for six days. During this vacation period, the cash and foreign exchange black markets still have two and a half days of business. Now I will supplement the general situation later.

March 5 (Monday) Cash roasting red black market situation The potential is firm and firm, especially in the afternoon, it is even stronger, breaking the high price of 4,300 yuan on February 1 this year, and setting a record of 4,335 yuan. The result of the evening closing was 4,340 yuan, up 110 yuan from the end of last week. As for the occurrence of buying, it is due to the following factors: the tightening of foreign exchange, the need for guest help is very good, and I heard that some local speculators have transferred to buy gold after profiting from the multi-headed stocks of the Public Industry Association, and the gold of silver building jewelry has also risen by 10 yuan, which is 440 yuan. (Tuesday) The black market continued to prosper, and once again the highest peak of the year appeared. Chen opened and jumped 40 yuan, which was 4,380 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange suddenly turned back, people's hearts turned, and a large number of retail investors closed, it suddenly fell to a low of 4,315 yuan. As a result, the foreign exchange recovered and softened, and the saying of Jialido was very popular, and the trade wind re-emerged, and the brokerage help absorbed a lot. By the afternoon, the top plate once reached 4,395 yuan. After entering, the floating profits were sold, and it fell back to 35 yuan, which was 4,360 yuan for the close. As a result, it still rose by 20 yuan. The gold of silver building jewelry had been raised by 5 yuan, and then it returned to a small amount, which was still 440 yuan.

(Wednesday) The gold market opened flat, still at 4,360 yuan. Then, due to the loosening of foreign exchange, it caused a selling trend, and it had dropped to a low of 4,315 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and the rumors in the market were very strong. In addition, the Hong Kong gang moved and the floating air was forced to make up for it, so it was as high as 4,390 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, it still rose by 30 yuan. The gold of silver building jewelry was also raised by 5 yuan, which was 445 yuan.

The silver and money industries in this city will have a three-day holiday from the 8th to the 10th for the Spring Festival and the closing period. Today is a weekly holiday, and business will resume as usual tomorrow.

### Foreign Rice Arrives Vigorously

During the suspension of this newspaper, a large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company Jinan ship imported on the 5th, with 12,512 bags from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan ship, which arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also loaded 18,695 bags, which have been unloaded separately. Yesterday (the 10th), the company's Chengdu ship also transported 13,129 bags from Hong Kong. Because it was the Lunar New Year, the dock workers were on holiday, so after arriving in Shanghai, it berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession, and waited until tomorrow (Monday) to start unloading.

On the 5th, 1,390 bags of sugar were imported from Haikou, and 328 pieces of tea were imported from Hong Kong. On the 10th, 200 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong.

Also, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haikou, 305 pieces to Hong Kong, and 1 piece to Xiamen.

### A Snapshot of Last Year's Yarn Market

The change in the market price of cotton yarn Twenty-count Double Horse price was 405 yuan during the red market. It then fell to 365 yuan due to the abandonment of Nanchang. When the foreign exchange fell sharply in the middle of the 5th and 6th, from eight-ban Shi to six-ban Shi and five-ban Shi, after intense manipulation by speculators, it once reached a low of three-ban Shi and 25. At this time, the people of this port were panicked, and the cotton yarn rose sharply, jumping step by step to 860 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the market price soared, the demand decreased, the war clouds in Nanning were full, the transportation and sales were hindered. At the same time, our country's agricultural products were ripe, the export of local goods was strong, the lining was loosened, the exchange rate hardened, and the long position was released until mid-October. Twenty-count Double Horse fell straight from 860 yuan to 610 yuan. Later, in mid-December, due to the impact of the European war on the US and Indian cotton markets, consumption increased, and the market price was high. In addition, the speculation of bill shrinkage revived. At the end of the year, it was seen again at 775 yuan, and the closing price was 760 yuan. As a result, it was nearly 50% higher than in 1938. Tomorrow is the God of Wealth Day in 1940. The industry will open, and I wish the cotton industry to be even better this year.

### The Growth of the Chinese Air Force

— Hui Zi

Strong and healthy flying generals are the guardians of the country.

Two and a half years ago, when Japan began to invade China, China had only one aviation school, the Aviation Officers' School in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. But now, branch schools are being established everywhere to train flight students. Training is divided into three steps: preliminary, intermediate, and advanced. Bomber and fighter flight techniques are also being trained separately in various places. These are the fundamental training of the air force outside of the ranks.

Flying Lessons: In some corners of Sichuan, residents often wake up from their sweet dreams to the sound of airplanes soaring in the sky. The pilots are all tall, strong, and vigorous, aged between eighteen and twenty-two. For the first few hours, they need an instructor to accompany them on the flight, but after ten hours of training with an instructor, they can fly independently in the sky. In addition to flying skills, they also need to learn climbing, dodging attacks, and other combat-useful techniques.

After six months of training, a clever student completes his preliminary training. Six months later, the second stage of training also ends. Then, in the first stage of completed training, they are divided into bomber and fighter pilots. In short, it takes at least eighteen months to complete an aviation officer's training.

Due to the high standards in physical strength and intelligence, the number of those admitted accounts for only two or three percent of the number of applicants (the majority of physical failures are due to unqualified eyesight), and among those admitted, only sixty out of a hundred will graduate, while the rest are eliminated in various tests.

Patriotic Zeal

Those who are not admitted or are eliminated often cry before leaving, because they have lost the opportunity to serve their country. As for the young people who are admitted, they are all very good pilots. They can cope calmly when encountering difficulties, because the flame of patriotism burns in their hearts. When the first phase of training ends and they are about to enter the advanced training, they often choose fighter flight between bomber and fighter flight. Although the teachers explained that bombing is more useful in air combat, they still want to learn fighter flight, because they are willing to compete with foreign aircraft that bomb Chinese civilians. As for the aircraft, they all cherish them very much, so the damage rate of the aircraft is very, very small.

Learning Costs: The cost of flying courses is staggering. The Chinese government spends about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan on a flight student in his preliminary training, about 15,000 to 25,000 yuan in the second stage of training, and a huge amount of 35,000 to 45,000 yuan in the third stage of completed training. So, every graduating flight student, in addition to his priceless life, has to spend such a huge amount of money to complete him.

Standing, Their Life: Whether in the classroom or on the flying field, the discipline is very strict, but it is not boring, because they often hum some marching or other tunes. The food is very sufficient and beautiful, but they always stand to eat, because they have jointly made an oath that before the invaders are driven out of the Yellow Sea, there will be no chairs and stools in their dining hall.

### Inauguration of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama

— Chrysanthemum

According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 6th of this month, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has already been inaugurated. (See the report from the Shanghai Western newspaper on the 7th that the National Government remitted 400,000 yuan for the ceremony.)

According to Tibetan legend, the Dalai Lama is immortal. What is called death is merely a transformation of the physical body. Therefore, a child born after the passing of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama on December 17, 1933, must be his reincarnation. After searching for many days, he was found in Jiangtuya, Qinghai, in October 1937. This child, now six years old, named Lhamo Dhondup, is the newly inaugurated Fourteenth Dalai Lama. When he first met the Living Buddha (Hutuktu) who came to find him, he reached out his small hand for prayer beads. It turned out that the Thirteenth Dalai Lama had given a set of prayer beads to the Living Buddha before his death, which was strong evidence of reincarnation. He is the third son of a wealthy farmer with a total of four siblings. His family life is Sinicized, so this child can speak some Chinese, though not much. He is healthy and has piercing eyes. General Ma Bufang of Qinghai, since the Dalai Lama's reincarnation was found in his territory, sent people to protect him and advocated for raising him in Qinghai. Later, when Lhasa announced that another reincarnation had been found near it, General Ma agreed to send him to the Lhasa Monastery. This journey began on July 13th last year, with the travel expenses borne by the National Government, totaling 100,000 yuan. The journey took eight weeks.

Since there were three candidates for the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, according to precedent, lots should be drawn to decide. The lottery ceremony is quite solemn. In addition to the chanting of mantras and burning of incense by the monks, slips of paper are used with the names of the candidates written in Tibetan and Chinese, rolled into shapes similar to cigarettes, and placed in a golden urn. The representative sent by the National Government (currently Wu Zhongxin) then uses chopsticks to pick one out, and that person is the chosen one. This time, however, this procedure was not followed, because the Dalai Lama born in Qinghai had already been confirmed as the reincarnation of the Thirteenth, just as the Eighth Dalai Lama was able to recount stories of his previous life, so there was no need to draw lots.

Regarding the golden urn for drawing lots, it is worth mentioning that it was established by Emperor Qianlong in 1792. Before this, disputes often arose over the succession of the Dalai Lama. Since the installation of the golden urn, lots have been drawn to decide. There are two golden urns, one placed in Lhasa and one in the Lama Temple in Beijing, in case something happens in Lhasa, this ceremony can be held in Beijing. With the exception of the Eighth and now the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, all others have been selected using this method.

### A Study of the Yao Ethnic Group in Guangdong and Guangxi

— Xu Songshi

The Yao are also written as 猺. The character 猺 began to be used in the Tang Dynasty and contains a derogatory meaning. Now that all ethnic groups are united in the republic, it should be changed to 徭.

Distribution of the Yao Population Currently, the Yao people in Guangdong are mostly in the Beijiang River basin and Qinzhou. In Guangxi, they are mainly in the Liujiang River basin. The Dayaoshan Mountains, where the counties of Xiuren, Xiang, Wuxuan, Guiping, Pingnan, and Mengshan in Guangxi meet, are particularly dense with Yao people. Currently, there are more than 50,000 Yao people who have not yet been assimilated in Guangdong and about 200,000 in Guangxi. The population in the Dayaoshan Mountains alone exceeds 40,000.

There are more than 20 types of Yao, including Hou Yao, Jinxiu Yao, Hong Yao, Ao Yao, Gou Tou Yao, Man Yao, Lan Dian Yao, Guang Tou Yao, Ma Tou Yao, Bai Ku Yao, San Hua Yao, Bang Yao, Jian Tou Yao, Dong Long Yao, Pan Yao, Liang Yao, Ban Yao, Guo Shan Yao, She Yao, and Bai Yi Shanzi. In Guangdong, almost all are Ban Yao, Pan Yao, and She Yao. In Guangxi, Ban Yao and Pan Yao are also the most common.

The author grew up in Lingnan and has traveled and investigated the Yao Mountains in West Guangdong many times. As far as I know, most of the Yao people in Guangxi came from Guangdong. They often claim to be from Zhuji Lane in Guangdong. Zhuji Lane is originally in Nanxiong. Many wealthy families in Lingnan often cite Zhuji Lane as their origin. Whether the Yao people's claim is reliable, I dare not say.

Origins of the Yao People in Guangdong and Guangxi As for the origins of the Yao people in Guangdong, opinions vary. Some say that the Yao people were originally the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong, and were forced to gradually move into Guangxi, resulting in more Yao people in Guangxi today than in Guangdong. Others say that the origins of the Yao people in Guangdong are untraceable, but they were not the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong. According to Hao's Guangdong Tongzhi in the early Qing Dynasty, there were 106 Yao Mountains in Qingyuan County, 35 Yao Mountains in Conghua County, 4 Yao Mountains in Qujiang County, 2 Yao Mountains in Yingde County, 9 Yao Mountains in Gaozhou, 58 Yao Mountains in Sihui County, 54 Yao Mountains in Xinxing County, 94 Yao Mountains in Yangchun County, 13 Yao Mountains in Yangjiang County, 7 Yao Mountains in Enping County, 49 Yao Mountains in Deqing Prefecture, 2 Yao Mountains in Fengchuan County, 33 Yao Mountains in Kaijian County, 44 Yao Mountains in Maoming County, 21 Yao Mountains in Dianbai County, 83 Yao Mountains in Xinyi County, 51 Yao Mountains in Huazhou, 26 Yao Mountains in Lingshan County, 22 Yao Mountains in Dong'an County (now Yunfu), 28 Yao Mountains in Xining County (now Yunan), and 5 Yao Mountains in Lianshan County. At the same time, the Huang Qing Zhigong Tu also stated that Xining, Lechang, Zengcheng, Ruyuan, Hepu, and other counties all had Yao people. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Yao people in Guangdong were still so numerous, so it is not surprising that many people say that the Yao people were the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong.

However, according to the author's research, this is not the case. According to historical records, the Yao rebellions in Lingnan first appeared during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty. The Song History Renzong Ji states that in the second year of Emperor Renzong's Jingyou reign, the Yao Liao attacked Leihua Prefecture. The Song History Yang Tian Zhuan also states that in the third year of Emperor Renzong's Qingli reign, the Yao people of Hunan robbed and plundered prefectures and counties. When the rebels heard that Tian had arrived, they fled south of the mountains. From then on, the Yao rebellions in Guangdong became increasingly frequent. It can be seen that the history of the Yao people in Guangdong is still relatively shallow. Moreover, based on the author's research of more than ten years, it has already been determined that the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong and Guangxi were not Yao people, but Zhuang people.

Ancient Yao People's Residence The author dares to say that except for the She Yao in Chaozhou and Xunzhou, the Yao people in other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi all came from Jiangxi and Hunan. And the most ancient Yao people's residence was still in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. We can say that Zhejiang and Fujian provinces were originally the hometown of the Yao people. The Shan Yue of the Wu and Yue states were the Yao people. The Yao people like to use the words "Pan Gu" for place names. To this day, place names with "Pan Gu" can be found continuously from Jiangsu through Jiangxi and Hunan to Guangdong and Guangxi. Luo Changyuan of the Song Dynasty said that there was a Pan Gu Temple in Huai'an, Guang, and Yangzhou had a Pan Gu Tomb and Pan Gu Shrine, Huichang in Jiangxi had a Pan Gu Post, and both had a Pan Gu Shrine, and Xiangxiang in Hunan had Pan Gu Bao. According to the author, other places such as Hengyang and Changning in Hunan, and Xunwu in Jiangxi, also have place names with "Pan Gu". The number of Pan Gu place names in Guangdong and Guangxi is even more difficult to list. The Pan Gu place names in Guangdong and Guangxi were all established by the Yao people, and only the Yao people worship Pan Gu. The Yao people's ancestors came from East China, which is clearly verifiable. Isn't this a very interesting thing? The author's recent book, "History of the People in the Yuejiang River Basin" (published by Zhonghua Book Company), also has a very detailed study of the Yao compatriots in Guangdong and Guangxi. This is just a glimpse of it.

### The Scavengers

— Ling Yu

Digging for Treasures in the Garbage Daily Income of Only One or Two Dimes

Clearing out the overnight garbage, they are dumped bucket by bucket into the trash cans, and the scavengers—begin to be active early in the morning.

What are they looking for? Broken pieces of glass, and foreign bottles, filthy broken paper, cigarette butts less than five cents long, broken tin cans without lids, shoes with the faces and soles about to separate, cinders of coal balls, tin foil for wrapping cigarettes, already flattened cigarette cans, a small piece or a long strip of broken cloth or old cotton, and all kinds of broken things...they want everything.

Some places have purely old garbage shops that specialize in buying these things. It is said that a can full of cigarette butts can be bought for two cents, ten pieces of tin foil for wrapping cigarettes can be bought for one cent, broken paper is two cents per catty, broken cloth is three cents per catty, broken copper and scrap iron are more expensive, but rarely seen, broken shoes are one cent each, because they can be matched there. Old foreign nails can be bought for eight cents a catty. For people who live by scavenging, these shops are their outlet.

Sometimes, they also have exceptional harvests, finding a two-dime corner ticket in a broken wallet, picking up an ear digger next to the trash can, finding a cigarette holder in a cigarette can, and everything else that becomes an item. The selling price of this kind of thing is of course several times higher than broken things. This is an exceptional harvest, but only a kind of accidental luck.

Most of the scavengers are ragged, haggard, with withered faces mixed with smoke, although they can earn one or two dimes a day, but the lives of this group of people are simply the same as beggars.

Children's Weekly

### Beginning Learning with Care

— Yang Chunyang

The winter vacation has slipped away in the blink of an eye, and a new semester has already begun. Children, after spending two weeks living at home, are now carrying their schoolbags and skipping and hopping to school.

What work did you do during the winter vacation? I think much of it was likely squandered away easily. At that time, you were thinking: the weather is so cold, I'll wait until school starts to work hard!

Now the time has come for school to start. Are you working as hard as you thought you would during the vacation? Perhaps your thoughts have changed again now? Thinking that there's plenty of time ahead, today is over, there's still tomorrow, no need to work hard when school just starts, I'll wait a few more days to calm down and then start. You must know that the passing of time is the fastest thing. Today is the first day of school, but it will only be a flash, and summer vacation will be here again soon! How many promising children have been delayed in their careers by the saying "there's plenty of time ahead." Dear children! While the semester has just begun, quickly decide on your work plan! Starting from today, begin your efforts!

"Start with a little effort, and the result will surely be good." Children are now like the sprouting of all the plants and trees in the spring. If you hope to have good results in the future, you must rely on cultivating them well in the warm climate of spring. Without the devastation of pests and diseases, they will thrive vigorously.

Dear children! Now is the beginning of a semester, and also the beginning of your efforts. You must not lose this important good opportunity, work hard! I think you will surely be able to get a better harvest when the next semester ends!

### How to Study Science?

— Shu Shan

Children must know: "A person's life is all about learning." Do you think that's right? The proverb says, "Learn until you are old, but you will never finish learning." "Learning is endless"...all these words are a very clear confirmation, and they are all warning us, so "learning" has a close relationship with us. But today I want to discuss with the children about science, because the modern age is a scientific age, everything needs to be scientific, then science and us have a more important connection, so we need to have a clear study of science, otherwise we will be swept into the whirlpool of elimination. Our country is also a country with backward science, so the need for science is even more urgent. But how to study science? I am not a scientist, of course I don't have any systematic and detailed methods, and I can't talk about any experience, but the following points are put forward for discussion with the children, and it can also be said that these points are necessary conditions for studying science.

(1) Careful observation: Science mostly emphasizes observation, because modern methods of studying science mostly use the inductive method, which is to observe the evolution of various aspects of facts to determine its final certain conclusion, but we are prone to a problem, that is, we think we are smart, and first guess its result, and then neglect careful observation.

(2) Patient attitude: This is a necessary condition for studying science, but we often covet simplicity and fear complexity, and everyone has a hurried mentality, that is, it is best to get a problem, and after looking at it, hope to get its result immediately, but in fact it just can't meet your ideal: then you will throw it away and not think about it anymore, this lacks a patient attitude, how can you get a correct result?

(3) Objective criticism: The knowledge that the teacher teaches you, on the one hand, you should sincerely accept it, but on the other hand, you should criticize which end of this knowledge is right, and why is that end wrong? Why is this end correct? Can it be suitable for all other phenomena? What incomplete shortcomings are there? Decide for yourself one by one, so that you can understand thoroughly and not blindly follow.

(4) Refer as much as possible, the knowledge in books is ultimately limited, and even if you can understand it very clearly, it is very few, and you should refer to other books as much as possible, and then ask teachers or parents and brothers who are more knowledgeable than you...to make a further recognition and a deeper understanding!

These shallow four points are offered to the children who have just started school for not many days. If you can fully meet these standards, then your knowledge will increase infinitely and your future will be great.

### Small Reading Plan

— Tong You

1.  No matter how busy you are, have at least two times to read every day, that is, get up a quarter of an hour earlier in the morning, and go to bed a quarter of an hour later at night.

2.  Read at least half an hour a day, at least five pages, and you can read about two thousand pages in a year.

3.  When reading, you must concentrate, not afraid of the cold in winter, not afraid of the heat in summer, and not think about worries and happy things.

4.  After reading, you must think about it and firmly remember the main points of the book.

### Amphibious Bomb

— Lu Lishi

We only know that bombs can only bomb things on land, and the work of destruction in the ocean has to be taken over by torpedoes. But clever scientists had long thought of relying on bombs dropped from airplanes to destroy enemy warships rampaging on the water, and now, they have finally succeeded.

I can't help but introduce this invention to the children, because the news published in the newspaper is too exciting. The work of German torpedoes has caused the British Navy, which dominates the sea, to suffer greatly, and cruisers and battleships have sacrificed a lot. I think the children who have read this news must can't help but praise the greatness of the torpedo, right? Yes, the torpedo is great."

This kind of amphibious bomb can be a bomb in space and become a torpedo when it enters the water. A large bomb contains four cylinders. If it is dropped into the water, the four cylinders storing the explosives will immediately disperse, and the compressed air originally installed inside will push them in four directions, as fast as torpedoes. When they hit the enemy ship, they will immediately explode. The most powerful thing is that if this large bomb is dropped into the water and does not hit the enemy ship, it will be divided into four torpedoes and advance fiercely in each direction. The range is very large, and it is easier to hit the target, so the danger of being attacked by the enemy is also greater. Once the United States and any country in the world go to war, they will be able to see its capabilities in this amazing invention.

### Two Images in the Lunar New Year

— Wen Yi

"The New Year is here!" "The New Year is here!" Such cheers came from everywhere. The streets were more lively than before, and brilliant light shone from all directions, scattered in the noisy air. The harmonious and sweet music showed that it was issued by the people of civilized countries. Coming and going, almost half of them were children, laughing, jumping, running, playing, feeling a special pleasure, better than other fairylands. Adults also made fun of this time, and the sound of cards could be heard everywhere. The aroma of meat, chicken, and all kinds of things came from the corners of the houses. The sound of firecrackers rang continuously, and people were generally busy celebrating the New Year. But people who are forced by hunger and cold and are fiercely attacking the dark environment are crying in a low voice, for the sake of making a living, they have to run around the streets begging, thinking in their hearts: will they be able to get some food tomorrow to help them continue to maintain for one day? Their mournful faces looked up at the sky, begging heaven to give them some food. Their skin was frozen stiff, and they could no longer move. They lay down like puppets. The above two scenes, hell versus heaven, but only separated by a thin plaster wall!

### Pigeon Hatching Record

— Shen Xishen

A pair of pigeons are raised on the drying platform of Qiu'er's home. How lovely their pure white feathers are! They fly out together during the day and fly back together in the evening. In his spare time, Qiu'er cleans their houses and feeds them food, and truly loves them very much! One day, when Qiu'er was changing the rice straw for them, he suddenly found two pigeon eggs inside, which were very exquisite and lovely. Some people say: pigeon eggs can be nourishing, but Qiu'er couldn't bear to ruin these two future little lives, so he let the hen pigeon hatch the little pigeons.

During the incubation, the hen pigeon did not fly out, but kept the pigeon eggs close to her body morning and night: the pigeon eggs were subjected to heat for a long time, and the inside gradually changed. About two weeks later, the little pigeons came out. At first, they didn't have a single feather. After three or four days, they grew some yellow feathers and made some faint sounds, and their shape was very similar to small pigeons. The hen pigeon began to feed them; she spit out the rice grains she had eaten from her throat and fed them to her two children, always three or four times a day. She also took care of them very carefully. If you approached the little pigeons and the hen pigeon happened to be away, she would immediately run back to protect them; or if you wanted to catch the pigeons, the hen pigeon would stretch out her beak to peck you. Her care for her children is so loving and inseparable, which really makes us understand the greatness of motherhood. People and birds and beasts are originally the same!

The little pigeons grow up very quickly under the careful care of their mother; after ten days, the color and shape of these two chicks are no different from their parents, and soon they will be able to fly.

But the hen pigeon has lost a lot of weight.

### Black Brothers (5)

— Yi Mu

Xi Hua muttered: "If you dare to come again, be careful!" Although he said this, he was also a little scared in his heart. He trembled and walked out of the corner; at the same time, the old gentleman had already gone out and slammed the door shut. In an instant, I saw a cloud of mist flying past the window, swirling for a while, changing into various patterns, rolling down towards the valley, and turning several times in the air before disappearing in a burst of heavy rain.

Xi Hua turned to Ge Le and scolded: "Humph, Mr. Ge Le, you did a good job! Quickly put the mutton on the plate. If you dare to make trouble again, I'll catch you—ah, how come this mutton has been cut!" Ge Le hurriedly said: "Brother, you once allowed me to have a piece." Xi Hua said angrily: "Okay, you cut it down while it's hot, so you can eat more gravy. You are really a clever devil! But I won't allow you to be so presumptuous anymore. Sir, leave here quickly and wait in the coal cellar. Don't come out unless you hear my call."

Ge Le didn't dare to disobey, and walked out listlessly. His two brothers devoured the mutton, and when their stomachs couldn't hold it anymore, they locked the rest in a bowl. Then the two of them took out wine and drank until they were drunk.

That night, the rain was heavy and the wind was strong, and it didn't stop. When Xi Hua and Han Shi went to bed, they first closed all the wooden boards on the windows tightly, and then fastened two iron bolts on the door before going to the bedroom. The two of them originally slept in the same room. When the clock struck twelve, the two of them were suddenly awakened by a very loud collapsing sound. The bedroom door was opened by some powerful force, which shook the whole house.

Xi Hua exclaimed on the bed, "What's going on?" But he heard the old gentleman coldly reply, "It's just me." The two brothers hurriedly got up and sat on the long pillow, widening their eyes and looking into the darkness, but they saw that the bedroom was flooded with water, and a blurry moonlight shot in from a hole in the window board, forming a very large water bubble, constantly rolling. Then it swayed up and down like a cork for a while before stopping, and the old gentleman was sitting on it, looking very comfortable, as if he was sitting on the softest and most luxurious chair cushion, and the pointed hat and long robe were still neatly dressed; the pointed top of the hat stood high, because the roof was gone.

The old gentleman said with a mocking tone: "I'm sorry to disturb you. I see that your beds are probably wet with rainwater. You should go to your younger brother's room, because I have reserved the ceiling for him."

The two brothers didn't dare to say anything and hurried to Ge Le's bedroom, already soaked, their hearts filled with terror. The old gentleman shouted from behind: "You two can find my business card on the kitchen table. Please remember, this is my last visit." Xi Hua trembled and said: "Please God, let it be the last time!" Then the water bubble disappeared.

When it dawned, the two brothers looked out from Ge Le's small window and saw that Baishi Valley had become a wasteland. All the trees, crops, cattle, and sheep had been washed away by the flood, replaced by a large pile of red sand and grayish-brown soil. The two brothers trembled as they climbed to the kitchen, only to see that the water had submerged the floor. All the money and movable things had long been swept away, and only a small piece of white paper was left on the table, with several crooked and long-bodied characters engraved on it: "Mr. Southwest Wind."

Entertainment World

### Spring Festival New Film Introductions

— Qi Hua

"Tarzan Finds a Son" After watching "Tarzan Finds a Son," I want to specifically mention the young actor playing Tarzan's son—John Sheffield. His movements through the valley and swimming underwater (not sure if a 'stunt double' was used) are lively and innocent, even more endearing than Mickey Rooney in "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

The story is about Tarzan finding a child who survived a plane crash. He and Jane name him "Boy" and love him as their own. Later, the child's uncle comes to the countryside searching for him. Tarzan, unwilling to part with his "treasure," is tricked by Jane and trapped in the valley. She sends the child away, but the uncle plots to seize the inheritance, killing his companion and forcing Jane to accompany him. Unfortunately, they accidentally enter a native tribal area and are captured. Eventually, "Boy" helps them escape. Tarzan leads an elephant troop to rescue them from danger.

There are special effects of Tarzan and the child playing underwater, humorous monkey performances, a charging elephant troop, and footage of various tropical birds and beasts. This should be the most interesting film of the Spring Festival.

"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" is about Queen Elizabeth's reign and her romance with the Earl of Essex. However, after the Earl's rebellion, Elizabeth ultimately sends him to the executioner's block.

During the two hours in the theater, not only was I moved by the story, but also by Bette Davis's superb acting as Elizabeth, which was extremely inspiring. Through her every move, we seemed to see through her heart, witnessing her inner struggles and conflicts (between empire and love). Yet, she maintained a clear and strong character and the dignity of a queen. I believe this success far surpasses "Of Human Bondage" and "A Longing for You."

The director's editing of the story can be described as concise. Even more endearing is how every scene's emotional atmosphere is strongly grasped. For example, the scenes of Elizabeth stripping the Earl of Essex of his military power and the Earl going to the executioner's block are particularly intense and vivid.

"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" I haven't seen Lon Chaney's silent film, but I dare to say that the remake with sound definitely surpasses the silent film. Under the director's grand and broad vision, he consistently maintained the tense atmosphere given by the story, like a flood rushing straight down, leaving almost no room for the audience to breathe. The depiction of Quasimodo's abnormal psychology is also quite endearing.

Charles Laughton's makeup and acting can be described as perfect. Maureen O'Hara has also improved compared to "The Black Swan." Other roles, such as Louis XI, Count Frollo, and the poet Gringoire, are also well-matched. Worthy of praise.

### Drama Scene Trends

— Hua

Since its premiere on New Year's Eve, "Ge Nen Niang" is still sold out every show. Several actors have been performing from the beginning to the end, which is very tiring. Last time, they all fell ill as a result. Now, to regulate the actors' energy, "Ge Nen Niang" will only be performed at night, probably after three or four days, and the daytime performances will be changed to "Nie Hai Hua," originally written by Xiong Fuxi. The director is Li Pingqian.

The Shanghai Art Theatre's "Daughter Country" is a new type of fantasy play, a novel concept on the Chinese stage, and the business is also booming. Because all the actors are on stage this time, a new play cannot be rehearsed, so they are preparing to revive "Love and Death Struggle" after "Daughter Country."

Among many large theater troupes, the Great Bell Theater Troupe is one of the most spirited and successful. Last time, their performance of five one-act plays at the Russian Little Theater on Avenue Foch was praised by both insiders and outsiders. Now, they have invited Xu Xingzhi, the writer and director of "The Seventh Evening," to direct Xia Yan's original "The Wedding Night," scheduled to premiere for four days starting from the Lantern Festival, and the venue will still be the Russian Little Theater.

### Celebrated Peking Opera Actor Ma Lianliang's Fortieth Birthday; Celebrations Being Prepared in the Old Capital's Theater Circle

— Zhi Ge

The famous actor Ma Lianliang will celebrate his fortieth birthday on the seventeenth of this month, and his wife will also be celebrating her thirtieth birthday this year. Therefore, friends in Peiping (Beijing), have initiated a joint birthday celebration. It is said that the theater circles in Beiping are preparing a grand private performance, hoping to release the oppressive atmosphere under the iron heel of the occupation; In Shanghai, Ma has many old friends, all of whom will send telegrams of congratulations, jointly extending their congratulations. There should be a special grand occasion at that time. Ma has five sons and two daughters, all from his first wife. The eldest son is named Chongren, followed by Chongyi, Chongli, Chongzhi, and Chongxin. The daughters are also grown up and are studying in primary and secondary schools. Except for the eldest son who is learning martial arts, the others do not enter the theater world, perhaps indicating the sentiment of "doing one line and regretting it?"

It is also learned that Mr. Ma will come to Shanghai in two months to perform at the Huangjin Theater. This theater is expected to feature Xi Xiaobo after Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society. The group following Cheng's troupe will be Ma's Fufeng Society.

### An Old Carpenter Is Making a Puppet

Movie Story

### Adventures of a Wooden Puppet

— Translated by Yi Fan

Translator's Note: "The Adventures of Pinocchio is originally a world-famous fairy tale." After being adapted by Walt Disney, the creator of Snow White, it was drawn into the second full-color cartoon feature film; and it is said that it will soon be released in Shanghai. This article is excerpted and translated from Disney's original story.

Pinocchio the Puppet

Long, long ago, one evening, the evening star twinkled in the dark sky. Its silvery-white light shone on a small village below, and on a solitary traveler walking alone through this quiet little town. He was Jiminy Cricket, poorly dressed, with a package on his small shoulder. At this time, he was very tired and needed to rest, so he jumped into a house through a window hole.

The fire in the stove inside had not yet gone out. He saw a kind old man making a puppet. This old man was Geppetto, the old carpenter respected by all the villagers nearby. He lived here alone—with only his cat Figaro and his goldfish Cleo as his sole companions—specializing in making and repairing toys for people. He was truly the angel of happiness-making in this village. This was his workshop, which was also his home. The last step of the puppet's work—painting—was completed, and the cat, the goldfish, and Geppetto were all happily smiling. The old carpenter gave him a name: Pinocchio. Pinocchio, what a beautiful name! Just as endearing as his appearance. Look at him sitting there, so spirited. Round face, big eyes, long, pointy nose, wearing a hat on his head with a beautiful feather inserted on it: clever and lovely, looking just like a real boy—but, but he can't speak, can't move. "Wishing Star!" As he went to sleep, Geppetto earnestly prayed to the evening star in the sky, "How wonderful it would be if Pinocchio were a real, living child!"
