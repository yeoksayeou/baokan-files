### The Brave Soldiers of Southern Henan Again Report Victory: The Japanese Army in Tanghe Suffers a Complete Collapse; The Japanese Forces Attacking Northward from Zhongxiang are Also Repelled; Chinese Troops Near Suixian Complete Multiple Encirclement Lines; A Major Battle is Expected on the Henan-Hubei Border

Luoyang: The battle near Tanghe has lasted for more than two days and nights. By late on the 8th, the battle had come to a conclusion. The invading Japanese army, after being met head-on and flanked by the Chinese forces according to plan, suffered a complete collapse. The total number of dead and wounded is estimated to be over 2,000. Currently, the Chinese are coordinating with troops on the left and right flanks to clear the battlefield and search for remaining Japanese soldiers. Moreover, cavalry units are pursuing the fleeing enemy. After the news of the victory in Tanghe reached Xinye, the military's morale was greatly boosted. The Japanese forces at Xinqiang (south of Xinye), hearing the news, fled eastward. The Chinese are advancing at full speed. (9th dispatch)

Fancheng: More than 3,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded westward from Biyang reached Tanghe on the morning of the 7th. On the night of the 8th, the Chinese troops arrived and engaged in fierce combat, completely defeating the Japanese. Tanghe was thus retaken. In the area north of Shuanggou, southwest of Tanghe, there were over 1,000 Japanese soldiers who were surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops on the 9th, and more than half have already been eliminated. The Chinese troops attacking the rear of the Japanese forces north of the Jingzhong Road advanced to the Xianghua Road on the 9th, made contact with another unit, and began sweeping to the left and right of the Japanese. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. At the same time, Chinese troops on the Hanyi Road also launched attacks. Important strongholds around Suimenkou have been controlled by the Chinese. The Japanese at Yingzao and other places are showing signs of wavering. (9th dispatch)

Fancheng: The Japanese army advancing northwestward from the three directions of central Hubei, northern Hubei, and southern Henan totals over 100,000, accompanied by powerful artillery, cavalry, and tank units, and assisted by a large number of aircraft. Their ambition to encircle our positions, defeat the main force of the Chinese army, and occupy the area between the eastern bank of the Xiang River and the southern section of the Pinghan Road is very obvious. However, as of noon today, the Chinese army has been using part of its forces to block the advance of the Japanese from all directions. In particular, a certain unit guarding Tongbai has been engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese for a long time, remaining steadfast and preventing the Japanese advancing from Nanxin and Nanque from linking up. Starting on the 7th, the Chinese army began encircling and attacking the outer flanks and rear of the Japanese forces. The main forces of the two Japanese routes have been severely damaged and are showing signs of wavering. One unit broke through and fled northward, reaching Tanghe on the 7th, attempting to attack the flank of the Chinese army from the northeast to relieve the siege of the main Japanese force in southern Henan. After being fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, the remaining Japanese soldiers fled southwest, still falling into the Chinese encirclement. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese advancing northward towards the east bank of the Xiang River from Zhongxian Yangzi has been defeated. The Chinese forces then pursued and fiercely annihilated them at Tianjiaji, Xinjie, and Gengjiaji (all on the south side of the Xiangzao Road). The remaining Japanese forces reached the area north and south of the Gun River on the evening of the 8th, and one unit broke through to near Sanhezhen (northeast of Fancheng). This unit was completely annihilated by the Chinese last night and retreated southward. In addition, the Japanese advancing from Suixian towards Zaoyang were blocked by the Chinese army in the area east of Gaocheng, Lishan, Anju, and Qianyi, and were severely damaged near Lishan. The momentum of the Japanese was greatly reduced. Yesterday, the Chinese army voluntarily opened the front line, attracting the Japanese to the Zaoyang area. As of noon today, the main force of the Japanese had just passed Lizhen Town, and the Chinese troops in that area simultaneously completed several lines of encirclement behind the Japanese. The first line connects Xinjie to the west, directly to Xiangyang, and connects to Tongbai, Biyang, and Tanghe to the east. The encirclement is now being tightened from all directions. The greatest victory is unfolding. (9th dispatch)

Fancheng: One unit of the Japanese army advancing towards Tianjiaji (north of Zhongxiang) in central Hubei was intercepted by the Chinese army on the afternoon of the 7th, with over 1,000 Japanese soldiers killed. On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese reinforced with a large number of troops and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese under the cover of machine guns and artillery. After a bloody battle until the evening, the Japanese were still unsuccessful. On the morning of the 9th, another unit of the Chinese army launched a flanking attack on the Japanese from Xinjie (south of Zaoyang), gradually forcing the Japanese to the vicinity of Gengjiaji, where they were surrounded and annihilated, killing more than 860 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through and fled towards Tuqiaopu. (9th dispatch)

Nanyang: One unit of the Japanese army in southern Henan, invading westward along the Xintong Highway, has been intercepted by the Chinese in successive battles. The Japanese formation is showing signs of disintegration. Since yesterday morning, one unit of the Chinese army on the outer flank has launched a fierce attack on the flank and rear of the Japanese from the Tongbai Mountains, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. By noon, the Japanese forces were showing increasing signs of being unable to hold out and scattered to the northwest. The Chinese army pursued in separate routes. This morning, one unit of over 4,000 troops reached the vicinity of Shahepu and forcibly crossed the Tang River. The Chinese army took advantage of their being half-way across the river and launched a flanking attack from the front and rear, annihilating most of the Japanese force. (9th dispatch)

Chongqing: According to the latest military dispatch from the front lines of northern Hubei, the vanguard of the Japanese army is 20 miles away from Fancheng. It is reported that the Japanese army advancing northward along the east bank of the Hanshui River from Zhongxiang has reached Huanglonggang (transliteration), east of Fancheng and south of the Zao-Fan Highway. The Japanese apparently intend to cut off the highway near Xuankou Town (transliteration), east of Fancheng, and meet with the Japanese army advancing westward along the Zaoyang Highway. Another Japanese army departing from Suixian is reported to have advanced to a certain point southwest of Zaoyang. There is also a third Japanese army advancing along the highway, currently engaged in battle with the Chinese army near Tangxian Town, east of Zaoyang. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Luoyang: Since the Japanese army in southern Henan invaded westward, it has suffered heavy casualties due to interceptions by the Chinese army. A large number of corpses have been transported back to Xinyang, estimated to be over 2,000. (8th dispatch)

Luoyang: The Japanese army in southern Henan harassed Dahetun (east of Tanghe) and was defeated by the Chinese. Later, they harassed westward again, with multiple Japanese aircraft assisting in the battle, but they were again unsuccessful. Currently, the Chinese army is deploying in the Tongbai Mountains. (8th dispatch)

Chongqing: Today, a spokesperson for the Chinese military stated that the mechanized Japanese army has been advancing along the Henan-Hubei border towards the strong positions of the Chinese forces. A major battle between the two sides will occur within days. The Japanese army is currently attacking with 150,000 troops, 200 aircraft, and 400 tanks, advancing from the north and south. The northern route is advancing from Changtaiguan and Xinyang, and the southern route is advancing from Zhongxiang and Yangzizhen. Another central route army is attacking along the Xianghua Highway from Suixian. The Japanese armies on the northern and southern routes launched their attacks on May 1st, while the Japanese army on the central route was only able to begin operations on May 4th due to fierce resistance. The Chinese military spokesperson also recalled the same battle in May of last year, saying that the Japanese army suffered a major defeat at that time. Now the Chinese army is fully prepared. The Chinese army had learned of the Japanese plan in April. The Japanese attack is clearly intended to consolidate their position in Hankou and eliminate the Chinese forces operating in the Hankou area. The Japanese army is not only encountering serious resistance on all five routes, but is also finding it extremely difficult to maintain its transportation due to the Chinese army's encirclement strategy.

Editorial

### The United States and the Soviet Union in the Future International Order

The more international affairs evolve, the more dangerous and worrying they become, a sentiment shared by almost everyone in the world.

Based on the recent international situation, it can be inferred that the United States and the Soviet Union are indeed standing firm in the midst of turbulent waves, acting as pillars of support. What their positive contributions to the international order will be is still impossible to estimate. In essence, whether these two countries can prevent the spread of war, whether they can maintain local security, and whether their actions will ultimately promote human civilization and create a foundation for peace, the merits and demerits of their actions all await objective facts to be revealed, and cannot be judged today. However, the Soviet Union, on one hand, has stopped its attacks on belligerent countries for their partiality; on the other hand, it has signaled to Germany its concern for Sweden's neutrality; signaled to Britain to open the door to Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations; dismissed Germany's mediation between the Soviet Union and Italy; and strongly refuted rumors of compromise with Japan. Although these attitudes are not enough to be seen as the outline of the Soviet Union's future actions, they have given a positive and subtle influence to the current chaotic international situation, which cannot be ignored. As for the United States, it has frankly declared its attitude regarding the possible deterioration of the situation in the Mediterranean and the possible crisis in the Dutch East Indies; within its own country, it has promoted public opinion for sanctioning violence, which is maturing, and its naval construction and economic measures show the firmness and concreteness of its policy. The stationing of the Pacific Fleet in the Far East is the most blatant manifestation of its intentions. To say that this can contain the madman is not believable, but at least it makes the madman look sideways and reconsider his plans. From the above, although the positive contributions of the United States and the Soviet Union are not yet worthy of praise, they should be recognized at this stage.

Unfortunately, the development of international affairs often deviates from the standards of normal reason, and even runs counter to it. For example, the normal course of the European war would be to restore peace; even if it is difficult to restore immediate peace, it would be normal to prevent its further expansion; even if it expands, it would be normal to expand only out of military necessity. But is this the case? The current danger is not that there will be a tragic slaughter between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line, sacrificing tens of millions of lives to artillery fire; it is not that there will be a decisive battle between the main forces in the North Sea, sinking huge battleships to the bottom of the sea; it is not that London, Paris, Berlin, and other densely populated, industrialized, culturally prosperous, and historically significant cities will be destroyed by the bombing of the enemy's air force; but that Italy is about to join the war and the Balkans are about to be ravaged. According to common sense, it would be most beneficial and reasonable for Italy to retain freedom of action and remain a bystander throughout the war. The Balkan countries have been carefully guarding themselves from the beginning, fearing the approach of misfortune. Since the belligerent countries do not need the Balkans as a decisive battlefield, the Balkan countries will eventually maintain their neutrality. This is required by public law and dictated by self-interest. But have you not heard the desperate appeals of the Greek and Romanian authorities? What are these appeals for? Have you not seen the US authorities ordering US citizens in the Balkans to withdraw as soon as possible? Have you not seen the Italian newspapers attacking the Vatican's newspaper? Have you not seen the New York Times revealing that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has politely declined US President Roosevelt's offer to mediate? These are all phenomena of the past two days, which seem to be hinting at the dangers of the next few days. Danger can no longer be concealed, but why Italy must go to war is something that normal reason cannot answer.

Based on normal reason, it can still be asserted that although Italy is poised and ready to strike, it will ultimately not go to war. If this is not the case, then Mussolini will insist on achieving his desire for the Mediterranean: first, he is determined to have the Mediterranean; second, it is difficult to appease the clamor of the Fascist Party; third, he has made promises to Hitler under certain conditions that cannot be broken; fourth, he has a high assessment of his own air force and its capabilities in combat; fifth, he has made a negative observation of the impact of the losses suffered by Britain and France in Norway. These five factors may be seen as the reasons why Italy will eventually participate in the war. However, judging war based on normal reason, the interests of the nation during and after the war must be the standard for deciding whether or not to fight. The above five factors are not sufficient to justify non-participation. If war breaks out, let us not discuss the success or failure of the outcome; the immediate and visible reaction will be that the United States will expand the scope of its neutrality laws, and the Soviet Union will strengthen its policy towards the Balkans. These are still the smallest, narrowest, and slightest of reactions. Extrapolating from this reaction, to regard Italy's participation in the war as the starting point for the expansion of the European war to an unlimited extent is not an exaggeration. From this starting point, judging the United States and the Soviet Union, the United States and the Soviet Union will no longer be steadfast pillars, but will become crucial players in determining the outcome. For the United States and the Soviet Union to participate in the decision of the final outcome, it is essential that the United States and the Soviet Union establish an understanding and cooperate as soon as possible. Then, they can overcome obstacles, simplify the complexities, and regard the European situation as the final and most central problem of the world's overall situation, and work together to achieve stability. This is the most光明 and reasonable捷径.

### US Warships Remain Stationed in Hawaii: Preventing the Spread of War; The British Are Pleased; The Japanese Believe It Is a Demonstration: The US-Japan Situation Is Very Subtle and Complex

Tokyo: Japanese Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa told reporters today that the US Navy Department's decision to station its main fleet in Hawaii is another anti-Japanese demonstration. However, the Japanese Navy is not seriously concerned about this matter and was aware of the US decision in advance. When asked about the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the current state of the Dutch East Indies, the spokesman said that the Navy unconditionally supports Arita's remarks and shares the same views. A US reporter asked whether Arita made these remarks because of the previous rumors that the Dutch East Indies would be placed under US protection when the Netherlands was drawn into the war, and whether the US Navy made the above decision because of Arita's remarks. The spokesman said that he does not see any connection between these rumors and Arita's remarks, or between Arita's remarks and the US Navy's decision. It is important to know that the policies set by a country are profound and rigorous, and will never be changed due to rumors. The US-Japan situation is very subtle and complex, so he maintains a reserved and calm attitude towards the politicians of both countries. (9th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Times Washington dispatch states that people here are convinced that the US battle fleet's stationing in Hawaii is one element of President Roosevelt's announced policy of "doing everything we can" to prevent the spread of war. This particular event is related to the current tension in the Netherlands and other countries, and the determination of the United States, which can be demonstrated in various possible ways, to inform the Japanese government that it will regard a "protective" occupation of the Dutch East Indies as a most serious matter. (9th Reuters dispatch)

London: London newspapers yesterday competed to publish news of the US Navy Department's decision to keep the US fleet in Hawaiian waters and engage in other tactical exercises, with large headlines. The Star's headline was "US Fleet Remains in the Pacific," and the Evening News' headline was "The US Fleet's Humorous Order," expressing the Londoners' pleasure at this move. (9th Associated Press dispatch)

Washington: The US Navy's stationing of a fleet in Hawaiian waters remains the main topic of discussion among political and diplomatic figures here. It is generally believed that this measure is aimed at Japan and is a public secret to protect the Dutch East Indies. Secretary of State Hull said that the US fleet may return to California within days. (9th Huitong dispatch)

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said yesterday in response to inquiries that Foreign Minister Arita did not make any specific proposals during his talks with US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre. (9th Huitong dispatch)

### Netherlands Invites Neutral Journalists to Visit Coastal Defenses, Demonstrating Efficiency of Defensive Works, Military Measures Taken in the West

The naval authorities in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, recently invited newspaper reporters from neutral countries to visit the coastal defenses of the Netherlands aboard the cruiser "Sumatra," in order to understand the efficiency of the defense works if Dutch neutrality is violated. In addition, the commander of the Dutch "Water Line" area (including major cities in the western Netherlands) issued a notice stating that various military measures have been taken. Anyone driving a car on the highways in this area must exercise extreme caution. The government authorities, in view of the events in Norway, are determined to suppress the activities of "Fifth Columns" (referring to traitors) within the country. All national institutions, newspapers, and important enterprises are heavily guarded by soldiers. Furthermore, the regulations for punishing espionage have also been strengthened. The Ministry of Justice will submit a new bill to the House of Representatives in the near future, arguing that as long as the current tense situation does not ease, the courts may exile political criminals to the colonies, so that rebellious elements will no longer harbor hopes of being released by foreign forces. The government authorities are also concerned that foreign countries may use airplanes and parachutes to assist "Fifth Columns," and have therefore decided to strengthen the defense of all airfields and other places that could serve as aviation bases, as a precautionary measure. According to a government announcement yesterday, the police in the Dutch East Indies are closely monitoring German residents and Nazi organizations in western Java. Two publications of the party have been ordered to cease publication. A member of the East Indies Parliament, Xian Mou, asked the government whether German residents in the territory might follow the example of German residents in Norway and act as internal collaborators. It was answered that the authorities are paying close attention to this issue, but there is no need to declare martial law in the Dutch East Indies. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Approves the Outline of Economic Construction in Sichuan Province, Convening Responsible Personnel in Chengdu to Discuss Results, Determining Policies, Institutions, and Projects to Be Undertaken

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that Sichuan Province has abundant resources and a large population, making it an important base for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is imperative to predetermine an outline for the economic construction of Sichuan Province, with the central government, local authorities, social figures, and entrepreneurs working together to accelerate its advancement. He convened responsible personnel in Chengdu for detailed discussions to formulate an outline for the economic construction of Sichuan Province, determining its policies and institutions, and the projects to be undertaken. The outline has been approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the full text is as follows:

(Outline of Economic Construction in Sichuan Province) Sichuan Province is rich in resources and has long been known as the "Land of Abundance." With the rise of the war of resistance, it has become an important rear base. Meeting the needs of national defense and laying the foundation for the people's livelihood, the construction center cannot be located anywhere else. However, economic construction is complex and multifaceted, so it is necessary to coordinate the entire province and establish sound systems, so that things are not done in vain and results can be expected. The following are the proposed outlines for policies, organizations, construction projects, funding, and other aspects. (A) Policies. Modern economic construction should prioritize the establishment of policies, which should be based on the ultimate goal of construction. The future economic construction of this province should embody the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, increase material production, seek the happiness of all the people, and benefit the people without competing with them for profit. The effects of construction must ensure that the largest number of people receive the highest and most widespread benefits. Based on this goal, the following five policies should be pursued. 1. Socialized Economic Construction. Since the purpose of economic construction is to benefit the people, socialization should be its main policy. In the future, the construction of this province should strive for the widespread distribution of practical benefits, avoiding the emergence of special class capitalism, so that the benefits of the entire province belong to the people of the province, and the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the 70 million people of Sichuan can gradually reach a state of abundance and affluence. 2. Rationalization. Economic construction should proceed according to rational and planned steps. There are three standards: (1) Construction should be based on the needs of the people's livelihood, avoiding useless acts and not creating conflicts of interest. (2) Construction should adapt to the resources and environment of this province. The province has a vast area and varied conditions, so it is necessary to formulate regional division of labor plans according to local conditions. (3) Construction work should weigh priorities, determine urgency, divide stages, and set phased implementation plans. During the war of resistance, transportation is difficult, and the transportation of raw materials and the procurement of machinery are particularly difficult. The progress of construction must take these facts into account. 3. Scientification. Scientific management is an essential element for the success of economic undertakings. In the future, the construction of this province should be based on this understanding, so that the activities of agriculture, industry, and commerce are all carried out in accordance with modern methods to achieve the highest efficiency. The selection of personnel should be based on specialized training as the standard. Labor and capital in industry and commerce, and landlords and tenants in agriculture, should also coordinate with each other, each doing their best, and applying the latest technologies to achieve the greatest results. 4. Systematization. The management of economic undertakings must have a sound system as its foundation in order to obtain long-term and reliable results. In the future, the production and marketing of this province should gradually establish rational systems in terms of personnel, finance, and operations, in order to adapt flexibly and avoid wasting effort. 5. Organization. The system is the framework of economic undertakings, and organization is its network. With organization, information can be communicated and strength is not dissipated. In the future, the government should guide the formation of various industry groups and trade associations, so that the government's relevant economic laws and plans can be effectively implemented by various groups, and the legitimate interests of producers and professionals can be promoted and protected. (B) Institutions. The construction of Sichuan Province is of great importance. In order to meet the needs, an institution for initiating, coordinating, designing, and deliberating should be established as the hub for promoting work. The Sichuan Provincial Economic Construction Committee is established as the central organization for promoting research, design, and service. As for the construction work itself, it should be handled separately according to its nature. Projects that benefit the people without direct benefits can be handled by the Construction Department of the Provincial Government. For projects that have direct benefits, in order to speed up their promotion, the government and the people should jointly organize the Sichuan Revitalization Corporation as the parent company to promote business. The people can organize subsidiaries to directly promote business at any time according to their needs and abilities. The subsidiaries are supported and supervised by the parent company on the one hand, and operate their own unique businesses on the other hand. As for the funds of the subsidiaries, part of them are initiated and allocated by the parent company, and part of them are raised by the people according to the method of commercial companies. In this way, the people have the opportunity to invest widely and contribute to beneficial production, and the morbid states of speculation, hoarding, and profiteering can be avoided. (C) Construction Projects. A rational economic construction plan relies on overall planning. At present, the progress of economic construction in the province varies. Some have already achieved results, some are in progress, and some are important but have not yet been carried out. Based on the facts and considering the needs, the following eight items are proposed as the mainstays of construction: (1) Land, (2) Agriculture and Forestry, (3) Industry and Mining, (4) Transportation, (5) Trade, (6) Finance, (7) Reclamation, (8) Health. Key points are listed and advanced separately. 1. Land. The ultimate purpose of land administration is to accurately know the area of cultivated land in the province and the ownership of land rights, so that the relationship between landlords and tenants has a precise basis for improvement, and the land tax revenue has accurate statistics for assessment.

### British House of Commons Passes Motion for Adjournment, Majority of Votes Only 81, Some Members Demand Cabinet Resignation

London - The House of Commons recently put the government's motion for adjournment to a vote, and it was passed with 281 votes to 200 votes, a difference of only 81 votes. It can be seen that the strength of the opposition has increased. During the voting, some members loudly demanded the resignation of the cabinet. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

London - According to Reuters, Chamberlain will remain in office, but the government may be reorganized. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - Although the House of Commons passed the cabinet's motion for adjournment with 281 votes to 200 votes, observers generally believe that since the collapse of the MacDonald cabinet in 1931, the national cabinet has always received the support of a very large majority of votes whenever it encountered important debates. This time, it only received a majority of 81 votes, which is rare. In addition to the opposition parties voting against it today, 44 members of the government party also voted against it. Among them, the most important ones are former Secretary of War Lord Belisha, former Secretary of the Navy Duff Cooper, former Secretary of the Colonies Amery, Admiral Sir Keyes, and Lady Astor, Lord Kinhorn Nicholson. In addition, there were 130 people who did not participate in the voting, including 30 who were absent due to illness, some who were serving in the army, navy, and air force, and between 50 and 60 who abstained. Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently studying the debate in the House of Commons today and the results of the voting with his advisors. Political figures say that the fact that the opposition Labor Party members refused to participate in a cabinet headed by Chamberlain has now been confirmed. According to someone from the Conservative Party, the members of this party have always adhered to discipline when voting. Unexpectedly, a large number of members voted against it this time, which shows that the current government has suffered a major setback. Another point is worth noting: For many years, Churchill, as the Secretary of the Navy, has loudly appealed in the opposition, exposing the expansion of German military power, but the government has remained deaf to it. Moreover, because he led a part of the Conservative Party members to oppose three national cabinets, although his past political achievements were brilliant and his reputation was high, he was never invited to participate in these cabinets. At this moment, he is actually responsible for defending the national cabinet in the House of Commons. This situation is very contradictory. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

London - The thirty supporters of the government who voted against the government in the House of Commons last night held a meeting in the House of Commons this afternoon, resolving that the next government must be a truly nationally united government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - The House of Commons approved the government's motion to adjourn until May 21. Super-faction member Davis moved an amendment, advocating that the meeting should reconvene on May 14. It is said that yesterday's vote has greatly changed the national situation. The House of Commons may have to deal with the storm, so he opposes adjourning for as long as the 12th. Moreover, the entire government structure must be reorganized, and the issue should be considered as soon as possible. The overall situation is changing daily, and new threats may occur. It is not a good strategy for the House of Commons to adjourn for a long time in this situation. Time is moving every second, and no one knows what dangers will befall the Netherlands, Belgium, or other countries in Southeast Europe. Conservative Party member Busby supported Davis's amendment. National Conservative Party member Loftus opposed the amendment, saying that they all admitted that the entire government must be changed, including people from various parties and even people outside the parties, so it is very appropriate for this meeting to be held on the 10th or 12th, so that the leaders of each party can discuss their opinions every day. Liberal opposition member Mandel said that a long-term adjournment cannot be made now. Conservative Party member Margesson reiterated the Prime Minister's assurance that Congress would be convened before May 21 if necessary. Then Davis withdrew the amendment. Secretary of the Interior Anderson announced that it is now urgently necessary to increase the authority's new regulations on dealing with foreign activities and implementing the suppression of propaganda that obstructs the war by law. Opposition leader Attlee stated that the Secretary of the Interior had decided to consult with members of Congress on the new regulations, but this does not mean that members of Congress agree with or oppose the new regulations. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - According to a Reuters House of Commons lounge interviewer, it is quite clear that the Labor Opposition Party and Lloyd George will not accept official positions under the Chamberlain government. The Labor Opposition Party has accepted the motion for a ten-day adjournment of the House of Commons. The Labor Party will hold a meeting next week. In view of the changes in government personnel, the government's motion for parliamentary adjournment is a good opportunity for discussion. The Prime Minister has invited a delegation of pro-supporter members of "1922" to Downing Street to meet. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - Foreign Minister Halifax went to the Foreign Office this morning to discuss matters, and then hurried to Downing Street at 10:00 a.m. At 10:55 a.m., he went to the House of Commons. About a hundred citizens gathered in front of his residence, cheering and saluting him. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### British House of Lords Debates Norway War Situation, British Foreign Minister and Minister Without Portfolio Refute Members' Accusations Separately

London - When answering questions in the House of Lords, Minister Without Portfolio Lord Hankey first stated that the bravery and competence of the British troops in Norway is a glorious precedent for the nation and a good omen for the future. He then said that some people believe that the government lacked sensitive information on this matter. However, we knew in advance that the enemy had concentrated troops and ships, and was engaged in embarkation and disembarkation exercises. However, given the close relationship between Norway and Denmark and Germany, if we had not heard anything about Germany's actions beforehand, what we knew would certainly not be more than the governments of Norway and Denmark. Regarding the German plan mentioned by Lord Strathbogey, many such books have been published outside. The General Staff knew of the existence of this plan, and we had also drafted a counter-plan to deal with special emergency actions when necessary. I think the government's dispersal of aid to Finnish troops was too thoughtful, because the government believed that it was not appropriate to keep all of these troops stagnant under the circumstances at that time, and to requisition ships needed in other areas as well. (omission)

Hankey also refuted a certain question, first stating that the setbacks in Norway were not enough to prevent the Allies from achieving final victory, and that the Germans had transferred eight or nine divisions of the army and a large number of air force from the central theater to the Norwegian theater, and had suffered extremely heavy casualties. We should not be discouraged by this retreat, but should express our satisfaction with the heroic achievements of our troops.

Lord Chatfield then rose to speak, saying that it is a mistake to say that the retreat from central Norway was an unfortunate event. This matter will not affect the final victory of the Allies. I believe that this retreat was a practical and heroic performance, but it is completely different from the Battle of Gallipoli in the past. The British troops who went to Gallipoli at that time were temporarily transferred from the battlefield. The British troops fighting in Norway today were specially retained after the General Staff's full consideration for the purpose of providing this aid. I firmly believe that the government will launch fierce attacks on the enemy's communication lines day and night in the entire theater of war in the future, and will completely eliminate the few German troops. Norway will definitely be our backing.

Lord Teynham also rose to speak, saying that it is extremely doubtful whether the occupation of Trondheim will give Britain an advantage in the air. This matter may make the situation even more dangerous. Foreign Minister Lord Halifax answered the debate, saying that it is impossible for members of the upper and lower houses to distinguish between the Prime Minister and any other member of the War Cabinet who is in full agreement and shares full responsibility for all matters. I cannot say that the government is without fault, but I do not often express regret on behalf of the government. The Foreign Minister strongly criticized the illusion of a shortcut to victory, saying that I have always been reluctant to mention the great hardships that the country will encounter, or that this war will largely depend on the government's ability to maintain stability and lead all efforts without expending significant energy. Therefore, I hope that the government will not deviate from its main purpose, but will seek the best technical advice and take the most effective approach. Someone asked whether the various supply matters would be under the authority of Churchill. Halifax replied that I believe that Churchill can conduct any investigation into the supply issue and suggest organizational improvements. If there are difficult problems, he can submit them to the cabinet for resolution. As for the two matters of establishing a War Cabinet and recommending a smaller group of ministers without portfolio, the purpose is the same, that is, to seek the efficiency that all matters should have. There is now a real danger that obvious simplification will only add another cog to the machine and cause even greater delays. All members of the government have only one goal, which is to achieve victory. Whenever we believe that others can do a better job, I know that they will be willing to give way to the wise and will never be reluctant to leave, because the responsibility we bear today cannot satisfy people, but is a heavy burden and is sometimes close to unbearable. Anyone who can do their job has no right to fail to recognize the mistakes pointed out to them and should welcome them. Halifax continued, saying that most of the criticism is based on information that is not detailed, and at the same time is based on what is known more than the government knew when it took action. From the government's point of view, it is not enough to care about it, but when the effect of the criticism makes the whole country feel that the combat efforts of those responsible for directing the war are improperly planned and the measures are wrong, then I think this criticism has destroyed its purpose, and only adds unnecessary and useless weight to the unavoidable hardships of the war.

The House of Lords took no action on the vote. Then Lord Snell rose to say that the Labor Party is willing to reaffirm the important responsibilities that the country should bear for the principles on which it started the war in the most powerful way. We have no retreat or disagreement in resisting the threats of tyranny and injustice, the threats of authoritarianism to freedom, and the threats of totalitarianism to democracy, because there are no parties or boundaries to speak of today. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### British House of Commons, Second Day of Debate, Chamberlain Accepts Labor Party Challenge (Continued from Yesterday)

London - The opposition party in the House of Commons severely criticized the government last night because of the Norwegian military setbacks. Labor Party member Morrison also pointed out that Prime Minister Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, and Secretary of State for Air Hoare were incompetent. Chamberlain finally agreed to accept Morrison's challenge and let the House of Commons vote on it after the debate ended.

### Hall's Report: Sky Battles

During a debate, Air Minister Hall stated, "What I want to discuss is specifically the events of the past month and the work of the British Air Force in Norway. The Germans had already occupied important airfields in central and southern Norway, which is extremely important. When considering the subsequent battles, this point must not be forgotten. From the beginning, the British Air Force was at a disadvantage, having to fly hundreds of miles across the North Sea, while the enemy planes had nearby bases. The difference in conditions was vast. Finding a base for British fighters in Norway was our task. I can state unequivocally that we began aerial combat without any delay. As soon as German troops entered Norway, our air force began reconnaissance. Within hours, we launched large-scale bombing raids on airfields in Norway, Denmark, and Germany. From that day on, day and night, rain or shine, our air force carried out bombing missions. Their efforts were very evident, and their achievements were also very remarkable. During this period, enemy air raids on our bases and troops were greatly reduced. The German air force suffered losses three times greater than ours. All of this is supported by factual evidence." (Government party cheers)

"In short, the British Air Force is a match for the enemy. Reconnaissance aircraft accompanied the first troops to Åndalsnes to find flat ground suitable for landing. Eventually, only one suitable location was found, and the snow was cleared from the ground to create a runway. Ammunition and gasoline were also set up. In less than a week, it became an airfield capable of accommodating aircraft. At that time, aircraft carried by an aircraft carrier flew out from the ship, 180 miles away, in the snow. They landed on a lake at 7 PM that evening, and reconnaissance planes appeared in the sky at 10 PM. However, the next day, 80 German bombers arrived to attack, continuing for fifteen hours without stopping, dropping countless tons of high-explosive bombs. The two sides engaged in at least thirty-seven battles. As a result, six enemy planes crashed into the lake, and eight crashed in nearby areas. According to estimates by the British air squadron leaders, at least thirty enemy planes were destroyed."

Labour Party's Dalton asked if there were anti-aircraft guns near this frozen lake. Hall replied, "Unfortunately, no. The deployment of anti-aircraft guns was disrupted due to the sinking of ships. At the time, the question was whether to rush our air squadron forward or delay it for a few days to wait for the anti-aircraft guns. After considering the overall situation, we ultimately decided to send the air squadron to deal with the German bombers immediately. Most of the British aircraft were rendered inoperable on the ground due to German bombing, but none were shot down from the air."

"The lack of air bases was the main reason for the British Air Force's disadvantage in the operation. We were aware of this danger early on, but we could not avoid action to avoid the crisis, as it would not be tolerated by British public opinion. We have learned two lessons from the Norwegian campaign: first, the superiority of British fighters over German bombers; and second, the power of the British Air Force to operate at night. However, while the quality is superior, the quantity is insufficient. The speed of aircraft production is increasing day by day, which is much better than before. I think it will definitely get better in the future."

Answering a question from a certain member of parliament, Hall said, "According to what I know, there are no airfields in the Narvik area. The German air force is not invincible. However, any air force, whether German or otherwise, is only invincible when there is no sufficient air force to counter it. The Allies are seeking to have sufficient fighters to counter German bombers here. Wherever there are fighters, we express our ability to deal with German bombers. The war history of the past eight months has shown the superiority of British fighters over German bombers."

### Lloyd George Raises Questions

Lloyd George began by saying, "The facts stated by Hall are not sufficient to defend the government. The first batch of British soldiers sent to Norway should have been elite troops. The Germans had a strong force, while we responded with untrained Home Guard. It is important to know that the work that the vanguard should accomplish is related to the success or failure of the entire army."

"We should have ensured that the army and navy were in contact and had mutually supportive actions, but we did not do so. We were merely gambling on the opportunity to find air bases. The departure of this expeditionary force was extremely important, as the strategic position of our country and its prestige in the world were at stake. However, the authorities' arrangements and equipment were inadequate, and there was no coordination between the army and navy. The government knew that the Germans were preparing to launch air raids on several neighboring areas and the Baltic Sea. However, their actions in Norway were such that the government should be severely condemned for this."

"We are deeply honored to read the heroic war history of our army, but we feel even more ashamed of the government's deception of our soldiers." (Opposition party cheers loudly) "In my experience of commanding wars, I never regard a major defeat as a trivial matter. The government must grasp the facts to restore its position. There is no reason to panic at the moment, but there is a major reason why we should be more united." (The crowd cheers) "By informing the people of the facts, the people will understand the extent of our danger. The two major powers of Britain and France are now united in the struggle for freedom. If we do not inform the people of the true situation of the crisis, we will not be able to mobilize the entire nation of Britain to exert its full strength."

"We need real action, but not the superficial action that we have already taken. As for a meaningless account of the losses on both sides, it is useless." (The crowd cheers) "In terms of strategy, we are currently in a worse position than before. Hitler's greatest victory is that he has put us in a greater danger, far more than what the German submarines inflicted on us in 1914."

"The strategic advantages we have given to Germany are: first, the loss of Czechoslovakia and its one million best European troops; what is the second advantage? Did we not have a Franco-Soviet alliance? According to this alliance, the Soviet Union should have supported Czechoslovakia. If that were the case, Germany would have encountered a new front. But what was the result in the end? Now Soviet ships are crossing the Black Sea to supply Germany with aviation fuel. The third advantage is Romania. Germany has virtually taken Romania into its grasp. Even if Germany did not get it a month ago, we have sent Romania to Germany with our policy in Norway. As for Spain, I hope that what I am worried about in Spain will not come true."

"Now that we have placed the Scandinavian Peninsula in Germany's hands, it is useless for us to criticize Sweden. What right do we have to blame them? We used to provide aid to neutral countries and protect them, but we never sent an aircraft to Poland. Even in Norway, our actions were an afterthought. Germany's occupation of Norway has brought German planes and submarines 200 miles closer to our coast. We have made promises to Poland, Norway, and Finland. All of our checks have become waste paper." (The government party shouts "Shameless," while the Labour Party applauds loudly) "Now, will any small country be prepared to resist the Nazis based on our empty promises? You tell me. Then what is the point of not grasping the facts? Everyone is dissatisfied with our country's war efforts. I also agree with the Prime Minister's statement that we must respond to the current situation and not regard it as a human problem. I support the Prime Minister's call for sacrifices from the people. I believe that if the people have the trust that the leaders are doing their best, they will always be prepared to sacrifice. Now I dare to solemnly declare that I have a word to tell the Prime Minister: The Prime Minister can set an example of sacrifice, because nothing can contribute more to our victory in the war than the Prime Minister sacrificing his position." (Labour Party cheers loudly)

### Cooper Hopes the Government Will Realize

Former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper then spoke, saying that the public hopes that the government will be fully moved by the opinions they have heard and the information they have received from private sources and take steps to remedy the current difficulties. He does not want to hear the Prime Minister's words of begging for friendship. His resignation from the current cabinet is to express his distrust of the current government. (Reuters, 9th)

### Alexander Ends Debate

Finally, Labour Party's Alexander rose to end the debate, praising the work of the British troops who fought hard in the Nordic peninsula for four weeks, and then said that the reason why we are asking the government to change its plans and organization tonight is because we know that there is dissatisfaction with the government in various parts of the country regarding the British troops in Norway. Within two or three days after the troops returned from Norway, I received reports of inadequate equipment to cope with the battlefield situation and the lack of cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and sometimes even shells. Although the country has not been alarmed by the current serious situation, the people do expect that when the government sends troops to fight abroad for the country and freedom, it should send them in appropriate conditions as far as possible, doing its best to ensure that everything is in order, so that the hope of winning the war is not in doubt, and that the people understand the situation they are facing. The purpose of this is to make the people understand the situation they are facing. Most of the various documents that have been published, which make the people believe that everything is going smoothly, come from government personnel. Months ago, we did not expect that we would lose our food source from the Scandinavian Peninsula, or that we would soon encounter a situation where Dutch food would no longer be shipped to England for supply. We have been repeatedly deceived by public reports. What is the truth of the food problem now? We should inform the people with real facts and promote its organization based on real wartime economy. I am very disappointed with the information that the Prime Minister can give us now, and I am also dissatisfied with the explanations given by Hall and Stanley. I want to know what kind of information the government received about what Germany intended to do before the German invasion of Norway, and what preparations the government made to prevent the German invasion of Norway. (Reuters, 8th) (To be continued)

### British King Issues Military Service Notice

London The King of England today signed a notice ordering all British men within the borders of Britain who reach the age of nineteen on May 9th and are not yet thirty-seven, with some exceptions, to be called up for military service. It is estimated that over two and a half million people will be conscripted under this new notice. (Reuters, 9th)

### Roosevelt Denies Mediating European War, Pope Believes European War May Affect Other Countries, Italian Newspapers Continue to Attack Allied Military Attempts

Washington The White House issued a statement yesterday denying reports that the United States had offered to mediate the European war to the Italian Prime Minister. The statement said, "The White House absolutely denies the newspaper reports that President Roosevelt ordered the US Ambassador to Italy, Philip, to offer to mediate the European war to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. President Roosevelt believes that this news is completely wrong and has no basis." (United Press, 9th)

Rome Gaeda, the mouthpiece of Mussolini, wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday discussing the Gibraltar issue, saying that the Anglo-French control of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal violates the principles of European freedom and justice. If the Allies think that occupying Gibraltar and the Suez Canal can control the Mediterranean Sea, it is a major mistake. Recently, the authoritative newspaper "Messaggero" criticized the British for asking Italy to explain its true attitude towards the European war, and accused the Allies of trying to expand the war to the Mediterranean Sea to make up for their defeat in Norway. The newspaper said in an editorial, "Italy, as a non-belligerent country, does not need to obtain the satisfaction of Britain. The Italian people are satisfied, because they know their needs and support their leaders." The newspaper also discussed the possible expansion of the European war, saying that "the goal of this demonstration by Britain is very obvious. After the Allies were defeated in Norway and lost the iron ore in Northern Europe, they are now preparing to extend the scope of the war to the Balkans and the Near East to cut off Germany's oil supply and create unrest and terror." (United Press, 9th)

Vatican City The Pope recently gave a speech in a church where believers gathered, claiming that the European war may spread to a wider area, and urged all believers to pray sincerely for peace. The Pope also said that today's world is poisoned by infidelity and disbelief, and his face was full of sorrow and he could not help but sigh. (United Press, 8th)

Vatican City The Pope recently addressed thousands of newly married couples in the Vatican, mentioning the possibility of the European war affecting other countries, saying that if human power cannot now reverse the tide and immediately re-establish a just, faithful, and lasting peace, then people can still pray for God's intervention to unite their children in peace again. (Reuters, 9th)

Rome Italian newspapers' attacks on the Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" have become increasingly fierce. The "Fascist Regime" newspaper criticizes it harshly almost every day, and the "Tribune" has also joined the attack on "L'Osservatore Romano" because of its pro-Allied stance. Roman news vendors are now unwilling to sell the newspaper, so the number of people reading the newspaper here has been greatly reduced. (Haitong, 9th)

New York The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that "President Roosevelt had expressed to Prime Minister Mussolini his willingness to mediate the European war, but was rejected by Mussolini. Although his tone was euphemistic, his intention was extremely firm... At that time, the US Ambassador to Italy, Philip, handed over a letter handwritten by President Roosevelt to Prime Minister Mussolini. The content did not contain any special suggestions, only expressing his willingness to mediate, and that he would inform him in detail after Mussolini accepted it in principle. After reading the letter carefully, Mussolini said to Ambassador Philip that President Roosevelt's expression was extremely admirable, but unfortunately, under the current circumstances, it was difficult to find a basis for negotiation, and the time was not suitable for the appeasement movement. He would reply to President Roosevelt in his personal name. The next day, Foreign Minister Ciano handed over a reply to Ambassador Philip, confirming what the Prime Minister had said." (Havas, 9th)

### US Advises Nationals to Evacuate from Southeastern Europe, Hull Issues Public Announcement

Washington Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that he had issued a public announcement advising American nationals in the Balkan and Danube countries to evacuate. If a war breaks out there, the suffering of American nationals would be inexcusable. (United Press, 9th)

### Anniversary of Founding of Italian Empire, Mussolini's Speech

Rome Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Italian Empire. Crowds gathered in front of the Palazzo Venezia, cheering and paying tribute to Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister immediately appeared on the balcony and gave a short speech, saying, "May 9th is the day of our country's greatest victory. I am usually very silent, and I will never break the silence lightly unless there are facts. This should be regarded as normal by you." In addition, the Overseas Territories Exhibition recently opened in the port of Naples. King Emmanuel III personally presided over the opening ceremony. Crown Prince Bimon, Libyan Governor General Balbo, and former Commander-in-Chief of the East African Expeditionary Force De Bono were all at the station to greet the King. (Havas, 9th)

### Bulgarian Military Expert Discusses Black Sea Issue

Sofia British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Sofia for a week. On the day of his departure from Sofia, Colonel Gantchev, a famous Bulgarian military writer, published an article in the "Slovo" newspaper, discussing the intentions of the Allies. His article stated that after the Allies were defeated in Norway, they now want to blockade Germany in Southern Europe. However, there are three major obstacles to the Allies' plan: the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Italy. If the British fleet is not able to invade the Black Sea, then the plan to blockade Germany in Southern Europe will be impossible. Because Turkey does not want to offend the Soviet Union, it is difficult for it to tolerate the Allies invading the Black Sea. Italy is also of great importance in this regard. (Haitong, 9th)

### Situation in Netherlands Slightly Eases, Vigilance Still Undiminished

The Hague The tense situation in the Netherlands eased temporarily last night, but the military authorities' vigilance and defenses remain undiminished. Foreign observers estimate that the Netherlands has a total of 600,000 soldiers, pilots, and auxiliary personnel, ready to fight. The authorities seem to be taking nothing lightly. Flat avenues and other open spaces in the Netherlands have been made unusable as landing sites for troop transport aircraft where necessary. At the same time, the authorities are now searching for suspicious individuals. Soldiers were not allowed to take leave, but now they are allowed to do so. Several sections of electrified railway that were closed have now resumed service, which is evidence that the tense situation has eased. (Reuters, 9th)

The Hague The Soesterberg airfield near here is only allowed to be used by Dutch aircraft. Foreign commercial aircraft use the Eelde airfield near Groningen. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense announced that volunteers may also postpone enlistment if they have vocational needs. (Haitong, 9th)

The Hague The situation in the Netherlands is gradually becoming quieter. The government announced last night that the electric railways will resume their original schedules today, and all non-electric trains will resume their original schedules on May 10th. The Hague officials also announced that from May 10th, only Dutch aircraft will be allowed to dock at the Schiphol airfield outside Amsterdam, while foreign aircraft will dock at the Ypenburg airfield. (United Press, 9th)

The Hague Two German Nazi Party newspapers in the Dutch East Indies have been repeatedly reporting in violation of Dutch neutrality, and have been ordered to cease publication by the East Indies authorities. (Havas, 8th)

The Hague It has been rumored that an envoy from the German government, carrying a note in the nature of an ultimatum, has arrived in The Hague. This statement was denied by well-informed sources, who said that no one has submitted an ultimatum or a demand in the nature of an ultimatum to the Dutch government today. (Havas, 8th)

### British Foreign Secretary Meets Soviet Ambassador, Submits Response to Soviet Union, Asks for Explanation of Several Points

London Regarding the reopening of commercial negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union in order to sign a special commercial agreement, after the Soviet government submitted a note, Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the country's Ambassador to Britain Maisky at the Foreign Office this afternoon and handed over a reply. According to well-informed sources, several points in the Soviet note are not very clear. The British reply asks for clarification. Political figures say that Britain is unable to know exactly what the content of the German-Soviet commercial agreement is, so the Soviet Union must provide guarantees to Britain, declaring that after British goods are imported into the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will not directly resell them to Germany, nor will it use its own inventory to supply Germany, but will use British goods to replenish them. In addition, to what extent Britain must purchase goods from the Soviet Union in order to prevent Germany from obtaining supplies from the Soviet Union to continue the war is also not known to the British government and must be explained by the Soviet government. (Havas, 8th)

### Soviet Foreign Minister Meets Southern Economic Delegation

Moscow Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met yesterday with the Yugoslav economic delegation, and the talks lasted for three hours. The Yugoslav economic delegation includes Djovitch (the head of the delegation), Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Obela Dunavich, Deputy Governor of the National Bank Mikich, and Director of Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Pigenich. (TASS, 9th)

### German Advance in Northern Norway Obstructed, German Air Force Continues to Be Very Active

Stockholm, Sweden According to reliable sources, the German offensive in northern Norway has been thwarted due to the difficult terrain and the Norwegian army's resistance by relying on the terrain. Their offensive south of Mosjøen has also been unable to advance. The aid of the Anglo-French Allied forces to the Norwegian army has been very effective. (Havas, 9th)

Stockholm, Sweden The Norwegian General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that German troops repeatedly attacked our army at the foot of Mount Røgastinden. Our army repelled them with the help of aircraft and artillery and is now pursuing them victoriously. It is also reported that German troops have occupied all customs posts along the Norwegian border, except for one in Verdalen, which they occupied once and then retreated. (Havas, 8th)

Stockholm, Sweden According to the "Aftonbladet," order in Trondheim is gradually returning to normal. The food problem has been satisfactorily resolved with the cooperation of the German and Norwegian authorities. Workers are not allowed to leave their posts without special permission. Labor disputes have been resolved by the newly established arbitration court. Strikes are strictly prohibited. A special committee managing industry, commerce, banking, agriculture, and transportation has also been organized. (Haitong, 9th)

Paris French military officials claim that Allied troops continue to land in Norway and the fighting continues as normal. Contact has been made with German troops at various points in Narvik. Although the Germans resisted, they gradually retreated under the pressure of the Allied troops. Bad weather and difficult transportation are the reasons for the slow progress of the war. (Reuters, 9th)

Stockholm, Sweden Svenska Dagbladet reports that three or four German transport aircraft are constantly transporting reinforcements and supplies to northern Norway. German troops are also parachuting into the area north of Bardo (35 miles northeast of Narvik) in order to attack the Norwegian army from the rear. The German air force is increasingly active, constantly bombing the Allied forces, while small squadrons of British air force aircraft are also attacking German positions in Narvik. The entire railway from Narvik to the Swedish border is still in the hands of the German army. (Reuters, 9th)

Stockholm, Sweden The Norwegian Telegraph Agency recently issued a message stating that the Norwegian army, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, has repelled enemy troops in the Røgastinden mountains and the Græsdalen valley. (Havas, 9th)

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Gives Speech in Paris: "Norwegian Military Strength is Substantial, Germany Will Surely Bring About its Own Destruction"

Paris Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht recently told the press here that after meeting with key British and French military and political figures in London and Paris, he is convinced that the governments of those countries will do their best to promote the cooperation between the Allied forces and our military. It can be seen that the Norwegian war has become a part of the European war. Germany, having crossed the line, will surely bring about its own destruction. This is extremely important, because after the Allied forces defeat the German army in our country, its impact will make it easier to defeat Germany in the general situation. King Haakon VII and key government officials are still directing the war in the country. Envoys from various countries have also moved to safe locations with our government. Our military strength consists of six divisions, and the strength of the northern division has not been lost at all. As for the supply of troops, our government has already taken all necessary measures to stockpile food sufficient for one year. Not only that, but our government has also been purchasing military supplies from Britain, which have been transported to our country by several British merchant ships. (Havas, 9th)

### The Åland Islands Heavily Refortified

A dispatch from the correspondent of the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, states that Finland has heavily refortified the Åland Islands. The garrison has been increased from 500 to 3,000 personnel, accompanied by artillery units. It is rumored that this move has been tacitly approved by the Soviet Union, and the Swedish government has also expressed its support. The sole objective is to prevent attacks from third countries. Furthermore, the Finnish General Staff has announced that the waters surrounding the islands have been laid with mines, making navigation extremely dangerous. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### British Admiralty Announces Losses of Submarines and Fishing Vessels. Germany Releases Details of Bombing British Warships. French Newspaper Admits Damage to a Cruiser

London. The British Admiralty recently announced that during the Allied forces' withdrawal from Trondheim, six naval fishing vessels were lost. Two of them were sunk by air raids, and the remaining four were severely damaged in air raids and were deemed unsuitable for attempting to cross the North Sea.

Berlin. The German News Agency recently issued a detailed report on how German aircraft sank a British capital ship with a single bomb. It stated that a German reconnaissance plane discovered a large British escort fleet rapidly heading west off the Norwegian coast. After reporting to headquarters, fifteen aircraft were immediately dispatched. After flying for an hour over the North Sea, they sighted the enemy. A large naval fleet was advancing, clearly identifiable as heavy cruisers and capital ships, followed by escorted transport ships. At that time, the British ships detected the aircraft and immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. The squadron leader then sought the most advantageous position and directed each aircraft to begin bombing. One bomb hit a British capital ship, immediately causing thick black smoke to rise. This was followed by a thunderous explosion, clearly indicating a hit on an ammunition magazine. Consequently, flames soared into the sky, engulfing the entire ship, which sank within minutes. In addition, one heavy cruiser and one transport ship were also hit and caught fire. The squadron leader then issued a signal to return to base. All aircraft then climbed to high altitude and safely returned to their original base without any losses. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

### The European War Enters an Active Phase. Eden Delivers a Speech

London. Dominions Secretary Eden, at a banquet of the National Defence Public Awareness Committee today, delivered a speech, stating that the European war has now entered a new phase, which can almost be described as an active phase. Our country is prepared to make the necessary efforts to engage in a bitter struggle, even if it takes years. However, if we want to ensure victory, we must fulfill three main conditions: first, do not underestimate the enemy's strength; second, do not reduce the resources of the Empire, and must make full use of everything and every place; and third, conduct the war with the greatest courage and determination of the entire Empire.

### The Peace of the Pacific Depends on the Existence of China. Gu Weijun Speaks in Paris

Paris. The Pacific Problems Research Committee convened this morning, chaired by the famous French sinologist Paul Pelliot, to hear a speech by Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France. Dr. Gu stated that the Republic of China is not only the first republic in Asia but also the only republic in Asia, and has always advocated freedom of thought. Certain foreign theories are not acceptable to Chinese society. It is even more unimaginable for anyone to aspire to establish hegemony in the Far East. In short, the existence of China is sufficient to guarantee peace in the Pacific. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### British Opposition Labour Party Prepares for Annual Conference

London. The opposition Labour Party is scheduled to hold its annual conference on the 13th of this month in Bournemouth. At that time, the issue of whether the party should join the current cabinet will be discussed. All parties now support the inclusion of representatives from the Labour Party and the Liberal Party to form a unified national cabinet. This Labour Party Congress is therefore all the more important. Members of the House of Commons believe that increasing wartime production is an urgent task, so cooperation from the Labour Party is essential. However, it is not yet known whether Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to co-opt Labour leaders into the cabinet. Even if this were to happen, the Labour Party is likely to reject it based on its principle of non-cooperation with Chamberlain. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Chamberlain has only two options: one is to temporarily maintain the status quo with his current unreliable majority party, and the other is to step down in a timely manner. After all, Prime Minister Chamberlain can calmly choose what to do during the ten-day parliamentary recess. At the same time, the Labour Party can also take advantage of this annual conference to decide on its attitude. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Soviet-Hungarian Relations Have Improved

This transaction will be handled by Hungarian private companies and facilitated by the government. (United Press dispatch, 9th)

Budapest. The "Politikai Ujság" recently reported that it is rumored that the German authorities have requested the Hungarian authorities to allow German troops to transit through Hungary. This statement has been strongly denied by Hungarian officials, who said that those who made this statement have ulterior motives. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Japanese Side Again Attempts to Delay Restoration of Hongkou Police Authority, Using Court Issues as a Pretext. Shanghai West Special Police Force Also Indefinitely Postponed

According to reliable sources, the Japanese side is using the issue of the Special District Court as a pretext to refuse the Shanghai Municipal Council's recovery of police authority in the Hongkou E District. Stirling Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, denied yesterday that the Japanese side had included the condition that "civil and criminal cases of Hongkou residents shall not be handled by the Special District Court" in the negotiations on the return of police authority in Hongkou. However, he did not deny that the negotiations between the two sides have not yet yielded any results.

Hongkou Cases Still Referred to Special Court

According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, there are currently no difficulties in referring Chinese residents in the Hongkou District to the Special District Court. Some time ago, the Japanese side had established a "fake court" on Haining Road in Hongkou to handle cases involving Chinese residents within its sphere of influence. Although there is currently no indication as to whether the Shanghai Municipal Council will establish another agency in Hongkou to handle civil and criminal litigation cases in the Hongkou District after the Hongkou police negotiations are completed, the Chinese and foreign community will never allow it to happen.

Japanese Police Chief Has Arrived in Shanghai from Japan

The Japanese police chief of the Hongkou District, Furuya, recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan. Afterwards, he met with the Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Bourne, for discussions. According to the Japanese side, they hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will appoint Furuya as the police chief of the E District. At that time, the Japanese police officers under his jurisdiction from Jiaxing Road to Tiendong Road may also be confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

No Progress in Shanghai West Negotiations

According to Shanghai Municipal Council Commissioner of Police Bourne yesterday, regarding the negotiations on the establishment of the Shanghai West "Special Police," the Shanghai Municipal Council submitted its final proposal to the head of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Ying, last week, but has not yet received a response from the puppet side. The date for the next meeting has also not been set. It is heard that this proposal was drafted based on the results of the meeting between the two sides ten days ago. It is still difficult to predict whether the puppet side's response will satisfy the Shanghai Municipal Council in the future. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to step up supervision of this matter to ensure that the two sides can reach a final decision as soon as possible and realize its "Special Police" organization within the next month. As for the content of the negotiations between the two sides, Bourne believes that it is not yet time for official release, so he refuses to reveal the truth.

### Commemorating May Ninth Amidst Frequent Reports of Victory

Yesterday was the May Ninth National Humiliation Commemoration Day, which is the day in the fourth year of the Republic when Yuan Shikai, delusional of restoring the monarchy, violated the public trust of the nation and acknowledged the humiliating Twenty-One Demands. Yesterday, all sectors of the city voluntarily suspended entertainment banquets, and all Chinese radio stations also suspended broadcasting entertainment programs to show that they would not forget the national humiliation. At this time, the war of resistance has entered a favorable stage, and reports of victory are frequently received from the front lines. The goal of avenging the humiliation and strengthening the country is not far away. The citizens of the city, amidst somber commemoration, all embrace infinite enthusiasm.

### The Market Price of Coal Balls Drops Back to $8.50 Per Load Yesterday

Due to speculation, coal balls and raw coal dross were manipulated, resulting in a shortage of goods on the market. The ex-factory price of coal balls at Panmen even broke all previous records. Now, each of the large coal ball factories has separately launched the sale of cheap coal balls. Yesterday, the market was more stable, and the inventory of goods increased somewhat. For a time, the market price of various coal materials turned downstream, and the market price of coal balls fell by twelve yuan, opening at 164 yuan. Each load fell by nine cents, opening at 8.50 yuan. In addition, Yitai Xing Coal Ball Factory is scheduled to sell labor coal balls from the 11th to the 30th of this month, selling 60 loads of cheap coal balls every day, with a limit of 15 catties per person, totaling one yuan in national currency. The time is from 9:30 am every day until the quota is full. A total of five sales offices have been set up: (1) 380 Maigen Road, (2) 393 Aierjin Road, (3) 390 Lafaide Road, (4) 564 Xujiahui Road, (5) 358 Wenlin Road.

### Coal Dross Priced in US Dollars. Coal Industry Talks About the Reasons, Calling It Nothing Strange

The fact that the coal dross market is priced in US dollars has attracted attention from all walks of life. Because the change in the currency unit of raw materials is indirectly related to the daily life of citizens, according to the coal industry, "pricing in US dollars is indeed the case, but this specifically refers to coal companies ordering foreign coal from foreign companies such as Hongji India. Domestic coal materials and market transactions are still calculated in national currency. The changes in the currency system for ordering foreign coal were settled in national currency before the war. After 'August 13th,' they were changed to be priced in French francs. In March of last year, the unit was shillings. Since April 1st of this year, various foreign coal transactions have gradually adopted US dollar pricing. This change depends on changes in exchange rates and adapts to various factual needs. There is nothing strange about the decision." However, the inventory in this city is abundant, and it is the goods that were imported before the exchange rate changes. The excuse of increasing prices is obviously a smoke screen released by speculators.

### The French Municipal Council Decides to Stabilize Prices and Takes Concrete Steps. The Solution Can Be Announced Today. Acts in Concert with the Public Concession. Key Personnel from Both Concessions Attend the Meeting

This dramatic change in exchange rates has not only caused foreign goods, but also domestic products to uniformly raise their prices, which not only affects the livelihood of ordinary people, but also relates to local security. After research by the various subcommittees of the French Municipal Council's Equalization Committee, "it has been confirmed that the current situation has indeed reached the principles stipulated in Order No. 78 of the French Consulate General of February 19 this year. However, after confirmation that it is necessary, and if merchants are not satisfied with reasonable profits, then price limits should be set later." A concrete plan for stabilizing prices has already been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly for approval yesterday. It was decided to consult with the Public Concession Price Control Committee today and submit it to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Ochi, for approval, and to implement it publicly from today.

Meeting Situation

Yesterday's General Assembly started at 5 pm in the French Municipal Council on Xiafei Road. More than a dozen Chinese and French members were present. The Chinese members included Wan Molin, Zhao Zhiyou, Jin Zhixuan, Lu Gaoyi, Yao Zhongba, and others. Qi Zhi was unable to attend due to his trip to Hong Kong. J. Brediar, the director of the French Municipal Council, attended and discussed in detail the reports submitted by the three subcommittees and the concrete measures drafted to stabilize prices and crack down on hoarding and excessive profits. After two hours, the resolutions were passed and it was decided to send the passed cases to the Public Concession Price Control Committee today for consultation, and to submit them to French Consul General Ochi for approval. It is expected to be officially announced and implemented this afternoon. As for the establishment of food production and sales agencies proposed by Kui Yanfang, it was submitted to the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Price Control Committee, so it was not discussed at yesterday's meeting. However, it is understood that the committee attaches great importance to this suggestion.

Acting in Concert

A reporter from the Great China News Agency met with a member of the Equalization Committee yesterday. The reporter asked how imported rice and coal could be stabilized due to foreign exchange issues. It was said that this was a point that all the members present at the meeting had been thinking about and trying to solve. The committee is determined to overcome all difficulties and stabilize prices to alleviate the difficulties encountered by citizens. A member also expressed in a firm tone that he would never allow the Equalization Committee to become an empty organization or the price stabilization measures to become mere words. Because the current prices and their trends have made it impossible for the general public to bear them, forcing the Concession authorities to take concrete steps to crack down on manipulation and speculation. As for the detailed measures, they have now been drafted and will be translated into Chinese tonight and submitted to the Consul General for approval tomorrow, and to seek the consent of the Public Concession authorities. It is expected to be announced this afternoon. It is noted that the steps taken by the French Concession Equalization Food Committee in the past, in addition to forcing merchants to display the prices of daily necessities, have also announced average price lists for daily necessities to show price restrictions, and designated the Central, Baoxu, Beidang, Xiafei, Mailan, and Xiao Dongdou Five Police Stations to handle complaints. All events in which the public raises prices too high and the degree of quality on goods are fraudulent, can be accused to the above five places, but it is heard that there are not many cases received in the past, and merchants who have been unscrupulous have gone their own way. Yesterday's third general meeting decided to take further action.

Adjusting Grain Prices

According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee will meet at 4 pm today to discuss in detail the price adjustments of rice, flour, and general goods. British Chamber of Commerce President Marshall Shishi will chair the meeting, and West Committee members Wei Lai, Glen, Hongke, Hedanhaige, Chinese Committee member Li Wenjie, and Japanese Committee member Sugimura will attend the meeting. It is heard that the Special District Court of this city has also cooperated in cracking down on price increases, and there have recently been several cases of punishing profiteers.

State of Unease

Dalu News reported that, according to observers, since the devaluation of the French currency last week, the prices of food, rent, clothing, fuel, and other important commodities in the city have increased by ten to twenty-five percent, making the situation of the working class, which accounts for the vast majority of the population in Shanghai, increasingly dangerous and difficult to live on. If the wages of these people are not increased, it will be difficult to maintain their lives. Therefore, some factories have experienced labor disputes due to workers demanding wage increases. The price index of this city, with 1936 as the basic index of 100, has reached 473 for food, 349 for rent, 291 for clothing, 541 for fuel, which has increased the most, and 427 for miscellaneous items. The general index is on average as high as 453.

The above figures

Although not detailed, are sufficient to see the general picture of rising prices. According to observers in this city, the salaried class is now in a very difficult situation, so all parties believe that unless the authorities of various companies, agencies, and business firms can increase their salaries appropriately, it will be difficult to maintain their daily lives. According to investigations, several large factories are currently studying this issue, but according to general estimates, what factories can do for workers may only be to add some salary and rice subsidies. On average, the wages of Chinese workers have increased by about 50 percent since March 1938, but compared with the cost of living index, the extent of price increases is still minimal. Recently, the supply of pigs, chickens and ducks in Shanghai has also been in short supply. The original cows that could not supply the needs of this city in northern Jiangsu are said to have only sold three chickens on the market in the southern city on the 7th of this month, which is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee Holds Regular Meetings to Discuss the Plan to Reduce Government Expenses. The First Meeting is Scheduled for the 14th of This Month. Chairman Powell and Committee Members from All Countries Will Attend

After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee passed the expansion of the committee members from four to twelve at this year's tax meeting, it was announced by the consulates of various countries on the 2nd of this month. According to accurate information obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the first meeting of the committee has been scheduled for the afternoon of the 14th of this month to discuss the issue of reducing the Shanghai Municipal Council's administrative expenses and other general economic matters related to the bureau. At that time, British committee member Powell will chair the meeting, and committee members from all countries will attend on schedule.

The Financial Situation Has Become Stable

According to sources close to the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, the Bureau's $16 million public bonds were fully subscribed within three hours. Of this, $12 million was used to repay bank overdrafts, and the remaining funds were used as working capital. It also purchased 100,000 pounds of British gold a week before the black market shrank sharply, so the exchange rate difference for the Bureau's Western employees' foreign exchange will not be affected. The proposal to increase the municipal surtax by 51% was also passed at the tax meeting and will be implemented from July. In addition, administrative expenses were reduced, and many senior Western officials were dismissed. In particular, a number of senior Western officials were dismissed from the restructured Public Works Department, so the Bureau's financial situation has become greatly stabilized.

A Large Number of Western Employees Have Been Dismissed One After Another

As for the Bureau's efforts to save expenses, several senior Western officials have retired one after another, and the Public Works Department has been reorganized, and nine senior Western officials who were deemed unnecessary to continue were dismissed in the past two months. They include Senior Assistant Engineer Balingdun, Senior Assistant Real Estate Surveyor Fabolao, Engineer of Horse Power Widefei, Landscape Supervisor Keer, Senior Public Works Officer Tuomais, Assistant Naide, Heating Equipment Engineer Shiweiqufu Keji, Director of Civil Engineering Huazhen, Senior Assistant Engineer Jinssi, etc.

### The Dynamics of European Shipping are Closely Watched by All Parties

The Italian postal ship Conti Rosso, which loaded passengers and cargo in Italy at the beginning of last month and sailed to the Far East, arrived at the port at 5 pm yesterday and berthed at the Shuntai Wharf. This time, it carried 626 passengers, including many Jews and retired Chinese employees of German ships, as well as a large amount of cargo. Since the outbreak of the European War, the voyage of ships sailing from Europe to the Far East has been slow. Recently, as the war has intensified, the sailing time has become even longer. At this time of changing circumstances and uncertainty, the dynamics of European shipping are closely watched by all parties. In addition, it is widely rumored that British and French ships will change their routes or reduce the number of voyages. European ships, which have close commercial relations, have become the focus of the entire shipping industry.

### After Clarification from the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai Market Confidence Strengthens; Foreign Exchange Eases, Black Market Gold Continues to Decline, Public Bonds Stabilize, Financial Market Optimistic

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Banking and Money Trade Association, received official communication from Yang Jun of the Ministry of Finance, emphasizing the lack of restrictions on withdrawals, and the government's determination to maintain currency stability and financial security. Yesterday, they sent telegrams to various trade associations and banks and money houses to comply. A reporter from the "New Voice" news agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the British HSBC bank, which is listed on the foreign exchange black market, kept the exchange rate for British currency unchanged. The exchange rate for US currency shrank by 0.0625. Due to the ongoing maintenance by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, and because HSBC is supplying legitimate needs of various industries, the actual exchange market trend is upward. The price of gold on the black market has continued to fall, and the prices of various foreign currencies and foreign stocks have also declined. The prices of commodities such as rice, coal, and yarn have fallen back, but the unified public bonds in the securities market are trending upward, which is a sign of financial market stabilization.

Restricting the Flow of Legal Tender into Occupied Areas

In addition to restricting the supply of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market (not a complete stoppage, but rather to prevent Japanese purchasing), the government is also restricting residents of free areas of China from transporting legal tender into occupied areas. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Customs authorities have received instructions from the government that residents wishing to go to the occupied areas are only allowed to carry a maximum of 50 yuan in legal tender. Government measures on this matter were remembered to have been established earlier, with the only change being the amount of legal tender. It is said that the initial limit was 500 yuan, later reduced to 200 yuan, and now it has been reduced for the third time to 90 yuan.

Financial Newspaper Reports on Market Fluctuations

A recently published English financial and commercial newspaper stated that the foreign exchange market on Monday of last week appeared weak due to the emergence of those holding April futures. The British exchange rate reached 4 and 3/16 pence. HSBC absorbed at this exchange rate, but it is unknown whether it was on behalf of the Equalization Fund or for customers. Before the close of trading in the afternoon, and on Tuesday, April foreign exchange futures were fully settled.

Sellers Disappear

When there was a large demand for foreign exchange in commercial circles, the exchange rate tended to decline. On Tuesday evening, the Equalization Fund intervened to maintain the British exchange rate at 4 and 1/8 pence. On Tuesday, rumors intensified, because some Americans in the city wired Washington requesting the US government to lend money to China to maintain its currency, which further

Disturbed Public Sentiment

This move led some people to speculate that the Equalization Fund would soon be exhausted. This news was unfavorable to the foreign exchange market, but it should not be assumed that the Fund's subsequent cessation of foreign exchange supply was related to this news. There is absolutely no basis for the claim that the Equalization Fund is depleted. On the contrary, the Fund has at least two to three million pounds. However, we cannot forget that

The Equalization Fund

is not used to stop long-term adverse exchange rate trends. Its purpose is to prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange market. No exchange equalization fund can maintain a shrinking exchange rate caused by a long-term trade deficit. Last week, this publication reported that a banking conference was held in Hong Kong to discuss the issue of temporarily suspending the Fund's activities and allowing the legal tender to find its natural level. It was reported that the meeting concluded that maintaining the fixed price of 4 and 1/8 pence would only deplete the Fund. As a result, the bank responsible for balancing exchange rates in this city received a telegram from Hong Kong on Wednesday night to stop supplying.

### Japanese Side Praises the Valor of Chinese Soldiers; Three Chinese Soldiers Defended Their Position in the Battle of Suixian, Refusing to Leave, Putting Down Their Machine Guns and Preparing to Charge Out with Hand Grenades

The "Continental Daily" reported that a Japanese army spokesperson yesterday (the 8th) praised the valor of three young Chinese soldiers at a press conference. It was stated that the Japanese army had repeatedly encountered extremely brave Chinese soldiers. On the 4th of this month, a Japanese army unit advanced to a location ten kilometers south of Suixian, where they were blocked by gunfire from two fortresses. The Japanese army found it very difficult to capture the fortresses, and finally dispatched a "suicide squad" to bravely capture one of the fortresses. After the other fortress was destroyed by the Japanese army with the assistance of the engineer corps, it became silent. When the Japanese soldiers approached the destroyed fortress, they were very surprised, because the ones holding it were three young Chinese soldiers. Judging from the position of their bodies, it was clear that they had just put down their machine guns and were preparing to charge out with hand grenades. The Japanese soldiers were "deeply moved" by their bravery in combat.

### Foreign Nationals in This City Bring Forward Working Hours; Promoting the So-Called Daylight Saving Time

Foreign nationals in this city are currently promoting "Summer Time," also known as "Daylight Saving Time," which involves starting work an hour earlier during the summer, generally from May 1st to the end of September, so that they can have more daylight leisure time after finishing work in the afternoon. Many Chinese and foreign commercial firms in Shanghai have already implemented this by bringing forward their office hours by one hour. Similarly, the embassy district in Dongjiaomin Lane in Beijing and Tianjin have also implemented it. Several major cities in the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Ireland, and other countries have also adopted "Summer Time." The benefit is that the morning temperatures are cooler when leaving home for work in the summer, and it is not yet dusk after finishing work, allowing for beneficial outdoor exercise. In addition, commercial firms can also save on electricity bills.

### New US Consul General in Shanghai Arrives Yesterday

About to go to the US

The newly appointed US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the US transport ship Henderson at 2 PM from Qinhuangdao. The ship was berthed at floating pontoons 12 and 13. According to Mr. Lockhart, he will leave Shanghai aboard the President Taft to attend his son's graduation ceremony at Princeton University, and then is scheduled to return to Shanghai in September to assume his duties.

### Postal Workers Request Increase in Allowances

Already Requested to the Postmaster General

The entire staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration requested on the 20th of last month to the authorities to uniformly change their living allowances to 50 yuan, along with requests for coal briquette and vegetable oil allowances, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, soaring prices, and difficult living conditions. The authorities indicated that they would consider increasing allowances after postage rates were increased. However, because the postage rate increase did not materialize, the entire staff felt that increasing allowances was becoming increasingly remote. However, in the current situation of soaring prices, it is difficult to maintain living standards with their current salaries. Although they currently receive rice subsidies and living allowances each month, the amounts are limited and do not provide much relief. Therefore, yesterday, the entire staff submitted a letter to Postmaster General Chapelin, requesting a uniform increase of 60 yuan in living allowances, and also telegraphed the Kunming General Administration. They also requested Mr. Chapelin to provide one month's allowance in advance to alleviate their immediate needs before receiving a reply from Kunming. It is reported that the authorities are considering this request.

### Coinage Panic Completely Resolved

The Shanghai Banking Association, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, issued aluminum one-cent and five-cent coins with a total value of 50 million coins, equally divided between one-cent and five-cent coins, totaling 1.5 million national currency. These were minted by the American Arctic Company and shipped to Shanghai in batches for distribution. In addition to the first two batches already issued, the third batch of 5 million coins has also arrived in Shanghai for distribution, managed by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, the Joint Reserve Depository of Money Houses, and HSBC for distribution to member banks for circulation in the market. Subsequent batches will continue to be shipped to Shanghai and distributed as needed. As for the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, it was specially authorized by the former Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes with a total value of 7 million national currency. 3.5 million, printed by the American Yongduo Company and already issued in batches, are now widely circulating in the Shanghai market. After this, future batches will be issued as needed depending on market demand. As a result, the coinage shortage panic in the Shanghai market has been completely resolved. The premium for exchanging coins at small money houses has been automatically canceled. Furthermore, the value vouchers issued by the Shanghai Electric Military Company, the French Tram Company, and public buses have been continuously withdrawn.

### Noodle Price Limited to 28 Cents per Jin

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, in compliance with the authorities' instructions to sell affordable noodles, held a meeting of the entire executive and supervisory committee at the Tongle Tea Garden on Zhejiang Road at 3 PM yesterday. The following resolutions were made: (1) Request flour mills and flour merchants not to deliberately raise prices to benefit the people's food supply; (2) The retail and wholesale price of noodles will remain at the original price of 28 cents per city jin, complying with the authorities' advice not to raise prices; (3) Investigate the retail prices of flour merchants, and report any price increases to the authorities for sanctions; (4) Request flour merchants to publicly display prices and not engage in illegal private transactions.

Japanese Control

The weather this spring is fine, and there is hope for a good harvest of spring crops. The earliest new wheat will be available on the market at the end of the month. Therefore, local Chinese flour mills, grain merchants, and others are preparing to send people to the production areas to purchase wheat. However, according to those close to the industry, someone has harsh plans to implement control over flour and wheat in the near future.

Flour Merchants Worried

Chinese commercial firms and factories have always relied on imported foreign wheat for pricing, but the sharp contraction of foreign exchange has increased the price by 75%. A small amount of unsettled payments has already resulted in huge losses. They are planning to shift to local wheat to reduce losses. Now that there is a move to control, they not only have no interest in sending people to purchase wheat amidst the double pressure of internal and external troubles, but they also have concerns about not being able to maintain their original business.

### French Public Bus Prices to Increase Starting Today

The French Public Bus Company, due to the recent soaring costs, has specially increased the prices of vehicles on all routes. It is understood that the company is scheduled to officially announce the price increase today (the 10th), raising fares at all stops.

### British Ships Strengthen Military Equipment; Implementing Embarkation Restrictions; Embarkation Prohibited Except for Passengers and Cargo Passengers; Both Taikoo and Jardine Shipping Companies Comply

Since the outbreak of the European war, British shipping companies sailing to the Far East have been ordered to add armaments to all large and small ships for self-defense, in order to avoid attacks by enemy warships. Yesterday, according to shipping industry sources, the British naval authorities have previously strengthened the British ship's armed self-defense capabilities, and are now sending personnel to inspect the armaments of each ship. If necessary, they plan to strengthen its military equipment to achieve thoroughness, or stipulate that the equipment of armed merchant ships is a military secret, and no one may disclose the content of the armed equipment. At the same time, for precautionary purposes, the major merchant shipping companies are instructed to implement wartime restrictions on personnel boarding merchant ships. When ships are berthed, boarding should be prohibited except for passengers and cargo passengers. It is reported that both Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies have complied, and have issued notices that boarding is not allowed on any ships belonging to the company except for passengers and cargo passengers.

### Child Traffickers Given Heavy Sentences Separately; Each Sentenced to More Than Ten Years Imprisonment and Fines; French Police Also Transferred for Investigation and Prosecution

Yang Xin, a detective from the Jiaxing Road police station, and detective Zhang Decai, previously uncovered a large-scale human trafficking operation at Fuxinxiang Grocery Store, No. 355 Baoding Road, Hongkou, and arrested ten men and women, including Ling Rongsen and Ling Zhangshi. They recovered two abducted children, Zhang Dingkang and Chuan Bingkui, along with more than a hundred pieces of children's clothing, shoes, hats, photos, and other items, and brought them to the police station. It was discovered that these people had committed

More than a Hundred Trafficking Cases

within the boundary, and the abducted children were all under the age of ten, mostly sold to Xiamen and Fuzhou. Under these special circumstances, the police station was unable to go out to investigate. Now, more than fifty pieces of clothing have been recognized by their owners. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting according to the criminal law for repeated offenses, also requested that the defendants be given the maximum penalty for the heinous nature of the cases. After several rounds of interrogation and debate, Xiao Peishen, a judge, took the seat in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning and announced the verdict: Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Li Fu, Wang Wushi, and Zhuge Qianshi, continuously and jointly

Intended to Profit

By abducting males under the age of sixteen and separating them from their families, each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 1,500 yuan each. Lu Wenzhong and Zhuge Chun, each sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 800 yuan each. Cui Tengshi sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 800 yuan. The fine can be converted to labor service at a rate of six months per amount. Wang Zhangshi is innocent, and the recognized clothing will be returned after the verdict is confirmed. After the sentencing, the judge announced to the defendants, "The cases you have committed are

Extremely Heinous

and there is no leniency under the law. Therefore, you should be given the maximum penalty to serve as a warning." Regarding the civil part, the defendants were ordered to return the abducted people to the plaintiffs. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that he would waive the appeal for the innocent part of Wang Zhangshi. Subsequently, Yan Jinwen, a detective from the Criminal Division of the French Police, submitted a public document to the Second Special Court, stating that the defendants had committed many similar cases in the French Concession and requested permission for extradition. The court deliberated that the nine defendants, including Ling Rongsen, be handed over to the French Police officers, along with Wang Zhangshi. The clothing and photos should be

Transferred for Verification

After the announcement, the defendants were taken away by the detectives separately. However, the family members of the abducted children, totaling dozens, mostly women, were present in court. Among them were widows and women in their fifties, whose children were abducted and could not be found. They all held deep hatred. When the defendants were taken out of the courtroom, they surrounded each other, hitting and kicking, wishing they could devour them alive.

### Second Special District Court Under Special Security Yesterday; Unprecedented Strict Security; Rumor Has It That Threats Were Received in Advance

The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, located at the intersection of Yu Jia Lane, Xue Hua Li Road, and Ma Dang Road in the French Concession, suddenly increased security measures from 8 AM yesterday. In addition to detectives from the police station being stationed to protect the premises, French judicial police officers, along with Chinese judicial police, were stationed outside the main entrance and side entrances, as well as at all entrances and exits, under the command of the French judicial police officers. For the parties to the lawsuit, only those with summonses were allowed to enter the court to report. Those requesting to attend the hearing and the parties who did not hold summonses were not allowed to enter. However, those holding long-term listening permits were an exception. Furthermore, the staff and lawyers of the two courts were also required to show their badges to enter and exit. The sudden increase in security measures was rare and unprecedented since the start of the war. According to rumors, the reason for the special increase in security measures by the two courts was that the court authorities received threats, so special security measures were implemented for protection. It was also reported that the two courts notified the police station to send additional detectives to provide special protection for all staff.

### Westerner Returns to Shanghai Discussing European War and Far East Commerce; Observations on Future Air and Sea Battle

It has been several months since the so-called Second European War broke out. We have seen information from both the Allies and Germany, and we can get a clearer picture of the progress of the war. But how exactly will this large-scale war in Europe progress? As the war drags on day by day, what will be the future of the Far East? These questions seem worthy of our study. Before we speculate, we should know that the so-called large-scale decisive battle, in terms of the naval and air forces of Britain, France, and Germany, will inevitably involve fierce naval and air battles as a measure of the strength of both sides. As for the relationship with the Far East, as it stands now, foreign exchange fluctuations, international trade—especially changes related to China—are all significantly related. Yesterday, a reporter met a Westerner who had just returned to Shanghai from Europe. He has lived in Shanghai for a long time and runs a large business. According to him, China's foreign market has not been adversely affected by China's resistance war. On the contrary, due to the needs of foreign markets and the efforts of the Chinese people, the export side has a considerable advantage. As for the fluctuations in foreign exchange, there is certainly more than one reason, but according to his personal observation, since the Chinese government is determined to maintain it, and the situation of the resistance war is moving in a favorable direction, there should be no accidents. This is something that all knowledgeable people should recognize, so this Westerner's views are mostly very optimistic!

The reporter also asked him about the current situation of the European war and his observations on future air and sea battles, which are detailed as follows:

Since the outbreak of the Western European war, a crisis has been lurking everywhere in continental Europe, with every place preparing to explode. In general, people feel that if peace cannot be established quickly, the war will inevitably expand. In the past few months, not only Western European countries like Belgium and the Netherlands, but also Southeastern European countries like Romania have been in a state of anxiety and turmoil, and countries in the Near East have also found it difficult to sleep soundly. Recently, Germany's battle line has not taken the southeast direction, but has gone northwest, which seems somewhat unexpected. Instead of driving its mechanized troops into Hungary or Romania, it used its navy, which is far inferior to the British and French Allied forces, to attack the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe, occupying Denmark in 24 hours and landing at several important seaports along the coast of Norway. After analyzing this sudden move, we can find two reasons: First, its abandonment of the southeast plant is unwilling to lose the friendship of the Soviet Union and Italy; second, its occupation of Northern Europe can directly threaten northern Britain and the British Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.

So far in the Northern European war, Allied troops have quickly landed in Norway to stop the German advance and have achieved some results. In fact, because the Allied forces did not obtain airfields in Norway that could be used by fighter planes, the German army was able to exert its air power to prevent the advance of Allied reinforcements. Germany has already paid a considerable price to gain a slight advantage, and the Allies have avoided temporary losses and made plans to temporarily withdraw troops from the Trondheim area of Norway, which has indeed shown agile and flexible tactics. After this, the tightening of the British blockade in the North Sea and the seeking of new military developments in Norway are of course inevitable. The state of Northern Europe in the past few weeks is just a ripple in the course of the war and cannot be used as any argument. The British and French Allied forces will certainly continue to use their superior naval power to fight, and the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits will be the battlefield for air and sea battles between the two sides. In the future, large-scale air and sea battles will inevitably occur continuously. So, let's take a look at the strength of both sides. (To be continued)

### Xiangtai Timber Yard Labor Dispute; Worker Arrested for Assault; Six Offenders Escorted to Court Yesterday for Interrogation and Detention

At 8:45 AM on the 8th, at the Yangshupu Road 1426, the Chinese-owned Xiangtai Timber Yard, sawyers elected a representative, Li Fengqi from Shandong, to request increased wages and rice subsidies from the Western manager, but he was unsuccessful. They blamed Li for failing to help, made threatening remarks, and were beaten on the head with iron bars and hammers, resulting in severe injuries and death after some time. Details of the situation have been recorded in this newspaper. Subsequently, detectives Shen Defu, Ji Xiucheng, and Jin Wanrong from the Yangshupu police station, along with Western detectives, rushed to the timber yard,

Apprehended the Murderer

and a total of twenty-five suspects and workers. After questioning those who were not involved, the six suspected workers, Wang Sheng, from Shandong, Liang Shitai, Yin Chengzong, Liang Shiji, Ding Fugui from Jiangbei, and Wang Yide, were arrested, along with the iron bars and iron hammers used as weapons, and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and police station lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution against the defendants for murder,

Stating that, according to investigation, between the 23rd of last month, they gathered and discussed the matter at No. 9 Meizhou Road (i.e., the home of the defendant Liang Shitai). A letter was written by a Mr. Xia, requesting the foreign manager to increase wages, because the prices of rice, noodles, and other items had soared recently. Later, they entrusted the deceased Li Fengqi to represent them and talk to the foreign manager, but it was unsuccessful. They used savage means to beat him to death. Please postpone this case for further investigation. It was found that the defendants Wang Sheng, Yin Chengzong, Liang Shitai, and Ding Fugui, at the time of the murder,

Beating the Deceased the Most Violently

Wang and Liang had blood stains on their short shirts and pants, which they later changed at home. According to Song Yougen from Yongbo and Wang Guisheng from Changzhou, who were contracted to sell firewood and timber at the timber yard, when they entered the yard to do business, the defendants, numbering dozens, prevented them from entering, leading to a conflict. They pointed to the defendants Wang Sheng, Liang Shitai, and Ding Fugui, who used iron bars and water pipes to beat them violently, causing injuries to their heads, backs, and legs.

All Suffered Serious Injuries

They are currently being treated at Shanghai East Hospital. The doctor applied medicine and bandaged their heads before they testified, stating that the defendants Wang, Liang, and Ding were barbaric and rude, and should not have violently beaten them for no reason, requesting prosecution. The defendants insisted that the deceased Li Fengqi favored the Western manager and suppressed them with threatening words. The rest of the testimony was evasive, seeking leniency. Judge Liu Yugui ordered them to be detained and postponed the hearing for further investigation.

### Robbery Case on Jixiang Street; Two Robbers Apprehended; All Stolen Foreign Currency Recovered

Yesterday morning (the 9th) at 8:15 AM, two merchants were discussing business in room 36 of the Jinjiang Hostel on Xingsheng Street when two robbers suddenly broke in. One of them was armed with a pistol and tied one of the merchants to a chair, robbing them of a total of 552 yuan in legal tender and a gold ring. As they fled out the door with the loot, they were spotted by a passerby, who shouted "Robbery!" At that time, a Sikh police officer heard the alarm and fired two shots at the robbers, but both missed. At the same time, he blew his whistle. The robbers also fired several shots. Sergeant Ma Mengtuofu, No. 287 of the French Police, and Patrolman No. 1019 happened to be patrolling the area and rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. They saw the robbers running east along Gongguan Road and followed them, chasing them to the intersection of Jixiang Street. At that time, Chinese Police Officer No. 1014 fired a shot at the robber, hitting him in the leg. At this time, a Russian named Que Banoff happened to be passing by and bravely captured the robber. The other robber was captured by Chinese Police Officer No. 631 and Patrolman No. 188 at the corner of Gongguan Road and Jixiang Street. The robbers and the stolen goods were taken to the police station. The pistol carried by the robbers still had five bullets in it. After strict interrogation, the robbers confessed that the pistol was supplied by a Mr. Jin, who lived at No. 7 Kangji Lane, Malan Road. Detectives were sent to arrest Mr. Jin, who admitted to providing the firearms without denying it. The robbers will be escorted to the court for trial today.

She was taken to the police station, and yesterday she was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and prosecuted according to law. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated her and ordered her to be detained for sentencing on the 14th.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Tend to Ease

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates plummet. The city's U.S. dollar exchange rate continued to be listed at 0.625 lower, while the British pound exchange rate remained unchanged. The domestic market saw more supply than demand, and the easing trend gradually expanded. Operators' paces were uneven, with sudden entries and exits, but there were no significant reactions. Initially, due to exports selling and Sassoon foreign firms selling, the market was hard. Foreign firms and speculators absorbed it, and it once turned flat, but the noon closing was still consistently higher. The initial situation in the after-market showed no rise or fall. Later, news came that Germany had attacked the Netherlands, and the war was intensifying, and people's minds changed again, and sellers hesitated, so the exchange rate slightly tightened, but the result was still loose and hard. The British gold was 3 shillings 468875, and the U.S. dollar was 4.8125 yuan, both up 125 from yesterday's closing. The futures trend was the same as the spot market, with a slightly closer distance.

Sassoon also made sales.

In the early morning, London's large bills, both near and far, fell 125. New York's silver price remained flat, London's raw gold remained stagnant, the British pound against the U.S. dollar was unchanged, against Shanghai it was up 0.625, against France it was unchanged, the U.S. dollar against the British pound was down 4.75, against Shanghai it was up 5 points, and against France it was down 2.5 points. The Central Bank's listed prices remained the same. The bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings 34375 for British gold and 4.625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, with the British pound flat and the U.S. dollar tighter at 0.625 compared to last night's close, due to the continued sharp decline in exchange rates. After opening, exporters first sold spot U.S. dollars to foreign firms at 4.6875 yuan, up to 75 yuan, so the market was already flat and hard. At the same time, foreign firms sold spot British gold to speculators at 3 shillings 34375. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar listed at 0.625 softer. The silver balance tax was announced, reducing it by one yuan. After this, due to Sassoon and others all intending to sell, supply exceeded demand. At around 10:30 AM, the May U.S. dollar was trading at 4.65625 yuan. The spot U.S. dollar was sold by foreign firms for 4.75 yuan. Around 10:30 AM, foreign firms and speculators slightly bought in, and the market turned stable. It is estimated that foreign firms absorbed the spot U.S. dollar at 4.6875 yuan, and speculators bought the May U.S. dollar at 4.625 yuan from Chinese banks. It was heard that the June British gold was once traded, with Hong Kong Telecom selling it to foreign firms for 3 shillings 21875, but the transaction volume was not large. Until noon, speculators suddenly bought, and the situation became hardened again. The May British gold traded from 3 shillings 375 to 40625, so the closing result was that both futures and spot prices were rolled over and eased. Spot British gold was 3 shillings 46875, and the U.S. dollar was announced at 4.8125 yuan, both up 125.

Chinese merchants had quite a bit of supply.

After the afternoon opening, it was flat at first, but later it was heard that there would be trading in June, with foreign firms selling June British gold to fellow firms for 3 shillings 12875, and Hong Kong Telecom buying June U.S. dollars from foreign firms for 4.4375 yuan. Subsequently, news came that German troops had attacked the Netherlands, and sellers stopped selling, and the situation weakened. The current U.S. dollar is now at 4.78125 yuan, but Chinese merchants are supplying very well. As a result, at the close, British gold was still 3 shillings 46875, and the U.S. dollar was 4.8125 yuan. The May British gold was 3 shillings 40625, and the U.S. dollar was 4.6875 yuan. Compared with the previous day's close, spot British and U.S. dollars were both up 125. This month, British was loose by 15625, and U.S. hard by 1875.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable

Hong Kong, 9th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. British and Shanghai exchange rates were unchanged. The spot U.S. dollar was tight at 25, at 20.5625 yuan.

At 2:30 PM, the market opened steadily, and the spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped another 3 yuan, to 422 yuan. The rest showed no change.

Tianjin British and American Continue to Rise

The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 1.5 yuan, to 112 yuan. The "United Notes" on the gray market were unchanged, still standing at 101 yuan.

### Amid Exit Rumors, Gold Prices Plummet Again - Lowest Seen at 6,820 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold market was in a slump throughout the day. The reason was that the exchange market continued to harden, and buying interest in the market subsided. Although securities firms once boosted prices, the amount was small and ineffective, and the downward trend was difficult to reverse. In the morning, it plummeted by 40 yuan, and before a moment had passed, money changers and banks competed to sell, and the price was pressed down to 6,880 yuan. Fortunately, securities firms frequently bought in at this price, causing it to recover by 30 yuan. However, many floating speculators, seeing the high price of 19, had the intention to exit, and at that time, the foreign exchange rate was still rising, and gold firms were also selling, causing the price to fall back to 6,840 yuan. The noon closing was 6,860 yuan. The initial situation in the after-market remained depressed. Retail investors sold in groups, and it fell to 6,820 yuan. Suddenly, news came that Germany had invaded the Netherlands, and the exchange market temporarily softened, stimulating buying interest. Gold firms and retail investors competed to buy, and the price rose to a peak of 6,940 yuan. Before the close, it was suppressed again by many military bulls and retail investors who closed out their positions. As a result, it closed at 6,879 yuan, continuing to recover slightly by 81 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was strong and clear throughout the day, with over 3,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold also fell by a small 10 yuan, and customs gold and other gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Falls Again by 81 Yuan

Since this morning, every bar (ten taels), the initial opening exchange rate reported a drop, and the U.S. dollar was tight, but it soon eased back, so it failed to stimulate people's hearts. On the contrary, there were quite a few who shouted to sell, and the market was pressed down by 40 yuan as soon as it opened. A gold firm did 20 taels, inferior to 6,920 yuan. Later, a certain money changer and a certain bank competed to sell, and the capital position became even more abundant, and it continued to fall by 40 yuan. A bank sold 10 taels of securities, at 6,880 yuan. Then, the number of sellers decreased, and securities and a certain bank saw it as low and bought in, and it rose by 30 yuan. Banks mutually did 50 taels, at 6,910 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was still loose and flat, the selling wind rose again, and a certain bank sold again, and the trend went downward again. After retreating into the 6,900 yuan mark, the exchange market continued to harden, and gold firms and retail investors also sold, and the market became even more tired. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a bank, at 6,840 yuan. Near the close, the floating selling wind had subsided, and it was slightly recovered. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold firm, at 6,860 yuan as the noon closing price. At the noon trading hour, people's hearts were tired, and it fell by a small 20 yuan as soon as it opened. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a securities firm, at 6,840 yuan. Later, a bank sold, and it was seen to fall by a small 20 yuan. A money changer sold 10 taels to a securities firm, at 820 yuan. Later, the banks saw it was cheap and bought in, and the market turned stable. Unexpectedly, at this time, rumors spread that the German army had invaded the Netherlands, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft. At one time, the buying wind expanded sharply, and gold firms competed to absorb it, and it rose by 120 yuan. Gold firms mutually did 10 taels, at 6,940 yuan. After entering, the number of buyers gradually decreased, and many retail investors took advantage of the high profits and sold, and it fell back. Moreover, the exchange market turned stable, and there were few people who entered, and it immediately retreated into the 6,900 yuan mark. Banks mutually did 30 taels, at 6,865 yuan. Near the close, gold firms slightly came to absorb, and it rose again by 14 yuan. Gold firms mutually did 20 taels, at 6,879 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 81 yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day was up and down by 120 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold from the gold firms was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both rarely traded.

Jewelry Gold Changed to Listing at 700 Yuan

The initial price of jewelry gold per tael sold by silver shops was still 710 yuan for Datonghang. Until 9:30, it was listed at 10 yuan lower. At 2:00 PM, it continued to drop by 5 yuan. At 2:45 PM, it rose back by 5 yuan. As a result, it was listed at 10 yuan lower. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to listing at 700 yuan. The new same-trades were the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan.

### Exchange Draft Discount Rate Drops Again

Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate fell even more sharply. For every 1,000 yuan, it fell from 150 yuan to 120 yuan in the morning, 125 yuan at noon, and the smallest was 115 yuan in the afternoon, and finally it was 120 yuan, 25 yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate of the money-shop association remained unchanged, and it was listed at 2.5 cents in both the morning and noon markets.

### Foreign Currency Falling Trend Intensifies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a smooth supply of British and American gold pounds due to the continued downward trend in gold prices. The market price of British gold notes fell due to the loosening trend of the black market British exchange rate. The price of American notes initially rose slightly to 21.20 yuan, and then gradually fell again. In the evening market, it retreated to 20.55 yuan, resulting in a fall of 45 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes still followed the downward trend of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. French franc notes and Annam notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price managed to stabilize. Dutch notes did not rise due to HSBC's reduced listing. Canadian notes and Philippine notes also showed a softening trend. The Japanese gold note showed a slightly rising trend, and the evening market was 1.28 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was slightly strong, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan.

### Securities - Wheelock Marden Stock - Fluctuations Quite Large - Domestic Prices Gradually Arousing Interest

Securities gray market: Yesterday's market gradually trended firmer. Because gold prices retreated, foreign exchange was prolonged, and the premium greatly decreased, people's confidence was somewhat stabilized, and buyers felt a slight interest. The market was not short of new bulls and short-covering transactions, especially retail investors with 5,000 to 10,000 shares were enthusiastic. Most were speculative in nature, with temporary short-term transactions. Switching buying and selling was also quite active. In the morning, Hong Kong and United Coal Mines sold Ding and bought Bing shares. Jiu Fu and Song Mao took the opportunity to buy Ding shares. Le Mao and Hu He Ji bought in. Tong Ji had considerable supply and demand, and the market price was relatively stable. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng, Yi Chang, Xie Da, and Shun Kang successively sold out. Ding Kang, Lian He, Yong Feng, Tong Shun, and Lian Yi successively bought in. Demand exceeded supply, and the price rose slightly by twenty cents. As a result, the price consistently rose again by fifteen to thirty-five cents. The transaction volume was seven to eight hundred thousand yuan. A simple summary table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of $72.00.

The overall stock market opened sluggish. Transactions were sparse in the first hour. Not until the last hour before noon did sentiment slightly improve, and trading volume increased accordingly. The afternoon market was more active, and the closing potential was also stable. Wheelock Marden had the largest fluctuations. Ex-rights shares traded from $116 to $123, and new rights shares from $84 to $89.50. The closing prices were $119 and $88, respectively. Shanghai Silver Company saw a slightly stimulating scene. The opening price was $37, and after opening, it continued to rise, reaching a new high of $41. The closing price was $39 bid. Its trading volume increased sharply from 7,000 shares the previous day to 29,000 shares. This was caused by rumors of a "very fat" dividend to be issued. International stocks were also affected, and the price was pushed to above $38, an increase of approximately $2 compared to the previous day. Jardine Matheson and Steel Corporation, on the contrary, continued to report downstream. The two stocks fell by the same amount as on Wednesday.

Rubber stocks, disregarding the recent rise in raw rubber prices worldwide, continued to soften. Although industrial stocks rebounded later, there was no response, which was truly an anomaly. The only reason was likely the tense situation near the German-Dutch border and the lack of faith of the Dutch in Nazi intentions. Generally nervous individuals also harbored suspicion and doubt about the future status of the Dutch East Indies. Considering the sharper drop in shares of rubber companies in Dutch Java, this speculation is likely not unfounded. As mentioned in the previous advertisement notice, the same stock market trading will continue until noon tomorrow (Friday). There will be no market in the afternoon. Trading will resume as usual on Monday morning. Although that day is a general bank holiday in England, it does not apply here.

London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of British company stocks in the Far East: HSBC shares rose one pound each, with a price of £92. Gulangsu Rubber shares rose three pence, with a price of 18 shillings and 6 pence. Security Insurance shares fell one pound, with a price of £28. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in any of the bonds up or down.

### Yarn and Cotton - Exchange Prolonged - Yarn Market Weakens Daily - Coupled with Sluggish Actual Sales - Bull Covering Increasingly Abundant

The yarn market continued to weaken. This was because there were few spot yarn transactions. Furthermore, after rising for many consecutive days, the market became sluggish, causing floating bulls to cut and close positions, and the market declined.

The spot yarn market opened flat in the morning. The price of 20-count Double Horse factory yarn was $1,610, down $30. Soon, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had slightly contracted, and buyers were again enthusiastic, pushing the price up to $1,740. Afterwards, it was heard that the exchange rate had turned longer and spot sales were sluggish. Bulls closed positions, and market prices gradually weakened to $1,608. It was found that the total transaction volume during the day was 1,225 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by $37. Today, 160 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Fellow merchants: 125 Hong Kong: 100

Ningbo: 5 Xiamen: 5

Total: 1,225

### Money Market Extraordinarily Tight - Cotton Sales Difficult to Develop

Transactions in local cotton are still sustainable. Trading among fellow merchants continues unabated. Factories and Chinese merchants have some demand, so people's confidence is stable. The current situation of spot cotton is listed below:

286.00

Omra 28.00 Fellow Merchants maintain 500 pieces

285.00

Yuheng 286.00 Fellow Merchants import 250 pieces

Mitelin 334.00 Chengfu imports 500 pieces

American Cotton 300.00 Xinyu imports 148 bales

Machine Cotton 232.75 Fellow Merchants import 120 bales

Mexican Cotton 144.00 Fellow Merchants import 250 bales

Mitelin 335.00 Fellow Merchants import 200 pieces

Another dispatch: Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was more active yesterday, with some transactions. Later, a small amount of short covering occurred. As a result, the closing price rose two points compared to the previous day. In India, because Far East transactions were light, yesterday's transportation forecast fell again by two rupees. Egyptian cotton rose 35 points.

There were many inquiries about foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, but few transactions were completed. Only the Tianjin gang purchased, limited to spot transactions. Ultimately, due to the extraordinarily tight money market, transactions could not be greatly expanded. The cotton market prices yesterday, converted at a factory delivery price of $4.6875 per US dollar, are as follows:

20-count American Mitelin 377.50

20-count also Lower Grade 363.20

32-count also 392.50

32-count also Lower Grade 381.10

42-count also 405.60

42-count also Lower Grade 390.70

### Grains - Extremes Must Revert - Imported Rice Sales Booming Then Stagnating - Prices Have Sharply Fallen by Six Yuan

The rice market continued to decline. The prices of various imported rice fell by about one yuan. The lowest price of Small Sieve rice once reached $46, a sharp drop of six yuan from the peak of $52. People's confidence has also become stagnant. It is not easy for both buyers and sellers to be energized for a while, resulting in a situation of booming sales then stagnation. Moreover, the association is striving to crack down on short selling and buying, and has set a deadline for delivery. It has been decided that all transactions completed from today onwards must be cleared within five days. Speculators have suddenly lost their support and are eager to clear procedures, and their thoughts of trading have disappeared. Prices have fallen to facilitate sales, but actual sales are not smooth, and the goods are more than the demand. The market is becoming increasingly sluggish and declining all the way. Small Sieve rice fell directly to $46 in the mid-market, and even cheaper goods were available, selling for only $45.50, a sharp drop of about two yuan compared to the closing price of the previous market. Only then did the decline gradually slow down. There were quite a few people who were interested due to the low prices. Russian country customers also started to collect. The situation turned tense again, and the price rose by half a yuan. Small Sieve rice finally closed at $47. Other Saigon goods, etc., saw price reductions ranging from thirty to fifty cents. No. 1 Saigon was priced at $49.70 to $49.30, No. 2 at $47.50 to $46.50, No. 1 Siam at $48.50 to $48, No. 2 at $46.80 to $46, Fire Sieve at $48.50 to $48, Tokyo Pointed Tip at $46.50 to $46, Mixed Broken at $42.50 to $42, and Rice Mung at $44.50 to $44.

The arrival of thin and thick Japonica and other domestic rice was still low, at 1,300 to 1,400 bags. Off-market gray market rumors indicated that it was still weak and continued to fall by about half a yuan. Wuxi Pure Special Japonica was priced at $49, Powder Grain at $48, Chang Kun Japonica at $47 to $48, and Middle Decision at $46.50 to $46. Qing Si Special Thin Indica was priced at $49, Big Market at $47 to $48, and Decision at $46.50. Nan Gang Early and Late Indica were priced at $46 to $47.

Glutinous rice alone showed a stable situation yesterday. The selling price has been repeatedly reduced. Taking Broken Tip rice as an example, it still needs $41 to $42, while genuine grain domestic glutinous rice, except for high-quality goods that are still around $40, mid-market goods are only $37. The difference between the two goods is as much as $4 to $5. The cargo owners are even more concerned about their own capital and are unwilling to sell lightly again. At the same time, visiting customers also knew that the price was low and added purchases, so the resulting transaction volume was still high, and the situation was firmer than other goods.

The fall in imported rice prices was very severe in the early market. Spot prices for both high and low grades fell across the board. The opening was the weakest, smaller by one to two yuan compared to the previous morning, and also smaller by more than one yuan to fifty-seven cents compared to the previous evening. 2,800 tons of Siam rice have arrived in port on the Da Pu Wheel, so the opening prices for No. 2 Siam and Small Sieve rice have been reduced to $46. However, because the low price attracted actual sales, and there was also speculative scalping activity, the market price rose again. In the afternoon, the market was affected by the gold market, international news, and futures, and buying interest was even stronger. Small Sieve rice once rose to $48. Then, due to profit-taking, the closing price was $47.50, and it was less attractive to landlords. No. 2 Saigon's May upfront term had a cash squeeze pattern. After the opening price, it gradually rose from $49 to $60 at the afternoon close. Original pack small print also reached $58.40. Total spot trading volume for the day was more than 7,000 bags, and futures were more than 500 tons.

Another dispatch: It has recently been heard that a large amount of imported rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Swire Company's Niuzhuang shipments brought 1,152 bags from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan Wheel also shipped 2,000 bags from Hong Kong. Furthermore, China Transportation Company's Da Pu Wheel directly shipped more than 26,000 bags from Saigon. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday, but it was not seen entering the port until the evening. It probably did not arrive last night and is expected to enter the port this morning. At that time, it will dock at the Gong He Xiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload onto the wharf (Zu).

### Flour Transactions Unsatisfactory

Yesterday's spot flour transactions continued to be calm. Because sales to North and South customers lacked development, the shops on the street also saw sluggish retail sales in the city, and the intake decreased rather than increased. The return of old brand names was higher than the factory price by four to five cents in the previous two days, but yesterday it officially opened at $14.25. The asking prices for other domestic flour were still firm. The cargo owners mostly stood guard and waited for opportunities, so new transactions were even more quiet. The factory price for No. 2 flour was still $14. The amount directly sold by the factories was also less than 5,000 bags. Today, 16,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin, and 2,000 bags were shipped to Yantai. However, there was still no market for wheat.

### Oil Cake - Raw Soybean Oil Hording Resurrected - Soybean Cake Sales to Outside Customers Not Weak

Raw Oil: Yesterday, the Hong Kong gang purchased 6,000 cans of Jiangbei canned oil. The hoarding shops on the street also purchased 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao oil, and 500 cans of Yantai oil to start the market. In the afternoon, because selling to customers was not smooth, the price rose slightly.

Soybean Oil: The hoarding shops on the street took action to purchase, completing transactions for 250 barrels of Dalian oil, 40 barrels of Qingdao oil, 100 barrels of road goods, and 200 dan of Da You Yu factory oil.

Soybean Cake: Yesterday, the Shantou and Xinghua gangs, etc., completed transactions for six to seven thousand cakes of various brands.

### Sugar Market - Red and White Sugar Showed Mixed Rise and Fall

Yesterday's sugar market trend: Coarse granulated sugar continued to loosen, while Carriage White sugar returned to favor. Spot price for 24 Coarse White sugar was $75.70 at this shop, small 60 cents, new goods at the outside shop were $75.40 to 20 cents, old goods were $75, calculated as small 80 cents, transfer shipment arriving on May 20 was $59.50. Taikoo B, Keswick shop, was $87, up 50 cents. HX Lou was $86.50, up $1.50. H Carriage Red new goods were $63. Spot Dutch Red goods were offered by the United Company, WA mark, 3,000 bags, $66, transfer goods were $55, calculated as small 50 cents. Spot sugar from this factory was $75.50, small 50 cents. Spot ice sugar from this factory was $90.50, Crystal Clear Ice Sugar was $92, all unchanged. The domestic sugar offered Hainan ocean, sixty-odd bags, priced at $73, to $69.50 and $67.

Also, yesterday (9th), 833 bags of sugar were transported from Haikou, also 2 bags from Guangzhou, 405 boxes and number 200 bags were transported from Hong Kong.

### Metals - Flat Galvanized Iron Traded Over a Hundred Dan

Since the contraction of foreign exchange, flat galvanized iron transactions, until yesterday's market, were sought after by the street's construction gang and factories, totaling seventy to eighty dan, and the Qingdao gang also amassed about thirty to forty dan. In addition, small amounts were sold to retail buyers in the shop. Therefore, people's confidence was still relatively stable, so the standard market price only fluctuated by a few cents compared to the previous market. Currently, the market price is $12.50 per sheet for 12 pounds, and $14.50 per sheet for 14 pounds. Wholesale purchases are slightly more competitive than before. It is found that there is no concern about an imbalance between supply and demand for shipments from factories on this street for the time being.

### Shanghai Woolen Industry After the Second European War (Continued)

Due to the outbreak and expansion of the Second European War, and the implementation of wartime administration by European and American countries, the authorities controlled activities such as wool and machinery, greatly restricting production. Furthermore, this long Eurasian sea route was frequently subject to destruction by enemy forces. Therefore, the distribution of wool in the Far East undoubtedly faced the greatest limitations. Although Shanghai's woolen companies could still receive sample orders from foreign manufacturers' representatives, these were mostly old samples from one or two years ago, and what was available was mostly existing stock (no new weaving required, just goods already in storage). As long as a telegram was sent, the goods could be loaded onto a ship. Truly new patterns that could be ordered and woven were very rare, and the arrival dates were uncertain. Due to weaving and transportation issues, orders could not be fulfilled as specified. Consequently, winter orders for items such as overcoat wool and thick fancy wool often arrived in early spring, while spring and summer goods like linen sometimes arrived in early winter.

It is now late spring, and summer woolens are already on the market, but the supply is extremely scarce. Items like "Fat Pique," linen blends, white drill, white linen, "Fan Er Ding," etc., as well as leftover stock from last year, are all highly prized. For example, English-made "Fan Er Ding," which sold for around fifteen or sixteen yuan last summer, is now wholesaling for around twenty-four yuan this spring, and it is difficult to find a complete range of colors. Linen is even more frighteningly expensive, rising from four or five yuan per yard last summer to around twelve yuan per full piece on the market this summer. Retail prices have increased by more than double, and the market still claims severe shortages. This situation is truly unprecedented. (Tang Yun)

Old News Rehashed - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (379)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)

### Strange Incident at the Panyu County Office

A recent incident is recounted within the Panyu County Office in Guangzhou Prefecture: On the night of the 22nd day of the third month, at the hour of four, Prefect Feng of Panyu County awoke from a dream. In the distance, he heard a clamorous din from the street behind the office, startling him. Listening carefully, it seemed as if there were those frantically yelling and pursuing someone, while others were wailing and crying for help. The crowd numbered no less than a thousand. He hastily roused everyone, and all heard the same thing. Immediately, he ordered the guards and yamen runners to take up arms, light torches, and go to suppress the disturbance. Upon arriving, however, the moonlight was bright, the wind calm, and all was silent. When questioned, the watchmen and sentries claimed to know nothing. They returned to the office to report, and all suspected that they had experienced a ringing in the ears after a dream. They went back to sleep, but after sleeping, they heard the clamor again, even louder than before. They went to investigate again, but still found nothing. This happened repeatedly until dawn. The next day, rumors spread throughout Guangdong, and all found it strange!

### Thief Taking a Sedan Chair

It is reported that the Zhejiang Shipping Bureau of this city was robbed of several hundred taels of silver notes last night. The cause of the theft was initially unknown. However, those in the upper rooms heard rustling sounds in the middle of the night. They immediately got up to check, but the chest was already empty. The family gathered to search, but there was no sign of the thief. However, they noticed a blue woolen sedan chair in the hall. They then remembered that someone had arrived in a sedan chair in the evening. They hadn't had time to check, and the thief must have sneaked in with it. The thief can be said to have had a brilliant idea. It is now reported that the county has been notified and requested to apprehend the thief, but whether the person and the loot can be recovered is unknown.

Commentary

### The "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association

— Yu Bi

Relief for Children Out of School, Tuition Extremely Low, Adoption of the "Little Teacher" System, Effectiveness Quite Significant

In the post-war isolated island, due to difficult living conditions, the education of children has also become a serious problem. Although general schools have established "Economic Classes" to provide learning opportunities for children from poor families who are eager to study, in reality, these "Economic Classes" are not truly "economic." Books and stationery all need to be paid for by the students themselves, causing many children to sigh in despair at the door!

Recently, I saw the "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association, and I think their tuition is low, the burden on the students' families is not heavy, and those providing instruction are "little teachers," eliminating the need to hire other teachers. Therefore, I will introduce it as follows:

The "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association is organized by the Youth Association of the Shanghai West Public Association. The class was established in the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, because the area near the Shanghai West Public Association (Robert Road, Big Ben) was a working-class area, the families were very poor, and there were many children out of school. The Association, with serving the people as its starting point, united several "voluntary instructors" (mostly young students) from the Youth Association and created this "Poor Children's Class."

Those entering the "Poor Children's Class" are almost all extremely poor children. Before the start of the school year, the parents submit an application form and must also fill out a family situation form. In this situation form, details about the residence, population, and especially the family's economic situation must be filled out carefully. After the Association interviews them and deems them qualified, they are notified that they are allowed to enroll. This is because they sincerely want to achieve the goal of "benefiting the common people."

Children who are allowed to enroll can pay a tuition fee of eight jiao or five jiao depending on their economic situation (a portion pays only two jiao or is completely exempted) and then enroll.

The "Poor Children's Class" currently has more than one hundred students, ranging in age from seven to fifteen or sixteen years old. The majority are around eleven years old. Classes are held every afternoon, and the subjects studied focus on three main areas: Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge. There is also citizenship training, with very simple and concise goals: (1) Diligence in study, (2) Politeness, (3) Neatness.

As for the class organization, they are currently divided into classes according to the students' age and level, using multi-grade teaching. Since the spring of the 28th year (1939), the "little teacher system" has also been adopted. There are currently eight little teachers, all outstanding children from the upper grades of the Workers' Children's Primary School established by the Association.

These little teachers can also ask the teachers who guide them for help with any difficult questions at any time. Every Thursday, the guiding teachers and little teachers hold a meeting together to exchange ideas.

Every Friday, the "Poor Children's Class" holds a weekly meeting. All the programs are also prepared and hosted by the little teachers. The little teachers must also give a simple speech to the students, at which time the guiding teacher will also attend to offer a few words of encouragement.

According to Mr. So-and-so, the person in charge, the students of the "Poor Children's Class" are very diligent in their studies, and almost everyone attends regularly. Also, the little teachers are better than "volunteer instructors." First, they are very persistent, and the students also trust them very much. Second, they can fully cooperate with the guiding teachers, so the results are very significant. The Association also gives the little teachers considerable encouragement, such as changing the little teachers to half-tuition students or free students; having a meal with the little teachers once or twice per semester; and leading them on tours of parks or to various places to visit.

I think the "Poor Children's Class" and "little teacher system" of the Shanghai West Public Association should be promoted everywhere so that it can gradually be developed and expanded. Gentlemen who are interested in serving society and benefiting the people may as well rise up quickly and try to implement it.

### The Road to Getting Rich is Blocked

— Wei Si

A certain roadside advertisement once used this touching headline: "Life is very difficult, so one can only hope to get rich."

In today's Shanghai, who doesn't feel the difficulty of life? Naturally, there are very few exceptions. Who doesn't hope to relieve or lessen the burden of life? If one could strike it rich with a fortune in silver dollars, that would truly be a shortcut to overcoming difficulties.

So, people buy dog racing tickets, horse racing tickets, human racing tickets (jai alai), play lotteries, and frequent gambling dens. Why? To get rich and relieve the difficulties of life!

However, getting rich in this way, as the advertisement says, is merely a "hope." And truly achieving this hope is probably not much easier than ascending to the heavens, right? Therefore, the seeds sown time after time are like those scattered on a cement floor, destined not to sprout, let alone blossom and bear fruit.

Pitiful people who feel the hardship of life, harboring this difficult-to-realize hope, tighten their belts and squeeze out a little bit of money as the price for wanting to realize what, in fact, cannot be hoped for. One hope, one disappointment; another hope, another disappointment; continuing in this way, finally plunges that difficult life into an even deeper abyss of hardship.

It is understandable that people experiencing hardship in life want to get rich. But trying to achieve that goal through the various means mentioned above is merely a suicidal policy. To resolve the difficulties of life, please take a different path, this road is blocked!

### A Suggestion for the YMCA Boys' Department

— Lin

"Not to be served, but to serve." This is said to be a motto engraved on a stone tablet at the base of the YMCA building. We know that the YMCA's purpose is also based on this, and in fact, the undertakings established by the YMCA have indeed achieved the goal of serving the community, which is something we greatly admire. For example, the establishment of the YMCA Boys' Department has benefited many poor students and resolved many of their personal problems, such as providing us with bathing facilities, reading materials, educational film screenings, swimming, various beneficial recreational activities, and setting up self-cultivation classes, etc. However, amidst all these benefits, small problems have arisen. It's not that our extravagant expectations are too great; it's that there are issues that actually need to be reasonably resolved. Therefore, we offer a portion of our suggestions to the YMCA Boys' Department and hope that they will be adopted.

(1) Bathing Issues - The Boys' Department's bathing facilities consist of four showerheads in such a small room, with so many people, and only open twice a week. Under these circumstances, it is really very difficult to get a clean body. Therefore, we request that the Boys' Department open another bathroom or open the existing one one or two more times each week, to avoid overcrowding.

(2) Self-Cultivation Classes - Self-cultivation classes are very beneficial to us, and although we have to pay a little money, we are also very willing to participate. Therefore, we hope that the Boys' Department can offer more classes such as "Journalism Class," "Drama Class," "Short-Hand Typing Class," "Excursion Class," and so on.

These few suggestions come from our hearts, and we hope that the YMCA Boys' Department, which serves the people, can adopt them as much as possible.

### Herding Together

— San San

Poor person: Why does the money of the rich keep accumulating, while the money of the poor keeps dwindling?

Zoologist: Perhaps money also has a kind of herding instinct, so small amounts of money tend to go towards large money groups.

Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Literature is Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots, Well-Managed People

Besides Mrs. Su Ya, who is middle-aged, everyone present today is young and full of vigor. Even Mrs. Su Ya, although she is a foreign old woman, is very willing to associate with Chinese youths, laughing and talking just like them. At the table, Lin Jiancheng and Engineer Xue discussed the recent developments of the Taihu Cement Company. Engineer Xue said, "Our business is linked to your construction business. The more developed the construction industry, the greater the demand for cement. Recently, China's reconstruction efforts have progressed very rapidly. In addition to building houses, there are also bridges, roads, and all kinds of projects being carried out simultaneously. This almost makes our factory's output somewhat insufficient. We must purchase more machines and build more buildings. Now we have also newly established two brick and tile factories, one in Changzhou, which specializes in making blue bricks, and one in Yixing, which specializes in making red bricks. The products are quite good, and we want to make good quality items at low prices. Mr. Jiancheng, please try using our materials in your construction projects; we would be grateful." Lin Jiancheng said, "Of course! We use domestic products for construction materials whenever the quality is good and the price is reasonable. Besides, we are old friends, and we know that the products under your management and command are of course the most reliable. Just take the lumber we use for construction. In the past, for any large construction projects in Shanghai, foreign lumber was used. Wouldn't that be a laughingstock? There are vast forests everywhere within China's borders. People often get lost in the forests, walking for days and nights. Are we lacking lumber? It's just that transportation is inconvenient, and the lumber cannot be transported out, so there's no way. After China's rejuvenation, transportation will gradually develop everywhere, and lumber can be transported out of the mountains and forests. And the lumber companies in various provinces are also emerging like mushrooms. It's truly 'timber in inexhaustible supply,' so why would we still use foreign lumber?" Yu Danyun then introduced the two Miss He's, saying, "These two Miss He's are textile experts. They are about to open a relatively large silk weaving factory in Suzhou's Free Village, and they will soon be building factory buildings. That will require quite a bit of cement bricks and tiles from your factory. I will introduce these two customers to Mr. Xue first." Engineer Xue said, "Thank you, thank you! If you favor us, we will definitely provide special service." At that time, Jin Danyun and Mrs. Xue also found each other very congenial, and she introduced to the two Miss He's, "Speaking of running factories, this Mrs. Xue is also an old hand at factories." Mrs. Xue smiled, "Oh dear! I'm just playing around, how could I have the ability to run a factory?" It turned out that Mrs. Xue runs a factory, a toy factory, specializing in making toys for children. (End of Chapter 74)

### Don Ameche on How to Educate Children

— Ms. Sha Wei

Don Ameche is now a very experienced father. He once gave a speech on "How to teach his children in this world of declining morals." A rough account of it is described below:

Six Years of Fatherhood Experience, How to Punish and Teach?

On July 20, 1939, I – Don himself – became the father of a third child, like the previous two, a boy. This completely disappointed me and Donny – Don's eldest son – because we hoped to have a girl.

Now I have six years of experience as a father, and I know how to nurture a child and guide him onto the path of health. At the same time, I also have a good lesson for children, which I learned from my mother. In the past, my mother was always very strict with me and my sisters. At that time, although I often resented it, now I am grateful. My success today depends on the strict training I received at that time.

So now I am the same way with my children. If any of them commits a mistake, we all sit down together to study the severity of the mistake and give them punishment and teaching accordingly. For example, once my second child, Ronnie, hurt the newborn baby because he was jealous. We ignored him until he also loved his newborn brother.

Cultivate a Sound Personality, Suitable for One's Own Individuality.

Raising those children is a very interesting thing. Be mindful of those children, and try to help them build their own personalities; but that is not something you force them to develop, but rather their own excellent qualities. So some people say: in the current terrible trend, it is necessary to cultivate them into the qualities they think are necessary. I think that is wrong, because every child has his own inevitable qualities.

I feel that I am the happiest person now. I have the work I love to do, and at the same time I have a happy family. Although there is a war in Europe now, it has nothing to do with me, and this kind of world is exactly what I need. In this chaotic era, my children will be able to become young people with great personalities.

They are now studying at Catholic School, and I know that church schools can give them better education. At the same time, I also want them to go to church universities in the future. Unless they have special reasons, they must go to these universities.

Hope the Children Have a Real and Great Personality.

There is one thing that my children will never enjoy, and that is that I will never use a servant to pick them up, or have a dedicated car. This will cultivate their wasteful habits.

I don't want my children to be soldiers in the future. I am afraid of war, and I hate all the evil consequences caused by war. But if the motherland needs them, I believe they will fulfill their responsibilities. But I want to pray to God that this kind of thing will not happen. Speaking of prayer, my Donny and Ronnie, they have developed the habit of praying since they were very young, because only prayer can bring peace of mind and body. We may have more children in the future, but no matter what, I finally hope that they will all have a real and great personality in the future.

Longevity Teapot Opera Talk

### A Brief Review of Cheng Yanqiu's First Performance of "Locking the Lin Purse" (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

Cheng Yanqiu's golden performance this time has unprecedented appeal. Every day is fully seated, and it is quite difficult to get a ticket. Those who missed out must be in the minority. I am also one of those who missed out. Yanqiu is modest and values friendship extremely. Whenever he comes to Shanghai, he always comes over to talk to me. Last month, on the —th day, he came to my house with a light car and simple entourage. After exchanging pleasantries, he said that he would perform a newly written play called "Locking the Lin Purse," with extremely demanding singing and many new tunes. There is a "crying head" added to the Er Liu Ban, which is an "original board," the same as "singing San," which is still novel. He and Mr. Wang Yaoqing researched it together, and it may be a refreshing change. When I heard this, I really wanted to hear what it was all about. If I were in Beiping, Mr. Cheng Yushuang would definitely give me a ticket at that time, but in Shanghai, the ticket price is more than four yuan, so even if I were given a ticket, it would be difficult to accept. Half a month later, this play was posted and performed. It happened that Mr. Xia pre-purchased a ticket. I went there at 8:30. Wang Shaolou's Hongyangdong Sixth Son was about to return to the great hall. I only heard a sentence "Impermanence arrives and all things end..." According to Mr. Xia, his voice was not good. After a ten-minute break, "Locking the Lin Purse" came on stage, and the audience's spirits were refreshed. I also paid special attention. Now I will make a brief review of the script and Mr. Cheng's particularly excellent and weak points in singing and acting. The plot of the story has already been introduced in this publication, so I will not repeat it.

Advantage 1: This play can break away from the cliches in the first scene, using servants and maids to repeatedly exchange dowry items and the Lin purse, first vaguely writing about the pride of the heroine Xue Xiangling, and then the heroine begins to appear on stage, and then actually writing about her pretentious and arrogant state. The original intention was to narrate that Miss Xue was getting married soon, and there was no old-fashioned matchmaking, betrothal ceremony, etc. This aspect is commendable.

Advantage 2: The scene of the sedan chair sheltering from the rain and meeting the poor bride Zhao Shouzhen and giving the Lin purse writes about the different situations of the rich and the poor. While singing, she also inserts white. The arrogance of the Xue family's maid is overwhelming, and the poverty and boredom of the Zhao family's old father are in stark contrast. The singing uses two kinds of Er Liu and Liushui, and it is also concise. This scene is extremely good.
