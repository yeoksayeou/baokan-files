### Sudden Shift in Foreign Policy: Bulgaria Decides Not to Join the Axis; Soviet Union Uses Its Influence to Prevent German Expansion; Balkan War Zone May Not Expand

Berlin: A German spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday afternoon that with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia joining the Axis Pact, the second phase of joining the pact has concluded. Regarding foreign newspaper reports that Bulgaria will also join the Tripartite Pact, nothing has been heard here. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Sofia: The Bulgarian ambassador to Germany, Mr. Taraganov, returned from Berlin yesterday. It is widely believed that he will submit a report to the government today. It is also known that the Secretary-General of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Mr. Sobolev, arrived here by special plane on Sunday and was personally received by King Boris. It is widely believed that the reason Germany failed to instigate Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact was due to Soviet opposition. (United Press, 26th)

Sofia: After the Bulgarian government suddenly stopped participating in the Axis and decided not to send politicians to Berlin, King Boris immediately consulted with Soviet Foreign Secretary Sobolev and Soviet Ambassador Lavristev yesterday. This consultation is considered extremely important. The sudden development of Bulgarian foreign policy is considered a sensational move here. Previously, it was expected that Bulgaria would follow in the footsteps of Romania and Slovakia, signing a similar treaty of alliance with the Axis powers. Diplomatic circles had predicted that after the signing of this new alliance treaty, Germany and Bulgaria would soon jointly deal with Turkey. It has been learned that Bulgaria was ready to send politicians to Berlin to resolve some important details in the German-Bulgarian agreement, and possibly sign the agreement in Berlin. In the past, it was believed that Bulgaria would adopt a foreign policy coordinated with the wishes of the German government. Bulgaria had wanted to seize territory from Greece, and if German and Bulgarian forces assisted Italy, this request could be fulfilled. Diplomatic circles here generally believed that Bulgaria had already fallen into the embrace of the Axis powers, which was one of the reasons. As Bulgaria's joining the Triple Alliance seemed imminent, martial law was declared in various regions of Turkey, and Turkish troops rushed to the Bulgarian border. Turkey has been determined that if Bulgaria invades Greece, Turkey will help Greece in the war. It is believed that Istanbul will act with its so-called determination. Yesterday's situation took an unexpected and decisive turn. Although Bulgarian politicians were ready to depart for Berlin, a last-minute announcement revealed that Bulgaria's will had suddenly changed. The Bulgarian government decided to keep the delegation in the country and turn to the Soviet Union to negotiate with Soviet trade and diplomatic representatives. According to diplomatic circles here, King Boris said to Hitler during their conversation that Bulgaria had "important reasons" to maintain its non-belligerent status, preferring to postpone its demands on Greece rather than risk war at this time. It is also said that the Soviet Union may have warned Bulgaria not to wage war against Greece, as Bulgaria's war against Greece would also involve Turkey, and the Axis powers might win as a result. As a result, Germany's power would extend to Tatarstan and other regions, which is a matter of extreme concern to the Soviet Union. As Hitler's troops approached the Soviet Union, Stalin remained on the sidelines. After Romania and Slovakia joined the Axis, Stalin decided to oppose the further expansion of Germany's diplomatic and military potential. Diplomatic circles here also strongly stated that the signing of the historic German-Soviet alliance was a means by which Germany and the Soviet Union each sought to achieve their own goals. Although the Soviet Union outwardly approved of Germany's recent actions in diplomacy, the mistrust between the two countries remained. The Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Sobolev, who consulted with King Boris, is the chairman of the Soviet delegation to the Danube International Conference. The conference discussed the redistribution of the commercial interests in the commercially important Danube region. Mr. Sobolev's presence in Romania was for attending the conference.

### Reorganization of Turkish Foreign Ministry

Istanbul: Reliable sources here report that the organization of the Turkish Foreign Ministry will undergo changes. In the current international situation, which is changing rapidly, it is useless for foreign ministry personnel not to devote their full efforts to paying attention to current international affairs and studying international politics. In the future, matters handled by the Foreign Ministry involving commercial and legal issues will be transferred to other departments, so as to improve the efficiency of the Foreign Ministry and concentrate the attention of Foreign Ministry personnel. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Berlin: A spokesperson for the Nazi Party in the Vaevey area stated yesterday that Slovakia's signing of the Axis has come to an end in the current diplomatic negotiations, but Bulgaria will not sign. When someone asked whether Bulgaria's sudden change in its original plan was the result of Turkey's recent defensive measures in the Les area, the spokesperson replied sharply, "I do not believe that a country preparing to sign an agreement with Germany would abandon its original intention because of the threatened actions of a neighboring country." (United Press, 26th)

Moscow: Immediately after the German newspapers published the statement that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Axis Alliance had obtained the prior consent of the Soviet Union, the Soviet official news agency denied it. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union's denial is tantamount to reiterating its neutrality and non-participation in the Axis. In addition to the TASS news agency's denial of the German newspaper's news, the Soviet Union has not yet reacted to the successive accessions of Slovakia or Hungary to the Axis Alliance. (Reuters, 26th)

### Reportedly Germany Provides Guarantee to Respect Turkish Independence on Condition That Turkey Remains Neutral, Western Border of Turkey Remains Vigilant

Ankara: Foreign observers here say that the political tension in Turkey last weekend has eased. The original reason was that the German Ambassador Papen and the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu had talks, and Bulgaria's denial of issuing an ultimatum to Greece and its denial of massing troops on the Greek-Turkish border were also reasons for easing the tension. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Istanbul: It was learned today from reliable sources here that the German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen, has assured the Turkish government that Germany will remain neutral in any conflict in the Balkans. Yesterday, Mr. Papen and the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu had an hour-long meeting. Although the content of the meeting was not disclosed, knowledgeable sources stated that Mr. Papen assured the Turkish Foreign Minister that if Turkey remained neutral in the current war, Germany would guarantee Turkey's independence in exchange. (International News Agency, 26th)

Ankara: The German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen, hosted a banquet yesterday to welcome the Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Khalid, who is currently in Ankara. Many key figures in the Turkish government were invited to attend, including the Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Menemencioğlu. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Ankara: After the government recently declared martial law in the Turkish and European parts of the country, it also appointed General Ali Okan as the commander of martial law, placing all administrative matters under the jurisdiction of the military authorities. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)

### Romanian and Slovak Prime Ministers Return Home from Germany

Bucharest: General Antonescu and his entourage returned here last night from Berlin. All Romanian cabinet ministers and diplomatic representatives from Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain were at the station to welcome them. The leader of the Iron Guard, Mr. Shema, delivered a welcome speech. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Berlin: Yesterday afternoon, Hitler personally received Professor Tuka, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Slovakia, with the German Foreign Minister also present. Professor Tuka and his entourage returned home by special train at 7:00 last night. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Bratislava: When Slovakia joined the Tripartite Pact, Slovak President Dr. Tiso sent a telegram to Hitler, expressing his satisfaction with Slovakia's participation in the creation of the new European order, and expressing his belief that under Mr. Hitler's leadership, Slovakia's future would be bright. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Vienna: Eighty-nine officers of the Slovakian Linka Guard, led by Chief of Staff Kubala, arrived here yesterday. Governor Siraci personally welcomed them and delivered a welcome speech, emphasizing the close relationship between Slovakia and Germany. Slovak officers will visit the army exhibition. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

### Bulgarian Capital Scheduled to Hold Air Raid Drill

Sofia: An air raid drill is scheduled to be held here on December 1. The exercise will be controlled by aircraft, and a total of thousands of people will participate in the exercise. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

### Japanese Admiral Nakamura Advocates War Against the United States, Says the Real Goal of American Policy is to Subjugate Japan Without War

Tokyo: Retired Japanese Admiral Nakamura published an article in the National News yesterday, advocating a quick war with the United States. The gist of the article is that Japan wants to complete its "sacred mission," and the United States is the biggest obstacle to it. Therefore, if Japan does not go to war with the United States, it will be extremely difficult to realize Japan's plan to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and end the "China Incident." The real purpose of the United States is to subjugate Japan without war, and its means are to provide aid to Chongqing and impose economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, although the China Incident is still ongoing, all Japanese people must be united and have a strong determination to attack the United States. (United Press, 26th)

### Japan Holds Economic Conference, Calls It the East Asia Group

Tokyo: The economic conference to discuss economic cooperation between "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia" and the establishment of a Far Eastern economic group opened here yesterday. The Japanese representatives were the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and other representatives. The representative of "Manchukuo" was the Minister of Economy, the representative of Nanjing was the "Minister of Transportation," and Mongolia was the Minister of Finance. About 500 people attended the opening ceremony. Chairman Go said in his speech that the reorganization of Europe will thoroughly reform the European economic system, and Japan is working hand in hand with the major European countries. Since Roosevelt was elected president, the attitude of the United States will inevitably use the situation in the Far East to achieve its own goals. Therefore, Japan must take preventive measures. Japan has now drafted a plan to enable "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia" to cooperate economically and adapt to the national conditions of each country. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

Tokyo: Mr. Hoshino, the President of the Japanese Planning Board, said in a speech to the East Asia Economic Conference last night that Japan has not been greatly affected by the US embargo on scrap iron. Japan had expected this and has therefore tried to increase steel production and does not rely on US scrap iron. Therefore, the consumption of US scrap iron in Japan has been decreasing day by day. Mr. Hoshino stated the great potential for coal and iron production in China, Japan, and Manchuria, and emphasized the importance of complete coordination between the three countries. He then spoke about the Japanese government's ten-year economic program. Yin Tongqi of the North China Political Affairs Commission spoke about the importance of improving water conservancy and planting forests to develop agriculture in North China, and improving mining and transportation in North China. He also advocated the use of a system of exchange to maintain the balance of currency values between Japan and North China. (Reuters, 26th)

### Hasegawa Transferred to Governor-General of Taiwan

Tokyo: Admiral Kobayashi of the Japanese Navy, the Governor-General of Taiwan, has resigned, and his successor has been decided to be Admiral Hasegawa of the Supreme Military Council. Admiral Kobayashi is now listed in the retired military officer records. The new Governor-General is an active-duty admiral, and his selection is due to the importance of Taiwan as a base for Japan's southward advance. Hasegawa previously served as Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, and Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval Station. The formal appointment will be made tomorrow. (Reuters, 26th)

### Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Elected; Walter George Elected

Washington: Senator Walter George of Georgia was unanimously elected yesterday as the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is the most powerful committee in the United States, to fill the vacancy left by the late Senator Pittman.

His current term expires in 1945. (United Press, 26th)

Editorial

### Looking at the Future of the So-Called "New Order"

Germany, Italy, and Japan are striving to create the so-called "new order" at all costs; and the free countries that are unwilling to submit to the new order have lost hope of compromise and coexistence with the three countries. This is the evident situation recently. However, how will the overall situation eventually develop? How possible is the realization of the new order? Please try to make a forecast.

Needless to say, if the three countries want to realize their dream, they must first overcome the various forces that oppose the so-called "new order." In Europe, the main opposing force is Britain, which is fighting to protect its own imperial interests. In Asia, it is China, which is striving for independent survival and is engaged in a national struggle. In the short period of time in the past, Germany and Italy in Europe, and Japan in Asia, used tricks of deception and coercion, or used empty threats, or incited internal changes in the other side, or were forced to suddenly concentrate superior violence to win lightning victories; but these methods have all failed against China and Britain. The fact in front of the three countries is a long-term, comprehensive war. The three countries' basic strategy of quick victory has hit a wall, and the deadlocked strategy has seen its helplessness. China has unleashed its internal potential and obtained external assistance. Britain has widespread territories that share loyalty. The brotherly country, the United States, is fully backing it up. In short, the strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan is gradually diminishing, and the strength of China and Britain is gradually increasing. With this long-term ebb and flow, the final outcome of victory and defeat can be said to have been determined, and only the timing is uncertain. This is a difficulty that the so-called new order cannot break through, and it is also the end of the dream. Perhaps these are said too far away. Even in the near term, Germany and Italy have controlled many countries in Europe by military force and diplomacy, not only controlling but also conquering. And what is controlled is not the so-called territory of the new order; moreover, if Greece resists, a head-on blow will become a miracle; and if Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania are recruited, it will be smooth sailing, ranking like small stars. Unexpectedly, Bulgaria is unyielding and declines the temptation. Japan has gained a foothold in Vietnam, and the southward advance has a basis. However, Britain is not willing to show weakness and has established a Far East military region. The Dutch East Indies does not accept economic constraints, and even in Vietnam, it can be seen that thorns are everywhere, and it is difficult to swallow the whale. Therefore, regardless of whether Germany and Italy are in Europe, or Japan is in East Asia, if they want to go further than they are now, they will encounter opposing forces at any time and place, and there is a possibility of a new war breaking out at any time and place; in short, the future of the "new order" is full of difficulties, not only for China and Britain. Originally, the so-called new order was in the category of not daring to touch or collide with the Soviet Union and the United States, but the Soviet Union and the United States were not at ease watching from the sidelines. The attitude of the United States is firm and clear, and it has expressed a near-hostile attitude towards the so-called new order, which is not to be said much. As for the Soviet Union, it seems to be very polite in trying to avoid friction and opposition with the so-called new order. However, in the news that Bulgaria was not tempted by Germany and Italy yesterday, there is a powerful person behind Bulgaria, and the person behind it is about to emerge. If this is not the Soviet Union, then who else? If the general trend is like this, is it not enough to conclude that the new order will eventually be shattered and the final failure of Germany, Italy, and Japan will be inevitable!

The above are all references to the surrounding environment of the so-called new order. Now, let us discuss the internal conditions of those who vainly attempt to establish the "new order": Germany and Italy have a combined population of 110 million, and Japan, including Korea and Taiwan, has a total population of about 80 million. The three countries together occupy about one-eighth of the population. Although it is not considered small, they are mutually assisting in evil rather than being a unified entity. Compared with unified China, it is not as good; compared with complex Britain, it is also not as good. And the truth tells us that the era of building large countries is long past. The reason is that the development of modern history has gradually narrowed the cultural distance between the various races of mankind. The requirements of national freedom and independence have become an irresistible trend. Therefore, any hero, even if he envies China and Britain and wants to build a similar large country, is completely impossible. Today, Germany, Italy, and Japan, without measuring their own strength, want to divide Europe and its overseas colonies, and conquer the whole of Asia, respectively, and control tens of millions of human beings. It is no exaggeration to say that they are daydreaming. Looking at it again from the perspective of resources, the natural endowments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are absolutely insufficient to be the foundation for running large countries. And the methods taken by the three countries are still the old examples of imperialism. They hope to enrich themselves by exploiting the conquered countries: from the perspective of human nature, this goes against the national consciousness endowed by each race; from the perspective of international movement, its wisdom is smaller than socialism; it is fundamentally acting against the heavens, and it only sees its futility. Therefore, in the European countries that have been conquered by Germany and Italy, there is sabotage and unrest everywhere, and in the Chinese military occupation zones of Japan, there is destruction and waste everywhere. Using a hideous face, seeking the sincerity of obedience: determining the relationship between master and slave, seeking the interests of brothers and friends, this is the contradiction that coexists and dies with imperialism, and it can never be helped by gentle caresses. And the so-called new order is heading towards this contradiction. Its future is only a vague dream, only a tomb leading to decline! Therefore, even if we put aside the prejudice of doctrine, it is impossible for the three countries to imitate the Soviet Union's annexation of the small Baltic countries. If they want to imitate the Monroe Doctrine of the United States, the starting point is different and the difference is thousands of miles.

### Sea Defense American Merchant Property Under Unwarranted Japanese Oppression Attempt to Confiscate Goods Worth Millions on Pretext American Photography Results in Expulsion by Japanese Sentry

Hong Kong A prominent American merchant from Sea Defense, upon arriving in Hong Kong, stated that the manager of the North American Enterprise Company in Sea Defense, Mr. Tuofu, recently stated that the American property and goods in Sea Defense, valued at approximately three million US dollars, are in danger due to the oppression of the French authorities by the Japanese. Mr. Tuofu also stated that the photographing of the North American Enterprise Company by the United Press reporter Mr. Zhigebi and the American Vice Consul in Hanoi, Mr. Linton, was entirely within their rights, as the company is American property. The Japanese sentries who expelled them from the North American Enterprise Company's premises were actually infringing upon American property. Mr. Tuofu also accused the Japanese of forcing the French authorities to allow the Japanese to manage the North American Enterprise Company's warehouses. Mr. Tuofu solemnly denied the Japanese claim that the North American Enterprise Company is a disguised name recently used by a Chinese enterprise company and is actually Chinese property. Mr. Tuofu pointed out that the company was legally transferred and registered on August 19th under French jurisdiction, and it takes six months to finalize the registration. Although there are still two months before the registration is finalized, the company's property, including premises subleased from Texaco and Dutch companies, is now threatened by the Japanese. The Japanese are also demanding protection and stationing troops in legal American property. The company's warehouses are approximately 30,000 square yards, storing kerosene, machinery, spare parts, automobile materials, and rubber boats. 90% of the goods belong to the American Far East Trading Company, and the remaining portion belongs to Chinese merchants, the American Red Cross, Hengxin Foreign Firm, Gongli Foreign Firm, American Yongyou Company, William Hende Company, and other American companies. The total value of the goods is approximately three million US dollars. Mr. Tuofu also stated that under Japanese pressure, the French authorities have refused to issue export licenses. It seems that the Japanese are clearly trying to confiscate the goods on the pretext that the company is not American property. Mr. Tuofu also stated that when the company chartered a Xijiang boat and was unable to obtain an export permit, and the American goods on the boat were being unloaded, the French authorities forced him to open the warehouse to store the goods from the boat. Mr. Tuofu stated that his company is directly responsible for the goods stored in the warehouse and on the Xijiang boat. Mr. Tuofu also stated that the French authorities have now allowed him to leave Sea Defense and have issued him a visa for his passport. The current question is whether the French authorities will recognize the legal transfer of property from the Chinese Enterprise Company to the North American Enterprise Company. Regarding the Zhigebi and Linton incident, Mr. Tuofu said that even if they had taken photos, this action was within their rights, as the area under the American flag is American property and can be photographed by Americans. Mr. Tuofu accused the Japanese sentries of expelling Zhigebi and Linton as an infringement upon American property and pointed out that news about American expatriates and American property in Vietnam is currently only allowed to be disseminated by Japanese news agencies, so the reports are biased. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Hong Kong According to Japanese sources in Hanoi today, the Vietnamese authorities are considering taking "measures" against the American Consul and Vice Consul stationed in Hanoi as a result of an American news reporter taking photos at a Japanese military materials depot. The Japanese sources stated that the authorities, at the urging of the Japanese army, have decided to expel United Press reporter Zhagebi. American Vice Consul Linton accompanied Zhagebi last week when he photographed the so-called military materials depot. He and the American Consul Li Te are also subject to "measures" taken by Vietnamese officials. Japanese sources claim that investigations have revealed that these individuals were "engaged in anti-Japanese espionage activities when they were arrested while photographing Japanese military materials depots in Sea Defense." The Japanese military authorities issued a special statement in Hanoi yesterday, briefly stating the reasons for their serious view of the matter. It is reported that Zhagebi once photographed a building flying the American flag but occupied by the Japanese army. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

American Envoy Humiliated Incident Protest to Be Raised Again

Hanoi News today, The American Consul in this place, Li Te, deemed the Japanese response regarding the American protest over the Japanese sentry's impolite treatment of the American Vice Consul and American reporters to be unsatisfactory and rejected it, and will protest to the Japanese again. It is reported that Li Te protested to the Japanese on November 20th regarding the Japanese arrest of American Vice Consul Linton and United Press reporter Zhagebi. It is reported that Jacobbi attempted to photograph Japanese soldiers standing on American property. The two Americans were then taken to court for questioning. The Japanese response to the European protest was that it was entirely the American's fault. The American envoy deemed this response unsatisfactory and will protest again.

French Professor Lectures on the Current Situation in Laos

Hanoi Professor Lai Wei of the Department of Ethnology at the French Far East Academy gave a lecture yesterday, explaining in detail the current situation in Laos, western Vietnam. He said that within the region from Thailand to Hainan Island, the Thai ethnic group is actually the largest ethnic group, and the language, clothing, and culture of the Lao people are indeed similar to those of the Thai people. Hundreds of years ago, the Lao people were scattered throughout the Mekong River basin and the upper reaches of the Menam River, and their culture was very prosperous. Although they experienced ups and downs in the middle, they were still able to maintain their inherent characteristics. When French forces extended into Vietnam, the Lao people gradually declined due to internal strife and the harassment of mountain bandits in the north. At this time, the ruler of the Lao people was almost prepared to hand over his only remaining territory, the Luang Prabang County, to his historical enemy, the Siamese people. However, the residents of the county voluntarily sought French protection and surrendered to Mr. Bavi, the French envoy stationed in Bangkok at the time. This is the process by which Laos became attached to France. In the past fifty years, the country has been painstakingly managed by France, and it has not only enjoyed peace for a long time, but also gradually restored the national prestige, and the economic life has also greatly developed. Therefore, whether in terms of land, river economy, or population, today's Laos has established an inseparable connection with Vietnam. In short, the Lao people hold one of the oldest cultures in the world today, and after fifty years of influence, they have become closely related to France in culture. (Havas, 25th)

### Chairman of Sichuan Province Orders Food from Hunan and Shaanxi National Food Bureau in Chongqing Sells Rice at Fixed Price

Chongqing Since April, the price of rice in Sichuan Province has almost doubled. The new Chairman, Zhang Qun, in order to relieve the plight of the people, plans to order white rice from Hunan and flour from Shaanxi to stabilize the price of rice. The reason for the rise in rice prices in Sichuan Province is that unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the army's need for large quantities of food to monopolize and profit. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Chongqing In order to cope with the current rice situation in Chongqing, the National Food Bureau will sell rice to the poor, military families, students, and civil servants at a special price from December 1st. This special price will be 60 yuan per shi, while the market price is 180 yuan. The bureau will supply 1,000 shi per day under a partial rationing system. The poor and military families will be able to purchase from municipal stores with rationing certificates, while students and civil servants will be handled by schools and institutions. Each adult can purchase two dou. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Chongqing The rice price problem in Chongqing has not eased. According to Shen Zonghan, Deputy Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, at the end of the year before last, there were 50 million shi of rice stored in the 15 provinces in the rear. Last year, 750 million shi were harvested and 700 million shi were consumed, leaving 50 million shi. Combined with the previous year's surplus, there were a total of 100 million shi of rice stored. This year, the harvests in all provinces exceeded last year, and although Sichuan Province was slightly lower, it was still about the same as last year. Therefore, there should be more surplus rice this year, so the rice prices in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces have all fallen back by one-third to one-half, while Sichuan Province is the opposite. This is definitely not a natural cause, but a man-made one. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### British Ambassador to the United States Talks at Length with President Roosevelt Although British Gold Reserves in the United States Have Decreased, All Sectors in the United States Still Advocate Intensifying Aid to Britain

Washington The British Ambassador, Lord Lothian, met with President Roosevelt for 80 minutes. Afterwards, Lord Lothian told reporters that the President and he had not mentioned finance at all. The President wanted to know the recent events in Britain and the situation of their resistance to air raids. He described everything in detail to the President and told him that Britain was very optimistic if it could get some help from the President. The President did not make any promises, and he did not discuss any specific issues with him. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Washington The British Ambassador, Lord Lothian's remarks that Britain's dollar reserves are gradually decreasing have still aroused continuous attention and discussion in all parts of the United States. However, all comments are not unfriendly to Britain. The Washington Bee Newspaper stated that most Americans know that for the sake of their own interests, they must provide Britain with rapid and continuous material assistance. The suggestion that assistance should be stopped if Britain cannot pay cash is immediately rejected as absurd, because the motive for helping Britain is not money, and every cannon and machine crossing the Atlantic is an investment in America's own security. The Washington News said of Britain's war record that any schoolchild knows that everyone will never see the return of this extra money, so the United States should buy the British territories in the Caribbean Sea and Bermuda. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

New Orleans Sir Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress, spoke to the American Federation of Labor here last night, warning the United States that it must be prepared to prevent German forces from extending into the Western Hemisphere before the United States' existing military preparations are completed. He said that since the Nazi Party has already set the time for an outbreak in Europe, it will also take unexpected actions in the Western Hemisphere in the future. He also said that Britain will continue to fight until dictatorship is eradicated from the world. American workers only need to step up the production of armaments to overcome the Nazi Party without firing a single shot. Finally, he said that Britain still needs more planes. American Federation of Labor President Green responded, saying that the United States must quickly transport the strength needed by Britain to Britain so that Britain can win an early victory. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Washington The British Ambassador to Washington, Lord Lothian, stated yesterday that if Britain wants to win, the United States must accelerate massive aid to Britain. Lord Lothian made his remarks after meeting with President Roosevelt. The Ambassador said that Britain is optimistic about the future of the war, depending on the United States increasing and accelerating its assistance to Britain. Lord Lothian also firmly stated that he did not discuss the issue of Italy paying Britain's credit loans with President Roosevelt. He said that Britain hopes to receive assistance from the United States regarding aircraft, military supplies, ships, and economy next year. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

London According to responsible sources, there is no truth to the claim in a New York newspaper that the recently returned Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, carried a memorandum announcing that the British government wanted to buy or lease non-combatant warships from the United States. According to the newspaper's report, the warships mentioned were three battleships, six cruisers, and one hundred destroyers. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Washington When a Reuters reporter asked British Ambassador to the United States Lothian about the London questions regarding his talks with reporters on Saturday, he replied that the questions were clearly based on a misunderstanding of his remarks. His remarks regarding Britain's financial position in the United States were made in response to a question about what kind of assistance the United States could provide to Britain in 1941. He replied at the time that the United States could provide aircraft, military supplies, ships, and finance. His remarks regarding Britain's financial position were entirely related to the situation created by the US legislation requiring Britain to purchase goods in cash. He did not mention Britain's general economic and financial position. The questions and answers at the time were limited to the status of the dollar, and all parts of the United States interpreted it in this sense. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

US Senate to Investigate British Financial Resources

Washington Republican Senator Nye of North Dakota introduced a bill yesterday requesting the Senate to formally investigate the financial resources of the British Empire. Nye's proposal is clearly intended to deal with those who advocate repealing the Johnson Act. (Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that no further loans will be granted to any country that has not paid back its debts to the United States from the previous European war.) Also, Senate Majority Leader Barkley predicted that the issue of British loans and deposits would not be discussed in this session of Congress. This issue should be discussed only after the opinions of Congress have been clarified. Barkley's speculation was made after visiting President Roosevelt. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

British Ambassador and Hull Hold One-Hour Talk

Washington After visiting the White House yesterday, British Ambassador to the United States Lothian held talks with Secretary of State Hull for an hour. Lothian also told reporters that the issue of economic aid to Britain was not discussed. The issue must be decided by the US government. The discussion only concerned the losses of British ships attacked by German submarines and the lack of naval bases on the Irish coast. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 26th)

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan Announces: Nomura Appointed as Ambassador to the United States, Suma Transferred as Minister to Spain

Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday the appointment of General Nomura as the new Ambassador to the United States. Suma, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was concurrently appointed as Minister to Spain. (International News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

Tokyo – It was announced here yesterday that General Nomura has been appointed as Ambassador to the United States. The new ambassador previously served as Foreign Minister in the Abe Cabinet, as a member of the Supreme Military Council, and as Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval Base. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

Chongqing – Various Chinese circles here believe that the appointment of Naval Admiral Nomura as Japan's new ambassador to the United States is a sign that Japan hopes to reach an understanding with the United States on the overall situation in the Far East. However, well-informed observers believe that Nomura's mission will inevitably encounter failure, because if Japan continues its aggression against China, concludes the Tripartite Pact, and expands into the South China Sea, Nomura will only waste his breath like his predecessors. If Japan cannot abandon its fundamentally hostile Far Eastern policy towards the United States, adjusting US-Japan relations will be extremely difficult. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

Tokyo – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today regarding Nomura's appointment as Ambassador to the United States, expressing approval and issuing a warning, stating that while the ambassador's qualifications and achievements are important, they are not enough to guarantee the improvement of US-Japan relations. The state of no treaties between the two countries still exists, and the United States is paying attention to the Berlin Pact's apparent animosity towards the United States and is interfering in various Eastern issues, including the Dutch East Indies, in order to obstruct Japan's East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere plan. All of these are facts that should be noted. Furthermore, the tension in the international situation can also affect US-Japan relations. The cooperation between Britain and the United States in East Asia and the Pacific is currently increasing the risk of friction between Japan and the United States. We must not ignore this either. Our mention of these various difficulties is not intended to discourage the new ambassador, but rather because we believe that these difficulties will make his work more valuable. Anyone who foresees many obstacles ahead can prepare for them in advance. The Asahi Shimbun hopes that Nomura will not only demonstrate his diplomatic talents but also his political talents. Other major newspapers did not publish editorials on Nomura's appointment. The Yomiuri Shimbun, however, published an article, clearly stating Observation Point One: Warning the public not to be optimistic that Nomura's mission to the United States can stabilize US-Japan relations, stating that the United States still maintains the Open Door Policy and Equal Opportunity Doctrine it advocated in 1899, while Japan is pursuing a policy of establishing a New Order in East Asia. Therefore, the conflict of opinions between the two sides is unavoidable. From our point of view, it can be said that if the United States continues to refuse to recognize the New Order in East Asia established by Japan, the disputes in US-Japan relations will be difficult to resolve.

### German Aircraft Groups Bombard London, Bristol Heavily Damaged, Incendiary Bombs Cause 45 Major Fires, British Air Force Night Raids German Naval Base

Berlin – Large formations of German aircraft launched continuous, batch attacks on the British southwestern port of Bristol from Saturday night to Monday. German bombs rained down, factories and stores collapsed one after another, and the entire city was engulfed in raging fires and black smoke, creating a terrifying scene. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

Berlin – According to a report from German reconnaissance planes, the British city of Bristol has become a large furnace after being attacked by German aircraft on Sunday, with dense black smoke and at least forty-five major fires, with countless smaller fires. The southern part of the port suffered particularly severe damage, with ten large factories in the industrial area all ablaze. There were five major fires in the northern part of the city. The fire at the gas company reached 400 meters into the sky. Most of the material and grain warehouses were destroyed, and the suburbs were also heavily bombed, resulting in extremely heavy losses.

### Italian Air Raids, Combat Power is Such That They Desert the Battle and are Easily Defeated

London – It is heard that the cooperation between the Axis powers in the air war against England has resulted in infighting between German and Italian pilots. The incident arose when the Italian fighter escort squadron was severely damaged by British fighters while approaching England, and they fled first, leaving the German bombers to fend for themselves. The German bomber squadron then dispersed and returned to their original defenses. When they negotiated with the Italian pilots, each refused to yield, and they began arguing, eventually drawing their guns and firing at each other, resulting in the deaths of several combatants.

### Christmas Truce Proposal, Britain Decides to Reject It

London – During a meeting in the House today, a Member of Parliament questioned Prime Minister Churchill, asking what the government's attitude would be if the Vatican or several neutral countries offered their good offices to facilitate a 48-hour Christmas truce, and whether it would consider such a proposal if it were received from neutral countries.

### Greek Troops in Albania Launch Attacks on Multiple Fronts, Break Through Italian Second Line of Defense, Continue to Occupy Four Important Strongholds, Italian Communiqué Claims Counterattack Has Begun

Athens – After occupying Korçë, Greek troops also took Pogradec in their stride. Yesterday, the Greek troops in Albania repeatedly destroyed many Italian castles. The latest news revealed that Greek troops attacked on five fronts, and with rapid progress, occupied at least four more cities in Albania, broke through the Italian second line of defense, captured more than 8,000 Italian soldiers, and advanced more than 50 miles into Albania. The speed of the Greek pursuit forced both Greek and Italian armies to abandon all weapons except light arms. The Greek army is clearly planning to descend directly on the Shkumbin River, cutting Albania in two, as a prelude to attacking the Albanian capital of Tirana. According to recent news, Greek troops on the northern front, with the help of British forces, have reoccupied Moschopolis and Pëllumbas, and have strengthened the defenses of Pogradec. In the southwest, after the Italian forces withdrew from Argyrokastro for twenty-four hours, the Greek troops immediately occupied the city, advancing another ten miles and reaching a point ten miles from Tepelenë. This is another important position for the Italian army leading to Vlorë. News from Budapest also stated that a major battle had broken out along the entire front. It was also learned that after the Italian forces withdrew from Konispol opposite Corfu, they launched a fierce counterattack to the south, thus hindering the advance of the Greek mechanized units. Greek sources arriving in Budapest stated that this Italian counterattack was "the fiercest since the outbreak of hostilities." The Italian General Staff in Rome also stated that the Italian army is currently carrying out a major counterattack, but denied the Greek claim that 8,000 Italian soldiers were captured. (International News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

A broadcast stated that "the Italian army within Albania now faces the possibility of being completely surrounded." Athens also claimed that an Italian general had committed suicide due to military setbacks. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

London – A Reuters aviation correspondent claimed that the Greek threat to Argyrokastro would drive the Italian Air Force out of its last base within Albania. The Italian squadrons stationed there may have already withdrawn. It has been two weeks since the British Air Force first announced attacks on the airfield there. British aircraft recently flew to the area on Thursday, but the bombing target was a "military concentration." Airfields near the battlefield must be abandoned once they are within artillery range. For example, the Italian Air Force abandoned two of its best forward bases near Korçë before the Greek troops occupied it. The loss of the Italian forward bases in Albania will put British aircraft within easy strike distance of Italian reinforcements landing on the Albanian coast and troop embarkation points in southern Italy.

Renowned Albanian Warriors Assist Greece in Vigorously Eradicating Defeated Italian Troops

Athens – As Greek troops continued to advance and occupy new positions today, the fiercest and most renowned fighting people in Albania, the Mërgëtorët, also took up arms and ambushed key areas, helping to kill isolated Italian troops. The fierce Mërgëtorët have never formally submitted to the Italians and have long considered resisting Italian aggression. The Greek advance has provided the Mërgëtorët with the opportunity to snipe at the Italian troops. These people live in the wild villages between the Vjosë and Shkumbin rivers, severely disrupting the Italian rear and inciting Albanian rebellion. This action by the Mërgëtorët has greatly assisted the Greek army in capturing Italian positions. The Italian positions were on the north bank of the turbulent Vjosë River, facing Greek artillery fire in front and attacked by the Mërgëtorët in the rear. How could the Italian army not be defeated? A part of the Greek army that had crossed the Vjosë River and advanced on Pogradec is currently rushing west toward the Italian positions at the foot of the Lënia Mountains. Authoritative sources claim that the Greek army has also captured eight mountain guns, eight tanks, and one hundred transport vehicles left by the Italian army in the valleys around Moschopolis. These eight captured tanks have been used by the Greek army as the vanguard for attacking isolated Italian troops. When these eight tanks entered Medyk, the Italian garrison there mistakenly thought they were their own troops and welcomed them. At that moment, the Greek troops in the tanks fired wildly at the welcoming Italian positions, causing countless casualties. The Moschopolis area is filled with thousands of defeated Italian soldiers, many of whom were already frozen, starving, and dying. They were then attacked by the Greek army. In this battle, several thousand more of these defeated soldiers were captured by the Greek army. According to reliable estimates, the number of Italian soldiers captured by the Greek army so far has reached more than 7,000. Official war reports state that Italian aircraft bombed several inland towns and villages, causing some deaths and injuries, but no military equipment was damaged.

### General de Gaulle Returns to London, Meets with British Prime Minister for Long Talk, French Revival Movement Grows

General de Gaulle had his first meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at 10 Downing Street last night after his return to England. Last night, General de Gaulle gave a broad speech, giving a general review of the situation from the French perspective, stating that now that the British Air Force has destroyed Mussolini's warships and the Italian army fighting the Greek army is fleeing in disarray, the people of France can understand that the French army has been deprived of the glory of participating in the final victory for freedom. But the patriotic enthusiasm of the French people, inspired by French heroes such as Joan of Arc and Clemenceau, is now growing and will help in the final liberation of France.

Albanian Front – Four Italian Divisions Annihilated

Athens – Reuters learned today that it is estimated that since the outbreak of the Greek-Italian war, up to four Italian divisions on the Albanian front have been cut off and destroyed, and an Italian armored division that launched the war in two directions has also lost all contact and is temporarily useless. Military experts have confirmed that Greek troops are continuing to advance on all fronts, and several new major military actions are developing. At the same time, military figures issued a cautious tone, saying that the communiqués issued by the Greek command may not record all their achievements, and military actions cannot be said to be completed until the positions are consolidated. The Greek vanguard is currently acting quickly, but the command cannot yet announce that it has occupied certain locations. The Greek cavalry that reached Pogradec yesterday is still near the area, and Greek reinforcements are rushing there, but the retreat of the Italian army has left behind a large amount of materials, which has slightly hindered the march. The continued advance has threatened the various bases that the retreating Italian army originally intended to defend. A large group of Greek troops entered Pogradec (north of Korçë in southwestern Albania) near the South Country border yesterday, and it is heard that Greek cavalry has occupied Moschopolis (ten miles west of Korçë) and continued to advance to the confluence of the Trevla River. It is also said that Greek troops have occupied Konispol in the Kalamas River region. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### Random Talks on the European War 24: Londoners' Underground Life

The German air force concentrates all its efforts to bomb London, which has almost become a daily routine. The loss of life and property suffered by London is indeed incalculable. The most painful thing is for the millions of residents who have not yet been evacuated. The sound of air raid sirens never ceases every night, and going in and out of air raid shelters is like shuttling back and forth. The upheaval and pain of daily life is truly beyond description. They even invented a novel slogan amidst their helplessness, called "If you want to avoid war, you can only join the army." This is a double-edged humorous remark. Although it is not without a self-deprecating meaning, it is actually not necessarily a pleasant way out for the public under suffering!

London was originally the world's largest metropolis. In peacetime, the population reached 8.5 million. Currently, in addition to the women and children who have been ordered to evacuate, and the wealthy and large households scattered in the surrounding countryside, totaling about 2.7 million people, the majority of the common people who cannot migrate and the men and women who must make a living in the city still make up five-eighths of the total population. For the sake of protecting their lives, the only way out for these people is to "dig underground!" According to the most reliable statistics, every night when German planes attack, about one million people hide in air-raid shelters built by the air defense authorities, underground train stations, and basements of various public buildings. As for those who hide in small air-raid shelters built by private individuals, as well as the basements of semi-public buildings, or in air-raid trenches, the number is even greater, at least around four million. In order to prevent everyone from being "homeless," every place with a crack to drill into is regarded as a place to settle down and make a living. In the past, everyone liked to live in high-rise buildings: six-story or seven-story apartment buildings were almost always fully occupied, and the rent was very expensive, making it difficult to find an empty room. Since German planes began to visit from time to time, this situation has changed dramatically. All dilapidated houses, even skyscrapers with elevators, even if they only ask people to pay a dime in rent, no one cares. Currently, the most valuable and precious place is the cellar that everyone used to despise. Deep underground coal mines and disinfected sewers in large factories, if opened, these owners could immediately become rich, because these places are truly good places that everyone seeks but cannot find.

However, the underground life of Londoners still varies according to their class and wealth. The rich, of course, can find pleasure in hardship everywhere, with drinking and banquets almost every day, while the disparity between the happiness and suffering of the vast majority of common people and laborers who live by working cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The most luxurious and comfortable underground life is the basement of large hotels, built below ground level, with seven-story steel-reinforced concrete buildings standing above, standing tall and unassailable. When London was most severely bombed by German planes in September and October, the basement of large hotels still had melodious music and bright lights. In a small hall, men in military uniforms and women in elegant attire snuggled together and danced gracefully. Under waltzes such as "The Blue Danube" and "The Merry Widow," everyone had a feeling of being drunk and wanting to become immortal. Despite the roaring of General Göring's bombers and the country's anti-aircraft guns on the ground above, these men and women were unmoved, because they felt that the basement of this large building was truly a safe place to be!

Many tables were placed in the ballroom, surrounded by diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in England, British government officials, military officers, and women dressed in makeup. They ate lavish meals, such as lobster, chicken, whiskey, and various French wines and Danish malt liquor that were shipped before the war. The price they paid was very expensive, because apart from the first-class large hotels that could still supply these luxury goods, most other nightlife venues and banquet places could only sigh in vain.

When the music stopped, everyone at the tables began to talk again. What they talked about was nothing more than using the German bombing of London as the center of discussion. Both men and women presented their own expertise and interpretations. For example, describing what the scene outside was like at the time, and whether the final loud noise that shook the ballroom floor was caused by a nearby attack, the explosion of a bomb, or the anti-aircraft guns fired from the roof of a public agency not far from where they were, everyone constantly discussed these various issues.

Late at night, after drinking, the musicians packed up their scores, tucked their various instruments under their arms, and slipped out one by one. The guests also left in succession. Some guests had already put on long pajamas or thick scarlet velvet robes, and as soon as they arrived at the underground dormitory, they fell asleep. Single men and women mostly lived separately, and there was even a dormitory specifically for married couples. Although these dormitories were deep underground, they all had air conditioning equipment inside, and guests could inform the attendants to wake them up at a designated time. Although it was not as convenient and free as being at home, these dormitories were still quite comfortable in comparison. And most importantly, it was not only very safe underground, but also relatively quiet. If you lived in any floor of a building on the ground, not to mention the danger of being bombed, even the various sounds of explosions, burning, and flying shrapnel would keep people restless all night, making it impossible to fall asleep.

However, the number of people in London who are qualified to live in large hotels is ultimately small. And these high-end basements have long been overcrowded. Therefore, the most common phenomenon is that when an air raid siren goes off, everyone still desperately runs to those ordinary-class basements. The most common air-raid shelters used by ordinary people are underground stations, followed by steel-reinforced concrete warehouses built near the docks. As for the air-raid shelters built by public and private individuals, on the one hand, they are not enough for people to use, and on the other hand, not all common people can imitate them, so of course the demand exceeds the supply.

### Most American Residents in Shanghai Still Maintain Their Original Businesses; Most American Residents Who Have Not Evacuated Do Not Want to Leave; American School Will Still Open Next Semester

According to an employee of the American President Lines, American residents in this port who did not make it on the "Washington" special evacuation ship that sailed out last week will probably not be able to leave Shanghai until February next year, unless they have already booked cabins on President Lines ships. Although there are four President Line ships sailing from Shanghai to the United States this year and in January next year, namely the President Cleveland, scheduled to leave Shanghai on December 9, the President Coolidge, scheduled to leave Shanghai on December 31, the President Pierce, scheduled to leave Shanghai on January 6 next year, and the President Taft, scheduled to leave Shanghai on January 20, the cabins on these four ships are all fully booked. Therefore, those who wish to return to the United States in the future will have to wait until February next year to purchase tickets to return to the United States.

Business Owners Do Not Want to Evacuate

There were originally about 4,000 American residents in this port. In addition to those who have evacuated and returned to the United States, there are still more than 2,500 American residents. It is understood that half of them have no intention of evacuating, as most of them are business owners in Shanghai. At the same time, according to the American Consul General in this port, the American authorities' original plan to send a fourth special evacuation ship, the "Manhattan," to the Far East has apparently been abandoned. It is understood that the ship is currently traveling between New York and San Francisco. Before the signing of the Neutrality Law, the "Washington" and "Manhattan" were transporting American residents evacuating from Europe. The news received in this port regarding the rumors of a strike by the crew of the "Washington" in Manila is inconsistent. However, the American President Lines has not heard of this matter.

Two Gunboats Patrol and Return to Shanghai

The U.S. Yangtze River Fleet's river gunboats, the "Luzon" and "Guam," left Shanghai yesterday and sailed to an undisclosed destination for routine patrol exercises. Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, is in command and is scheduled to return to the Yangtze River on Thursday and still berth at the U.S. Navy pontoon. The only U.S. ship remaining in Shanghai is Admiral Hepburn's private yacht, the "Isabel," which is berthed off the French Bund.

American School Continues to Operate

Yesterday, an employee of the Shanghai American School stated that the school will continue to offer classes next semester and will not be suspended due to the war and the evacuation of American residents. However, the number of students will decrease. Two months ago, when this semester started, there were a total of 520 students, which has now decreased to 190. The number of faculty and staff has also decreased from 32 to 25, all due to the evacuation of overseas residents. The number of students will be even smaller. The school has sent letters to the parents of students to inquire whether they will enroll in the next semester. So far, few replies have been received, and it is impossible to determine how many students will continue their studies next semester. It has now been decided that the next semester will start early on December 30 and end on April 17, two months earlier than usual.

### Accidents Greatly Reduced During Safety Campaign Week

38 Fewer Cases Than the Previous Week Prove Good Results; Public Concession Police Department Holds "Safety First" Campaign Week; Car Accidents and Injuries Greatly Reduced, Proving Good Results; This week has now passed; The Police Department has decided to continue showing the "Safety First" film for a few days for the benefit of Chinese citizens;

Widely Watched

Chinese members of the Police Department and Fire Department were invited to watch this film at the Gordon Road Police Station at 7:15 p.m. the day before yesterday; The Police Department did not expect traffic accidents to be drastically reduced as a result of this campaign; However, the results of the campaign have proven that all preparations were not in vain; During the "Safety First" campaign week, there were a total of 109 car accidents, a reduction of 38 cases compared to 147 cases in the previous week (ending November 17);

46 People Were Injured, Including 2 Deaths, Which Is Also a Decrease Compared to 61 People Injured in the Previous Week, Including 6 Deaths; As for the results of the "Safety First" campaign week in the French Concession, it is not yet known; It is generally believed that traffic accidents in the French Concession will also be reduced; It is noted that at the beginning of the "Safety First" week, the authorities stated that they would not regret the effort of holding the campaign if traffic accidents could be slightly reduced; However, the situation on the first day of the campaign has proven

It Will Be Successful

Chinese students assisted the police in distributing traffic safety leaflets to pedestrians, all cinemas screened the "Safety First" film, and Peck, Deputy Police Commissioner of the Traffic Section of the Police Department, and others gave speeches on Chinese and foreign radio stations, all of which made no small contribution; The officials in charge of this campaign expressed their gratitude to all relevant parties for the reduction of car accidents by 0.58%, and hope that the number of accidents during "Safety First" week will be further reduced in the future;

### Military Transport on the Burma Road is Smooth and Plentiful; Completing a Major Mission; Half of the Vehicles Dispatched are Dedicated to Cargo Transportation; Shanghai-Kunming Intermodal Transport is Smooth and Has Exceeded the Quota

The Burma Road, China's only international highway, has been reopened by the United Kingdom on October 18, and it has been five weeks since then. Since the opening of the road, all war materials have been transported into the interior of the country like a rushing tide. These military supplies are transported to various parts of the southwest via Kunming on this road, which is enough to strengthen China's power, and Chinese products are also transported by trucks along this road to overseas countries and handed over to their friendly countries;

Active Driving

This powerful activity undoubtedly proves the consistent national policy of the National Government. Although the Burma Road was closed for three months, the impact on China was minimal. During the first week of the road's opening, the Japanese sent bombers to bomb the road and bridges, among which the most important Mae Khong River Bridge and the road surface were slightly damaged, but this action did not stop the transportation of goods, and the freight trucks did not stop their mission as a result. The Chinese road builders have quickly repaired it, and although the road from Lashio to Kunming is 800 kilometers long, there are Chinese road builders along the section who can repair it immediately if there is any damage, just like the Japanese bombing of the Canton-Kowloon Railway at the beginning of the war. The Chinese authorities repair it as soon as it is bombed;

Smooth Cargo Transportation

According to recent reports, cargo transportation on the Burma Road is now proceeding smoothly under absolutely smooth circumstances, without any obstruction. Two weeks ago, an Associated Press reporter traveled along the road from Lashio to Kunming. According to the reporter, this accidental bombing, as far as he knew during his trip, did not damage anything of the Chinese side. Shanghai received a report from the Associated Press reporter from Lashio last Sunday, stating that a Chinese authoritative spokesperson said that the Burma Road will have more calm and expansion in November, and that the food and goods transported to Chongqing are rarely hit by Japanese aircraft, probably because the Japanese believe that bombing is futile. According to the report, the recent activities of Japanese aircraft have been greatly reduced;

Direct Transportation of Shanghai Goods

According to news from the shipping industry in this port, since the opening of the Burma Road on October 18, the government has restricted cargo transportation and gradually rushed to transport the car fires and military supplies stored in Lashio day and night. It has been completed by the beginning of this month, so cargo transportation has been relaxed recently. The current situation is that half of the transportation is military supplies and the other half is cargo transportation. The government still provides 400 trucks for commercial transportation. In addition, light items and parcels are generally transported by livestock vehicles. The British shipping company Simalo, which chartered the shipping company Qiaocheng in this port, went directly to Rangoon. The ship is currently berthed at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Yesterday, it completed the loading of the goods entrusted by Qiaocheng, completed the customs clearance today, and will set sail directly for Rangoon tomorrow morning. Qiaocheng Shipping Company began to handle direct intermodal transportation between Shanghai and Kunming. The announcement was only half a sentence, and the merchants in this port who went to contact it were extremely crowded. As of yesterday, it has exceeded the 200 tons of the company's scheduled tonnage. Jardine Matheson's new printed Burma route is to rent the British merchant ship Chang'an, which has a deadweight of 10,000 tons, and travels to Singapore, India, Calcutta, and Borneo's Penage. The ship left Shanghai on the afternoon of the 25th and set sail on the route for the first time, carrying more than 2,000 tons of cargo;

### Inland Branches of Various Banks Increase Deposit Interest Rates; Financial Network Can Be Completed Within the Year; More Than 500 Branches Have Been Established

In order to circulate inland finance and strengthen economic power, the Ministry of Finance formulated a two-year plan to complete the financial network in the southwest, northwest, and neighboring war zones, and ordered the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, as well as the banking industry associations, to complete it by the end of 1940. After the four banks and the provincial banks, local banks, and commercial banks and money houses were ordered to comply, they have generally established branch offices, mutually contacted and remitted money, promoted agricultural loans, and absorbed ordinary savings, which has achieved great results;

Branch Offices Widely Established

After the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture were ordered, they immediately established branch offices in various places. The Central Bank has 33, the Bank of China has 59, the Bank of Communications has 26, and the Agricultural Bank of China has 36, totaling 154. Including the previous branch offices of the four banks across the country, there are more than 350. In addition, the banks of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, and other provinces and local banks have newly established 100 branch offices. As for commercial banks such as Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Continental, Zhongnan, Jin Cheng, Yanyun, Xinhua, Siming, China Industrial, and Tongshang, the total number of branch offices added in the interior has exceeded 50;

Deposit Interest Rates Increased Inland

After the banking industry was ordered to collect idle funds, increase production, balance prices, and stabilize society, and strive to promote savings business, it ordered the branch offices of banks in the southwest, northwest, and interior to increase interest rates and absorb savings. For fixed-term deposits of one year, the interest rate is from 8% to 1% per week, while the deposit interest rate in the Shanghai concession area is reduced appropriately, so that idle funds in Shanghai can be transferred to the interior for national development. As for the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, in view of the fact that the promotion of savings business in the past was mostly focused on cities, and smaller counties and other industrial and commercial concentration areas lacked storage institutions, and the current activities of workers, farmers, merchants, and vendors are quite active, and convenience should be given to savings, special simple savings offices have been established, stipulating a floating deposit of 5% and a fixed-term one-year interest rate of 1% as the principle;

### The Telephone Company Attempts to Increase Prices Should Be Stopped

The company's annual report shows that its business is booming and setting new records; The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently sent a letter to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to change its charging methods and implement a huge price increase. All sectors of society believe that the company's business is booming after the war, and there is no need to increase prices in fact, and the proposed price increase methods are as exploitative as possible;

Public Opinion is Aroused

Deeply surprised; The association has also received reports from users requesting the transfer of letters to the relevant authorities to stop it. After the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented charging according to the number of calls in 1936, the burden on users has increased. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the environment in Shanghai was special, the population increased sharply, and the industry and commerce also showed abnormal prosperity, and the company's telephone revenue reached a record high over the years. According to the company's own statement in the 1939 annual business report, "Due to the increase in newly installed telephones and the increased use of installed households, the number of calls this year has greatly increased. A total of 102,000,000 calls were made in 1937, 126,000,000 calls were made last year, and 198,000,000 calls were made this year." It also stated that "As of the end of the year, there were a total of 77,554 telephones in use, an increase of 19,165 from before the war."

Good Business

Sufficient to prove; As for the increase in the company's expenses over the years, it is also unnecessary to say anything in the autumn of rising prices, but judging from the company's business conditions, it should be enough to offset it. The detailed reasons for this price increase have not yet been officially published. What has been seen in the newspapers is only that the company plans to install a total of about 16,000 new households, and the cost of purchasing machines has increased sharply. This may be the biggest reason for the price increase, but the company's increase in telephones is to increase the company's assets. To seek compensation, it can only appropriately increase the deposit fee for new households, and it is extremely obvious that it cannot use this to seek a general price increase. I think that when talking about

One of the public utilities, should be charged at a low price, to facilitate the public as the purpose, for the special letter to reach, please comply with the situation, for the company's application for price increase, give a serious review, to benefit the industrial and commercial industries, I can not pray enough;

### Shanghai Merchants' Goods Detained in Vietnam; Prepared to Return to Hong Kong and Transport to Rangoon; Now Sorting Out Supporting Documents and Powers of Attorney; Returning to Shanghai is More Expensive and Less Economical

Regarding the detained goods of Chinese merchants in Vietnam that were detained by the Chengnan Government Motor Vehicle Company, which has been approved for release, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Jingyao to protest to the Vietnamese government, and telegraphed the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities nearby. It has been nearly a month since then. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city only received a telegram from the Saigon Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday, stating that after repeated negotiations, the Vietnamese government

Has the Intention to Release

However, the original owner of the goods must submit the supporting documents and powers of attorney to the association so that it can make a strong appeal to the Vietnamese government again. It is already noted in yesterday's newspaper that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently sent letters to the relevant industries, instructing them to retrieve the supporting documents and powers of attorney of all goods detained in Vietnam so that they can be sent to the Saigon Chamber of Commerce as the basis for negotiation. The factories and businesses in this port have now started to sort out the certificates and powers of attorney and will send them to the

Municipal Chamber of Commerce

One side is preparing the transportation procedures for the return of the goods to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to the opinions of manufacturers, it is believed that if the detained goods can be released smoothly through negotiation, it will be decided to return to Hong Kong only, and it is not intended to be transported to Shanghai again, because this item of goods has been delayed for a long time. After a little sorting out, it is urgent to transport it to the interior. If it is transported from Hong Kong to Yangon and then imported into the southwest and other places via the Yunnan-Vietnam Road, the time and cost will be cheaper and faster, so as to avoid the complicated procedures of transporting it from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All the goods have been detained until now, which has reached several months, and the loss of merchants has really been considerable. It is hoped that the Vietnamese government can take into account the difficulties of merchants, comply with public opinion, maintain the past friendly relations, and stop making things difficult and release them as soon as possible. In addition, the 1,000 tons of cotton yarn cloth and groceries loaded from Shanghai on the British merchant ship Granton, the first direct flight between Shanghai and Myanmar at the end of last month, has been notified that it has arrived in Yangon and has been unloaded ashore;

### The Detained Ships Have Been Protested, and the Japanese Side Has Not Yet Released Them; The American Dasheng Ship Was Harassed From the Time It Was Detained; Passengers and Crew Members Hid Their Money and Belongings

The German ships Moufu and Feikang and the American ship Dasheng, which were detained in the waters of Zhejiang, have been under surveillance by the Japanese side in the waters of Zhoushan for nearly a month. Although the German and American consuls in Shanghai have repeatedly lodged protests, the Japanese side has always refused to release them on the grounds that they are still under investigation. The news that the shipping industry has released that it will be released soon is also a general speculation. According to inquiries from all parties yesterday, the Japanese authorities still have no official reply that it can be released soon. As for the passengers on each ship, they have already landed in Zhoushan and transferred to Japanese ships to Shanghai. In addition, the Haifu ship of the German shipping company Lihua Yangxing has not yet sailed out of the Oujiangkou. It is reported that the passengers on board the ship have landed in Yueqing and will take a ride to Shanghai when the ship is scheduled to set sail. It is generally expected that it will have to wait until the Moufu and Feikang ships are released and return to Shanghai before they can set sail;

Recalling the Process of Dasheng's Detention; A passenger yesterday recalled to reporters the process of the Dasheng ship being detained by the Japanese Navy on the 1st of this month, saying that the Dasheng ship was intercepted by a Japanese Navy cruiser 10 hours away from Shanghai. The ship originally intended to tow the Dasheng ship away, but because the ship's side was loose and the masts were also damaged, it no longer towed it the next day. For the next two days, the Dasheng ship was forced to follow the cruiser. On the third day, it was handed over to a Japanese military transport ship and taken to Dinghai. After arriving in Dinghai, passengers on the ship were still not allowed to go ashore. It was not until the 11th of this month that the ship's comprador contacted the Japanese ship Haitong to transfer to Shanghai. When the Dasheng ship was intercepted by the Japanese Navy, there was a great disturbance on the ship. The crew members ran back and forth to hide their money and belongings, and the passengers threw letters and other items into the sea. In addition to 37 passengers, there were also 20 Chinese sailors and 1 foreign shipowner on the Dasheng ship;

### Western Detective Smith Resigns to Join the Military

Western Detective Back Smith of the Public Concession Police Department has served for seven years and has always been highly valued by his superiors for his excellent performance. Recently, due to his eagerness to serve the country, he has submitted his resignation to the Police Department and will leave Shanghai on Wednesday (27th) to join the British Royal Navy. Chinese and Western colleagues of the Police Department held a farewell banquet for Mr. Bae at the Police Department Club on Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday (23rd). At the banquet, Deputy Chief Inspector Robertson delivered a speech, praising Mr. Bae's past achievements in the Police Department. Finally, colleagues from the Police Department presented him with a silver cigarette case and silver flowers and other souvenirs, on which appropriate words were engraved, as well as the names of the presenter and the recipient;

### The French Concession's Rent Ban Infringes Upon Legal Rights

The chairman of the French Concession Rent Research Committee, Duke, recently drafted a rent ban and distributed it to the members of the committee for research. Residents in the concession are paying close attention to this. A reporter from Paiming Society sought the opinions of all parties. According to reports, in terms of law, the Rent Research Committee has no right to legislate. Collecting small rents, although there is no legal basis, is essentially different from the nature of extortion in criminal law. It seems that it is not entirely in accordance with legal principles to convict it of extortion. There are already regulations in civil law for unreasonable rent increases and high prices. Moreover, the sovereignty of the concession still belongs to the territorial country, so all laws in the French Concession should be based on Chinese law. How can we abandon what is inherent in Chinese law and come up with this so-called ban that is unnecessary and destroys the sovereignty of the territorial country? This argument is not to defend the collection of small rents, but to say that matters concerning national sovereignty are major and cannot be echoed casually;

### Beggar Asylum: Opening Soon, Capacity 1,500

Salvation Army Brigadier Maruyama, the initiator of the Salvation Army Beggar Asylum project, is nearing completion and should be operational soon. Located at the intersection of Singapore Road and Hardoon Road, the asylum can accommodate 1,500 beggars. If necessary and circumstances permit, the asylum may be expanded. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council will fully support this project.

Winter Clothing Arrives Soon

According to Western sources yesterday, when the President Cleveland mail ship arrives in Shanghai early next month, it will bring a large quantity of new and used clothing to be distributed to European refugees in the city to help them keep warm. The clothing includes inner and outer garments for men, women, and children, as well as shoes, socks, scarves, and so on. Most of these clothes will be given to refugees from German-occupied areas of Europe. Although the refugees in the European Refugee Camp on Huishan Road in this city have food and lodging, they still lack warm winter clothing. Therefore, these clothes are like timely rain.

Distributing Rice Tickets

According to Major Maruyama of the Salvation Army, in addition to preparing to shelter beggars and providing small loans for self-help, the Salvation Army is also distributing a large number of rice tickets. Each ticket can be used to collect five *sheng* of rice at five designated locations in the two settlements. This is to help impoverished citizens and will continue even after the Beggar Asylum is established. Furthermore, for the purpose of helping poor people from other provinces who are stranded in Shanghai return to their hometowns, the Salvation Army will also purchase boat tickets and send them back if they have guarantors and apply for assistance.

### American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai on the American Ship: Departing for Return Trip with 300 Tons of Cargo

The American mail ship *Collinsworth*, which was tasked with transporting American wheat to Shanghai, has completed its mission in China. It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday morning, taking the route via Dagu, Kobe, Yokohama, and returning to Seattle to report. However, due to the bad weather yesterday, the departure was postponed to this morning. When returning home, the ship will also carry 300 tons of goods purchased in Shanghai. As for the rice and wheat carried by the ship, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee will cooperate with Mr. Jude, the general secretary of the American Navy YMCA, to take charge of the distribution. All refugees in the occupied areas will receive a share. How to distribute it will be decided after the Committee holds a meeting for discussion.

### YMCA Prepares to Celebrate Christmas

All Christians in the city, with Christmas approaching, were notified by the YMCA yesterday that the Association is preparing various celebrations for Christmas and a general outline is provided below for your attention: (1) Christmas Opera, (2) Members' Celebration, (3) Children's Party for the Poor, (4) Various Groups (Shanghai United Mandarin Worship, Small Church Fellowship Group, Huxi Commune, Student Dormitories, Others), (5) Banquet for the Association's Directors, Staff, Colleagues, and Family Members.

Jesus Mail Sealing Dates

As the Christmas holiday season is fast approaching, many foreign businessmen in the city have been going to the Shanghai Postal Administration in recent days to send Christmas and New Year's mail and gifts, causing considerable congestion. The Shanghai Post Office has stipulated the following dates for sealing and dispatching mail to Europe and the United States: (1) Via the Pacific route, sealed and dispatched from Shanghai on December 1, arriving in Victoria, Vancouver, and Seattle on December 16, and arriving in London on January 3, 1941; sealed and dispatched on December 3, arriving in San Francisco on December 19, and arriving in London on January 1. (2) Via the Siberian route, sealed and dispatched in batches on December 3, 6, 10, and 13, and arriving in London by January 10 at the latest. However, because Christmas is near, many people have been using Pan American and other airlines to send mail, hoping to arrive at their destination before Christmas.

### Negotiations Held Yesterday Still Failed to Reach a Resolution

The labor dispute at the French Tramway Company continued. At 5:15 PM yesterday, six labor representatives, including Gu Jingeng and Zhou Guoxiang, carried 14 unresolved demands and held talks with the company's manager, Favre, to discuss solutions. The political director of the French Municipal Council, Marais, and others attended. The negotiations lasted two and a half hours and did not produce any concrete results. Only Article 5 of the above four articles was fully accepted: (When a worker becomes ill, the employer should immediately send them to the hospital, provide a third-class ward, and the employer should bear the medical expenses and pay wages during the illness). In addition, the employer also agreed that the executive director of the labor union could have ten days of leave per month. As for the severance pay method, the employer will give three months of salary (including allowances) to those who have worked for five years or more. Although the employer discussed and negotiated each of the remaining conditions one by one for a long time, a solution that satisfied both parties was not achieved. It is reported that the labor representatives will carefully discuss the results of yesterday's negotiations, make some modifications to the conditions, submit them to the political department, and then agree with the employer to continue negotiations.

### Feliu Returns to Shanghai from Northern Trip: Reported to the Bureau for Duty Yesterday Morning

Feliu, Director-General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, finished his short vacation in North China and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 25th). However, because the plane he was on in Jinan was delayed, Feliu did not arrive in Shanghai until the night before yesterday. Yesterday (the 26th) morning, he went to the Bureau to cancel his leave and handle many public affairs that had been put on hold during his absence.

### Western Public School Moves to British Barracks

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided to move the Western Public School into the barracks left by the British troops next to the Zhaofeng Park. The parents of the school's students have strongly opposed this decision, and their emotions are running high. The Municipal Council is still keeping silent on this matter and only stated that the Bureau's Works Department and Education Department are considering this matter. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, it is difficult to say what has been decided or what has not been decided. All that can be said is that the matter is under consideration. At the same time, the parents of the Western Public School students were still indignant yesterday (the 26th) and expressed their opposition, saying that choosing this school site is not only inconvenient due to the long distance, but also the location is not very safe, and the barracks buildings themselves are not suitable for renovation. A part of them has been damaged after the British troops withdrew and no one took care of them. It will cost more than 100,000 yuan to make them suitable for school use. Furthermore, the fact that the parents of the students were not consulted at all before the school site was moved was also strongly opposed. The Western Public School for Boys is the oldest foreign educational institution in the city. The school building was originally located near Hongkou Park. However, when the Shanghai War broke out in 1937, it had to be moved out. It is currently temporarily holding classes at 282 Kaina Road and plans to move into the former British barracks next to Zhaofeng Garden next semester.

### Shanghai YWCA Fundraising Bazaar Latest News

Since the preparation began, thanks to the efforts of the various committee members and the support of all sectors of society, the results have been very impressive. It is reported that the Dazhong Rubber Factory, Yuanyuan Printing and Dyeing Factory, Sino-British Dispensary, Guanshengyuan, China Underwear Company, Tiger Balm Wing On Tong, Sun Sun Company, Family Industry Cooperative, Wuzhou Dispensary, Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, Xin Da Xiang, Xin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, Sino-French Dispensary, Taikang Food, Jinglun Shirt and Socks, etc., and dozens of members of the Association have donated household items such as hot water bottles, galoshes, printed silk scarves, Green Bear Soap, toothpaste, cod liver oil, yeast tablets, exercise books, universal oil, work clothes, table covers, bed sheets, pillowcases, oil paintings, book covers, toys, knitted goods, etc., totaling thousands of items. Other companies, factories, and stores are also continuing to send donations. At that time, the prices will be set according to the principle of being particularly low, hoping for high volume sales and not seeking high profits. Therefore, donation tickets are very popular with outsiders.

### Rickshaw Puller Beaten to Death: Defendant Acquitted

Xu Wang, a woman from Yangzhou, recently hired a lawyer at the Special Court No. 1 Criminal Division to sue Qiu Deji (also known as Xiao Guangdong), the owner of the rickshaw company at 416 Shanhai Lane, Shanhai Road, and Zhou Asan, Shuangxi, and others for jointly injuring her husband, Xu Quanbai, resulting in his death. The prosecution's gist was that her husband made a living pulling rickshaws. At about 1:00 PM on the 28th of last month, he went to the defendant's company to take over the shift and had a dispute over the order of pulling rickshaws. The rickshaw owner, Xiao Guangdong, first punched him and kicked him in the abdomen, and then ordered the two or three defendants to surround him and beat him severely, causing him to die shortly afterward. This constituted the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code and was accompanied by a civil suit for 15,120 yuan, calculated at three yuan per day for fourteen years, plus 250 yuan for funeral expenses, requesting that compensation be ordered. The Special Court No. 1 heard the case several times. The defendants, Zhou Asan and Shuangxi, did not appear. Only Qiu Deji hired lawyer Wu Peng to appear in court and stated that this fact was an unfounded accusation by the plaintiff, attempting to achieve the purpose of extortion, and requested that the court declare him not guilty. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Liu ruled Qiu Deji not guilty yesterday morning, dismissed the plaintiff's civil suit, and suspended the trial for Zhou Asan and Shuangxi.

### Weng Feipeng: Attempted Murder, Sentenced to One and a Half Years

Weng Feipeng, a Fujianese, was skilled in photography and singing. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he had evil thoughts. He knew that his friend, Wang Lianxi, had a Contax camera (worth 1,500 yuan) for sale, so he falsely claimed that a friend wanted to buy it and invited Wang to meet him in Room 205 of the China Hotel on the night of the 11th or 12th of the month. Later, Weng used an iron rod that he had placed in the room to strike Wang on the head. His purpose was to knock Wang unconscious and steal the camera and escape. However, Wang did not faint and cried out for help. When Weng saw that his plan had failed, he fled and was caught. He was sent to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned him clearly yesterday morning and sentenced Weng to one year and six months in prison as a warning. The iron rod and other items were confiscated.

### Rumors Suddenly Arise: Gold Market Advances Circuitously, Surpassing the 5,700 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's gold market fluctuated erratically in the black market, rising in the morning, falling at noon, and then rising again in the afternoon. Prices surpassed the 5,700 Yuan mark. This was due to the foreign exchange US dollar, which went from tight to loose amidst various rumors, with the military trend softening in the afternoon. The widespread rumor of a "New Central Bank" opening on the 5th of next month sparked buying, causing the market to open at 5,710 Yuan. Under the buying pressure from silver firms and money shops, it soared to 5,730 Yuan. The sudden reversal of the tight foreign exchange market caused gold firms and silver firms to rush to sell, leading to a downward trend. At noon, a certain atmosphere suddenly intensified, with the noon closing price at a low of 5,675 Yuan. In the afternoon, the US dollar exchange rate tightened again, and securities firms and small money shops re-entered the market, causing the price to rise again above 5,700 Yuan, eventually reaching 5,715 Yuan, with a further squeeze up to 5,717 Yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 4,560 taels. Swap buyers offered approximately 7 Yuan to sellers. In the spot market, a certain jewelry store and gold firm sold a total of two hundred and several tens of taels to small money shops, with the price being 7 Yuan lower than the futures price, later needing to be about 10 Yuan lower. Jewelry gold rose 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat. In the early morning, foreign exchange was reported tight, and the opening buying sentiment was still good, jumping up more than 50 Yuan from the previous day's closing price. It was estimated that gold firms took in 20 taels from silver firms at 5,510 Yuan, and the silver firms showed strong interest in taking in, purchasing a significant amount, then raised the price by 20 Yuan. It was reported that money exchange businesses entered gold firms with 30 taels, at a price of 5,730 Yuan. At that time, favorable rumors were rife, and the foreign exchange market was indeed tightening. However, because gold and silver firms, securities firms, and others were willing to sell at the high price, the rising trend was thwarted, falling to 5,685 Yuan. Still, because the exchange market remained soft, sellers hesitated, and prices rose again above the 5,700 Yuan mark. It was estimated that money exchange businesses did 30 taels, at a price of 5,710 Yuan. After 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange rate remained flat, and the transaction volume was also strong at that time. A certain client took in two to three hundred taels, but encountered scattered sellers, and the closing price was pushed down to 5,675 Yuan. It was estimated that gold firms pushed 20 taels to money exchange businesses. In the afternoon, prices first remained flat and then rose. Gold firms entered silver firms with 20 taels, at 5,678 Yuan. Money exchange businesses released 10 taels to securities firms, at 5,675 Yuan. At that time, securities firms purchased, raising the price to 5,705 Yuan. However, shortly after, it dropped by 15 Yuan again, to 5,690 Yuan. Subsequently, gold firms, retail investors, and others successively took in, and gold firms did 30 taels, reaching 5,712 Yuan. Silver firms released 20 taels to money exchange businesses, at 5,705 Yuan. Before the market closed, buying sentiment was good, reaching 5,723 Yuan. As a result, silver firms released thirty taels to money exchange businesses, with the evening closing price at 5,715 Yuan, a squeeze up of 47 Yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 55 Yuan throughout the day. The current selling price of cash gold from Yuan Ben brand was more than 10 Yuan higher than the black market price, and the buying price was 30 Yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 Yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few open transactions.

### Foreign Currencies Rise in Unison

British gold notes showed a slightly weak trend, retreating to 50 Yuan and 5 Jiao in the evening market. American gold notes showed an upward trend, due to the intense rumors regarding the imminent establishment of the new "Central Bank," causing unease. The evening market rose to 16 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and 7 Fen, a further increase of 1 Jiao and 7 Fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes pierced the 4 Yuan mark, with the evening market at 4 Yuan and 1 Fen. Japanese gold notes gradually became firmer, with the evening market rising back to 1 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 4 Fen. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, with the evening market still standing at 1 Yuan, 1 Jiao, and 4 Fen.

### Securities: Sufficient to Show China's Strong Credit; London Foreign Debt Turns Favorable in Unison

Securities in the grey market, with rumors acting as negative news, the market was already at its peak. Many floated out suddenly, and the market price suddenly rose and fell. The morning saw a very severe decline, and the afternoon stabilized slightly, with large rises and small corrections. This is the normal process for the bond market, and it is not worth taking seriously. The rumors are especially not to be believed. Only sporadic small investors sold in the market, and large investors did not come out at all. The market still has a shortage of cash. The future may be temporarily hovering. Yesterday morning, the opening price was only a small 2 Jiao, due to the sudden tightening of foreign exchange and the sudden rise in gold. Lianhe, Sheng, Da, and Wanchun were the first to sell. Category C immediately broke through 64 Yuan. Dingkang, Runde, and Yichang also sold. Hengfu first sold and then bought back. Yitai, Hongda, Runli, Wuyuan, and Lemao all bought in. The noon closing plummeted by several Jiao to more than one Yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu also bought in, and Renchang also replenished a lot. Yitai continued to buy in, and Lianhe, Changkang, and Shunchang also needed it. Category C once reached the Yuan price, but then Lanyi, Xiekang, Tongkang, Tai, and Dechang sold out and continued to loosen, but it was slightly firmer than in the morning. The result was a unanimous return of a small 5 Jiao and a half to 8 Jiao and a half. The total number of transactions totaled more than 3 million Yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Grain: Imported Rice Still Arrives, More Than 12,000 Bags; Not Being Controlled is to Not Manipulate

Yesterday's market for imported rice became even more active due to the activity of speculative hoarding households. Rumors emerged endlessly. There were reports that Hong Kong quotations had risen, so the buying spirit became even higher, and the market price continued to rise. Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 rice became even more of an excitement catalyst due to the Vietnam issue. Xiaowen rice, which used to be priced the same as Saigon No. 2, was not able to be used for rumors and exploitation because of the convenient transportation to Burma and Hong Kong and the continuous flow of sources. And it also did not arouse the interest of general blindly hoarding households. Their "football" transactions were naturally no longer favored. Therefore, the same cash, No. 2 and Xiaowen, actually had a difference of two or three Yuan. Futures and road goods all had a difference of two Yuan. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 and No. 2, Yanghua, and Siteng rose by more than one Yuan, while Xiaowen, Dahua, and Si were just hovering. Selling opened December Xiaowen at 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 4.5 Fen, and at one point in the afternoon it was as low as 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 2 Fen. The evening closing last night was still 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 4.5 Fen, the same as the night before. Compared to this, Saigon No. 1 cash is from 87 Yuan to 88 Yuan and a half, No. 2 cash is 84 Yuan and a half, November is 83 Yuan and a half and 82 Yuan and a half, and December is 82 Yuan, 6 Jiao, and 7 Fen, all larger than the previous day by more than Yuan. Trading was active in both directions, with a transaction volume of 1,200 to 1,300 tons of cash. In addition to being actually consumed by local customers, it was also favored by hoarding households. The price rose by about 1 Yuan, and the transaction volume also exceeded 10,000 bags.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Liangzhou wheel, loaded with 4,894 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday morning and berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yusheng wheel arrived in port at 5 pm yesterday and berthed at Zhasifu Wharf. It is estimated that 16,275 bags were transported from Hong Kong and will begin unloading this morning. (Zu)

New Japonica and Medicinal Seeds, etc., a total of more than 1,000 stones arrived. On the sales side, the general local street guests saw imported rice tightening and were unanimously optimistic, and their appetites were also strong. Therefore, the owners worked very hard to shout out, and as a result, the selling price also rose by Yuan Cu. It was heard that the original packaged New Japonica was 93 Yuan, followed by 90 Yuan and 0 Jiao and 5 Fen, True Special was 93 Yuan and 8 Jiao, Bulk was seen at 89 Yuan and 86 Yuan and 2 Jiao, Green Horn Tea Seed was 81 Yuan and 8 Jiao to 80 Yuan and 0 Jiao and 5 Fen, Feilaifeng was 82 Yuan and a half. Du Yangjian was short of goods and there was no market.

Glutinous rice sales have not been very smooth, so Guonuo is just so-so, still opening at 85 Yuan and a half. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice also brought up the opening slightly due to rising quotations, with Special at 77 to 78 Yuan and Zhongguan at 75 Yuan.

### Third Batch of Imported Flour: Contract Price 18 Yuan and 2.5 Jiao

Flour: The flour market has entered a stable state. It was found that the No. 2 flour mill officially increased its price by one Yuan the day before, and it may not move for a while. The rising wind of various returned goods has also gradually subsided. For example, after the old Che Zhan single rose to a high price of 20 Yuan, it is difficult to rise any further. The market price of imported flour once followed the factory price and shouted high, but yesterday it also stood at between 19 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 6 Fen and 19 Yuan. This is because the local street has newly ordered a third batch of futures imported flour, 20,000 bags to be delivered in December, at a contract price of 18 Yuan and 2 Jiao and a half. Therefore, the tense situation of current flour has gradually dissipated. The two factories in the city have approved a total of about 8,000 bags, the price is still 18 Yuan, and the customer price is 19 Yuan. Because the production of each factory is insufficient, the quantity supplied is very limited.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market situation did not break away from the firm and quiet situation. After the self-opening price rose to 28 Yuan, the Chinese factories also planned to absorb it at this price. However, the arrival of goods was scarce, and they were all designated to be delivered to Japanese factories to limit the price. It was heard that more than 200 bags of wheat were sent from nearby Kunshan and Taicang to the Sanxin Factory, but the price has not yet been officially set. The market transaction is still silent and lacks new transactions.

Mr. Wang Zizhang, please come to the museum for a discussion immediately.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Sales are Thin; Oil Prices Rise Instead

Yesterday's oil market did not show any sign of loosening. Because manipulators used the effect of air and favorable rumors were strong, buying was strong and the market price was high. Unlike soybean sales, which were thin and still buried in a tired state. According to statistics, 150 Dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were made, the price was 80 Yuan to 81 Yuan, 80 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, the price was 74 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, the price was 72 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 450 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, the price was 74 Yuan, 2 Jiao, and a half to 75 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 700 cans of Yantai butter, the price was 106 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 140 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, the price was 103 Yuan and 5 Jiao to 04 Yuan. The above destinations are local street, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. Futures transactions were 1,500 to 1,600 barrels of Qingdao raw oil to be delivered in December, the price was 103 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and a half to 105 Yuan, the closing price was 04 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and a half.

### Yarn and Cotton: Under the Manipulation of Outsiders, the Yarn Market is Unstable from Now On

The yarn market, which had rebounded the day before, weakened again yesterday and entered a revolving route. This is because the actual transaction volume was reduced compared to the previous day. However, the Hong Kong gang's demand for 32-count single yarn continued unabated, so the selling price was uniquely firm. The sales of 20-count yarn were slightly inferior, so speculators who made profits vomited again, and the market price fell back. Looking at the current situation, it is still hovering. Considering the cotton yarn itself, it can be stable, but ordinary outsiders enter and exit from time to time, resulting in an unstable situation.

Shuangma Morning Opening Trend: Firm. Because it closed at a high level the day before, the bulls were very dense. The first plate of 20-count Shuangma was priced at 1,225 Yuan, up 5 Cu, back and forth three or four times more than 1,220 Yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange shrank slightly by 0.3125, the bulls deliberately shouted loudly, and the buying power was slightly strong for a while, rising to 1,232 Yuan in an instant. However, seeing the high price, those who made profits believed that the current sales were not as strong as the previous day and wanted to end. The market price gradually declined to 1,219 Yuan. At this time, the bulls still struggled, until more than half past eleven, the speculative wind was not good, and they sold off one after another, continuing to fall to 1,210 Yuan. The closing price was 1,210 Jiao Yuan. The statistics of the intraday transactions of the cattle were 6,150 Yuan, and the market price of 20-count Ma fell by 7 Yuan. The amount of each gang purchased is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 515 Fellow Travelers 5,650 Statistics 6,200

### Cotton Remains Silent

The current cotton situation is not very interesting, and the overall situation is still stable. As for the factory sides, Shenxin and Yongan factories, the appetite is flat, and the factories such as Xinyuhongzhang have lower yarn prices, which are nearly 100 Yuan different from the Shuangma selling price, and their intention to purchase raw materials is even weaker. Therefore, the cotton market is more and more hesitant, unable to rise or fall.

The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially bought by the same industry, and then sold by spot merchants and liquidated by some bulls. As a result, the closing price fell 5 to 6 pounds lower than the previous day. India fell more than two rupees again yesterday.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has always been unusually quiet these days. The factory side has no intention to purchase for the time being, and the transaction between the same industry is very light. I have not heard of any transactions.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived, and the day before, the Great British Company's Sinmali wheel transported 7,130 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, which arrived in port on the morning of the 24th and berthed at Qichang Stack in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)

### Piece Goods: Cloth Increases "Factory Tax," Implemented Next Month, It is Said

Factory Cloth: The market started to rise and then became tired, because the new rise in the cloth market had not yet gained a firm foothold, and the increase in the uniform factory tax was heard to be implemented from the first day of next month, and because of the end-of-month advance payment relationship, the market was slightly firm, the number of sellers suddenly increased, the market price rose once, and then fell back in an instant. The result was flat, with slight differences in coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, and grey cloth. The factory price remained firm, and Yihua Factory's Jin Sanda bleached cloth opened more than 50 boxes, the price was 41 Yuan per piece, and the local street stores were the most prosperous in small batches.

Dongbu first rose and then fell, and the selling plate was weak. Longtou fine cloth opened at 35 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 6 Fen in the morning, and the retail sellers in the market were very active, so it fell straight to 34 Yuan and 9 Jiao in a short time. The after-market also opened tired, and then rose to 35 Yuan, 2 Jiao, and a half to close due to the same industry's replenishment. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1 Yuan and 8 Fen.

Spring and Autumn

### Regarding "Married Women"

— Sha Xinyuan

The issue of the post office not employing female staff was discussed some months ago, and a strong case was made. The result was a victory, but unfortunately, it was incomplete. You see, in the post office's advertisement for "Junior Postal Staff," women are now included in the "qualifications" section, but these "qualifications" still have "conditions"! — Just read the "Eligibility" section: "All citizens of the Republic of China (excluding married women)... are eligible to apply." This cannot but attract the attention of all sectors of society, especially the women's sector, which should not be overlooked.

From the post office's perspective, they have made a concession. Women "theoretically" did not have the "qualifications," but now they are actually listed among them, which is cause for women to celebrate and be "overwhelmed with favor." But let's think about it. A high school graduate is at least eighteen or nineteen years old, and even those who marry later are only twenty-five or twenty-six. (Due to physiological reasons, it is not advisable for women to marry too late.) This is equivalent to saying that a woman's "useful" period is eight years, and the other fifty or sixty years should be "lived in vain." In this way — according to the post office's calculation, a woman's "life" can only be counted as eight years. We don't know what to say about this.

Therefore, what follows is that women, in order to seek economic independence and further seek equal status between men and women, end up "sacrificing" marriage. — In order not to give up the post office's "golden rice bowl," they have no choice but to endure the pain. Here, I cannot help but congratulate our Republic of China that the post office employs so few women, otherwise, we would have no descendants and become extinct!

The post office is a "national institution," and it openly does not hire "married women," not to mention other companies, foreign firms, and shops. At the same time, this undoubtedly says, "Women should return to the home to specialize in producing 'cannon fodder,' and should not be concerned with social affairs."

We do not believe that the wise postal authorities are not considering ways to accommodate the special physiological needs of women (maternity leave before and after childbirth, which, according to statistics, averages no more than two years of rest for each woman in her lifetime), but instead are "turning their attention" to depriving citizens of their rights. Is it that Chinese women are not able to participate in social activities? Is it that Chinese society has advanced so rapidly that it no longer needs women to do things? Is it saying that China already has 450 million people, and women cannot have both employment and marriage, otherwise China will suffer from overpopulation? We cannot find appropriate solutions to these problems!

Our female compatriots, this is a matter of vital importance. You should continue to strive for progress with the spirit of "struggle" from the past, and you must not remain silent; you must know that this is not just a matter of individual women, but a major issue for the entire country, the entire nation, and even the entire world. Especially in China today, to obliterate the strength of women is to invite self-destruction. We hope that all sectors of society will pay attention, and that the postal authorities will also consider this matter carefully!

Here, especially the women's sector cannot remain silent!

### A Group That Specializes in Tearing Down Posters

— Yu Jun

For the past three years, the people of Shanghai have continued to live a life of pleasure and dissipation, seeking only to satisfy their own selfish desires, without regard for the welfare of the masses. However, there is no shortage of clear-headed and insightful people who do not abandon their responsibilities and actively and energetically engage in work that benefits society. However, these people are rarely noticed by society.

The day before yesterday, I unintentionally discovered something that is worth recording. As I was walking at the corner of Avenue Foch and a certain road, around 6:00 AM, when there were still few people on the street, I saw two or three young men around the age of twenty tearing down posters on the wall. They seemed to be organized, and they were holding small scrapers and cloth bags, putting the torn pieces of paper into the bags. I noticed that they were tearing down advertisements for nude performances at theaters, and I began to understand the significance of their work. I sincerely asked them for the details.

They said: "Although this group of workers does not have a formal organization, there are several others who take the same action. They always come out to do this work early in the morning or at night when there are few people, specializing in tearing down those improper posters, such as advertisements for nude performances at theaters or theaters that use pornography to lure young people; advertisements for 'curing leukorrhea' and 'miracle pills' at pharmacies and halls that deceive people's money. All posters that contain toxins that are sufficient to numb the mind, defraud money, and harm the people are torn down."

Hawthorne Detective Stories

### The Ballerina's Fate

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12: Report and Explanation

He said in pursuit: "The real killer turned out to be Li Zhifan, which I never expected. I was just wondering, Songquan just brought back a —"

Hawthorne seemed not to have heard the last half of his sentence, and interrupted, "Jinshou, how can you say you didn't expect it? You're too forgetful. When we were discussing at Lilan's house this morning, didn't you say that the Group A shoe print was left by the killer? That insight was completely correct."

Ni Jinshou suddenly looked uneasy. His body twitched, and his eyes avoided the floor. He said slowly, "To be honest, that was just a guess of mine, with no basis. I thought the person with the Group A print might be an outsider, but I didn't expect it to be Li Zhifan. Because I really didn't think he would use Lu Jiansheng's shoes to pull off such a trick."

Hawthorne said, "That's because you focused too much on the gun problem, and therefore overlooked that this was a double murder case."

Ni Jinshou said to himself, "The inside story of this case is really too complicated. I have to admit that my vision is really not clear. So, Li Zhifan's motive for killing Lilan was solely for money?"

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Money is one theme, and there is also the resentment of breaking off the engagement. As I see it —" He suddenly reached into his pocket and took out two pieces of paper from a diary. He looked at the two pieces of paper, and his two shiny eyes turned, as if a change had occurred in his mind. He folded the two pieces of paper that he had taken out again, held them in his hand, and did not let Ni Jinshou see them. He looked up and said, "Jinshou, what kind of report did Songquan give? Tell me about it first, and then we will discuss Li Zhifan's motives and actions, which is more appropriate in terms of procedure."

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, let Songquan say it again himself." He rubbed the electric bell button on the side of the desk with his finger. A servant immediately walked in. He ordered, "Call Songquan in."

Hawthorne threw the remaining cigarette butt into the ashtray, and leaned back more comfortably on the sofa, preparing to listen to Songquan's report. Two minutes later, the burly Songquan had entered. I didn't recognize this person either, but looking at his demeanor and the order in which he spoke when reporting, it was clear that he was also a fairly capable person and a rare talent in the detective community.

### University Beggar

— Mingxun

At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, there is a beggar with a emaciated appearance who writes with his fingers dipped in water, in Chinese and English, with clear and elegant handwriting, next to a diploma from a certain university in Nanjing. After reading it, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions, and I wrote a short poem:

Unable to find a place to live, he smears himself with mud,
Wearing ragged clothes, his eyes are dark,
He also graduated from university in the past,
Don't say that beggars come from a low background.

### No Chicken

— Wansui

The price of meat has already risen to more than two yuan per catty, so not eating chicken is naturally not considered shabby. What I worry about is the influx of guests, the nobles with thousands of embroidered shoes. Even without fish, they still want to sing "Let's go home with a long sword!"? How much more without chicken! And that "chicken" is the indispensable "turkey" for the Christmas season.

"Christmas is a foreign festival, not in the category of dragon boat races, where people are free in the heavens. However, is it because 'businessmen' want to do more business, calling it a 'foreign winter solstice'; or is it that 'foreign moons are more beautiful than Chinese ones,' and one has to put on a tuxedo to EVE it up, so the 'foreign festival' is celebrated by everyone in China, and turkey is naturally indispensable. — It is also reported that some people have said that turkey is a Chinese specialty, and expanding the 'foreign winter solstice' is also a way to promote domestic goods.

In that case, it is truly regrettable that the turkeys in the Zhoushan Islands have been completely "controlled" this year!

However, with the European war in full swing, the American expatriates in Shanghai are also continuing to withdraw in batches. The foreign gentlemen's refined interest in this "own festival" may have long been dispelled by greater responsibilities. Even if humorous like Mr. George Bernard Shaw, he would not say "eat chicken to save the country," would he? We seem to have even less reason to generously tell the children that Santa Claus will send sweets and gifts down the chimney!

However, I, who am chewing on vegetable roots, am particularly eager for a taste of turkey this year, because the price of meat has risen to more than two yuan per catty; and because turkey is a specialty of our Zhoushan Islands.

### Solo Recital by National Musician

— Yiyin

The writer has long admired Mr. Wei Zhongle, a pipa expert, who is famous in the music world and has many students. For the past two years, he has promoted national music and won unanimous praise in the United States. He has worked hard. This summer, he returned to Shanghai for recuperation and was hired as a professor of ancient music at Shanghai University. He also held two recitals on the 20th and 21st of this month at the Wu Liande Hall of the Asian Literary Association on Museum Road.

The program for this recital included seven pipa pieces: "Yangchun Baixue," "Feihua Diancui," "Bawang Xie Jia," "Neon Feather Dress Dance," "Qinglian Music House," "Song and Dance Introduction," and "Huaiyin Pingchu"; two erhu pieces: "Illness Chant" and "Good Night"; and three guqin pieces: "Puan Curse," "Three Variations on Plum Blossoms," and "Drunken Fisherman Singing in the Evening." Due to the enthusiastic requests of the audience at the second session, he continued to play the erhu piece "Under the Moon" and the pipa piece "Wild Geese Descending on the Sand," for a total of fourteen pieces. Mr. Wei's skills in pipa martial music are unique. He is accustomed to using bold and powerful techniques to give the audience the pressure of thunder and lightning, while the exquisite parts are like the stretching and rolling of spring clouds, and the competition of exotic flowers; or like the clear sky and bright sun, and the gentle breeze; or like the misty smoke and moon, and the distant mountains and near trees; or like the flowing clouds and flowing water, and the clinking of broken jade; or like murmuring whispers, telling homely stories, or like painful knots, and tragic indignation, thousands of threads, ... all human emotions and desires, magnificent, disorderly and complicated. And when it is released thousands of miles, it suddenly ends. The guqin and erhu are also equally skilled and flowing, reaching the point of perfection, like the sound of jade pendants, like the chanting of gold and stone, and the sounds linger. Mr. Wei's performance is truly divine, dazzling and breathtaking.

The writer privately hopes that Mr. Wei will hold public recitals from time to time in the future, so that the life of national music will shine brightly again, and promote the progress of national music, promote and develop it, revive national culture, and establish a unique national music; the public will also get pure music to edify and comfort them, which is very fortunate.

### Shi Ping Joins Lu Bao

— Xingxing

Shi Ping, this newcomer on the screen, used to study at Qiude Girls' High School. In October of last year, when the "Guolian Company recruited students for the song and dance class, Shi Ping, out of love for singing and dancing and Chang Ying, resolutely applied and was admitted. After some training, she officially signed a acting contract with Guolian. Not long ago, there were rumors that Shi Ping was on leave to go to the mainland, and there were also rumors that she was engaged to a certain gentleman. In fact, the plan to go to the mainland did not materialize, and the engagement with a certain gentleman was also unfounded. Now, news has come that she will join the Lu Bao Theater and meet the public on the stage. It turns out that Shi Ping's leave of absence from "Guolian" was indeed a fact. Before this vacation was over, in order to improve her acting skills, she made this move to join Lu Bao. It is said that the date has been set for the beginning of next month.

It is said that the vernacular dramas performed by Lu Bao Theater have always been welcomed by the audience. Now, with the addition of Shi Ping, a newcomer in the film industry with excellent acting skills, it is expected that Lu Bao will be greatly enhanced.

### Portraits of Female Artists

— Tang Shuo

(7) Gu Lanjun

The general public believes that Gu Lanjun's love affair with Li Ying will damage her artistic prospects. In fact, Gu Lanjun's spirit of loyalty to her job is also undeniable. Now, Gu Lanjun and Li Ying live together in the Huaye Building on Seymour Road. Gu Lanjun has publicly admitted this, and there is no need to avoid it for her. The Huaye Building is an apartment building, and Lanjun has rented two rooms, one of which is a suite. When Lanjun has to film or perform tomorrow, she will move into the suite the night before! Closing the door and quietly memorizing the script, no one is allowed to disturb her, not even Li Ying; this shows that although she needs love, she has not slackened her job, and she is still working hard for her own future at any time.

Lanjun already had a superior position at the Mingxing Film Company. "Peach and Plum争艳" is a work that laid her foundation. After the war, she joined Xinhua and gained a more noble position in the film industry by starring in the film "Diao Chan". After that, it was her golden age. Her love affair with Li Ying occurred when they co-starred in the martial arts film "Huang Tian Shuang", and the recently completed "Bo Ming Hua" is her first crystallization after her union with Li Ying.

The original name of "Bo Ming Hua" was "Money and Love". The content is almost a self-portrait of Lanjun. Lanjun was once favored by Gu Qianlin, a great mountain man who easily obtained her photos for 6,000 yuan. Lanjun's feelings for the mountain man were not bad, but after watching the cartoon "Pinocchio", she was greatly influenced in her thinking. She decided to get rid of the shackles of money, so she opened up another love route and united with Li Ying. The plot of "Bo Ming Hua" is about the change in her love route, but the heroine in the play is not a movie star but a dancer.

Since the plot of "Bo Ming Hua" is produced under this theme, it fully exposes the sin of money playing with women. The producer of this film is Zhang Songtao, Lanjun is his goddaughter, and Li Ying has a teacher-student relationship with him, so Hyun Bulan calls Li Ying "Big Brother", and Li Ying calls Lan Jun "Big Sister". This special name comes from the relationship between the same school.

Lanjun also has considerable interest in drama. In the past, she performed "Qun Ying Luan Fei" with Tang Ruoqing, Xu Xinyuan and others at the Carlton Theater. Recently, she participated in the New Art Theater and played Zheng Chenggong's wife in "Hai Guo Ying Xiong". She is smart, she knows how to grasp the personality of the characters and the atmosphere of the drama, so whether on the screen or on the stage, her acting skills are skillful and successful.

### "Peacock Flies Southeast"

— Chushui Wangsun

"Peacock Flies Southeast" is about to be made into a movie by冉度. Let's talk about its story here. Jiao Zhongqing, a small official in Lujiang, and Liu Lanzhi are a couple with very good feelings, but Jiao's mother doesn't like her and forces her to be sent back to her home to marry again. He and she agreed that they would not marry and would still be husband and wife. After she returned home, the son of the county magistrate proposed marriage. Although she did not allow it, she could not resist the coercion of her brother and nominally succumbed. He knew about this news and came to find her to meet, and decided to die for love together.
