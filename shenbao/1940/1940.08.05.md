### London Arrests Japanese Residents: British Government Rejects Japanese Protest, US Acknowledges British Action as Strong Move, Japanese Newspaper Advocates Recalling Ambassador and Severing Ties with Britain

London: The British government today rejected Japan's protest over the arrest of two Japanese residents in London, stating that the action was entirely for the sake of British "national defense." The British Foreign Office has firmly stated that even though the Japanese ambassador has demanded the release of these two Japanese residents, Britain will not abandon its hard-line stance.

London: When the Japanese Ambassador to Britain visited the Foreign Office yesterday, Foreign Secretary Halifax informed him that the arrest of the Japanese residents was based on the Aliens Act and was done for national security reasons. It should not be seen as retaliation for the arrest of British residents in Japan. The Japanese Ambassador immediately expressed his hope that it would be quickly clarified that the arrested Japanese residents had not committed any crimes endangering national security. (Reuters, 4th)

London: According to sources from the Japanese side last night, the British arrest of three wealthy Japanese merchants residing in Britain will inevitably make the Japanese feel the need to establish a deep understanding with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it will make Japan eager to resolve its disputes with the Soviet Union. Although it is generally expected that the Japanese garrison troops in Northeast China will oppose this move, it is said that the result of this action may be that the Japanese Navy will blockade Hong Kong. While Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu was discussing this matter with British Foreign Secretary Halifax, the Japanese Embassy in London also held a meeting. Although it is believed here that Britain has notified the United States of every detail, the widespread rumor that Britain and the United States have reached an agreement on Far Eastern policy is not considered credible. It is believed that Shigemitsu told Lord Halifax that this kind of arrest was "inopportune." It is said that Shigemitsu also said, "This sudden move by the British authorities seems to have no effect." Informed sources say that Lord Halifax told the Japanese Ambassador that he also hoped that normal relations between the two countries could be restored. At the same time, the government remained absolutely silent about the arrests, but stated that the action was to ensure national security and had nothing to do with the arrest of British residents in Tokyo. It is believed that the Japanese were arrested under the Aliens Act. Only the names of two of the three arrested persons have been publicly released. The two are Makihara and Tanabe. Tanabe is the deputy manager of Mitsui & Co., who came here from India two months ago. It is reported that his wife is a British woman. Neutral parties believe that Tokyo will demand that the British government immediately release the arrested Japanese residents, otherwise, a crisis will occur in British-Japanese relations. (United Press, 4th)

Washington: Political figures here yesterday viewed the arrest of prominent Japanese businessmen residing in Britain in London on Friday as an unexpected expression of vitality in British policy toward Japan. Political figures believe that the British authorities' arrest of Japanese residents indicates that although Britain is busy fighting Germany, it still deeply believes in all the strength of its country. The arrest of Japanese residents is generally seen as a retaliatory move by the British authorities for the Japanese authorities' arrest of British residents residing in Japan on espionage charges. Some people here view the arrest of Japanese residents by the British authorities as a strengthening of the attitude of the British political circles, indicating that Britain has increased confidence in being able to resist any possible German attacks. On the British side, Royal Air Force bombers bombed German industrial centers, oil stations, and other strategically relevant locations, increasing the confidence of neutral observers in Britain. Some people believe that the strengthening of Britain's attitude toward Japan is partly due to the United States' firm policy toward Japan. (United Press, 4th)

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch. Regarding the British arrest of three important Japanese residents in London, the commentaries in various newspapers here all stated that Britain's intention was to force Japan to promptly release the British people arrested on suspicion of espionage and to force Japan to abandon its inclination toward the Axis powers. The commentary in the Hochi Shimbun has taken an unusually strong stance, urging the Japanese government to take drastic and effective measures, recall the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, sever diplomatic relations with Britain, and hoping that the Japanese government will immediately take the necessary actions before severing diplomatic relations to clearly express its attitude to Britain. The Chung Ngoi Commercial News stated that we do not need to investigate the motives of the British arrest of Japanese residents, as this move by the British is clearly a retaliatory action taken against Japan's arrest of British residents suspected of espionage. When the British House of Lords met on the 30th of last month, Foreign Secretary Halifax mentioned retaliatory measures in response to questions. Moreover, the British diplomatic and press circles have also advocated arresting Japanese residents, imposing economic sanctions on Japan, and reopening the Burma Road. The above points clearly prove that Britain's motive is retaliation. The Japanese government should promptly announce the inside story of the arrest of British residents to eliminate Britain's misunderstanding, etc. Newspapers affiliated with the Asahi Shimbun believe that after careful investigation of the case, the Japanese government should immediately take strong measures. Newspapers affiliated with the Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that although Britain arrested Makihara and Tanabe as retaliation, the Japanese government's arrest of spies and suspected spies is absolutely proper. Under these circumstances, the best policy for Japan is to respond to violence with violence. The deterioration of British-Japanese relations should be the responsibility of the British side. The Japanese government should take effective measures against Britain to eliminate the network of foreign spies in Japan. The Yomiuri Shimbun also holds a similar view. (Dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo: The arrest of prominent Japanese businessmen in London has caused great excitement among the people here. The Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having received the report from the Japanese Embassy in Britain, immediately held a meeting. The published official report shows that British-Japanese relations have once again become tense and expresses Japan's firm attitude towards this matter. It is expected that Japan will lodge a serious protest with London. Japanese military personnel are paying close attention to this. Military circles believe that Japan should respond to this British measure with the firmest attitude. Japanese newspapers are full of reports about this matter and demand that the authorities take even tougher measures to suppress international espionage activities. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Tokyo: The "Hochi Shimbun" reported yesterday that the Far Eastern division of the British intelligence department is also involved in international espionage activities within Japan. The Japanese authorities will conduct a thorough investigation. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

London: The diplomatic correspondent for the Times of London mentioned the arrest of Japanese residents in Britain, saying that it is the opinion of people in London that Japan, under the strong influence of countless German personnel, is now trying to completely imitate Italy's actions in Germany before launching a blitzkrieg. When German troops were fighting in Norway, Italian newspapers launched an anti-Allied campaign, forcing us to leave part of our fleet in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the Japanese anti-British action is really intended to at least divert some of our forces' attention to the Far East. It is also said that a part of the Japanese army welcomes war with Britain, but the Japanese government may not share this opinion. The Japanese government is currently busy with the war against China and has no time for other matters. More rational Japanese people undoubtedly understand that Germany's scheme still contains the intention of provoking a Japanese-American war, so that American war resources to help Britain will be diverted to a larger extent to the Pacific, while Germany may also persuade Japan to take the Dutch East Indies on the pretext of the American ban on oil exports.

Editorial

### Japan and the Soviet Union

When the Japanese government, led by Foreign Minister Arita, issued a statement on the Dutch East Indies issue this spring, it was fiercely criticized by the military and radicals. It is said that the reason for the criticism was not entirely due to the excessive mildness of that statement, but rather to blame Arita for his recklessness, believing that he had no grasp of the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations, and rashly expressing his determination to advance southward, which was a reckless adventure. It can be seen that the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations occupies a very important position in the minds of Japanese radicals because if Japan launches a southward advance without first adjusting its relations with the Soviet Union, it risks falling into a three-front war. Generally speaking, Japan's current position is very similar to that of Germany before the conclusion of the Soviet-German Pact. The only difference is that Japan is even more deeply mired in the war of aggression against China. Because of this, before preparing to launch a new adventure, it cannot but deeply consider the threat from the North Asian continent. On the other hand, only during the period when the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain lack understanding and coordination on the Far Eastern issue is it a good time for Japan to actually engage in the southward advance. From another perspective, if the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact last autumn can be seen as a signal for the outbreak of the European War, then if there are new improvements in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan in the future, it can also be seen as a prelude to the outbreak of the storm in the South Pacific.

The Konoe Cabinet's foreign policy recently announced by Yosuke Matsuoka has already been thoroughly analyzed in yesterday's newspaper editorial. On the Soviet side, the Federation Council and the Nationalities Council also passed Molotov's report on foreign policy on the first of this month. In contrast, what Japan has expressed is abstract and ambiguous, but its creeping greed has been exposed. In the report on the Soviet side, it is firm and concrete, always maintaining its neutrality and consolidating its domestic and foreign positions. Matsuoka's speech did not mention any of the major powers, and the phrase "create allies that can be created" undoubtedly takes the Soviet Union as one of its main targets. In Molotov's report, the possibility of improving Soviet-Japanese relations is more clearly shown, and it is even recognized that the Japanese side seems to have a tendency to improve relations. The establishment of ties between the two countries is like a match, and if the two sides are in love, they will hit it off immediately. However, today's issue of improving Soviet-Japanese relations, even if the Soviet Union has expressed this and the Japanese side has this demand, is complicated by various other connections. We cannot assert that there is no hope of success, but it is definitely not as smooth and rapid as the Soviet-German alliance in the past. The theory that Soviet-Japanese relations may be improved did not begin today but was first seen in Molotov's speech on the anniversary of the October Revolution last winter. In the past eight or nine months, the only achievement has been the demarcation agreement for the Halhin Gol area, which was established after a long period of negotiation. What remains is only the "possibility" of improving relations. Major international achievements often emerge between people without knowledge, while those that are repeatedly publicized in announcements and by people but have not been realized for a long time mostly have many difficulties that are difficult to overcome. Molotov certainly hinted at the possibility of increasing relations between the two countries, but he also criticized Japan's imperialist desires. He showed a more reserved attitude towards Konoe's "new system" and its political aspirations. Therefore, the Soviet Union has no reason to worry about its friendship with China, and that is by no means something that Japan's one-sided love can shake. Even in terms of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Far Eastern crisis, there is no need to be pessimistic because the main key depends on how the international situation will change and be used in the future.

For the past year, Soviet policy has indeed focused on neutrality and self-preservation. If it has leaned to one side in the international arena, it has always been toward the Axis powers rather than the democracies. This phenomenon has made some anti-aggression and justice-loving people wring their hands, but it has its own origins and causes in history. Anti-Soviet sentiment that has existed since 1917 and the appeasement policy of the past three years are major factors that have contributed to the shift in the Soviet Union's diplomatic path a year ago. As long as these two factors are not eliminated, they will inevitably hinder the Soviet Union's cooperation in the anti-aggression and security movement. Although Nazi Germany was able to transform anti-communism into pro-Sovietism in the blink of an eye, in some democracies, the anti-Soviet tradition is deeply rooted, and it is difficult to eliminate even in times of national crisis. The Soviet Union, of course, regards its own security as more important than anything else, and at the same time, it is unwilling to simply become a tool for other countries in the face of a dangerous and volatile international situation. However, in this gap, it is also very likely to create opportunities for militaristic countries. The evils brewed and developed in Europe by anti-Soviet sentiment and appeasement policies have already doomed Czechoslovakia and Poland and destroyed Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France. Whether or not the evils will continue to spread in the future depends entirely on whether the democracies can act decisively, recognize reality, and dispel the clouds of doubt and obscurity and the tangential barriers to the Soviet Union, and consider improving relations with the Soviet Union and helping China resist Japan in the same top priority. In Molotov's report, although there was no satisfactory expression regarding relations with the United States and Britain, it did not close the door to improving relations. The impetus for the development of this issue in the future will still focus on the democracies. Recently, the United States' firmness and activity in the Far East are almost unprecedented. Under the various stimuli of recent days, the British side has also begun to reconsider its past measures. Such an attitude of the United States and Britain can, on a normal basis, become the basis for improving relations with the Soviet Union. However, international phenomena often do not develop in a normal direction. For example, Molotov's expression that Soviet-Japanese relations may be improved can be interpreted as the Soviet Union's expression that the possibility of improving relations with the United States and Britain is more distant. However, it must also be clearly recognized that even if Soviet-Japanese relations are improved, Japan will be guaranteed that there will be no more worries about the north, but by no means will the Soviet Union's relations with the United States and Britain actually deteriorate as a result, let alone that the Soviet Union will sacrifice its friendship with China. The subtle distinctions in the middle only need to understand the Soviet Union's policy of self-preservation and neutrality in any international war to understand. Such observations do not mean that Soviet-Japanese relations must be improved. It must be known that: (1) In order to invade China, what Japan seeks from the Soviet Union is not only to guarantee that there will be no worries about the north but also to ask the Soviet Union to stop its aid to China. This is what the Soviet Union should never allow, and what Japan has despaired of. For this reason, Soviet-Japanese relations have not improved in the past three years. (2) In order to implement the southward advance, what Japan seeks from the Soviet Union is only the guarantee that there will be no worries about the north. This is probably the limit that the Soviet Union will consider!

### Errata

In the third line of yesterday's editorial, there is a sentence: "Dongbao called it the 'basic national policy of the Konoe Cabinet'," Dongbao refers to a Japanese newspaper; it was mistakenly written as "Benbao," which was not the original intention. I hereby correct it urgently.

### Production Committee Supports Guam's High Defense Proposal, Funds Will Be Appropriated for Defense Construction, Congressman Maas Issues Statement

Washington: Congressman Maas, a Republican from the Production Committee and a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, told United Press reporters yesterday in an exclusive interview that Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, promised to fully support the Guam complete defense proposal. The defense funding would require approximately US$80 million to US$250 million. Maas announced that the Naval Affairs Committee last week had rejected the Guam defense proposal, but Vincent assured him that Vincent would support the proposal next year. A few days ago, the House of Representatives voted to allocate hundreds of thousands of dollars for non-military improvements on Guam, but no funds were allocated for the island's defense. Maas said, "I firmly believe that Congress is prepared to defend the island. In fact, if the proposal can be submitted for discussion next Monday, Congress may immediately allocate funds. I believe that defending Guam is extremely important for the defense of the United States and its territories." Maas also said that unless Guam is defended, it will be impossible to defend the Philippines. Converting Guam into a complete naval base would require US$250 million. Maas believed that the change in Congress's attitude towards strengthening Guam's defense was largely due to Japan's recent changes in foreign and domestic policies, as well as the rapid evolution of world events. Congress previously rejected the Guam defense proposal largely to avoid offending Japan because the island is too close to Japan. Other members of Congress also said that the sentiment in Washington in support of defending Guam has increased. (United Press, 4th)

Washington: The United States has allocated 4,300,000 gold yuan to increase air force and naval bases in the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island, and other places. These islands are only 700 miles from the northern islands of Japan. According to well-informed sources, this decision to strengthen defense is less than two weeks away from the Soviet Union's action to defend the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait.

### Horinouchi Visits Welles, Personally Delivers Note, Opposes Ban on Aviation Fuel Exports

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi personally delivered to US Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday a note formally opposing the US ban on the export of aviation gasoline. Although Horinouchi refused to comment on the content of his meeting with Welles, well-informed sources said that Horinouchi did not mention the issue of requiring licenses for the export of scrap iron and other raw materials. Horinouchi said that Welles did not explain the US point of view. (United Press, 4th)

Washington: It is reported that the State Department is currently considering what strategy to adopt to prevent Latin American countries from re-exporting aviation fuel obtained from the United States to non-American countries. Attention should be paid to preventing re-exports to countries currently at war. (International News Agency, 4th)

Tokyo: The Japan Times recently reported that ten Japanese kerosene companies have raised 5 million yen to form a kerosene import company to prepare to purchase kerosene exclusively from countries other than the United States.

### Labor George Delivers a Speech Calling for Freedom, the Germ of Nazism Spreads to Britain, Hoping the British People Will Be Extra Vigilant

London - Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George recently delivered a speech calling for the protection of freedom in Britain. He said, "Governments that save the country in times of crisis are often less tolerant of public criticism of the government than administrative organs in times of peace. Special vigilance in times of crisis is a natural trend, for fear that something exists behind our country's politics that could damage the free constitution upon which the country has been founded for hundreds of years. Only eleven months have passed since the beginning of the war, and we have already felt threats to the freedom of our people in all aspects. A small number of independent members of Parliament are resisting these attacks on the basic rights of our country and are working for the true meaning of democracy. All who believe that our country is the only remaining free nation in Europe will surely recognize that our actions are justified. However, the current danger is both significant and growing day by day. The threat of Nazi aggression has not yet become a reality; such attempts by the Nazi Party can be launched at any time. However, the most dangerous Nazi move to invade Britain has already begun: the deadly germ of Nazism, which extinguished freedom on the European continent, has crossed the English Channel and is spreading throughout this democratic nation (Britain). If we do not stop the spread of this epidemic in time, our free system will be destroyed without a trace. Home Secretary Anderson will be responsible for implementing various resolutions to give our country's administrative organs great power, similar to that of present-day Germany, Italy, and the part of France not occupied by Germany. Special tribunals will soon be organized everywhere. These tribunals will have the power of life and death over all residents of the country. These tribunals may not be interfered with by jurors and may impose judgments such as long-term imprisonment and the death penalty. All protections of people's lives and freedoms in trials, such as the Magna Carta and habeas corpus, may be suspended. There is no need to say that there is any chaos, illegality, or rebellion in the country that necessitates such revolutionary changes. However, the government has already shown signs of interfering with the press's legitimate criticism of the government. Even the rights of representatives of the people in Parliament to appeal for amendments to judgments in criminal cases and to review illegal executions have been affected by repeated suppression of public debate. The spy system, which irresponsible people mention in private conversations, is now forming a system similar to Germany's secret organizations. The actions of the old British traitor Tudor may reappear in every village and town in Britain. There is no special speech or action by any legal people's organization in Britain that necessitates such policies of oppression, surveillance, and punishment. During the last war, there were various powerful speeches advocating peace in the country, which even caused various difficulties for the war effort, but there was no record of punishing these peace advocates. MacDonald, Snowden, and Lansbury never let the police interfere with peace advocates. There are currently no signs of anyone undermining the administrative department's war effort anywhere in Britain. There are no organizations hindering the war effort as there were in the last war, nor are there large gatherings demanding an immediate peace as there were in 1917 and 1918. The threat of aggression has united the people, a phenomenon that did not exist in the last war. If we dare to speak out boldly about the various laws and plans used by today's impatient rulers to shackle us, we will say that it is absolutely unreasonable. Nothing can permanently tarnish the morale of our country more than applying this method of an all-powerful country to a country that prides itself on democracy in peacetime. I am just returning from a tour of a part of our country. I have seen that all classes and parties are working together with the government. In fact, all kinds of affairs are requested by these people to exercise power to help stop any aggression against our country. Workers in factories are working hard to assist the government in producing national defense equipment. Farmers in the fields have no complaints about the exceptional obligations imposed on them by the Ministry of Agriculture and are wholeheartedly engaged in increasing food production. They often follow the orders of their superiors with unsuitable tools. The number of volunteer corps in various places exceeds what the government needs, and they have not been given equipment and training by the government. These volunteer corps are all prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend their homeland, and these volunteer corps have no partisan affiliation and no activities outside the law. It would be absurd to say that there is no criticism of the government's measures. There is much criticism regarding the organization of local defense. The lack of proper equipment is bound to cause much comment. Legitimate comments from the people regarding the government's measures will still occur and will be done with all efforts, even at the cost of their lives. Therefore, all punishments and treatments are acts of frustrating the patriotism of the people. The British government has a decisive majority in the House of Commons. It is hoped that they will not use the power of Parliament to adopt plans that are hostile to the spirit of the nation, leading to a fate like that of France. (United Press International, 4th)

### Overture to Japan's Southern Advance Policy: Establishment of "National Policy Company" to Develop Resources on Southern Islands; Expansion of Route under Trusteeship

Washington - Some observers familiar with the situation in the Far East believe that Japan's stated policy of bringing French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies under its control is nothing more than an attempt to boost domestic morale. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo - "Hochi Shimbun" reports that Foreign Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Yosuke Matsuoka is also planning to establish a "National Policy Company" to develop resources on the southern islands. This is the first step in the Konoe Cabinet's southern advance policy. It is said that the initial capital of the National Policy Company will be 500 million yen, and its nature will be similar to that of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Its main task is to develop Japan's commerce and industry in the South Seas, and to try to enable Japan to obtain various major material resources. In short, Yosuke Matsuoka's plan is interconnected with the Konoe Cabinet's determination to create an East Asian group to achieve self-sufficiency. (Havas, 3rd)

Tokyo - Japan Airlines is currently planning to expand its airmail route between Japan and the South Pacific trustee islands. In addition to maintaining the existing main line between Yokohama and Palau, it also plans to open two new lines. One runs from Palau via Yap, Truk, and Pohnpei to Jaluit, a horizontal line from east to west, with a total length of 4,200 kilometers. The second runs from Saipan to Truk, a straight line from south to north. Both new lines can be connected to the above-mentioned main line. It is scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month, with a temporary schedule of one flight per month this year, and is expected to increase the number of flights next year. Saipan belongs to the Mariana Islands under Japanese trusteeship, and Palau, Yap, Truk, and Pohnpei belong to the Caroline Islands. Jaluit belongs to the Marshall Islands, while the American Guam is located between Saipan and Yap. (Havas, 3rd)

Tokyo - Chugai Commercial News reports that according to Japanese officials, although Britain has recently made every effort to expand its economic influence in the Dutch East Indies, Japan's policy of developing commerce in the South Seas will not be affected. As far as Britain is concerned, it has indeed made many efforts in all aspects to promote commercial relations with the Dutch East Indies. For example, the Australian Commonwealth recently signed a new commercial agreement with the Dutch East Indies government, stipulating that the Dutch East Indies should sell coffee, tea, fruits, and other goods to Australia without restrictions. Second, the British government agreed to provide a commercial loan of 100 million Dutch guilders to the Dutch East Indies. Third, the Dutch East Indies ordered cotton worth 4 million Dutch guilders from Britain. All of these prove that Britain is unwilling to sit idly by Japan's southern advance policy and is therefore rushing to catch up. (Havas, 3rd)

### French Press Reviews Peace Plan

Clermont-Ferrand, France - "Le Temps" recently published an article written by its Rome correspondent, Shanti Song, reviewing the outline of a peace plan that Germany and Italy may propose in the future. It roughly stated: "In the eyes of Germany and Italy, this European war has the characteristics of a social war between nations, that is, the characteristics of a revolutionary war. Therefore, one of the most important issues after the war is to enable European countries to establish governments with vocational groups or totalitarian characteristics, so that European nations can live in harmony politically in the future. In other words, the governments of Germany and Italy believe that Europe, from Portugal in the west to Finland in the east, will be easier to establish a common understanding if it can be guided by the same principles, so as to guarantee peace and gradually reduce armaments, so that the governments of European countries will no longer bear huge military expenses, thereby building a new economic order on the European continent. As for the Soviet Union, it seems that it should be excluded from tomorrow's Europe and need not be taken into consideration." (Havas, 3rd)

### Rumors of Germany, Italy, Soviet Union, and Japan Forming Economic Group to Confront Economic Power of Britain and America

Rome - The economic group of Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, and Moscow seemed to be under discussion last night, as the Axis countries began to make various preparations to establish a new group in Europe, so that countries would not have to rely on British economic supplies. Reliable sources said last night that the goal of this new quadrilateral group is to create the most powerful magnetic group in history, so as to unite the entire Europe, North Asia, the occupied areas of China, Japan, and Italian Africa, and to control Britain's economic lifeline. The Axis countries believe that in this way, even with the aid of the United States and South American countries, Britain will not be able to compete with the Axis countries' huge resources. Political sources pointed out that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's recent speech was an implicit willingness to conduct broader and more important negotiations with the Axis countries. The source also pointed out the importance of the long talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and former Ambassador to Italy Bai Wuminfu. According to reports from Rome, Bai Wu will soon accept the most important appointment. It is believed that Spain will also join this group, as Spain has recently made various indications that it is gradually approaching the Axis countries. It is believed here that Spain will bring Portugal into the group. It is also believed here that the Soviet Union may be able to draw Turkey into the group. It is also known that it is solemnly declared here that this huge economic group will not only guarantee the supply of military supplies during wartime, but also supply all the necessities of the people in peacetime.

### German Economic Minister Discusses European Economy

Berlin - German Economic Minister Dr. Raake's article on the future of the European economy, published on July 25, has been recognized by countries around the world as the most important economic event in recent years. This plan has shown practical effects during this week. Sweden's proposal to use Germany as a clearing center, Finland's request to concentrate foreign trade, and the recent commercial agreements between Germany and the countries of Southeast Europe all show the outline of a new European economic order. Germany is gradually becoming the main driving force for building Europe, but Britain is the opposite. The countries most affected by the British blockade are South American countries. Argentina has lost 40% of its European trade, Uruguay has no market for 25% of its wool, and Brazil and Chile have no way to sell coffee, cotton, rice, fruit, and copper. Britain's shift of transportation to the Atlantic proves that there is no foothold in Europe and the Mediterranean. German troops reported that British ships sunk from the 26th to the 28th reached 220,000 tons. Transportation in London and other commercial ports has been completely stopped. The food supply to Britain has fallen into extreme difficulty. (Haitong, 4th)

### Military Commission Announces Overview of Operations for One Week, July 28 to August 3

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the Chinese army on all fronts has fiercely annihilated stubborn Japanese troops on the northern and southern battlefields in the past week (July 28 to August 3), and has recovered many important strongholds, giving the Japanese a major blow. The more important achievements are summarized as follows:

Hubei and Anhui

A part of the Chinese army in Hubei entered Yingshan on the 1st and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The next day, another part of the Chinese army attacked Guangshui, and also killed many Japanese. The Chinese army on the west bank of the Xiang River continued to attack the remnants of the Japanese between Jingmen, Dangyang and Yichang for days, and achieved great results. Now Yichang is surrounded by Chinese forces, and the Japanese are trapped in fortifications and cannot move. Since last week, the Japanese in Anhui have transferred troops from Chaoxian to attack Wuwei. The Chinese army retreated to the left and right, and after seeing that the Japanese had penetrated deep into the trap, they began to counterattack and soon recovered Wuwei County. At the same time, the Japanese in Chaoxian risked danger to rescue them. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to attack the rear of the Japanese, sweep away the remnants of the Japanese, and then Chun Chaoxian, killing many Japanese and seizing many spoils.

Shanxi and Henan

More than a thousand Japanese troops and more than ten artillery pieces in the eastern part of Shanxi, northeast of Jincheng, and the Bagongzhen and Gaodu areas invaded eastward along the Jinling Avenue on the morning of the 27th. The Chinese army repelled them separately. By the evening, countless Japanese troops had been annihilated. Also, a certain Chinese elite unit has been fiercely attacking Wuxiang for days. The Japanese stubbornly resisted in the city and fought fiercely for three days and nights, finally recovering the county seat. As for the Chinese army in northern Henan, they have killed many Japanese in Xiuwu and Jinzuo for days. A part of them besieged Qinyang and are engaging in fierce fighting. The Chinese army in southern Henan once again attacked the South Gate of Xinyang, killing many Japanese troops. They are still attacking fiercely.

Guangxi and Guangdong

More than 2,000 Japanese troops in the vicinity of Suilu and Funan in southern Guangxi have attacked Qulixu in two directions for days, with great ferocity. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, they fought fiercely for several days. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After the Chinese army intensified its fierce annihilation for the past two or three days, they have now been completely cleared. As for the Japanese troops entrenched in Shenzhen, southern Guangdong, they have been attacked by the Chinese army several times in the past week, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the Chinese army launched attacks in different directions, one attacking south to Xinjie and the other rushing into the Southwest Town, an important Japanese stronghold, posing a great threat to the Japanese troops trapped in Guangzhou. Also, there have been fierce battles on the front line of Chaoshan in eastern Guangdong for days. No less than a thousand Japanese soldiers have died under the artillery fire of the Chinese army. The remnants of the Japanese troops are now in an extremely difficult situation.

Jiangsu and Shandong

After the Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu, who had launched a large-scale attack on the Chinese army from Baoying in three directions, were closely surrounded by the Chinese army last week, they have been fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in the past week, killing and wounding more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and seizing a lot of equipment and ammunition. Also, the fighting along the Tongpei Highway is also fierce. The Chinese mobile army is fiercely annihilating the Japanese troops who are acting recklessly in various places. Two thousand Japanese troops from Xintai and Laiwu in southern Shandong have recently invaded the area east of Laiwu, but have been repelled by the Chinese army separately. Also, the Japanese troops in Zhangqiu and along the Jiaoji Railway have invaded southwest of Zhangqiu for days, but have not succeeded and have been deeply surrounded. It is not difficult to annihilate them completely.

Other

In addition, the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi attacked the Japanese stronghold of Huafang on the eastern road of Jing'an on the morning of the 31st, killing many Japanese troops. At the same time, Songbu, an important Japanese stronghold between Anyi and Fengxin, was once again rushed into by the Chinese army, destroying many Japanese barracks and warehouses. On the 27th, Japanese warships on the sea off Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire, but were completely repelled by the Chinese army with a fierce iron fist. Also, Japanese planes have been attacking Sichuan for days, and many have been shot down and damaged by the Chinese army. These are all important achievements of the past week, and are reported incidentally. (3rd telegram)

### Soviet Supreme Soviet Passes Resolution on Annexation of Lithuania into Soviet Union Amidst Enthusiastic Cheers Throughout the Hall; Lithuanian Deputies Soon to be Elected

Moscow - The Soviet Union's Federal Council and Council of Nationalities held their third joint session last night. After separate voting, they unanimously passed the bill on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Last night was the third day of the conference. The conference hall was as crowded as on the second day, including scientists, Red Army soldiers, workers, the diplomatic corps, and foreign journalists. When Stalin and his comrades entered the hall, the guests greeted them with enthusiastic cheers.

Acting President of Lithuania Delivers Speech

Then the delegation of plenipotentiary representatives of the Lithuanian Parliament entered the hall, and everyone stood up and cheered. At this point, the conference began to discuss the third item on the agenda. Federal Council President Antuyev introduced Lithuanian Prime Minister and Acting President Yustas Paleckis to take his seat. The Lithuanian Prime Minister immediately delivered a speech in the Lithuanian language, finally requesting the Soviet Supreme Soviet to annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union, and at the same time submitting the declaration on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union amidst cheers. Then, members of the Lithuanian delegation, poor peasant Petrokas, geologist Mikis, and Cybetas, delivered speeches. They all sincerely requested that Lithuania be annexed into the Soviet Union. The female poet Nilys also recited poems praising Stalin.

Several Districts of Belarus Transferred to Lithuania

At this point, Deputy Ponomarenko, on behalf of the Soviet government, proposed to comply with the will of the Lithuanian people and annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Ponomarenko also proposed, on behalf of the Belarusian Socialist Republic, to transfer Svencionys and other areas to Lithuania, as the majority of the population in those areas are Lithuanian. Under Ponomarenko's proposal, the two houses voted separately, and as a result, the bill on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union was unanimously passed. At the same time, after listening to the declaration of the Lithuanian Parliament's delegation of plenipotentiary representatives, the Supreme Soviet decided to accept the Lithuanian Parliament's request to annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union. As for the Belarusian Republic's government's proposal to transfer Svencionys to Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet also approved it.

Borders of Two States to be Determined Soon

The conference also requested that the Supreme Soviets of the two states quickly determine the exact borders of the two states and submit them to the Soviet Supreme Soviet for consideration. In addition, according to the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet Supreme Soviet decided that deputies from Lithuania in the Soviet Supreme Soviet would be elected by Lithuania. The date of the election will be determined by the Supreme Soviet. The situation at today's meeting fully demonstrates the spirit of national friendship in the Soviet Union. Deputies from both houses will enthusiastically welcome the representatives of the Soviet Union's fourteenth republic. Slogans such as "Long live the Lithuanian people" and "Long live Soviet Lithuania" echoed throughout the hall. (TASS, 4th)

Kovno - In the Lithuanian capital and throughout Lithuania, the Soviet Supreme Soviet's resolution approving the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union has been announced in public places via radio. A parade will be held here today to celebrate, and a grand celebration will be held. (Haitong, 4th)

Kovno - The Lithuanian Cabinet decided yesterday to strip its envoy to the United States, Chaitiga, and its envoy to the United Kingdom, Urbalutis, of their nationality, as the two envoys had condemned Lithuania's annexation into the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Cabinet also decided to confiscate the property of the two envoys and permanently prohibit them from returning to the country. (United Press International, 4th)

### Soviet News Report Analysis: Molotov's Report

Today's Soviet News in Moscow published a commentary emphasizing the importance of Molotov's speech. The report stated: "Since several major powers possessing vast colonies were defeated in the war, Europe is now facing an expanding crisis that could easily become a world imperialist war. During this world war, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has convened three meetings. People's Commissar and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, has delivered speeches for the third time. Mr. Molotov's report fully reflects our country's foreign policy and provides a detailed analysis of the international situation. So, what are the key points of this report? We must acknowledge that each report by the head of the Soviet government contains the following three key elements: (1) a clear expression of the Soviet Union's desire for peace, (2) a demonstration of the Soviet Union's victory and forward progress, and (3) an expression of concern for national security and the sacred protection of its borders.

During the sixth and seventh sessions of the congress, the Soviet Union found it extremely difficult to maintain neutrality and peace because the European situation had undergone significant changes in the past four months. The war, which had been dormant for a long time, has been revived by the German offensive. At the same time, new countries have been drawn into the war, and countless governments have collapsed in succession. As a result, the European situation has undergone a major transformation. In this rapidly changing situation, Soviet ships, thanks to the skill of their pilots, were able to continue along their original course. The Soviet people were also able to remain outside the war and continue their peaceful work. This is extremely important because no one can predict how and when the war will end. Moreover, we anticipate that the war will enter an even more brutal phase in the near future. Given the Soviet Union's position in this highly tense situation, it is imperative to further strengthen its security guarantees, and the most important task in safeguarding its borders is to adjust the relationship between the Soviet Union and its neighbors. Regarding this work, great achievements have been made in the past four months. The peaceful resolution of Soviet disputes is one aspect of this. The initiation of the Soviet-Romanian dispute was not the fault of the Soviet Union. The dispute remained unresolved for 22 years until it was finally resolved.

The developments in the Baltic states are also a great success. At the same time, the return of the Bibru region to the Soviet Union not only corrects a historical injustice but also avoids potential border disputes. The financial cliques of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, under the direction of the Soviet Union's enemies, attempted to engage in activities, but these regimes have now been overthrown. This is not only due to Soviet diplomacy, but the main reason is that the people of the Baltic states and the Bibru region, under capitalist oppression, have long yearned to join the Soviet Union to gain liberation. Who does not know the welcome that the Red Army (liberators) received in the Bibru region? At the same time, who does not know that the people of the Bibru region, despite being persecuted by the Romanian authorities, have flocked back to their true homeland? All of this can be confirmed by the speech given by the Bibru representative at the Supreme Soviet Congress yesterday.

The passage of the resolution to establish the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Supreme Soviet Congress has created a new page in history. Is there any precedent in diplomatic history for such a rapid and peaceful resolution and planning of borders? This kind of achievement can only be obtained by the Soviet Socialist Republics because they all follow the wise national policy of Lenin-Stalin. Every worker can understand and passionately love the Soviet system. This can be demonstrated by the recent events in the Baltic states. The people of these three countries unanimously support the establishment of Soviet power. Without deep understanding, there could not be such enthusiastic and unified sentiments.

The strength of the Soviet Union is not only due to its rich reserves; the Soviet Union values the strength of its people most. Although the strength of the Soviet Union has caused dissatisfaction in some quarters, the increase in national power must make enemies uneasy. Molotov stated in his report: "We do not need the cooperation of certain gentlemen who are dissatisfied with us to carry out our work." This statement is extremely sarcastic. Although these insidious people only express their dissatisfaction in conversations, we do not need to pay attention to them. However, if "dissatisfaction" leads to anti-Soviet actions, the situation will be very different. In this regard, Mr. Molotov has urged the British and American governments to pay attention to their responsibility for the illegal actions in the Baltic region. The United States recently illegally detained cash purchased by the Soviet Union from banks in the Baltic states.

Illegal actions against the Soviet Union may become even more intense in the future. Molotov has briefly stated in his report that, for example, the mysterious planes flying over Baku and Batumi from Iran and Turkey, and the fact that the Finnish authorities are persecuting pro-Soviet elements, all show that anti-Soviet conspiracies are underway. In this poisonous international relationship, we should redouble our preparations to mobilize at any time and monitor everything. In this regard, we must reiterate Stalin's words: "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's conspiracies cannot be implemented."

Our country is powerful and invincible. This national power is based on the spiritual and political unity of the 193 million people of the Soviet Union. This national power is based on the supreme power of the Red Army. This national power is based on the great policies of the wise national leader, Stalin. In short, no force in the world can shake our country. Molotov's report was transmitted from the Kremlin to the whole world, proclaiming the Soviet Union's power and policies to its friends and enemies who are unable to do anything about it.

### Preparatory Negotiations Held Between Romania and Bulgaria to Discuss the Dobruja Region Issue

Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov met with Romanian Ambassador to Bulgaria, Cardel, in Sofia yesterday for a lengthy discussion. Political figures claim that the conversation concerned the initial steps to resolve the Dobruja issue. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

Romanian Ambassador to Bulgaria, Cardel, arrived in Sofia yesterday to conduct preliminary negotiations with the Bulgarian government on behalf of the Romanian government. Sources with inside information claim that the Bulgarian delegation will travel to Bucharest this week for formal negotiations, but the date has not yet been announced. Haitong News Agency's correspondent in Sofia learned that Romania's invitation and suggestions prove that Romania is willing to conduct negotiations on the Dobruja issue. It is reported that its proposal was delivered to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry by the Romanian Minister to Bulgaria on the 2nd. It is expected that the negotiations will proceed smoothly without any difficulties. Bulgaria is currently insisting on its demands and is unwilling to accept any compromise. Regarding the speculations in the Romanian newspapers, Bulgarian officials solemnly rejected whether the city of Silistra on the Danube would be ceded to Romania. The Bulgarian newspapers are very optimistic about the upcoming negotiations. The Savolo newspaper stated that Bulgaria's demands for Southern Dobruja will surely be met. Other newspapers also hope that the resolution of the territorial disputes between the two countries will promote friendly relations between the two countries. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

It has just been learned in Sofia that the Romanian Minister to Yugoslavia will come here to negotiate with the Bulgarian authorities on the Dobruja region issue. In addition, the Romanian Ambassador to Italy will go to the capital of Hungary to discuss the issue of Outer Transylvania with the Hungarian authorities. After Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu met with the German and Italian authorities in Salzburg, Austria, they told reporters that they would conduct direct negotiations with the relevant countries regarding all outstanding territorial issues. The current travels of the Romanian diplomatic representatives are likely for this purpose. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, is currently making a short visit here in Sofia. Bulgarian King Boris granted an audience yesterday. Papen then left here on the Orient Express that evening to go to the capital of Turkey. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

In Bucharest, the Romanian Iron Guard recently secretly distributed 10,000 leaflets throughout the country, urging Romanians not to surrender to the enemy, to be aware of the current crisis, and to say that since Romania has lost its first line of defense in Bessarabia and Bukovina, Dobruja and Outer Transylvania will also be lost one after another. "We have been deceived by lies at home and abroad. The leaders abandoned the people when the country was in danger. Romanians, remember that those who have created the current ambitious war situation are not your friends and will not help you. Take back your homeland, wake up quickly and work. Time waits for no one, do not give up an inch of national territory." The above leaflets were distributed at the same time as the leaflets of the same nature issued by former Romanian peasant party leader Maniu, and the sentiments expressed in the Romanian newspapers are roughly the same. The popular newspaper said that the military victory that dominates the world should not cause Romania to change its goal of territorial integrity and political and economic independence. The pro-Nazi current affairs newspaper stated that no month should be used as a reason for Romania to make unilateral concessions in order to maintain peace in Southeast Europe. At the same time, leaders of the National Țărănist Party, Maniu, and the Iron Guard are now becoming more and more closely related. It is heard that they have agreed not to participate in the organization of any government unless Maniu forms a cabinet and has the right to choose its members. It is also heard that the people of the country are quickly providing assistance to this movement, believing that it is absolutely necessary to find a way to protect the national territory at present. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

### Greek Prime Minister Reaffirms Neutral Policy

On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the ruling of the Greek totalitarian government in Athens, Prime Minister General Metaxas delivered a speech to the public at 10 p.m. yesterday, saying that in view of the changes in Europe due to the war, Greece will spare no sacrifice to protect its territory. If Greece can maintain its own peace, it will be the greatest contribution to Europe. We sincerely maintain neutrality and hope that our neighbors can also respect it. Although I am committed to supplementing military equipment, I have not forgotten peaceful work, such as the development of culture and the relief of poverty, and I will not hesitate to spend money on it. Mr. Metaxas finally hoped for the unity of Greece and the early peace in Europe. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

### Economic Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and Hungary

A delegation led by Hungarian cabinet member Nickel will depart for Moscow today to conduct negotiations with the Soviet authorities on the conclusion of a Soviet-Hungarian economic and trade treaty. Preparatory work for the negotiations has been completed. Hungarian political figures believe that the treaty will be signed soon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 4th)

### Indian Tycoon, Maharaja, Passes Away

Prince Maharaja of Mysore Province, India, passed away in Bangkok yesterday at the age of 56. During the reign of Prince Maharaja, all the progress in Mysore Province was the best in India, and Prince Maharaja was the second richest man in India. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

### Pravda's Observation: The European War is About to Expand; Increased Relations Between Germany and the Soviet Union Confirmed

Regarding Molotov's report, Pravda commented: "The speed of France's failure has been explained by Molotov. According to Molotov, France's defeat was not only due to insufficient military preparations, but the important reason was that the French ruling class excessively underestimated the power of the Soviet Union in European affairs. In short, any foolish politicians who have not abandoned the idea of lightly celebrating the Soviet Union should read Mr. Mo's words. Regarding foreign relations, the Soviet Union is still following the policy formulated by the 18th Communist Party Congress. In a word, the Soviet Union is engaged in promoting friendly relations with any country. The recent changes in the European situation have not only not weakened the power of the non-aggression pact, but have also proved the importance of the pact. The Stalin diplomacy policy implemented by the government is very clear and is supported by the entire population of the motherland. Although various parties have done their best to slander the Soviet Union, countless working masses in the world are still very sympathetic to Mr. Shi's foreign policy. We are now on the eve of the great war between Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States. The European war is about to expand and become a world imperialist war. Under these circumstances, the Soviet people must do their best to strengthen the defense forces of the motherland. (TASS dispatch on the 4th)

### Philippine President Advocates Abolishing Political Parties

Philippine President Quezon firmly advocated the abolition of political parties in the Philippines at an information meeting yesterday. Quezon believes that the existence of political parties is actually harmful and not beneficial. He vaguely stated that there should be no political parties in an ideal country. If democratic politics do not abolish the current political party system, they will inevitably lead to disillusionment. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

### German Authorities Strictly Blockade the French Border, Seemingly Preparing to Attack Britain; Hamburg Port Suffers Air Raid and Catches Fire; British Aircraft Bomb French, Belgian, and Dutch Airfields

The activities of the German troops in the occupied area of France yesterday became an undeniable mystery, because the German authorities strictly blockaded the border between the occupied and unoccupied areas of France. Even diplomats taking cars intending to go to Paris were blocked at the Molin control station. The Siamese Minister and U.S. Navy officers intending to go to Paris were forced to turn back halfway. The Dutch Minister intending to go to The Hague via Paris was also not allowed by the Germans. There are currently no trains running between the two regions, and mail has also been suspended. About one million letters in the unoccupied area are piled up like a mountain, waiting to be sent to the occupied area. The French government announced last night that it had allowed refugees from Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Alsace, and Lorraine, as well as residents south of the Somme and An rivers, to return to their original residences, but this matter is still awaiting a decision from the German side. Neutral observers believe that the closure of the border is because Germany is preparing to attack Britain on the French coast, and news from the Spanish border also said that German troops are being mobilized in the occupied area of France, so this belief seems reliable. (United Press dispatch on the 4th)

London Gazette stated that yesterday British bombers flew to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands to bomb several airfields. Many hangars and runways were hit. Ground aircraft were also subjected to low-altitude bombing and strafing. Enemy fighters offered some resistance. One British aircraft went missing. At the same time, British aircraft are still systematically attacking military targets within Germany. On Friday night, the main targets of the British attack were oil depots in Emden Hamburg, and Sarsbecken, as well as several airfields. Hamburg and Sarsbecken both caught fire and suffered heavy damage. One British aircraft crashed into the sea while flying back after completing its mission. The British Air Ministry's intelligence office recently stated that the British Air Force attacked the Dutch Schiphol air force port yesterday and destroyed several enemy four-engine aircraft. The German Sarsbecken oil refinery is an important source of gasoline, kerosene, gas, and lubricating oil. It was hit by 30 shells yesterday. British aircraft dropped eight tons of high-explosive bombs on this target. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Enemy planes dropped several bombs in southeastern England last night, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

The Hague Yesterday British aircraft bombed military-related locations in The Hague for the first time, and there were no losses. Only an old man (72 years old) and a 13-year-old girl were killed by the bombing. One of the old man's servants was injured. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

Berlin This afternoon, the German military report stated that the German Air Force conducted reconnaissance over the North Sea yesterday. Last night, German aircraft bombed Stanlow, an important oil port near Liverpool, and there were many fires. British anti-aircraft gun bases on the Isle of Canvey and the goose sea were attacked by air. British aircraft attacked northern and western Germany last night. Although they dropped more bombs than last time, the damage was all in places unrelated to strategy, so the impact was minimal. (Haitong correspondent)

London Last night, officials here stated that the important German port of Hamburg was devastated by bombing, and there were many fires that could be seen from 50 miles away. Recent British bomber attacks have again destroyed the oil depots and airfields around Hamburg. (International dispatch on the 4th)

Hamburg Hamburg suffered its 50th air raid by British aircraft the night before. The British aircraft were unable to soar into the clouds and indiscriminately bombed non-military targets, and encountered intensive fire from German anti-aircraft guns, so they left without dropping bombs. However, many bombs were dropped in the suburbs, injuring two people and collapsing many houses. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

Berlin A German military expert released a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, saying that Britain has now lost several more merchant ships, totaling more than 72,000 tons, including three oil tankers, all sunk by our submarines. British propaganda often says that Germany will lack gasoline in the near future to carry out maritime warfare, but this statement is not consistent with the facts. On the contrary, British oil tankers have been repeatedly sunk by our submarines. Due to the German and Italian blockade of various ports, the British Navy's maritime routes are becoming longer and longer, and gasoline supply has become a very serious problem. In addition, our air force is constantly bombing its gasoline depots. For example, on the 2nd of this month, our planes bombed the Thames Haven gasoline depot, and a fire broke out on the spot, and the losses must have been very heavy. Our planes are still attacking enemy military targets, but enemy planes are still targeting our country's civilians as their bombing targets. The day before yesterday, enemy planes raided Kifkohn and destroyed several farmhouses. Military tickets near the area were not damaged in any way, but the residents in the farmhouses were all bombed. (Haitong dispatch on the 2nd)

### German Military Releases Weekly War Situation

Berlin There were no major battles during the week from July 27 to August 3. The German Air Force continued to bomb various areas on the south bank of the English Channel, and the distance to the British Isles became shorter and shorter. The same team of planes can bomb back and forth several times a day. It only takes a few minutes to fly to the English Channel. Although the German Air Force is not very active at present, the airfields, aircraft factories, and munitions factories in famous British seaports have been bombed by German aircraft. According to news from neutral countries, Britain has now closed the navigation of the Thames River. German aircraft bombed British escort convoys and individual ships with remarkable results. The German Navy also made great contributions. German submarines and motor torpedo boats are also active everywhere. The western entrance and exit of the English Channel, the southern entrance and exit of the Bristol Channel, and the Irish Sea are easily reached by the power of the German naval base and can be directly threatened. Germany sinks an average of between 60,000 and 97,000 tons of British ships every day. The losses suffered by the British naval battle are also very heavy. Although British aircraft bombings of Germany are becoming more and more intensified, they mostly target German civilians, such as Hanover, Hamburg, and other places without military targets, but British aircraft frequently bomb them, and Germany will give an appropriate reply. The air war situation seems to be becoming more and more tense. In the Mediterranean, British shipping is greatly obstructed by Italy. Malta has lost its effectiveness. Gibraltar has been repeatedly bombed by Italian aircraft, and the British fleet in the port of Alexandria is often attacked by Italian aircraft, and the losses of ships are very heavy. Regarding the war in foreign territorial waters, the British giant auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara" (22,209 tons) was defeated by a German warship and seriously injured and fled into the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Germany is now keeping silent about the development of the war situation because Germany is now in a position to decide when to launch it. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

### European War Chronicle (1) - A Diagram of German Military Strategy

Previously, this newspaper published a selective translation of "Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937-1939" by Sir Nevile Henderson, the former British ambassador to Germany, to inform readers about the background of this European war. This war is almost a year old, and the land battles on the continent have long since come to an end, while the war between Britain and Germany remains unresolved. We have collected a wealth of materials, all first-hand reports from European and American journalists and writers. Now, we have selected the most outstanding ones to translate and publish in this newspaper under the title "European War Chronicle," which will be published daily. The table of contents is disclosed below:

(1) A Diagram of German Military Strategy
(2) A Survey of the Western European Battlefield
(3) The Self-Description of a British Air Force Warrior
(4) The Retreat of the British and French Allied Forces
(5) The Reasons for France's Defeat
(6) The Eve of Hitler's Order for a General Offensive
(7) The Refugee Story of Norwegian Female Writer Sigrid Undset

This is the first article, titled "A Diagram of German Military Strategy," written by Lionard Nason, a military reporter for the American Look magazine and a well-known American military affairs writer. During the last European war, he served in the 76th Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. Army and wrote extensively about the last European war. The original text is translated and recorded below.

Hitler's mechanized forces launched a general offensive in Western Europe with unstoppable momentum, astonishing the world. However, to military experts familiar with the actual situation of the British and French Allied defenses, this victory achieved by the German blitzkrieg tactics was not surprising. What was surprising was that the British and French Allied forces were so helpless against these anticipated tactics.

General writers and commentators, without thinking, rashly praised Hitler as a military genius and spread rumors that the German army had some secret new weapons, which were all deceptive. The strategy used by Hitler this time did not escape the confines of German strategists of the past. For hundreds of years, this strategy has been fundamentally consistent. The only difference is that Hitler was able to concentrate and utilize the fastest and most destructive force in history.

The strategy used by the British and French Allied forces in this European war focused on hiding behind the Maginot Line and the extended line along the Belgian border to the North Sea, adopting a defensive posture. The border area between Belgium and Germany was also fortified with strong defenses, seemingly allowing for complacency. However, this Maginot extended line on the border between France and Belgium was only a field defense work, not a permanent defense work. This kind of defense work was nothing more than bunkers connected by trenches, with tank defense lines built from railway tracks, and the entire line was protected by barbed wire obstacles.

The weakness of this defense line was east of Sedan, at the junction of the Maginot main line with the French extended line and the Belgian extended line. Therefore, the defense of Sedan was extremely important. If this point was breached, the side of the Maginot main line would lose its stronghold, and the German army could encircle the rear, invade French territory, and then march triumphantly along the Aisne and Marne rivers directly towards Paris.

Sedan had the Ardennes Forest as its natural barrier. The forest area stretches from Namur to the Luxembourg border, with mountains and rivers crisscrossing, and the Meuse and Semois rivers extending through it. This natural barrier had the potential to be an impregnable pass. It was extremely difficult for motorized units to fight in this rocky jungle, and the defenders could also use it as cover to avoid air raids.

When the German army invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, those familiar with the terrain immediately thought that the gateway to Sedan had been blocked. Neutral observers all believed that the French army must have been stationed in the Ardennes Forest area to protect Sedan. However, four days later, the German army had already crossed the Vierre River on the northeast side of the Ardennes Forest and occupied Sedan, advancing at a speed of 45 miles per day. This speed was unprecedented in history.

This proves that the Ardennes were not garrisoned, Sedan was not defended, and the Maginot Line had to change its strategy in a battle and retreat. The day after Sedan fell, the French authorities announced that they would abandon positional warfare and switch to mobile warfare. The German army's new tank corps was able to engage the Allied forces in the open field. The Allied forces were completely unprepared for this kind of mobile warfare, while the German army had been conserving its energy and was invincible. The outcome had already been predetermined.

The principle of all strategies is to avoid the real and attack the weak, that is, to concentrate superior forces to attack the weakest point of the enemy. This strategy generally requires dividing the army into two major corps, one being a holding force and the other being an encircling force. The holding force first makes a feigned attack in front of the enemy's position. Once the enemy's line of sight is drawn by this feigned attack, the encircling force bypasses the enemy's side and attacks the rear. The famous Schlieffen Plan of Germany adopted this principle.

Simply put, this plan stipulated that five armies would invade France, the First Army to the Fifth Army, arranged in a line from north to south. The First and Second Armies were responsible for the encirclement, taking the road through Belgium to attack Paris, while the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies were responsible for holding the French army along the line from La Fère, Rethel to Verdun. After the encircling force advanced to Paris, it turned eastward, making the French army face the enemy on both sides (see Figure 2).

The German army adopted this plan when it invaded France and Belgium in 1914. At the beginning of the war, the German army originally hoped for a quick victory. However, after the German army attacked Amiens, it was far behind schedule, and the supply of military supplies could not keep up. The German Chief of Staff, Moltke the Younger, abandoned the Schlieffen plan to attack Paris and instead adopted a strategy of annihilating the main force of the French army. The German encircling force then turned to attack the southeast.

After the German army reached the east of Paris, the French army saw that the enemy's right flank was empty and knew that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. They divided their forces and encircled the German army's right flank from the northwest. At the same time, the garrison in Paris rushed to reinforce the holding force along the Marne River. At this point, the German army was in a predicament of being attacked on both sides and had to implement a general retreat. The French army was able to turn defeat into victory in the Battle of the Marne. (See Figure 1)

The strategy used by Hitler in this European war was also the same. However, this time the German army broke through from Sedan and cut the French army into two sections; one was trapped in the Maginot Line, and the other was cut off on the west bank of the Meuse River. This strategy used two encircling forces, called overlapping encirclements.

This plan stipulated that the First and Second Armies would attack Paris from the north, the Third Army would advance from the northeast, and the Fourth Army would encircle from the east. In Belgium, the German army used three army corps of superior forces to attack the British and French isolated army, while the Fourth Army encircled from the east in the Ardennes. The Fifth Army held the defenders of the Maginot Line in Lorraine.

The advantage of this overlapping encirclement strategy lies in the fact that when any one army is forced to retreat, the other armies can attack the enemy forces pressing the retreat. In other words, the five German armies can all respond to each other and use superior forces to pressure the Allied forces in Belgium or the main force of the French army at any time and place. When the British and French Allied forces were trying their best to resist the offensive of the German Third and Fifth Armies, the German First and Second Armies were already carrying out a flanking offensive. If the Allied forces wanted to reinforce the flanks to resist this flanking offensive, the German Third and Fifth Armies had already taken advantage of the situation. This situation was truly a case of losing sight of one thing while attending to another.

As for the factors of the German army's success in tactics, it lies in the use of tanks and maintaining the liaison between the various armies.

Before the launch of the German blitzkrieg, there were two schools of military thought in the world. The British and French believed that tanks were an auxiliary weapon, and their main function was to assist infantry. The method of combat was to first bombard with artillery, then attack with infantry, and then pursue with tanks when the enemy retreated. In the early stages of engagement between the two armies, tanks were often used as reserves, and their speed was often controlled by the speed of the infantry, traveling two miles per hour in the open field. Over the years, the German side had long regarded tanks as the main force, while infantry had retreated to an auxiliary position.

It was difficult to determine who was right and who was wrong in these two theories before the war, but the right and wrong were immediately apparent when the two armies engaged in combat. However, the Allied forces already knew that they had made a big mistake, but they still did not try to remedy it. Although General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, was immediately dismissed, this mistake was not due to a day or two and could not be blamed on Gamelin alone.

While the Allied forces were replacing their commander and trying their best to find a defensible position, the German army had already followed the Schlieffen Plan and advanced directly from Sedan to the line of Rethel, Laon, and La Fère. Four days after the breakthrough at Sedan, the key to the Allied defense line was already in the hands of the German army. Since then, the German motorized forces immediately advanced to the English Channel on one side and occupied Paris on the other.

The liaison between the German armies was maintained by radio. The planes in the sky, the tanks on the ground, and the mechanized infantry were all equipped with radios, communicating with the headquarters at any time and place. The orders from the headquarters and the reports from the captains were all transmitted by radio. The advance, accommodation, and supply of the various armies were all directed by radio. The marching was rapid, yet still orderly. The encircling force rushed 200 miles in two and a half days. How could it not be victorious?

### Germany May Send Paratroopers to Defend French West Africa; Dakar Port is Full of German Spies

London - The London Times reported today that Germany is likely to send aircraft and paratroopers to the port of Dakar in French West Africa. The port is also a base on the air route between Europe and South America, and is the closest point in Africa to South America. Recently, a Polish ship left the port of Dakar without the permission of the French authorities. The captain of the ship told the British authorities last week that the French would detain the ship and that the port of Dakar was full of German spies. It is still unknown whether the British government will take any action to prevent Germany from transporting paratroopers to French territory. (International Telegram, 4th)

Rio de Janeiro - The Spanish transatlantic liner "Conte Verde" suddenly appeared in the outer port here yesterday, causing speculation that Spain may soon join the European war. The ship was originally scheduled to sail directly from Montevideo to Tenerife without stopping at Brazilian ports. Officials on the ship refused to explain the reason for its unexpected arrival here. The "Jornal do Brasil" said that the ship's "arrival at Guanabara Bay is due to Spain's imminent entry into the war." Naval officers on board the ship claimed that the ship was avoiding the seizure of its cargo by British blockade ships, believing that Spain would soon enter the war. (United Press Telegram, 4th)

### Netherlands to Implement Clothing Rationing System

Amsterdam - It was announced here yesterday that the Netherlands will follow Germany's example and implement a clothing rationing system to ensure the supply of clothing to the people, especially the poor. As in Germany, a voucher will be given to those with low salaries who need to purchase inexpensive clothing. Children under the age of three can purchase clothing without a voucher. It is understood that the clothing voucher will be implemented from August 12. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Cairo - According to an announcement from London, since the start of the war in Libya, the British have suffered 20 dead and missing, and 10 wounded. The Italians have suffered 20 dead and wounded each, and 472 captured. The Middle East Command stated that the aforementioned 20 Italian deaths and injuries each refer specifically to the Italian corpses buried by the British and the wounded Italian soldiers captured alive by the British. The number of Italian prisoners of war has now reached 818. The number of Italian casualties totals several hundred. The Italian army also suffered the loss of soldiers, guns, and tanks in its adventurous action to recapture the Capuzzo fort. According to ground and aerial observers, enemy corpses are piled up around the positions, many unburied, and destroyed tanks from motor transport units are scattered everywhere. Those captured admit that the hospitals are full of wounded. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)

### Churchill Warns the Nation Not to Relax Vigilance; The Possibility of a German Invasion Has Not Been Eliminated

London - Prime Minister Churchill recently issued a statement saying that even at this time, the possibility of a German invasion of our country has not diminished in the slightest. All of our people should remain vigilant and not relax in the slightest. As for the rumors spread abroad that Germany may not carry out a "blitzkrieg" against us, this is purely German propaganda. Their intention is to induce us to neglect our vigilance. The people must not fall into their trap. From this statement by the Prime Minister, it can be seen that the government is constantly on the alert. In addition, there is another phenomenon worth noting, namely that in peacetime, every year on the summer bank holiday (i.e., August 4th and 5th), a large number of Londoners would go to the seaside to escape the heat, crowding the streets. However, at this time, there are very few. The reason is that the majority of the city's residents have already been evacuated, and those who remain here are all in important positions and cannot leave even for a short time on holidays. In short, on August 5th, all factories will break with traditional habits and work as usual. This tense scene is unprecedented in the last 69 years. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)

### General de Gaulle Criticizes the Vichy Government

London - General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French National Committee in England, broadcast a message from London to France and French territories last night, saying that not all parts of France followed the "old men of Vichy." Hitler's roar and Mussolini's barking have frightened these old men. However, what I can tell the people tonight is that this is not the case everywhere. Many parts of France have now risen up with the determination to preserve French territories. Today's holders of governing power in the French colonies are fulfilling their duty if they refuse to apply the dishonorable armistice terms. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)

### Commemoration of the Songhu Resistance Approaching; Authorities Adopt Strict Security Measures; Armed Control to Maintain Order in View of Repeated Terrorist Acts Within the Concession

The raging Songhu War has passed in a flash for three years. The third anniversary of "August 13th" is approaching. The concession authorities in this city, seeing that the situation within the concession is becoming more complex, have no choice but to increase security measures. Furthermore, in view of the repeated terrorist acts within the concession, they will adopt even stricter special security measures than in the past. According to sources, the concession authorities and the Shanghai garrison are planning to make the security situation more thorough, and the cooperation between the military, police, and business community will be even closer.

Military, Police, and Militia Mobilize Simultaneously

At that time, in addition to the police officers of the two concessions going out on patrol, the garrisons of various countries in Shanghai will also mobilize simultaneously. In addition to the entire White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, all volunteer members from various countries will also be called up for duty. The two concessions will be completely placed under armed control. This special security measure will be more thorough than those implemented in the past, and the duration will also be longer, possibly continuing for three days or even five days.

Strict Curfew and Prohibition of Gatherings

According to a notice from the authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Police will strictly enforce nighttime curfew hours from August 5th to 15th. All citizens are requested to pay special attention. Anyone found loitering on the streets between 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. without a pass will be arrested and detained. At the same time, the French Concession is taking similar steps. These measures are issued for the anniversary of the Shanghai War. From today, the authorities will also prohibit all gatherings, parades, associations, and other activities. In addition, due to the tense situation, it has been decided to start special security measures earlier on the 9th. All police officers in the two concessions will mobilize simultaneously, patrolling the roads and inspecting pedestrians. Armored car teams, the American Business Corps, and patrol teams of American, British, French, and Italian forces of various countries, as well as male and female inspectors, will be dispatched at any time. As for the closure of various roads, bridges, and unnecessary alleyway traffic, it is not intended to close them except on the 13th. These security measures are all scheduled to be lifted at midnight on the 15th, but if the situation is good, the date of security measures may be shortened in advance.

Japanese and Puppet Police Guard Land and Water Transportation

The Japanese puppet regime, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas will launch an offensive during the commemorative day, is extremely panicked. In recent days, they have been building defensive fortifications in the four suburbs of Shanghai and sending more Japanese and puppet troops to garrison them. They are paying close attention to the areas around Beixinjing, South Huangpu, and Zhabei Railway. As for the bridges in the Hongkou District, such as Zhonghong Bridge, Lihong Bridge, Waihong Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Sikaizi Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, and Tilan Bridge, the Japanese garrison troops on the bridges have all resumed their posts.

### Tense British-Japanese Relations; Concern Among Overseas Residents in Shanghai; Desire to Know the Truth About the Tragic Death of Cox; Indians in Shanghai Being Orchestrated to Form an Association

Since multiple British nationals in Japan and Korea were arrested by the Japanese authorities, the British government has also detained two Japanese nationals in London according to defense regulations. The British government has taken a firm stance and rejected the Japanese protest. After the news spread, British and Japanese nationals in this city are paying close attention to the development of this case and are paying attention to the increasingly deteriorating British-Japanese relations. However, they are all maintaining strict silence on this matter and refusing to express any opinions. After Walker, the Far East General Manager of Reuters, left Shanghai for Japan last week, he participated in Cox's funeral in Tokyo and investigated the details of Cox's tragic death on the ground. A letter was received yesterday stating that he is scheduled to leave Japan and return to Shanghai within this week. At that time, he will give a detailed report on the Cox tragedy and the Japanese arrest of British nationals, so all sectors at home and abroad are eagerly awaiting him, hoping to understand the truth.

Japanese Shipping Lines Prohibit British Passengers

According to Japanese sources, Japan has prohibited British passengers from boarding any shipping lines traveling to Japanese ports. This move by the Japanese is actually a ban on British people landing in Japan, which makes relations between the two countries even worse. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the Japan Mail Steamship Company and others in this city did not sell passenger tickets to Japan yesterday because it was a Sunday holiday.

Indians Have Organized an Association

Recently, the chairman of the Japanese Indian Association, Sahal, came to Shanghai from Japan, planning to instigate the 2,000 Indians staying in Shanghai to engage in anti-British movements. At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, a meeting was held at the Astor House Hotel in Hongkou to discuss the organization of the "Indian Association in China." The meeting resolved to elect a chairman, secretary, treasurer, head of the propaganda department, and persons in charge of organizing volunteers, and to establish an organization committee, or set up a general association in Shanghai, with branches throughout the country. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the purpose of the association is to promote friendly relations between the Indian people and China and other countries, and to promote the public opinion of the Indian people. At the same time, we believe that the association was purely established for anti-British purposes, but it claims that the Indian people are indeed engaged in the independence movement, sparing no effort. This is a desire for self-help. This should be understood.

### After Qian Hongye's Murder, a Successor is Being Selected

The Shanghai Evening Post says that it is heard from responsible sources that although a successor has not yet been selected after the recent murder of Qian Hongye, the Criminal Court President of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu, the criminal proceedings in the Special Court will not be greatly affected. As soon as the judicial authorities in this city determine the successor, the name of the successor will be announced, because there are many judges in the court who are proficient in criminal law. It is also learned that the late President Qian was highly respected by the Chongqing authorities, and Chairman Chiang sent a telegram of condolence to President Qian's family. It is also heard that the Chongqing side will decide to issue a public statement praising him and allocating funeral expenses.

### Bizarre Report Regarding Japan and Place – Discovery of a British Spy Network – Assertions Made with Such Certainty As If They Were True – But the Reason for Their Activity Was Not Explained

The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese-language Continental News in this city yesterday (the 3rd) carried a piece of news claiming that a large British spy network operating in Shanghai had been discovered, and elaborating on the details of its work. Although the newspaper claimed that this spy group had extended its activities to Nanjing, it did not explain why this group was allowed to continue its activities without interference. The newspaper relayed the following information:

The Leader of the British Group in Shanghai

is named Scott, and his chief assistant is named Li Pinren (transliteration). In addition, there are 20 Chinese, most of whom are former students who studied in the UK, secretly gathering information about the "Nanjing Government." The group is divided into four departments: Political, Military, Economic, and Social Affairs. Their espionage activities are divided into eight sections, focusing on Soviet political, economic, military, and Communist activities in China, Japanese activities, the KMT-CPC cooperation, anti-Japanese resistance, and the activities of the Nanjing government. Other matters such as

the Actions of Various Countries in China,

the actions of Chinese political parties, the state of pro-Japanese groups, and the situation of Japanese state-run companies are also of concern. The newspaper went on to list the names of thirteen people sent to Shanghai to engage in activities by the British group, and the names of four people sent to Nanjing. It claimed that these people are all espionage experts who manage the entire spy network, enabling them to obtain detailed reports on Japan. Almost all of the cultural groups and various enterprises supported by the British are engaged in important espionage work. The two offices they have set up in Shanghai and Nanjing are only part of a spy network spread across the Far East.

### Zhenhai Battles Burned Down Houses – Four to Five Thousand – Japanese Warships Indiscriminately Bomb Two Islands – Japanese Troops Retreat Yesterday

The Ningbo sojourner groups in Shanghai continued to receive telegrams from Ningbo yesterday. (1) Xu Fu, a member of the Central Relief Committee, happened to be in Zhenhai for medical treatment during the Zhenhai battle. He went to Yong on the previous day for medical treatment. When asked about the extent of the losses and the relief efforts in the Zhenhai battle, he said that four to five thousand houses in the urban and rural areas were burned down. The refugees were displaced and had nowhere to turn, and the situation was extremely dire. He has discussed with Commissioner Xu of the Sixth District and, in addition to telegraphing Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province, he has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Central Relief Committee, requesting funds for relief and post-war rehabilitation.

Sounds of Japanese Warships

(2) At 6:12 AM on the third, two Japanese warships anchored outside the Zhenhai port fired twelve shots towards Jiangnan. At 9:15 AM, they continued to fire two shots towards Jiangnan. At around 10:15 AM, a Japanese warship was spotted near Hengshan, anchored on the waters of Qijiao. At 2:10 PM, a Japanese warship sailed from the north outside Zhenhai port and is now anchored in the waters of Ligang, with no unusual activity. At 3:05 PM, a Japanese warship was also spotted in the waters of Shipu, sailing south from the north at around 5:00 PM. (3) On the morning of the second, Ningbo heard loud cannon fire, like a string of pearls, all coming from outside the Zhenhai port. According to official inquiries, it was learned that Japanese warships outside the territorial waters twice fired artillery at our fortresses. The first time was at 8:11 AM, when a Japanese warship anchored in the waters east of Hudu Hill suddenly fired eight shots at the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The second time was at 11:20 AM, when it continued to fire four shots. However, there were no targets, and the shells landed in the wilderness, causing no damage.

Japanese Troops Retreat

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the two islands of Qiliji and Huangmang outside the Zhenhai port were occupied by Japanese troops landed by Japanese warships on the 17th of last month, and the Japanese flag was raised on the islands as a base for invading Zhenhai. After the county town of Zhenhai was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops on the two islands boarded warships and retreated yesterday. The two islands have now returned to tranquility, and the Qiliji lighthouse continues to shine as usual, guiding ships.

### Gaodeng's Trial Voyage to Zhejiang Sea – Suddenly Suspended – Japan Permits Resumption of Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Reportedly for Other Purposes

The office of the Gaodeng steamer of the Lulin Shipping Company suddenly announced yesterday afternoon that it had received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang saying that Japanese warships were still harassing the Zhejiang sea area, and the trial voyage of foreign ships was still prohibited. Therefore, in order to avoid danger, the shipping company had postponed the Gaodeng steamer's trial voyage, which was originally scheduled for 3:00 PM today, indefinitely. As a result, many of those who had purchased Gaodeng tickets from the shipping company rushed to the ticket office yesterday afternoon to return their tickets. As the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang is unlikely to be realized in the short term, a shipping merchant told reporters that the Japanese side's permission for foreign ships to resume shipping between Shanghai and Fujian was not without reason. Most of the Japanese goods entering mainland China are smuggled in through the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. Since the maritime transport of Fujian and Zhejiang was blockaded, these Japanese goods could not be transported in, causing significant losses to Japanese merchants. Therefore, they resumed the Shanghai-Fujian route in an attempt to allow Japanese goods to continue to be smuggled into the mainland. As for the method of importing Japanese goods, some unscrupulous import and export merchants tear off the original trademarks of Japanese goods, replace them with Chinese trademarks, and also stamp them with words such as "Completely Chinese Goods." However, according to reporter's inquiries, the local authorities of Fujian Province and the Chamber of Commerce of Qihai City have already paid close attention to this matter and will severely punish it once discovered.

### Japanese Bridge in Hongkou – Drunken Wandering

According to the Continental Daily, it has been reported from Hongkou that Japanese residents in Shanghai who are found wandering the streets drunk at night will be deported back to Japan. The Japanese consulate police have arrested 32 such Japanese this month and sentenced them to four days in prison. The Japanese authorities are doing this to remind the Japanese people of the "current situation of their motherland." Although some Japanese residents in this city are serving the public and restraining themselves, some Japanese people have forgotten the difficulties of the soldiers on the front lines.

### Xu Yongzuo and Xu Maotang – Soon to Regain Freedom – But Must Complete Bail Procedures

Xu Yongzuo, an accountant in this city, and Xu Maotang, manager of the China Remittance Bank, have been detained in the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for many days since they were arrested by the Japanese side together with the French Concession police. It is rumored that the reason for the arrest of the two Xus was related to the patriotic donations at the beginning of the Shanghai war. However, after investigation, there is no evidence of any criminal behavior. According to sources close to the two Xus, the French Consul has agreed to allow them to regain their freedom, but they must complete bail procedures. The families of the two Xus are now trying hard to obtain the conditions for regaining freedom, because their arrest was indeed innocent.

### International Trade Improves – Foreign Exchange Management Successful – Preparing to Stabilize Balance of International Payments – Black Market Speculation Gradually Suppressed

The Chinese government has successfully managed foreign exchange, the foundation of foreign exchange is being consolidated, the legal foreign exchange rate remains unchanged, foreign trade has improved, the balance of international payments is gradually being balanced, the issuance of legal tender has increased but the reserves are still sufficient, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange is stable, speculators can no longer use their skills, and legitimate import and export merchants have benefited greatly, which has won the support of Chinese and foreigners.

Indirect Management of Foreign Exchange Period

From the start of the July 7th Incident to March 13th of the 27th year (1938), the main measures during this period were to reduce the amount of legal tender reserves and prevent capital flight, in order to protect the foreign exchange fund. The important measures were: (1) Measures for stabilizing finance during extraordinary times; (2) Implementation of a new remittance system; (3) Promotion of small denomination subsidiary coins; (4) Strict restrictions on domestic remittances; (5) Restrictions on the transportation of banknotes. The above measures were very effective in consolidating the financial foundation. Although there was no direct management of foreign exchange in name, indirect management of foreign exchange was actually implemented.

Formal Management of Foreign Exchange Period

From January 14th of the 27th year (1938) to June 30th of the 28th year (1939), during this period, the unlimited supply of foreign exchange to the patrol ports was stopped. Those who needed foreign exchange had to go through application and approval procedures. For export foreign exchange, for designated export goods, the foreign exchange earned from the sale of goods had to be sold to the national bank. The important measures were: (1) Examination of import foreign exchange; (2) Sale of export foreign exchange; (3) Second stabilization of finance and new remittance system. Thus, the management of foreign exchange entered a formal stage.

Strengthening Management of Foreign Exchange Period

From July 1st of the 28th year (1939) to March 14th of the 29th year (1940), the main measures during this period were to expand the scope of foreign exchange settlement for export goods in order to increase foreign exchange income. At the same time, in order to reduce the use of foreign exchange, the import of non-essential goods was prohibited in order to save foreign exchange expenditure. For goods that were not prohibited, import merchants who had legitimate needs could still apply to purchase foreign exchange to meet the supply of domestic goods. The important measures were: (1) Receiving the difference in foreign exchange settlement for export goods; (2) Implementation of the prohibition of import goods; (3) Application for foreign exchange to pay the balance fee.

Adjusting Management of Foreign Exchange Period

From March 15th of the 29th year (1940) to the present, during this period, there were no changes to the application for foreign exchange purchase. However, the foreign exchange settlement for export goods was changed to fourteen categories of goods, and the commercial exchange rate between legal tender and pound sterling was suppressed, so that the main goods could increase exports, replenish the foreign exchange base, and stabilize the black market foreign exchange. The main measures were: (1) Revising the measures for the settlement and transportation of goods; (2) The exchange rate between legal tender and pound sterling was suppressed to four and a half points. In addition, the government bore the bank's handling fees for settlement.

Trade Improves, Import Surplus Decreases

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the management of foreign exchange is closely related to foreign trade. With the successful management of foreign exchange, foreign trade will naturally improve. For example, in the first half of this year, the total value of foreign trade was 966,039,000 yuan for imports and 934,585,000 yuan for exports, with an import surplus of 31,454,000 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, imports increased by 245,455,000 yuan, exports increased by 522,875,000 yuan, and the import surplus decreased by 277,600,000 yuan. Compared with the same period the year before, imports increased by 53,790,000 yuan, exports increased by 610,980,000 yuan, and the import surplus decreased by 88,250,000 yuan. The balance of international payments is therefore gradually being balanced.

### The Armor Arrives in Shanghai Today – Final Voyage

The US Navy transport ship Armor, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, will be delayed until today (the 5th) due to encountering a hurricane and heavy fog in the North Sea. It will carry American soldiers who have served in the Far East for two full years back to the United States to continue their service. The transport ship has been sailing at sea for more than 20 years, and the US Navy Department has decided to decommission it. Therefore, this trip to the Far East is its last voyage.

### Western Newspapers Discuss Consular Body Meeting – Facts Listed Argue Inability to Improve Situation

Yesterday's English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly published an article by the well-known British commentator Mr. Woodhead criticizing the recent meeting of the Consular Body held to discuss the Shanghai Municipal Council's appeal for cooperation in stopping terrorist acts. The article began by stating that on the day the meeting reached its final resolution, several murders occurred, including the assassination of Mr. Mesra, Chairman of the Russian Emigrant Committee, the abduction of Mr. Shen Jingzhou, manager of the Yi Tai Hing Coal Briquette Company, and Mr. Ni Lan Shen, local editor of the News. In fact, the above cases were definitely not committed by the Chongqing government. The Consular Body meeting resulted in the passage of a resolution condemning the impermanence of terrorist acts and urging the Shanghai Municipal Council to do its best to suppress terrorist acts and maintain the peace of the Settlement. At the same time, it suggested that the police authorities should strengthen their forces and strengthen cooperation with all parties, such as the French Concession Police, the Japanese Military Police, the Police Department of the Japanese Consulate, and the "Police Bureau" of the puppet municipal government. All these suggestions are very pleasing to the ear, but in reality they have no effect. The police authorities are well aware of the source of terrorist acts, but they are unable to effectively suppress them due to lack of strength. A few hours before and after the Consular Body meeting, Shanghai Municipal Council police officers were disarmed by the Japanese Military Police while arresting thieves on Yu Yuan Road, and traffic on Haig Road was stopped due to the opening of a gambling den. What is the meaning of the proposal for joint cooperation? The situation is so serious, why bother about whether the letter from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Consular Body is appropriate or not? In short, the actions of the Consular Body have not reduced the seriousness of the current situation.

### Shanghai Cultural Circles Commemorate Lu Xun's Sixtieth Birthday Yesterday – Lu Xun Devoted His Life to the Great Cause of the Nation – Now that the War of Resistance is About to be Completed, He Should Smile in His Grave

The late literary giant and ideological mentor Lu Xun (Zhou Shuren) passed away four years ago at the age of fifty-six. This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of his birth. Zhou devoted his life to fighting, and his contributions to the literary and ideological circles will be immortal. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once respected him as the founder of China's new culture. His contributions to national independence and freedom, and his promotion of social evolution, are truly outstanding. As the war of resistance enters its fourth year, the cultural circles, in order to commemorate the sage, initiated the celebration of Zhou's sixtieth birthday. Zhou's birthday was originally on the third day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. In order to facilitate the unification with the Gregorian calendar, with the consent of Zhou's wife, Ms. Xu Guangping, it was changed to August 3rd of the Gregorian calendar, and a ceremony was held yesterday (the 4th) at 10:00 AM.

Commemoration Ceremony

The commemoration ceremony was held in the auditorium of an academic organization on Lafayette Road. About 200 people attended, mostly from the literary, educational, and youth student circles of this city. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly. On the commemoration stage, there was a small portrait of Zhou taken on his fiftieth birthday. A bottle of flowers was placed on the altar, and there were several flower baskets under the stage. The commemoration ceremony began at 10:00 AM, and the ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Paying respects to Zhou's portrait; (3) Chairman's speech; (4) Expert's speech; (5) Zhou Jianren, Zhou's third younger brother, narrates Zhou's life; (6) Ms. Xu Guangping's reply; (7) Poetry recitation by five young poets; (8) Closing of the meeting.

Life Contributions

The chairman's speech analyzed in detail Zhou's contributions and success to the nation, and cited Dr. Sun Yat-sen as an example. The contributions of Dr. Sun to the national revolution and Zhou to the ideological revolution have had an immortal impact on the Chinese nation. In the expert's speech, the martyrdom spirit of Zhou's support for truth and justice, and the vast and profound educational significance he made to the Chinese youth were analyzed in detail. The conclusion was that the best way to commemorate Zhou was to advance the war of resistance and the revolutionary cause. Zhou devoted his life to advocating resistance against Japan and striving for national freedom. If Zhou knew that the war of resistance was about to be completed and victory was in sight, he would smile in his grave. Zhou Jianren's report on Zhou's life and Ms. Xu Guangping's reply were both very alert. The commemoration ceremony ended at 1:00 PM.

### British Consulate Recruiting Office – Resumes Registration – British Overseas Chinese Sign Up Enthusiastically

One week ago, the new conscript recruitment office attached to the British Consulate in Shanghai was so busy due to the enthusiastic participation of British overseas Chinese in registration that it announced a temporary suspension of registration for one week, so that it could calmly carry out physical examinations of a large number of registered service personnel, and at the same time give the overworked staff a chance to rest. It has been learned from the British authorities that the office will resume registration today (the 5th) from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. A large number of British overseas Chinese who intended to join the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom last week but failed to do so can go to register tomorrow.

### White Russian Leader Assassinated – Police Disclose Clues – Murderers' Vehicle From Hongkou – Mrs. Mesra to Return to Shanghai for Funeral Today

The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Mesra, Chairman of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, was shot and killed by a Chinese assassin on Nanyang Road on the morning of the 2nd. The murderer is believed to have come from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, because according to the police, the vehicle with license number 1797, which the murderer was riding, belongs to a Korean car rental company in Hongkou. Mrs. Mesra, who was recuperating in Japan, was shocked by the bad news and sent a return telegram, saying that she would arrive in Shanghai on the 5th to handle the funeral arrangements. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this city, had previously denied that the assassination of Mr. Mesra was instructed by the Japanese authorities, and said that once the "Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Association" is organized, the White Russian passport will be issued by this new group. It is found that the Japanese side formed this new group and planned to take over the work of the White Russian Emigrant Committee led by Mr. Mesra. Therefore, Mr. Mesra's position as the administrative head of the White Russian emigrants was opposed by the new group. The Japanese side once invited Mr. Mesra to work in the new "Association", but was rejected. The reason why the new "Association" could not be established is believed to be due to Mr. Mesra's refusal.

### Water and Electricity Company Strike – Final Stage – Labor Party to Decide on Steps Today – Jinmen Employees Continue to Work as Usual

All employees of the British-owned Water and Electricity Company and the workers of the old and new factories will take a stance towards the employer at 9:00 AM today and make a final appeal. Half a month has passed since the go-slow strike occurred in the company, and all users are deeply concerned about this matter and hope that the opinions of both parties can gradually converge and return to normal. According to employees speaking to reporters of the Pingming News Agency, they will once again express the grievances of the labor party to the company today. If the company authorities still do not understand, the employees will demand that the company authorities settle their savings and one year's dismissal fee, and the salary for July.

Jinmen Strike

All employees of the Jinmen Hotel at 104 Jing'an Temple Road have made a request to the employer to improve their treatment in view of the increasing cost of living, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the hotel has been open for nearly two months. The employees, about 190 in total, have received considerable education, and the monthly salary they receive is generally 14 yuan. The tips given by customers must be handed over to the accounting room, and then the accounting room will extract and distribute them. Therefore, the monthly treatment is quite meager. All employees, in view of the high prices at this time, find it difficult to maintain their lives with their monthly income. As a last resort, they made four requests to the authorities the night before: (1) Maintain the minimum cost of living; (2) Abolish the system of unequal salaries for the same work; (3) Employees shall not be dismissed without cause; (4) Publicize the accounts of business tips. The employer did not respond at the time, causing a go-slow strike to occur for a while. However, in order to maintain the convenience of all customers, the labor party continued to work as usual yesterday morning while negotiating with the employer again. The two parties are still at a stalemate.

### Suzhou City Gates – Still Not Open

Suzhou's city gates were closed at 8:00 AM after the puppet Wuxian County Governor Guo Huiji was assassinated on the morning of the 31st of last month, and traffic inside and outside the city was cut off in the afternoon. It has been five days now. Yesterday, travelers who went to Suzhou to buy train tickets at the North Station were still rejected, because the city gates of Suzhou have not been fully opened. Traffic outside the city was restored at 5:00 PM on the first, and traffic inside the city was restored on the morning of the second. The city gates are opened for two hours a day, allowing only elderly people to enter and exit. The Japanese puppet military police searched house to house, but found nothing. According to the Japanese side, the original state will not be restored until clues are obtained.

### Spring Tax Revenue – Total Amount Intercepted – Jianghai Customs is the Largest

### Japanese "Hengchan Company" – Encirclement of Wusong Civil Fields – Reportedly Paid Half in Cash

After the Japanese Hengchan Company encircled 60,000 mu of civil fields in Wusong, according to sources, the company has been paying half in cash and half in company bonds since last year. It is also claimed that the company bonds have an annual interest rate of 6% and will be repaid in fifteen years. In the past, when the full amount was paid in company bonds, the Taihe Silver Company would provide a loan of 60% of the face value. Now, the company pays half in cash. However, the farmers in that area have no land to cultivate and have suffered greatly.

### Two Young Girls Sold Repeatedly – Claimed to Be Willing to Work as Dancers – Male and Female Offenders Arrested One After Another – Prosecution for Interfering With Family

Zhang Wang, a woman from Changshu, is 48 years old and lives at No. 5, Yuanheli, Qinglian Street, Nanjing. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), she bought Zhang Guiying (13 years old this year) from her hometown as her daughter. In May of this year, due to economic difficulties, she sold her daughter to Liu Wang (40 years old, from Nanjing, living at No. 173, Caishi Street) for 100 yuan. Liu Wang actually forced her daughter to prostitute herself, and she opened the Yu Qiaqing Road Oriental Hotel Room 413, and the guest Yang paid 40 yuan for the virginity, but the girl

Could Not Bear the Abuse

complained to Gu Ni (24 years old, from Pudong, Tangle White), who lived with her. Gu Ni actually had bad intentions and falsely claimed to teach the girl to dance. On the 13th of last month, at about 6:00 AM, she secretly led the girl to Xu Changming's home at No. 3, Lane 100, Wenzhou Road, where Xu hid her at Cao Wu's home at No. 133, Gansu Road. Cao Wu feared being exposed, so she transferred the girl to Wu Chen's home at No. 32, Hengmaoli, Minti Ni Yin Road. Zhang Wang found out about this. According to the report to the French Concession Police, Detective Shao Guanrong was sent to Room 3, Yongxing Inn, No. 183, Caishi Street to arrest Gu Ni and the prostitutes Rong Zhuxilin and Chen Zhong.

According to Confession

The remaining defendants were arrested one after another, and Qian Chenghua (14 years old, from Changzhou, bought by him to work as a dancer) was also found at Wu Chen's home. They were all taken to the police station for investigation. It was considered that the plaintiff Zhang Wang was also suspected, so they were all sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special Court No. 2. Lawyer Yao Zhao of the Police Station filed a public prosecution against the defendants for the crime of interfering with the family. Judge Liao continued the trial in court the day before yesterday. When questioned, all the defendants denied the charges, and the two victims claimed that they were willing to work as dancers and were not forced. After checking the words in court, because further investigation was still needed, it was ordered to postpone the trial for another week. All the defendants were not allowed to post bail and were all detained.

### Notorious Thieves Hire a Truck to Arrive – All Caught

They robbed the five households of tenants including Gu Pufang and Liu Gu, and stole cloth, clothes, bicycles, and other items worth 7,555 yuan. They rushed out of the door and loaded the stolen goods onto a pre-hired truck, just as they were about to drive away. Detective Wang Cheng of the Gordon Road Police Station and Inspector Xu Decheng received a tip-off and rushed to the address with Western detectives to arrest them. The notorious thieves Xu Jinke, Yuan Yigen, Hu Guangyu, Li Shenglin, Cao Fugen, Liu Yuebao, Wu Deshan, Yang Zheyuan, and others, all from Jiangbei, were arrested one after another, and most of the original stolen goods were seized.

Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Station stated that the defendants in this case gathered in a room at the Bingtong Commercial Hotel on Aiwenyi Road to discuss the robbery and hired a truck in advance, parked near the hotel. He requested a postponement, stating that there were still many accomplices who had not been arrested. Judge Jiang questioned them and ordered them to be detained again.

### Another Upset in the Second Group of the Hezhong Cup; Shangxing Suffers a Miserable Defeat to Nanyang Yesterday; Nanyang Overtakes and Wins; First-Grade Paramount Defeats Qifan Greatly

The Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament has seen many upsets in the past month or so, such as Shanghai Youth's defeat to Qunyi, Youlian's defeat to Qifan, Shanghai Youth's loss to Liangxi, and yesterday's defeat of Shangxing in the second group to Nanyang. Nanyang initially lost to Moore and Paramount. After the great victory over Zhongyi, they defeated Tianxing. Yesterday, in the first half, they reversed the situation and defeated the powerful Shangxing, creating another miracle in the Hezhong Cup. At the beginning of the game, Zhang Banglun of Nanyang was trapped and made no progress. On the Shangxing side, the points were very evenly distributed. Zhou Jun and Ye Zuyao were very threatening, so Shangxing was better than the first half with 22 to 16. After changing sides, Nanyang suddenly became excited. Zhang Banglun exerted great pressure and scored every time. Han Longhai was even more unrestrained. The Shangxing basket was repeatedly broken, and the entire Shangxing army suffered a complete defeat. Nanyang overtook and won with 53 to 42. The outcome of the first-grade Paramount and Qifan game was predetermined. However, the situation in the first half was very tense. At the end of the first half, Paramount took the lead with 35 to 28. After changing sides, Qifan showed signs of decline. Qian Xi Zhang's active posture in the first half had been curbed. Qu Xilin and Zhang Zhihua stood out instead. Unfortunately, Paramount's strength was sharp, and Qifan could not do anything. In the end, Qifan lost to Paramount again with 50 to 80.

In the second match, Sanyi versus Zhenhua, Sanyi was the incarnation of the former Xiaozhonghua, and their technology has reached its peak. Zhenhua was also not weak, so both sides' defense was like a golden city, and it was difficult to break through. Therefore, the atmosphere in the stadium became white-hot. When the first half ended without any gains, the audience was even more obsessed, thinking that both sides were boosting their morale, but in reality, their strength was at the same level. The offense was sharp, and the defense was solid. Seeing that the statutory time was about to end, there were still two goose eggs. The soldiers on both sides became even more vigorous. Sanyi finally scored a goal in the last five minutes by Liu Ziquan with the determination to break the boat, and finally won the final victory with this precious goal, joining the three teams of Lianyi, Samsung, and Fahua to advance to the second round.

Economic Supplement

### Reasons for Revising the Commercial Exchange Rate

— Sun Liyu

The Ministry of Finance issued an order, effective August 1st, revising the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank of China from 7 'ban shi' to 4.5 'ban shi'. Those unaware of the true situation believed that the government was devaluing the legal tender, showing signs of inflation. Speculators seized this opportunity to stir up trouble, forcefully acquiring foreign exchange, causing the exchange market, which had been stable for several weeks, to contract again. The British exchange rate tightened from 3.859375 'ban shi' to 2.8125 'ban shi', and the US exchange rate also contracted from 5.96875 yuan to 5.8125 yuan. However, the Central Bank's official rate remained at 2.5 'ban shi' per shilling, proving that the government had no intention of devaluing the currency. The revision of the commercial exchange rate was a temporary expedient, and there were other reasons, the most important of which are approximately the following two:

(1) Recently, in order to raise funds for construction projects, the government issued the 29th year construction gold bond. Article 3, Section 3 of the British gold bond regulations stipulates that "those who pay in legal tender to purchase may convert it into British gold or US dollars according to the commercial exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance." However, according to the Shanghai black market exchange rate, each yuan of legal tender was worth less than 4 'ban shi'. After deducting 30% for the exchange difference between the inland and Shanghai, each yuan of inland legal tender could only purchase 2.7 'ban shi' of British exchange. If the government allowed inland people to purchase gold bonds based on the previous commercial exchange rate of 7 'ban shi', then each yuan would gain an undue profit of 4.3 'ban shi'. Now is a time when national finances are in deficit, and the government cannot condone people making huge profits. Therefore, the commercial exchange rate was specially lowered to 4.5 'ban shi' to avoid losses. However, even at 4.5 'ban shi', inland people purchasing gold bonds can still profit 1.87 'ban shi' per yuan, and Shanghai people purchasing can also profit 0.7 'ban shi'. Using this difference to encourage the purchase of bonds is enough to make the bond sales achieve good results. Observing the enthusiastic supply of Chinese banks in the past two days while speculators have been trying to acquire foreign exchange, it can be proved that the banks are willing to subscribe to gold bonds with this difference.

(2) For the export goods of Free China, all the 14 types designated by the Ministry of Finance, such as tung oil and tea, must first settle foreign exchange. Before July of last year, settlements had to be made according to the Central Bank's official rate. After July, settlements were made according to the commercial exchange rate of 7 'ban shi'. The government used this to subsidize merchants and encourage exports, which was quite effective. However, the black market exchange rate contracted again later, recently stabilizing at around 4 'ban shi', a difference of 3 'ban shi' from the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications. Dishonest merchants could settle at a lower exchange rate when their goods were exported from Shanghai and other places, gaining more legal tender, so smuggling became rampant. For example, tung oil exported from Shanghai in the first half of last year was only 376,416 yuan, but in the same period this year, it increased to 13,213,036 yuan, an increase of 34 times. Another example is tea, which in the first half of last year was only 2,367,405 yuan, but this year it increased to 24,512,150 yuan, an increase of 10 times. The increase in exports of these three commodities certainly has other reasons, but it cannot be denied that it includes a large number of smuggled goods. Now that the government has reduced the commercial exchange rate to 4.5 'ban shi', making it not far from the black market, state-owned export companies in the interior can also raise the price of goods purchased from merchants and stop smuggling. Therefore, this measure can achieve great results in encouraging exports and preventing goods from flowing into the occupied areas.

The above two points are probably the reasons why the government reduced the commercial exchange rate this time. However, some people believe that this method is enough to suppress the downward trend of the black market exchange rate and embolden bullish speculators. This statement seems reasonable, but it ignores the variability of the commercial exchange rate. This revision is a temporary expedient. If the situation of legal tender improves in the future and the black market exchange rate rises, the commercial exchange rate can also be raised accordingly without any obstacles. Moreover, according to the current black market exchange rate, there is still a difference of 0.7 'ban shi' from the commercial exchange rate for British exchange. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai US-British exchange rate of 3.66 yuan, the commercial exchange rate for US exchange is about 7 yuan, which is also about 1.2 yuan different from the black market. It is a big question whether bullish speculators are willing to bear this risk. Since the expansion of the European war, the exchange rate has been particularly loose, prices have plummeted, the import of foreign goods has become increasingly difficult, the actual demand for foreign exchange has been reduced to the minimum, and overseas remittances continue to flow in, the supply is still very strong, and the exchange market trend is still loose. If speculators want to take advantage of the revision of the commercial exchange rate to stir up trouble, they will surely suffer serious consequences.

Editor's Note: Mr. Sun has made a correct and profound analysis of the reasons for revising the commercial exchange rate. As for the consequences, from the reporter's point of view, it may be the prelude to the elimination of the black market for foreign exchange. Since the legal commercial exchange rate is close to the black market exchange rate, it will be easier for the Ministry of Finance to maintain the black market than in the past. When there is a huge difference between the official rate and the market rate, in fact, the Central Bank can only sell, but cannot buy, because export drafts will inevitably flock to the black market. The reason why the Central Bank's exchange application and approval system failed in the past was this reason. Now that the difference between the two is small, if the Ministry of Finance intends to eliminate the black market, it is easy to overcome this difficulty. Therefore, if speculators want to take this opportunity to stir up trouble, as Mr. Sun said, they will surely suffer serious consequences. Please carefully consider Mr. Sun's article.

Which is more important, the Far East or Europe, in the world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union?

What impact will the difference in importance have on the economic world?

Regarding the answer to this question, we have received two special articles from international problem experts Chu Yukun and Aina. 93 articles were submitted by various parties. Most of them also answered other questions. Judging from the envelopes used, the occupations cover industry, commerce, medicine, education, law, and even the film industry, which shows the development of political minds and the rising level of culture in all walks of life. The main points are published below, and the rest are briefly indicated by the names according to the opinions of each person.

Aina (Special Article)

Let me talk about the United States first. Let me quote a Reuters telegram from July: "The newly appointed Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of the Army Stimson have respectively presented their opinions to the Naval and Army Committees of the Senate, emphasizing that the new front line of the United States in the future is in the Atlantic." Knox also said: "Because the country's future is fraught with great crises, I have reconsidered my past advocacy of a tough policy toward Japan. The United States may be forced to choose between the threat in the Atlantic and the threat in the Pacific. For the sake of the United States, it may be better to avoid creating dangerous situations at the same time." From these two statements, the weight of the Far East and Europe in the United States' world policy is clearly visible. Europe is the center of the capitalist world, and the United States is the last fortress of world capitalism. There is no doubt that the United States' foreign policy is based on its policy toward Europe. Therefore, as soon as the European war broke out, the United States immediately passed a new neutrality law that was beneficial to the Allied Powers; while China's War of Resistance has been going on for three years, she has been helping China to some extent on the one hand, and she has been selling military materials to Japan on the other. Of course, we do not deny the irreconcilability of the contradictions between Japan and the United States, but its Far East policy is undoubtedly subordinate to its European policy.

As for the Soviet Union, we can also say that the problem of Europe is much more important than the problem of the Far East. The war among the European powers and the anti-Soviet ideas give the Soviet Union a more serious threat than Japan. However, because its political and economic organization is fundamentally different from capitalist countries, its foreign policy is also the opposite. The basic principle of the Soviet Union's entire foreign policy is to uphold peace and friendship among countries. This is no different in Europe and the Far East. In the Far East, the Soviet Union's policy of assisting China's War of Resistance is unchanged. This is fundamentally different from the diplomatic policy of assisting China to a limited extent to confront Japan's monopoly of the entire Chinese market. The Soviet Union does not need colonies or semi-colonies, nor does it need a market for exporting capital. The purpose of its aid to China is to help China defeat aggression, seek its own independence and liberation, and get rid of the imperialist and financial shackles imposed on it by the capitalist world.

Chu Yukun (Special Article)

The Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia, and occupies a very important position on the world political stage. It has a kind of "stabilizing force" for both Europe and the Far East. Although the United States is geographically located in the Americas, it is far away from Europe and the Far East. However, because its domestic prosperity depends entirely on foreign markets, and Europe and Asia are the places where its interests lie, once changes occur in Europe and Asia, they will affect the interests of the United States. Therefore, the United States is very concerned about the politics of Europe and Asia. Whenever the interests of the United States are threatened in either continent, the United States will definitely come out to intervene and maintain them. In short, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are spread throughout Europe and Asia. On the international political stage in Europe and Asia, the United States and the Soviet Union are two important roles. The policies they adopt cannot be ignored by anyone. As for which is more important, Europe or the Far East, in the foreign policies of the United States and the Soviet Union? This question should be answered separately.

First of all, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it occupies a pivotal position in Europe, enough to influence the development of the European situation. After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Hitler dared to send troops to Poland, and France lost the assistance of the Soviet Union, which led to its failure. This is one proof of this. Since the European War, the power of the Soviet Union has gradually expanded. Not only has most of Poland been incorporated into the territory of the Soviet Union, but also the countries along the Baltic Sea have been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's western border is extremely consolidated, and it is prepared for emergencies; this is the second point. The Soviet Union did not throw itself into the vortex of the European war this time, and its strength has been preserved. Germany and Italy and Britain and France are all exhausted. Even if Germany defeats Britain again, Hitler will not dare to act rashly against the powerful Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's position in Europe is consolidated and prepared for emergencies. However, this is not the case in the Far East. In the future, the Soviet Union's goal should be in the east rather than the west.

Secondly, the United States, Hitler's victory is certainly a major threat to the United States, but since France surrendered and begged for peace, although Britain wants to resist stubbornly, it is already powerless. Even if the United States helps with all its strength, it will not help; this is the first point. The United States has purely economic interests in Europe and Asia. Whether in Europe or the Far East, if its interests are threatened, it will definitely take defensive actions, regardless of each other. It can be seen from the expansion of the US Navy and the desire to build the so-called "two-ocean navy"; this is the second point. The US policy towards Europe has changed, and the "Monroe Doctrine" may be revived. The issue discussed at the recent Pan-American Conference, in essence, is how to stop Germany's power from extending into the Americas; this is the third point. Therefore, from my personal point of view, since the United States has not succeeded in Europe, it is possible to concentrate all its efforts on dealing with the Far East. The defense of Guam is not to be said, and the embargo on iron and oil to Japan further shows that the attitude of the United States towards the Far East is becoming stronger and stronger day by day. I heard that the date of action is not far away.

No Distinction, Waiting for an Opportunity to Act

Mao Bangci

The interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe and Asia are really not important; because peace cannot be divided. However, their policies, "perhaps depend on which is more serious, the danger in Europe and Asia? Which is more urgent? Then decide which comes first and which comes later? However, this order only exists at the beginning of the outbreak; then it may be related to each other and expand at the same time? Because of this, what kind of impact will the economic world suffer? It is not difficult to imagine. It is nothing more than the destruction of international trade by naval warfare, and the international exchange market is also in chaos because of this; as a result of the war countries strengthening wartime economic control, the supply and demand of materials in various places have also changed greatly. If the war drags on, the world's currency circulation will inevitably expand. This lays the foundation for the post-war currency trend. Generally speaking, if the victory belongs to Britain and the United States, the post-war world currency will not change much compared to today. On the contrary, that's not certain.

Ye Xin

Soviet Russia is now having problems in Europe, so it will not act in Asia. However, the Soviet Union will never coordinate with Japan. Since Japan does not dare to challenge him, he is happy to be temporarily conservative.

The United States is in a different situation because there is a blood relationship between Britain and the United States, and there are historical feelings; the consequences of the Anglo-German war are extremely close to his national fortune. As for the Far East, since Japan does not offend him, he does not have to look for trouble.

This is their subjective mentality, but when the objective situation changes, he will naturally not be allowed to take extraordinary measures. But it is still difficult to determine at present. However, there is one point that can be raised for discussion: will the Anglo-German war be like the Sino-Japanese war? Will it also enter a stalemate stage? If the European and Asian battlefields are both stalemated, then the United States may first solve the Far East problem, so as to move eastward and help Britain control Germany. The Soviet Union's activities in Europe should be limited to not increasing Germany's jealousy, and when it is appropriate, he will naturally have to settle accounts with Japan? But his actions will probably be one step slower than the US action?

In addition, Mr. Jin Dongren and Mr. Lu Yuwen have similar opinions.

The Psychology of Beauty and the Soviet Union in Form

Wang Xiao

The United States hopes to maintain the balance of power in the world and maintain its leadership position; the Soviet Union hopes to socialize the whole world and maintain its leadership position.

The United States' Far East policy is also to maintain the balance of power, so its aid to China, both moral and material, is important. This is a fact; and it is indifferent to Japan, and adapts to its diplomatic policy.

The United States has indirectly participated in the European war, while the Soviet Union is absolutely strictly neutral, and uses this time to consolidate its national strength.

Considering that the coastline of China has been completely blocked, (including the Yunnan-Burma Road...) the Soviet Union can engage in aid to China because the West has become more consolidated. The Chinese government attaches importance to and builds the Northwest Highway, and the United States has reduced various exports (such as oil and iron recently) due to its urgent need for war preparations... then the proportion of the Soviet Union's economic influence on China will increase day by day.

Considering the business negotiations between Britain, Germany, Bulgaria, Iran, Afghanistan... and other European countries with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's economic influence in Europe will be strengthened day by day, while the United States can maintain South America and North America, but it cannot but maintain contact with the Soviet Union. (The recent negotiation on the renewal of the commercial treaty was initiated by the United States).

Li Junfan

First, let us talk about the position of the United States in Europe. In fact, although the Allies remained neutral in the war against Germany, they did their best to assist the Allies with both economic and war equipment. It is undeniable that the United States can be said to be one of the belligerent countries, and its position is very clear. As for the Far East, it is enough to stop the aggressor, because Japan's economy depends on the support of the United States. As for the Soviet Union, its maintenance of its current relationship with Germany is actually due to the inability of the former Allies to cooperate with it, and it was forced to do so. Therefore, if Britain can make concessions today, the Soviet Union is very willing to contact it, and if the time comes, victory will be in hand! In the Far East, although it has assisted our country greatly, according to its consistent policy, it does not want to launch anything. (This can be seen in the conflicts in Zhanggufeng and the fishing rights in Sakhalin) It can be seen that the Soviet Union is enough to control the overall situation in Europe, and the United States is truly important in the Far East! Under this situation, our country's economic circles have pro-American and Soviet views, especially pro-American. As for the economic circles in Europe, especially Britain, there is a common feeling of befriending the Soviet Union.

In addition, Mr. Liu Xiqing, Mao Chongjie, Daoke, Zhang Yumei, Qian Yishi, Le Hui, Pan Zhihua, Gu Bingqian, Liu Daohong, and so on have similar opinions. Mr. Liu Xiqing also made a basic analysis of the characteristics of the US and Soviet policies, which is particularly admirable; unfortunately, the original text is too long, so I have to cut it short.

The United States Emphasizes Asia and the Soviet Union Emphasizes Europe

Du Yun

The world policy of the United States actually emphasizes the Far East; formally, it seems to emphasize Europe. The Soviet Union emphasizes Europe instead, and formally, it seems to emphasize the Far East. In the difference of emphasis, China's economy should have a closer relationship with the United States; naturally, it is the same relationship with the Soviet Union. Among the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which are in this subtle connection, Japan will be the most affected. (To be continued)

Changes in Foreign Exchange Settlement Commodities

The Chinese government's first method of managing export foreign exchange was to stipulate that 24 categories of goods such as tung oil, bristles, leather, wool, and minerals should be settled in foreign exchange. When merchants transport these 24 categories of goods for export, they should first ask the Trade Commission to estimate the foreign currency selling price, and sign a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange from the Central Bank based on this amount. With the certificate, they can go through customs declaration and transportation procedures. After the goods are sold, they must be sold to the Central Bank at the legal exchange rate. If the proceeds from the sale are lower than the Trade Commission's estimate, they can submit sales documents to the commission to apply for a reduction in payment. The implementation period was from May to December 1938. From January 1939, the number of foreign exchange settlement commodities was reduced from 24 to 13. From July 1939, the government took charge of the unified transportation and sales of four categories of goods, including tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals. All other export goods were settled in foreign exchange, and the settlement amount was not based on the Trade Commission's valuation, but on 90% of the actual selling price certificate issued by the commission. The exchange rate for settlement was also changed to the standard of 7 pence for British gold and 13.625 yuan for US dollars quoted by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank.

The purpose of managing export foreign exchange is to concentrate foreign exchange to stabilize the financial foundation and cultivate economic strength. Over the past three years, the Chinese government's efforts in this regard have achieved good results. In 1938 and 1939, the foreign exchange pre-sold by merchants to government banks reached 120 million yuan. There have been changes in the foreign exchange settlement method this year. Except for the four categories of goods such as tung oil, which are still transported and sold by the government in a unified manner, 14 categories of goods such as eggs, feathers, casings, leather, fur, gallnuts, medicinal materials, oil wax, ramie, and cotton are designated as foreign exchange settlement commodities among other export goods. Other export goods can be exempted from foreign exchange settlement. The amount of foreign exchange settlement is calculated based on 80% of the actual selling price certificate filled in, but if the goods are transported from the southwest provinces through foreign ports, the cost will increase. To compensate for the merchant's loss, it can be reduced to 70%. At the same time, the handling fee within 3% of the difference between the legal price of foreign exchange and the bank's quoted price paid by merchants to the bank when settling foreign exchange is also exempted. The current method has been implemented since March 15, 1940.

Compared with the past, the current method is similar to the 13 categories implemented in January 1939 in terms of the types of foreign exchange settlement commodities. Because all goods must be settled in foreign exchange, it only increases the management difficulties, and the value of many export goods is very small. In terms of the foreign exchange settlement method, it is the same as the method implemented in July 1939, which is based on the actual selling price certificate issued by the Trade Commission. In terms of the standard of the foreign exchange settlement exchange rate, the method of collecting the difference between the legal exchange rate and the commercial exchange rate is still adopted. However, the foreign exchange settlement amount has been reduced from 90% to 80%, and it can also be reduced to 70% due to particularly high costs. This is because the goods transported from the southwest provinces to Hong Kong for sale via Haiphong, its freight, warehouse rent, sales commission, and taxes account for 15% of the actual selling price. According to the method in July 1939, merchants will lose 5%. Therefore, reducing the percentage makes merchants profitable, so that export trade can be increased to intensify the collection of foreign exchange.

### Revision of Commercial Exchange Rate

According to news from Chongqing, the Chinese Ministry of Finance has officially announced that the commercial exchange rate of legal tender will be changed to 4.5 pence from August 1. The exchange rates of other foreign currencies are based on the market exchange rate between it and the pound. In early July 1939, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods" and the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Exported Goods", stipulating that applicants for imported foreign exchange must pay a balance fee based on the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. Exporters of foreign exchange can receive the exchange rate difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. This is the beginning of the use of commercial exchange rates. (To be continued)

### North-South Goods, New Black Watermelon Seeds, First Batch Arrived in Shanghai

Due to the severe drought and lack of moisture in the soil during this summer, most of the watermelon seedlings withered, and the harvest was greatly reduced. According to production news, it was only 30% to 50% of normal. It is said that the first batch of Xu Kui seeds and Mingguang seeds arrived yesterday, totaling nine pieces, which were sold immediately. It is estimated that the two types of seeds were priced at 87 yuan.

### New Lychee and Honey Dates are Offered at New High Prices

Hainan lychee, old goods have been out of stock for a long time, the first batch of new goods arrived the day before yesterday, totaling 16 pieces, and has been sold yesterday. The higher price reached 198 yuan, which is a new record. The second price was slightly reduced, and the market outlook is loose.

The first batch of new Suzhou honey dates arrived yesterday, totaling more than a dozen pieces, which were quite rare. It was sold at a bald price of 170 yuan, which is also a high price. The source of the second batch is expected to increase, and it is expected to return to small.

### Sugar Market, Raw White Sugar is Stabilized

Yesterday, the sugar market had little change due to Sunday. The price of raw white sugar from foreign warehouses was reduced from 69 yuan to 68.9 yuan, and then rose to 69 yuan. The price of transshipment goods that are invoiced is 53.2 yuan, Taikoo B Mark is 73 yuan, XH is 69 yuan, and DY is 69.5 yuan.

### Coal Ash, Charcoal is Exceptionally Popular

Charcoal is usually manufactured in large quantities during the hot summer months for winter use, but this year, due to the rare shortage of raw materials, coal dust, the screened dust in this street is also very expensive, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. Most of the charcoal manufacturers have stopped production, so the market is exceptionally popular. It is estimated that large charcoal is 24 yuan per thousand, and No. 2 is 16 yuan.

### Metals Trading: Slow Trading, Stable and Weak Prices

Yesterday was Sunday, and the metal market was even more subdued. There were no sales to out-of-town merchants, and transactions within the city were also quite sluggish. Throughout the day, the market only saw slight inquiries for black iron sheets, floral hoop lead wires, small tinplates, and common nails. The rest is hardly worth mentioning. Yesterday, black iron sheets, size 3 feet by 6 feet, mixed with various patterns, were quoted at 70 yuan for three to nine sheets. Selected sheets sold for 75 yuan. Small tinplates sold for 130 yuan per box, with retail prices varying around 1.23 yuan per sheet. Floral hoop lead wires were quoted at 13.50 yuan for 28-pound loads, 26.50 yuan for 56-pound loads, and around 52 yuan for 112-pound loads. Common nails were priced at 46 yuan per barrel (base price). Black iron billets were priced around 1,000 yuan.

How Can Impotent Husbands Enhance Their Energy?

Are there secrets to love? Yes, everything has secrets, and love certainly has them too. So, what are the secrets to love? Let those seeking love not wander down the wrong paths, and enter the joyous garden of love as soon as possible!

We know that a young woman in love is blossoming with the fragrance of her heart, yet shyly hides her feelings, as if concealing a great secret. If this deeply affectionate woman marries a strong and energetic husband, he can instantly draw his charming wife into a joyful and passionate realm in their marital chambers, making her realize the preciousness of happiness in life. Thus, love blossoms, sweetens, and leads to the birth of intelligent children, forming a blissful family. What a joyous life!

However, if a man has committed self-pollution (masturbation) or nocturnal emissions in his youth, or indulged in excessive sexual activity, or suffered from overwork and exhaustion, depleting the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, or damaging the nerves that control his sexual functions, then premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, infertility, back pain, memory loss, premature aging, and other symptoms will inevitably arise. Even with a charming wife in his arms on a warm night, such an impotent husband is often weak and incapable in their marital life, or only experiences a fleeting moment of pleasure, or cannot even participate at all. This is not only extremely unpleasant for the man himself, but how can a wife in the midst of passionate love not feel resentment? After repeated occurrences, love is completely destroyed, leading to family tragedies such as elopement, divorce, madness, and suicide, which are too numerous to count!

Impotent men must quickly cure their illnesses! To be a good husband, one must enhance one's energy! According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and ourselves, the most effective treatment for curing impotence and enhancing energy is taking "Reproductive Essence," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals. This medicine is based on the most effective principle of supplementation therapy in modern medicine, extracting the endocrine essence from the reproductive glands of vigorous animals such as deer, orangutans, and sea dogs, and refining it using scientific replication methods. Therefore, its quality is precious, its efficacy is certain, and its restorative power is unparalleled by any similar preparation. After taking "Reproductive Essence," men will experience increased sperm production, kidney replenishment, enhanced development, brain invigoration, blood circulation, and nerve nourishment within one day and night. Continued use will inevitably cure various symptoms in a short period, doubling their energy. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong their lives, reverse aging, and rejuvenate themselves. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at major pharmacies such as China-West Five Continents Taihe) to stop the leakage, which will speed up the results!

The secret to love is only to cure hidden ailments and enhance energy. There is no other way. Men and women seeking love, do not wander down the wrong paths!

Beauty

### The Sadness of Atrophied Breasts

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Anyone who lives in the city and has a relatively modern mindset knows that the aesthetic ideals for modern women emphasize the beauty of well-developed features and health, rather than the artificiality of sickly beauty. The so-called beauty of well-developed features and health means having high, elastic breasts, a full and well-proportioned buttocks, a lithe and slender waist, and graceful posture when walking. If a woman possesses these qualities, her curves will be fully revealed, her appearance will be pleasing, and even if her face is ordinary, she can move in social circles, winning the praise of many men and gaining unparalleled glory and happiness. On the other hand, if a woman has atrophied breasts, a gaunt buttocks, withered muscles, and no curves, even if she has the face of Xi Shi and the figure of Flying Swallow, heavy makeup and flaunting herself in the market will only be ridiculed by those in the know. What happiness can she have! Not only that, but women with atrophied breasts also have impaired ovarian function, which inevitably leads to irregular menstruation, excessive leucorrhea, malnutrition, frigidity, and infertility. As a result, they have difficulty conceiving, may never conceive, or may conceive but miscarry, or give birth to children who die young. All of these hardships are like arrows piercing the heart, causing immeasurable sorrow. Yet, an unsympathetic husband may repeatedly use the saying, "There are three forms of unfilial conduct, and the greatest is to have no descendants," as an excuse to fulfill his desire to take a concubine. Once the husband's desire is fulfilled, love is broken, and sometimes even a glimpse is impossible. How can one hope for lasting love and affection? Therefore, such women often suffer in silence until the end of their lives, and their fate is extremely tragic! It is a profound sigh! Therefore, in this day and age, the condition of atrophied breasts must not be ignored. One should immediately purchase "Reproductive Essence" for women, an ovarian endocrine preparation, to seek remedy. This preparation has high-quality ingredients, gentle medicinal properties, and accurate efficacy. Taking it for two weeks will greatly increase appetite, clear the mind, lighten the limbs, and reduce fatigue. Taking it for four weeks will most noticeably cause the breasts to feel a sensation of growth, changing from flat to slightly raised, and from loose to firm. If taken for eight weeks, not only will breast development have astonishing results, but also all old and hidden ailments will be completely cured, restoring your inherent health and beauty. That's when you'll be amazed by its remarkable efficacy!

### Untreated Nocturnal Emission Will Bury Youth

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

The period when spring emotions are aroused in youth is a crucial juncture in their lives. If their will is weak, and they indulge in the bad habit of masturbation, or marry early and engage in excessive sexual activity, damaging their sexual nerves and loosening their sperm gates, they will inevitably develop nocturnal emission. In physiological terms, seminal fluid is the so-called endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, which nourishes nerves, regulates emotions, promotes development, and accelerates metabolism. Therefore, youths who are chaste, self-loving, and pure in heart will inevitably develop healthily, have clear minds, and have unlimited futures with endless happiness after marriage! Now, suffering from nocturnal emission and neglecting treatment is like having a leak in the source of life without plugging it. If drips are not stopped, they will erode into rivers and seas. The sperm gates will inevitably loosen day by day, and the frequency of emissions will inevitably increase day by day. With the precious and limited endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands constantly leaking out, how can it not be depleted? As a result, symptoms such as memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging will inevitably arise. Such youths, being muddled and incompetent, will not only fail to progress in their studies and have difficulty achieving their goals, with no hope for their future, but also be rejected by women and hated by wives and concubines due to their unattractive appearance and inability to satisfy them sexually. Their youth and happiness will be completely buried as a result!

In fact, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. In this era of advanced medicine, there are already the most targeted and effective treatments. This is to take "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets," which can effectively consolidate the sperm gates, calm the nerves, and promote sleep on the same night. If the nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, one must also take "Reproductive Essence," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Taking it for one month will inevitably cure the above-mentioned symptoms invisibly, strengthening the body and increasing energy. If patients can come to our clinic in person, and receive new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.

### (1) Masturbation is the Precursor to Nocturnal Emission

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Huang Fuxiang, 18 years old, from Wuxi, lives in Anle Lane, Xiaoshatu Road. He is a student at a certain middle school in this city and is quite intelligent, and his parents love him very much. Unexpectedly, he has recently become increasingly pale and thin, experiencing frequent dreams, insomnia, and a dazed mind during the day, causing his academic performance to plummet. His father suspected something, and carefully observed his sleep and actions, and only then did he realize that his son had become infatuated due to reading erotic novels. He had developed the bad habit of masturbation, which had loosened his sperm gates and caused nocturnal emission. As a result, symptoms such as brain weakness, memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, pale complexion, and incomplete development arose. It almost ruined Huang's future and buried his youth. His father strictly ordered his son to quit masturbation, and took him to our clinic for treatment. After a specialist physician carefully diagnosed his symptoms, he instructed him to purchase three boxes of "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets" and half a dozen bottles of "Reproductive Essence" from the Five Continents Pharmacy, to be taken together, and administered new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections. In just one month, the nocturnal emission was completely cured, and he felt clear-headed, had rich thoughts, a rosy complexion, a strong body, and his academic progress was progressing by leaps and bounds!

### (2) A Husband with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Is Ashamed of His Wife

Feng Gang, 30 years old, married for five years. Because Feng suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, and nocturnal emission, they had never had children, and the love between husband and wife had faded. His wife, unable to bear wasting her youth, secretly engaged in an affair, and was about to discuss eloping with her lover, but fortunately, her plan was discovered by Feng. However, due to his own illness, he could only endure the humiliation after a slight reprimand. Feng realized this and came to our clinic for treatment last month. After a specialist physician examined his condition, he instructed him to purchase a dozen bottles of "Reproductive Essence" and three boxes of "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets," to be taken together, and administered new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections. In less than a month, he had become energetic and strong, the love between husband and wife was rekindled, and his wife was completely devoted to her husband.

### "Planting Silver"

Superstitious people say that deities have the power to turn things into gold; unfortunately, the Greater Celestial Realm does not have the bustling markets of the mortal world, so gold and silver are of no use to the gods, who keep their skill a secret. While the deities do not need such things, there are many people who do. If they were to spread the skill to the world for the sake of helping and benefitting others, why not reveal their divine powers and benefit the world? Yet they refuse to show off their skills, instead watching those with empty wallets and a desire to spend be unable to fulfill their wishes; those with no money left in their bedsides suffer from hunger and cold, unable to sustain their lives. If the deities are truly compassionate, how can they be so cruel? In "Strange Tales from the Leisure Lodge," Pu Songling wrote about money falling from the sky. The story clearly states that a large copper coin was chosen as the seed, and the deity chanted incantations and applied talismans according to the rules, and sure enough, coins rained down from the beams with a clanging sound, piling up ankle-deep in an instant, amounting to hundreds of thousands of strings of cash. The door was closed, but because the demanded reward was too extravagant and the owner was stingy, all the money in the house transformed into flying ants and flew away, leaving only a few seed coins. Although the story is absurd, it shows the foolishness of greedy people and the playfulness of the creator. Recently, a woman named Shu from Nanxiang has been able to stir up women with her outlandish claims, causing them to compete to hand over their silver for her to "plant." It is said that more and more people are coming from afar, and over a hundred families have been deceived. Even after their silver has been swindled away, they are told that it is not yet time to open the soil and that it would be violating the rules and angering the gods, and the foolish women instead beg her to help them resolve the situation. Alas! What trickery does this woman Shu use to make people believe so firmly?

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation—The Latest Scientific View

— Zhou Nanhai

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are of utmost importance to people's livelihoods, physical strength, and the rise and fall, poverty and wealth, of society and the nation. Yet, we often neglect them in our daily habits, unaware of the significant losses. It is truly lamentable! The major powers, with their high levels of public intelligence, are urgently paying attention to research and striving to improve. Scholars advocate, and the government and people work together to implement these changes, not only affecting people's intelligence, longevity, family harmony, and happiness. Since I have been living in Shanghai for five years, recuperating in seclusion, I have read extensively on health-related literature. Now, I will select the latest theories and briefly outline them for my compatriots who are concerned about health and alarmed by aging.

Dr. Roland of Germany is an authoritative figure in longevity medicine. His famous book, "The Causes of Aging and Its Prevention," is included in the World Medical Encyclopedia and has been reprinted seven times and translated into twelve languages (the Chinese translation by Ding Fubao was just published in May). In addition to treating endocrine glands with medication, he also pays particular attention to daily clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, I will extract the main points and briefly describe them below:

Clothing: Should be loose, thin, and well-ventilated, and he strongly opposes the fashionable hard collars and leather shoes.

Food: Should be vegetarian, with a small amount of meat, and of course, should completely abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and stimulants. However, he cites examples of healthy elderly people from various countries, who occasionally use a very small amount of tobacco and alcohol even beyond the age of one hundred. Housing: Should be in the countryside, mountains, or by the sea, with an outdoor lifestyle, and preferably sleeping outdoors. He strongly opposes elevators.

Transportation: Should be walking, car rides, etc., and he opposes the crowded and dirty trains.

At first glance, these points may seem ordinary, but the methods and underlying theories are profound and extensive, and very different from other people's theories. He also lists the causes, prevention, and effective treatments for various diseases, including the strengths of various modern schools of thought, and is the most appropriate compromise. In my opinion, Western customs often favor extremes, so the resulting philosophies often go to the extreme. Dr. Roland's views are quite consistent with our country's old learning, taking the middle path in everything and being careful to avoid going too far. He is a rare find among Western philosophers. For example, his views on sexual life do not advocate complete abstinence, and his praise of our country's custom of wearing white for funerals, while opposing the Western custom of wearing black (which affects nerves and emotions), proves that our ancestors' guidance of society, their consideration of human feelings, and the development of good customs were indeed based on profound principles, and that the great benefits of strengthening the race and improving health were embodied in daily subtle actions. I am not stubbornly clinging to the past, but I have seen that new scientific discoveries are in fact consistent with the ideas of the ancients. I am unexpectedly pleased by the greatness of our national culture and more confident and self-respecting, and I hope that my compatriots will strengthen themselves.

Organ therapy, which is now popular in Western medicine, has been practiced in our country for thousands of years based on the principles of dietary therapy. Mineral drugs, to prevent aging, the Jin people took Five-Mineral Powder, and alchemists used cinnabar pills, both of which emphasized minerals. However, the refining was not pure and the application was not appropriate, so they serve as a warning. However, their insights are indeed no different from modern scientific methods. Is our country's medicine limited to just grass roots and tree bark? In fact, it encompasses everything, and its effectiveness is due to experience, unlike Westerners who previously only valued minerals. As for the study of preserving youth, which is related to longevity, our country has long been interested in it and has many specialized books on the subject. Dr. Roland also discusses the dos and don'ts of optics, climate, and medicine in his book, but I cannot list them all. I will stop here for now. Those who are interested in further research can consult the original book.

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are inherently for health, but today's customs often harm life (especially among the wealthy who lack proper knowledge). This is because they do not understand physiology or the principles of things, so they harm themselves day by day without realizing it. The poverty of society, the entanglement of diseases, and the increased mortality rate are truly lamentable. Why wait until old age to seek medical treatment and illness to seek medicine, which rarely helps the dying and weak? Why not pay attention to these things in advance and increase your knowledge in peacetime?

### Clothes and Odors

— Bai Shui

The clothes we wear, whether they are made of cotton or wool, have the property of absorbing various gases and moisture. Therefore, we must be careful in all places. A friend rented the remaining rooms of a soy sauce workshop. Although he did not come into contact with the soy sauce, people always smelled the odor of soy sauce when he approached. The employees in a perfumery do not apply perfume to their faces or spray perfume on their bodies, but people always smell an intoxicating fragrance when they approach. What is the reason for this? It is because the clothes we wear can absorb odors.

The ability of fabrics to absorb odors varies depending on the material. Generally, wool fabrics retain gases for the longest time, and linen fabrics retain them for the shortest time. Also, wet cloth is easier to absorb gases than dry cloth. If you wear a fur coat or a thick woolen garment and enter an unclean toilet with a foul odor, the odor absorbed by the clothes will take at least one or two days to dissipate. Therefore, even if we pay attention to cleanliness ourselves, we will naturally be contaminated with an odor if we go to an unclean place.

Because clothes absorb odors, we should change our clothes before meeting with our superiors, so as not to bring an offensive odor. It is inevitable that our clothes will be contaminated with unpleasant odors due to carelessness. We ourselves do not notice it because we are used to it, just as "entering a shop selling abalone, one does not smell its odor after a long time." Before meeting with guests, we should carefully change our clothes, regardless of whether we think we have an odor or not.

A person is constantly sweating, and this sweat contains many odors. If we do not change our clothes often, we can also be contaminated with odors from sweat. In winter, we change our shirts or coats, and it seems that the clothes in between will not be unclean. But this is not the case, because fabrics can absorb odors. So, the sweat odor on the shirt can still be absorbed by the middle layer of clothes. Therefore, in winter, the middle layer of clothes should also be changed often.

### A Few Words About Vitamins

— Ainong

After this publication carried my humble article "Economical Vitamin C" the other day, it surprisingly attracted the attention of readers. The editor forwarded letters from Liu Luqiu and Chen Lanqing, inquiring about what items are the most economical and rich in vitamins A, B, D, and E. Now, I will answer as follows. If there is anything inappropriate, please advise.

Vitamin A is related to human development. Milk, egg yolk, cod liver oil, cheese, and other foods contain it, and cod liver oil is the most abundant source of vitamin A. However, the above-mentioned foods are relatively aristocratic, and ordinary families will not consume them. But spinach and lettuce, such green leafy vegetables, also contain a little. Their prices are much cheaper, but the content is not as high as cod liver oil. However, we must eat fresh ones, because if they are not fresh, the vitamin A content is negligible.

Beriberi is a very painful disease caused by a lack of vitamin B. Especially those who eat Saigon rice, which has been ground by machines, on isolated islands are most likely to contract this disease, because vitamin B is contained in the germ of the rice. After being ground by machines, the rice germ is completely removed, leaving only a grain of starch. Starch does not contain vitamin B, so we should often eat whole grains of brown rice. It is not easy to buy in Shanghai. Some rice stores display the sign "Hygienic Rice," which is artificially ground yellow rice. In the mainland, the price of yellow rice is relatively cheap, but once it comes to Shanghai, with the title of "hygienic," it is more expensive than white rice. In addition to rice, beans and fruits, especially oranges and lemons, contain a little, but the prices of oranges and lemons are prohibitively expensive, so you can only go without. But you can buy some red beans, and often cook some red bean rice, red bean porridge, and red bean soup, all of which should be bland. Vegetables also contain some vitamin B that can dissolve in water, so you must not throw away the soup when cooking vegetables.

Vitamin D content in daily foods is very low. Cereals have absolutely none, and even green leafy vegetables do not have any. But according to recent reports, the liver oil of Rufferfish produced in the Mississippi River in the United States contains a lot. However, we have no way to consume it. Later, many scholars studied and discovered that the ultraviolet rays in sunlight, when irradiated on the human body, cause a certain amount of ergosterol in the skin and subcutaneous fat to be affected by ultraviolet rays, generating vitamin D in the body. So, if we want to get vitamin D, we must allow ultraviolet rays to shine on our bodies. But you should know that ultraviolet rays cannot penetrate glass windows, so those who often live in houses cannot get it. Especially in summer, the ultraviolet rays in sunlight are the strongest, so some people advocate sunbathing. However, on this isolated island, it is good enough to often go to the open park, see the sun's face more often, and be exposed to sunlight more often. We don't need to be afraid of it, because it is our nutrient!

Vitamin E can promote pregnancy function. Milk, white rice, corn, and lettuce all contain a little.

The development of vitamins is truly promising. Vitamin E has already been discovered, and there may be even more gains in the future.

### Continued Notes on the Story of Living

— Yong

The great Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu, in his middle age, lived in poverty, leading him to reside in a thatched hut. One afternoon and evening during a wind and rainstorm, the thatch covering his roof was blown away; at that time, the bed where Du Fu slept was almost completely soaked by the rain leaking in. However, Du Fu not only did not complain about his situation, but also deepened his sympathy for the general poverty of the world. He hoped that one day they would all have good housing, so that even if he were still confined to this thatched hut, he would be very content. At that time, he chanted a poem, in which there were such lines: "How can I get ten million mansions, to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them joyful?" It is my hope that the ruthless landlords on the solitary island today can all hear these words, and no longer seek only personal gain while disregarding others.

Su Shi, one of the eight great masters of the Tang and Song dynasties, once bought a house in Yixing. The procedures had been completed and the price had been paid in full; however, he later returned it to the original owner. The original owner was an old woman who was already past sixty years old, because her son was not successful, so she had no choice but to sell the little property she had inherited. When Su Shi saw this situation, he was naturally moved in his heart. As a result, he did not ask her to return the prepaid money, and the house still belonged to her. In seeking among the people of today, there is truly an insurmountable lament for the past!

### Road

— Lian

Anyone who has grown up in the countryside, used to walking on muddy roads and treading on gravel roads, cannot help but stick out their tongue and exclaim in surprise when they run to Shanghai and see the smooth and flat asphalt and cement roads. When they see Nanjing Road is piled up of neat teak blocks, they will exclaim it as a spectacle, but in this era of scientific advancement, in a world where nothing is strange, there are also many strange roads.

In England, some people remelt various broken glass and use molds to make square bricks for paving roads, and the road surface is very strong. In the Czech Republic, broken glass and cement are mixed together, called "two-and-a-half soil," to pave roads, and the effect is said to be very great.

In Kimberley, South Africa, there is a road that is inlaid with dazzling pearls, gemstones, and huge diamonds. The value of the entire road is about five million US dollars, and this road can be said to be the most valuable road in the world.

In India, they use a large amount of waste from sugar factories—cheap molasses—to pave roads, becoming an excellent "asphalt road." In the United States, cotton is sandwiched between two layers of asphalt to strengthen the road, just like putting steel bars into cement.

What I have said above is only a small part. I don't know how many other stranger and newer types there are. For example, roads are made of rubber, blunt steel, salt, etc., but we just don't know it.

Ms. Xiuzhen's Compilation - Tianchu Recipe

Eating vegetarian food in summer is particularly in line with the purpose of hygiene. In recent years, more and more Chinese and Western people have advocated eating vegetarian food. The motivation is entirely due to the vitamin content in vegetarian dishes, which is superior to various meat dishes. This recipe is intended to increase the interest of people from all walks of life in vegetarian food. For the matching of seasonal dishes, cleanliness is also the principle. At the same time, in order to break superstitions, it is not marked as pure vegetarian for Buddhist meals, but only focuses on refreshment and coolness. If readers have delicious dishes that meet the needs of summer days and can be included in this recipe, please do not hesitate to record them, so that this recipe will become the most beautiful recipe for the family.

### (43) White Jade Emerald Silk

— Draft by Bai Huizhen

Preparation… Watermelon peel, lotus root, pickled ginger, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, fine salt, soybean oil or raw oil

Preparation… Remove the flesh from the watermelon peel and wash it clean, add fine salt, and after a while, wash away the salty juice and cut into thin strips. Also, cut the lotus root and pickled ginger into thin strips. Put them all into a pot and stir-fry, add appropriate amount of monosodium glutamate and soy sauce, then cook again until transparent. The taste is clear and palatable, and the color is beautiful and lovely.

Answer to Mr. Jin's Question about Making Tomato Sauce: First, wash the tomatoes clean, soak them in boiling water, remove the skin and seeds, then cook them over low heat until they are rotten and thick. Add a little sugar crumbs, not too much, then cook again, and stir with chopsticks to prevent scorching. When it appears dry, it is ready. The above is a home-made method. The machinery and organization of those purchased on the market are large and sound, so the taste is very different.

If you want to buy "monosodium glutamate", "Tianchu soy sauce essence", and oil, salt, sauce and vinegar, please call "44914", and a special delivery person will deliver them immediately without charging a delivery fee.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Huaying

The editor of this journal forwarded a letter from a reader who signed himself "Hate Fate" the day before yesterday. He claimed to be a small cook in a complex family. His writing was quite fluent and his characters were not bad. He could have been a clerk for someone, but it is a pity that he is a small cook. According to the letter, his mistress is a strange woman who doesn't know the market prices and orders dishes according to my menu every day, insisting that eight jiao is enough; therefore, she often complains that the dishes he buys are too expensive. This small cook has been wronged, so he wants me to explain how much the two meat and two vegetarian dishes I prepare every day cost. Now I want to tell this Mr. Small Cook that your mistress really doesn't know the market situation. Two years ago, eight jiao a day was indeed enough, but now it must be doubled. The word "economic" in my menu is comparative, not absolute. For example, for a middle-class family of eight or nine people, it is relatively economical to eat two meat and two vegetarian dishes for one yuan and five or six jiao a day. My method of distribution is to limit two meat dishes to one yuan, and two vegetarian dishes to about half a yuan. That's how my family does it every day. If your mistress doesn't trust you, she might as well go to the vegetable market with you for a few days, and she will understand everything and won't let you be wronged.

Spring and Autumn

### About "The Happiness of Apprentices"

— Ding Ren

After reading "The Happiness of Apprentices" in this journal on July 30, I have some thoughts, so I would like to talk about it:

Giving apprentices who are living in pain some spiritual encouragement and comfort cannot be considered a bad thing, but to obliterate the existence of objective facts and measure everything with a moderate imagination is inevitably to fall into the viewpoint of "idealism" and to misunderstand the "worldview" that an author should have, that is, the author's standpoint. Therefore, in this work of the happy person, we not only do not see the direction to guide apprentices to obtain true happiness, but also smell a paper full of class atmosphere; we not only do not see the pointer to thoroughly transform the lives of apprentices, but also the decadent style of reformism; in other words, this is not to fight against the minority who rule this society; but to surrender to the minority to seek personal opportunities. In the future, it will be even better to change from "apprentice, boss..." and become a minority himself, and slowly create the "apprentice" wholesale store that he tried before. At the same time, this "happy person" completely underestimated the entire national, collective strength, and completed the "personal struggle history" by separating personal livelihood from national livelihood. This is a very wrong understanding, but this is also to say that the "happy person" only sees the phenomenon, but does not grasp the essence.

Secondly, the examples cited in the "Happiness" article are all British and American celebrities, and they have ignored that they are standing in China and are seeking a way out for Chinese apprentices; they have ignored the differences between China's social system, social nature and those of Britain and the United States. It is to confuse the capitalist society of Britain and the United States with the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of China; it is not to see clearly the real living conditions of Chinese apprentices, but to say subjective "cool words". In fact, to be honest, to change the current "washing rice, washing vegetables, starting a stove, holding a child, washing diapers... apprentice life" is by no means a trivial and partial issue. Even if we take a step back, just as this "happy person" imagined, at most a few "bosses" and "managers" will be created. After all, there is only one Edison in the world, let alone the difference in social nature between the United States and China?

Therefore, my opinion is that in order to reasonably solve the painful current lives of apprentices, it should be linked to the liberation of the entire nation. This is also like women who want to be liberated must work hard in their position, and the goal of their efforts in their position is undoubtedly the same goal pursued by the entire nation. Therefore, the solution to the lives of apprentices should also be a link in this whole. If you insist on separating it, the result will be drilling into a "dead end".

Finally, I would like to make a sincere appeal on behalf of the apprentices: First, please bosses and masters broaden your horizons and see what time it is in China now. Delaying the precious time of young people is not only sorry for the apprentices themselves, but also sorry for the country and the nation. Second, I object to the "happy person's" personal struggle method, but should use collective methods to learn and struggle: apprentices should find apprentice friends around them, or more progressive masters or close upper-level elements to unite together, so that they can truly pool their wisdom and learn the knowledge they want to learn. At the same time, only in this way can they get rid of the current pain and get true happiness. Otherwise, if you run with this "happy person", you will never run to the bright road in your life. Recently, I saw a movie—Aviation Hero, which had such a sentence: "Why would such a great person be born in an ordinary family?" That has to be attributed to the thorough transformation of society. Third, I hope that people who are enthusiastic about social welfare can come out and run a few apprentice schools like "newsboy schools", which would be of immeasurable merit. Although the environment in Shanghai is bad, this kind of social welfare has not yet been completely "blocked", so this is not a question of being locked by others, but a question of willingness! The above opinions are humble, but in order to seek the true happiness of apprentices, I cannot but state my humble opinions and wait for the correction of those who know.

Amateur Chat

### After Reading "The Happiness of Apprentices"

— Shi Wei

After reading Cao Lingyou's "The Happiness of Apprentices" in this journal on the thirty-first of last month, I feel that I have a lot to say; first of all, I very much agree with Cao Jun's subjective wish to write that article, that is, "It is nothing more than to prove that people who are apprentices should not be too pessimistic, but should seize the opportunity of patience and work hard, and there will always be a day of success." This spirit of not being discouraged in a bad environment and striving for progress should be promoted.

However, from an objective point of view, Cao Jun's article will lead people to terrible conclusions; my impression after reading the article twice is this: that is, people are happy to be apprentices, although apprentices are doing "humble work," taking "stipends that are not enough to buy daily necessities," and suffering from "the temper of the old manager"... but these are happiness for apprentices. Therefore, the apprenticeship system is also reasonable.

Cao Jun uses the achievements of Edison and others to prove that being an apprentice is not without prospects, and his intention is quite kind; but I want to ask, how many of the like of Edison, Wells, and Franklin are there among thousands of apprentices?

I can't think of a popular example for a while, so let's turn the book. I have a foreign language booklet on hand, which has this section:

"The flowers and plants in the courtyard are gray, thin and weak. Why are they gray and weak? Because they grow under the big pine tree, the big pine tree proudly stretches its branches and completely covers the sunlight.

"And the monks and servants in the monastery often trample on them and damage their buds, so the flowers and plants in the courtyard are gray and weak.

"Now let's look at the flowers and plants by the river. They fully enjoy the sunlight and freely absorb water, so they can thrive. They are strong, they live happily, and they comfortably and proudly stretch their green leaves."

Obviously, the like of Edison are only a few branches in the flowers and plants in the courtyard that occasionally get sunlight and have not been trampled by monks. But the vast majority are born gray and weak. So, do we hope that there will be a few countable Edisons in society, or countless Edisons, like the flowers and plants by the river?

Cao Jun also talked about the problem of suffering, but I think it lacks principles: I have pointed out about the way in my article "Talking about Apprentices" in this journal on the twenty-fourth of last month, so I should bring it to a stop here.

The text is finished, but I still have some thoughts; I am happy that the apprenticeship issue has attracted attention. Therefore, I personally hope that the readers of this journal who have been apprentices and are still apprentices will write down their various experiences; wouldn't this make our theory closer to reality?

### The Ballerina's Destination

Chapter 4 Several Hypotheses

I saw that the bellboy's uniform really had the number 71 embroidered on it in red thread. This was a young man in his twenties, with a pair of dark eyes that fully showed that he was not only quick-witted, but also well-trained." However, the main subject of training for waiters in large hotels is not how to serve passengers, but how to distinguish the size of passengers' wallets and how to make money. This number 71 glanced at the corner of his eye into his palm, and then looked up to estimate Hawthorne and me, then nodded, and immediately performed his training skills.

"Sir, what's the matter?" The title of "Sir" was clearly a reaction produced by something in his hand.

Hawthorne said, "What kind of people live in this number 74?"

The bellboy hesitated for a moment and replied, "A man and a woman, surnamed Jin."

"Is the man a young man in a suit?" "No, he's an old man in Chinese clothes. The woman is still only in her twenties." When I heard this, I couldn't help but feel disappointed again. This was certainly not the person we were looking for. But Hawthorne still did not show a negative expression.

He continued to ask, "When did they come?"

Number 71 replied, "Just arrived—less than an hour ago." Hawthorne's eyes flashed. "Then, who lived here yesterday?" The quick-witted bellboy seemed to suddenly remember something and hurriedly replied, "Yes, it was a young man, wearing a suit, very tall, surnamed Qian."

Hawthorne quickly took out the small photo from his chest pocket. "Is this the person?"

The waiter looked at the photo and nodded repeatedly, saying, "That's the person. He moved out yesterday—no, actually he moved out today."

My hope suddenly recovered, and I was of course very happy.

Hawthorne asked again, "When exactly did he move out?" (66) Completely blocked the sunlight.
