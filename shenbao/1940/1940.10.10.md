### Australia and India Express Support for Reopening the Burma Road, Believing That Britain Is Beginning to Strengthen Its Far Eastern Policy and Abandoning Its Policy of Appeasement Toward Japan

Melbourne. Today, Australian Foreign Minister McEwen declared that Australia fully supports the decision to reopen the Burma Road. Australia had previously expressed its views to Britain. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Calcutta. The Chairman of the All-India Congress Committee, Acharya, said here today that all Indians welcome the news that the Burma Road will be reopened. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Chongqing. According to news reports, the British government had requested the Chinese government to send a task force to protect Burma if Burma felt threatened by Japan as a result of the reopening of the road. When this matter was inquired about by officials here, the response was that they were unaware of such a request. Officials welcomed the British Prime Minister's statement on reopening the Burma Road, not only because of the material benefits that would result from using the road, which would undoubtedly contribute to China's war of resistance, but also because this matter could symbolize Britain's determination to end its appeasement of Japan and join a common front with the United States in the Far East. It is generally believed here that the dangerous phase of the European and Chinese wars has passed. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Editorial

### The Chinese National Movement and International Phenomena

The international situation encountered on the Double Tenth Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China is such that everyone inevitably understands the profound significance within it. The Xinhai Revolution was the beginning of the Chinese national movement, and now is the final stage of the completion of the tempering of the national movement. The international situation it faces is precisely the largest tempering furnace.

Because of the collusion between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the international situation has made the Far Eastern atmosphere surrounding China and Japan unable to continue its chaos. It has made the haze of the international situation clear, the boundaries clear, and the facts have proven that China's war of resistance has won widespread support. Looking back from today to those years when the Far Eastern dispute had just begun, it was just a spark. Although its background was not without some more serious problems, those who started the fire at that time never expected it to develop to such a scale, even indirectly leading to the tragic disaster of a world war. Now, the world significance of China's war of resistance is clear due to the recent developments in the Far East. The various prejudices or biases of the international community in the past, as well as the various tangible and intangible measures that harmed China, can now be corrected in a timely and thorough manner. Fundamentally, the essence of the Chinese national movement and its relationship to the safety and security of the Far Eastern situation should also be deeply understood by all parties, and close cooperation with China should be carried out in order to take full and effective measures against the growing crisis in the Pacific.

From the Xinhai year to the present, these nearly thirty years are the process of building the Republic of China. The war that has been going on for the past three years is the most difficult and final scene in the nation-building process. Everything that has happened in the war has been enough to prove that the new China has begun to step into the ranks of modern powers. This is the result of the sacrifices and struggles of the military and civilians in recent years, and also the effectiveness shown by the long-term national movement from the Xinhai Revolution to the present. The remarkable results have been achieved, and the Chinese themselves must not be self-deprecating. The international perception of China should also be placed on a new level and reconsidered. We must inevitably have a positive influence on the Far East and even the entire world. It should be known that the turmoil of the Far Eastern situation has been going on for decades. The main reason is naturally that a stable balance cannot be formed between the countries involved, and the crux of the problem is the lack of a strong China. The ultimate goal of the Chinese national movement is to make up for this major deficiency. On the other hand, this is why those who invade China want to destroy it so much. In recent years, China has been at the final stage of its efforts. The restoration of future Far Eastern peace and order is only possible after China stands tall in the Asian continent in an independent and free posture. Not only that, the more serious the Pacific crisis, the more urgent this need becomes. The recent special concerns of the democratic powers about the Far East and their consideration of various emergency measures prove that a new era is about to unfold in the Pacific. One of the most important tasks is how to further integrate these measures with the existing effective factors in the Far East. China's national independence movement should also strive to complete the final task in this expanded international crisis. Looking at the international situation in recent years, some countries, large and small, strong and weak, have become vassals or even disappeared, and the colors of some regions have changed on the map. Only China, regardless of whether the international environment is beneficial or harmful, and whether friendly countries support it, has always persevered arduously, unyieldingly, and defended the country with its own strength, moving towards its predetermined goal. In addition to demonstrating the true value of the Chinese national movement, it has also fully fulfilled its important responsibility of maintaining justice and order in the Far East. This is a fact that should be recognized by the world today.

Recently, the reckless actions of the aggressors have been so extreme that they can hardly be imagined or controlled by normal reason. But this is by no means a sign that the world crisis is becoming darker and more chaotic. On the contrary, it is precisely the process that must be gone through in order to set things right. Observing the recent developments, the factors of light are increasing in direct proportion to the darkness. In any case, justice and fairness are virtues inherent in everyone's nature, while aggression is only for the sake of fulfilling the greed of a few. In the long-term torment and tempering, all the weaknesses of will and even habits will be gradually eliminated. In the end, of course, only the innate virtues will remain. China's three years of arduous war have already proven that this statement is not false. In the war pattern of the world, it will inevitably tend in this direction. The deeper the night, the closer the dawn. Whether it is the future of the Chinese national movement, the Far East, or the world, a glimmer of dawn has already been revealed in the deep dark night.

### Thai Aircraft Repeatedly Fly Over Vietnamese Territory: Thai-Vietnamese Relations Worsen: France States That It Will Ignore Thailand's Demands: Thai University Students Hold Demonstrations

Hanoi. French officials here announced last night that they had received instructions from the Vichy government to "ignore" the threatening demands made by Thailand to France. At the same time, officials here again denied that conflicts had occurred between the two sides on the Thai-Vietnamese border, and denied reports that Thai troops had crossed the Vietnamese border. French officials also stated that the negotiations between Thailand and France are currently being handled entirely by Vichy and Bangkok. At the same time, the retirement of five French military officers in Vietnam has caused some unease here. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)

Bangkok. Three thousand Thai university students gathered yesterday in front of the Ministry of National Defense to demand a revision of the border with Vietnam. When Thai Prime Minister Songgram General delivered a speech to the students, the demonstrators cheered enthusiastically. Songgram declared that Thailand's demands were only for Thai territory and areas inhabited by Thai people. The students then held another demonstration march in the afternoon, which was unprecedented in Thai history. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 9th)

Bangkok. In view of the tense relations between Vietnam and Thailand, the Thai Prime Minister has taken precautionary measures. The Ministry of the Interior has begun to investigate the activities of the French in Thailand and has broadcast reports that the Thai people should no longer accept Vietnamese currency in order to avoid future losses. The government has also issued a proclamation recruiting 500 volunteer air force soldiers, aged seventeen to twenty. Newspapers here prominently reported that the French government had rejected Thailand's demands for the cession of territory, and some advocated taking swift action. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 9th)

Hanoi. Authoritative French sources claim that Thailand has agreed in principle to the establishment of a joint commission by France and Thailand to resolve minor incidents between the two countries and to leave Thailand's territorial demands to Vichy for resolution. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)

Vichy. Recently, Thai aircraft have repeatedly flown over the airspace of French Indochina, causing considerable tension in relations. Yesterday, a Vietnamese Laotian named Nai Xiangtai (transliteration) was shot and killed by Vietnamese military police on the Mekong River. The Thai government insisted that the deceased was a Thai citizen, further worsening the situation. According to reliable sources here, the man was actually trying to swim across the Mekong River and was shot by the French military police. Furthermore, an investigation revealed that the deceased was actually a Laotian native belonging to Vietnam. The Thai government, wanting to attract international attention, claimed that the man was a Thai citizen and notified its embassies abroad of the incident. However, it is generally believed here that the incident was actually initiated by the Thai government, its intention being the same as the previous intrusion of Thai aircraft into Vietnamese airspace. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

Vichy. Regarding the recent border disputes between French Indochina and Thailand, well-informed sources here recently stated that France signed a non-aggression pact with Thailand in early June of this year. However, this pact has not yet been ratified. At the same time, the French Minister to Thailand, Lepissier, and Thai Prime Minister Pibul also exchanged documents on resolving various border issues. The border line between Thailand and Vietnam, dating back to 1907, has not been clearly demarcated, especially in the Mekong River basin. Thailand has certain rights on the left bank of the river, while the right bank is entirely controlled by France. Therefore, disputes often arise over the sovereignty of countless small islands in the Mekong River. On June 12 of this year, the French Minister to Thailand and the Thai Prime Minister exchanged documents with the aim of resolving this difficulty. At that time, the Thai government solemnly declared that once the Mekong River border issue was resolved, the Thai government would no longer make any territorial claims. Unexpectedly, while Japan and Vietnam were conducting negotiations, Thailand suddenly notified the French government that the French-Thai non-aggression pact could not be approved until a mixed commission was established to carry out Thai-Vietnamese border demarcation. In September, Thailand took a further step and made other territorial demands, stating in essence that if the sovereignty of Vietnam was transferred to another country, France would cede Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. In addition, it demanded that Vietnam cede several places belonging to French sovereignty on the Mekong River, some near the Thai border and others in Laos. The French government has rejected all of the above demands. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

### Large Numbers of German Troops Continuously Enter Romanian Territory Along the Danube River, with Intentions to Invade Iraqi Oil Fields; German Troops in Poland Increased to 100 Divisions

Bucharest. The first batch of German troops is currently moving down the Danube River, carrying tanks, flat-trajectory guns, anti-aircraft guns, and air squadrons. After arriving at Giurgiu, the German troops will advance to Ploiesti and Bucharest, as well as Targoviste near Bucharest. German troops will build an air force base there. Anti-aircraft guns will be erected at the oil fields and the Giurgiu oil pipeline terminal. In recent weeks, German war materiel has been continuously transported into Romanian territory in unprecedented quantities and of enormous value. As a result, the trade between Romania and Germany, which was previously in Romania's favor, has now become in Germany's favor. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

London. Reuters foreign correspondents claim that it is impossible to ascertain the number of German troops entering Romanian territory, their intentions, or where they will be stationed due to propaganda and Romanian censorship of communications. Personnel dispatched by the German Secret Police have been operating in Romania for some time, arranging how German troops will enter the territory. This is a noteworthy issue. Hungary may have followed in the footsteps of Sweden and Finland by allowing Germany to pass through. Romania's actions in inviting German troops are certainly contrary to neutrality. According to reports, when Germany used troops in Poland last year, it assembled a large army in the area of the railway leading from Poland to Romania. However, because the Soviet army advanced rapidly and occupied Poland first, the Soviet Union occupied the area and re-laid the tracks to the same gauge as the Soviet railways. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

London. British sources received news last night that Germany had recently greatly reinforced its troops in Poland. It is generally believed that this move is an attempt to exert pressure on the Soviet Union. Another British source believes that the number of German troops in Poland has now reached 100 divisions. It is speculated that Germany's increase in troops in Poland is intended to force the Soviet Union to take a "friendly" reaction if Germany takes action in the Black Sea and the Tartar Strait in the future. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)

Stockholm. The "Tidningen" recently published an unconfirmed Berlin report stating that German and Italian troops would soon break through Romania and Turkey to reach Iraq in order to seize British oil fields. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)

German Military Action Against Romania Is Composed of Two Factors

London. According to Reuters military correspondent Colonel Lowe, the military situation in Romania today is composed of several factors. Its geographical location, agricultural fields, and natural resources, allowing it to be rich in oil, have made Romania a military target for both East and West. Therefore, aggression from the West is not surprising. The Germans will mobilize at least two of their famous mixed corps to occupy Romania. Although the Romanian army is equipped with slightly older equipment, its officers and soldiers number a total of 1.6 million. The Axis powers dispatched elite German troops as the vanguard after the Brenner Pass meeting, undoubtedly for this reason. The German mixed corps is organized as follows: (1) Reconnaissance troops composed of motorcycle machine gun squads and light armored vehicle infantry squads. (2) A tank group composed of 540 tanks, which was quite successful in northern France. (3) A brigade of riflemen riding motorcycles, consisting of five battalions and motorcycles, and vehicles equipped with infantry guns, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns. (4) An artillery regiment and 100 five-inch howitzers. Hitler used the strength of this army to cause France to collapse and greatly wished to display it on the British coast. However, it was a pity that it did not achieve its wish and was disbanded. Therefore, the problem of continuing to maintain and train it arose. Thus, entering Romania now is killing two birds with one stone. In addition, there is another factor, namely, the number of German aircraft may exceed that of Britain. However, most of the strength of the German air force lies in the mixed corps of ground troops aided by dive bombers. However, when it encounters Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft in Britain, it falls one after another, like falling leaves in late autumn. At this time, when the final battle of the Axis powers is still far away, these dive bombers and mechanized divisions cannot be allowed to be idle. Judging from the entire military action of the Axis powers, it can be seen that they have changed their previous military plans after discovering a serious miscalculation of their strength against Britain. The German General Command's change of its scheduled plan at this time is tantamount to admitting failure, because the situation today is very different from that in June. The British army is becoming stronger and stronger, and its air force has also expanded considerably during this period. Powerful bombers and long-range fighters will soon be dispatched to attack German and Italian positions anywhere. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

The Axis Powers Exert New Pressure: Romanian Leaders to Visit Berlin

Budapest. Although the Bucharest side has strongly denied the entry of German troops into Romania, well-informed sources revealed today that the summons of King Michael of Romania and General Antonescu to the German and Italian capitals will be followed by new pressure from the Axis powers. According to reports, King Michael and General Antonescu will travel to Berlin and then to Rome at the end of this month to meet with Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the details of resolving the new order in the Balkans. At the same time, diplomatic circles here have learned that Germany has assured the Soviet government that the entry of German troops into Romania will not change the status quo in the Balkans. According to diplomatic sources, the German government's only wish is to prevent the possibility of Britain landing in Romania's Black Sea ports and seizing Romania's oil wells, which are of great importance to Germany's war machine. (International News Agency dispatch of the 9th)

The Situation in Romania Deteriorates Daily: British Nationals in Romania Ordered to Evacuate

Bucharest. The British Ambassador to Romania, Hoare, has advised all British nationals involved in the Romanian oil industry to leave the country immediately. All those who have been advised have now moved out of the oil area. Six of the twelve British nationals residing in Bucharest left the country today, and the rest will leave Romania on Monday next week. Ambassador Hoare requested Romania to explain the situation arising from the entry of German troops into Romanian territory. Subsequently, after receiving a reply from the Romanian side, he issued the advice for British nationals to leave the country. It is reported that the Romanian side is currently making rapid preparations to accommodate German troops entering the country by rail and sailing down the Danube River by ship. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Bucharest. Sir Reginald Hoare, the British Minister to Romania, has requested the Romanian government to immediately explain the situation arising from Germany's clear intention to station regular troops in important locations in Romanian territory. The earliest date for the arrival of German troops in Romanian territory is expected to be Thursday. British officials here are well aware that if German troops are stationed in Romanian territory, the British may not be able to maintain their mission in Bucharest. Therefore, Britain's position in Romania depends on the response of Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

### Britain and Turkey in Close Contact; Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Resigns

Istanbul. The Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union departed for Moscow yesterday to resume his duties. He returned to Ankara at the beginning of September to report on his work. At the same time, German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen has returned here after a three-week vacation. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

### New Group Formed in the Balkans: Rome Denies Statement

Rome. Regarding the report in the London "News Chronicle" that Germany and Italy intend to organize a new Balkan consultation including Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece, but excluding Turkey, authoritative sources here solemnly denied it yesterday, stating that it was inaccurate. (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)

### Spanish Cabinet Reportedly to Be Reorganized: German and Italian Special Envoys Welcomed by Spanish Newspapers

Madrid. Political figures here stated that after Spanish Interior Minister Suner's visit to Berlin and Rome, there will inevitably be significant results in Spain's domestic politics. A five-person meeting is scheduled to be held this week to review the general political situation and the contents of Suner's meetings with Hitler and Mussolini. It is generally believed that the Spanish cabinet may soon be reorganized. (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)

Madrid. Regarding the report that Italian special envoy General Bono and German Nazi Party special envoy Himmler will soon visit Madrid, the government newspaper "Arriba" commented that Spain's politics are now once again in contact with the European continent, and Spain will occupy its due position in the new European order. The newspaper also called the two special envoys the most senior and reputable liaison officers of Mussolini and Hitler, and political leaders for the construction of the "New European Order." (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)

### Churchill Addresses the House of Commons on the War Situation: British Naval, Land, and Air Defenses Greatly Strengthened; Enemy's Blitzkrieg Plan Becomes a Mirage

London - British Prime Minister Churchill addressed the House of Commons today on the war situation, stating that Hitler had unleashed his poisonous wrath upon our civilians and cities for over a month. He claimed he would raze British cities to the ground. The first question we should ask is, to what extent has the full strength of the German bombers been deployed? The German short-range dive bombers, numbering several hundred, have not been seen since suffering a major blow on August 15th. They are likely being kept in reserve for the overall plan to invade England, or have been moved to other battlefields; this is unknown. Therefore, we only have to deal with long-range heavy bombers. On average, about 400 military bombers seem to fly to our coast every night. Whether this number can be greatly increased is doubtful. What is certain is that German aircraft can sometimes exert their full force for several consecutive days. However, on a monthly basis, the average number may not increase significantly. The number of enemy aircraft attacks has gradually decreased in the past ten days. In the month since the major air raids began, British casualties and material damage have gradually decreased. Most of the German bomber pilots can only drop bombs indiscriminately. Generally speaking, the German effort to attack England has absorbed a portion of its total strength. I do not wish to say that we have fully measured the enemy's strength, but we are certainly more confident of the enemy's strength than before. The Germans claim to have dropped a total of 22,000 tons of explosives on England since the start of the war and claim to have treated London with 251 tons of explosives on Thursday night. Upon investigation, 180 people died in London that night. According to this calculation, one ton of bombs cannot kill one person. Compared to the dangers of the attacks from 1914 to 1918, it is only one-thirteenth as dangerous. At the beginning of the engagement, we expected to die two or three thousand people and injure twelve thousand every night. However, from the start of the war to last Saturday, a total of 8,500 people died from bombing and 13,000 were injured. Since the major air raid began on September 7th, the number of casualties has decreased every week, initially to 6,000, then to 3,000. However, the damage to houses is still significant. At the current rate of destruction, it would take ten years to destroy half of London's houses. However, before ten years pass, many things will have happened to Hitler and his Nazi regime, and Mussolini will have fully experienced what he did not expect when he stabbed France in the back.

### Adopting New Plans to Deal with Air Raids

The question of what constitutes retaliation and what does not is not worth debating. We should not hope that winter will reduce the bombing. We may have new methods to make the large-scale bombing of civilians at night or in the fog more difficult work for the enemy than it is currently. I am not at liberty to explain these new methods at this time. It is better for the enemy to become aware of them from practical experience. We must, in the shortest possible time, provide everyone in areas that are frequently bombed with bomb shelters where they can place their bedding. We have now started a major plan to provide those sleeping in bomb shelters with food and hot water during winter nights, and the agency for assisting those whose homes have been destroyed is also expanding. The Financial Secretary has prepared a national mandatory insurance bill to protect against the destruction of real estate. The government also intends to implement insurance measures for various movable properties, including furniture. In this way, we can say that Hitler's attempt to terrorize the British people has completely failed. Even more certain is that the lack of water, electricity, etc., will not disrupt our maritime traffic.

### The Crisis is Not Over, Maintain Vigilance

As for the German invasion of England, it cannot be said that the crisis is over. We must continue to actively strengthen naval, land, and air defenses. The main reason why the Germans have not yet carried out the invasion of England is that the British Air Force has won successive victories. The three major victories on August 15th, September 15th, and September 17th have shown the world that we have gained air superiority. With the Air Force victorious, the Navy's power is even more stable. Not only are American destroyers gradually joining the fleet, but reinforcements from other places are also arriving one after another. After months of air combat, the British Air Force is now stronger in both fighter and bomber aircraft than it was in May of this year, and the number of pilots is also rapidly improving. That Britain can catch up with the German Air Force in the first year of the war is something that the world never dreamed of before. Our progress is rapid, and next year at this time, comments on this matter will be even more satisfying.

### Reinforcements to the Middle East, Weather Improves

The British Prime Minister spoke of reinforcements to the British forces in the Middle East and elsewhere, saying that it is impossible to predict the outcome when enemy forces travel far across the desert to attack, and British, Australian, New Zealand, Ceylon, Indian, and Egyptian troops surround them. However, I can say that we are currently doing our best. The weather is better now than it was some time ago.

### Reasons for Failure in West Africa

The Prime Minister continued to speak of the Dakar campaign, saying that this was purely a French affair. Although the British side was prepared to provide assistance that could determine the situation in Dakar under certain circumstances, it did not wish to cause a long-term, violent conflict between General de Gaulle and the Vichy French. The British government will always assist de Gaulle until he achieves his goals and will never abandon him halfway. The overall situation in Dakar was adversely changed when three French cruisers and three destroyers arrived. All six ships carried supporters of Vichy, who were ordered to go to Dakar to intimidate the residents and guide the defenses. The British government's policy has always been not to interfere with the actions of Vichy French ships as long as they do not sail to enemy-controlled ports. On this occasion, the French ships approached the Strait of Gibraltar, and the First Lord of the Admiralty and the War Cabinet were initially unaware of it. By the time they received the report, it was too late to stop them. This was due to some mistakes, and is now a matter of military discipline. The government issued orders to stop the French ships at Casablanca, or, if that was not possible, to prevent them from entering Dakar. Neither of these measures was successful. However, the French ships were unable to carry out their plan to attack the port of Douala. Two of the French ships eventually entered the port of Dakar, while the other two were intercepted by British cruisers and turned back to Casablanca without using force. In the Dakar campaign, the Vichy side lost two submarines, one destroyer caught fire, and one cruiser was hit by artillery fire. The French battleship "Richelieu" also continued to suffer damage. As for the British side, one battleship and one large cruiser were damaged, but they are still capable of fighting with only minor repairs.

### Hope for Spain to Make Prudent Decisions

Finally, the British Prime Minister spoke of Spain, saying that no country in the world needs peace, food, and prosperous trade more than Spain. Britain hopes that Spain will follow the right path and not lose its status as a major Mediterranean power. (Reuters)

### German Air Force Employs "Hammering Tactics"; Unprecedented Catastrophe for the British Isles; Bombed Area Spreads Across Eighty Districts; Aircraft Noise Never Ceased for a Minute from Last Night to This Morning

London - Air Marshal Göring's pilots, last night and this morning, placed the British Isles on the anvil, hammering its vital organs everywhere. Black smoke billowed, intertwined, rose upwards, and obscured the sky, not dispersing for several hours until this morning. The German Air Force deployed a deadly enveloping maneuver in the British skies, launching its largest offensive since the start of the war, dropping explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, landing in eighty areas of this beleaguered country. Almost no part of England, Scotland, or Wales escaped the suppression of the German bombs. From dusk yesterday to this morning, several hundred German aircraft flew over London without a minute's rest. Countless fires broke out, and the fires had not been extinguished at the time of this reporter's dispatch. The extent of the destruction increased every hour, and the deaths continued. This air raid by German aircraft is likely to set a new record. London has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe, and the nearby towns and villages with dense populations have also suffered greatly. (International News Agency)

London - Last night and this morning, Nazi aircraft, operating over an unprecedentedly wide area of northern England, bombed over eighty towns, villages, and cities, including the London area. The night raid on the London area last night lasted only ten minutes less than the previous night. Before midnight, most of the German aircraft activity was concentrated in London. The British capital and its surrounding areas and suburbs suffered an unprecedentedly severe attack. Fierce anti-aircraft fire valiantly resisted the enemy. As the night deepened, the number of attackers gradually decreased, and by dawn, there was no sound in the air, and the anti-aircraft guns also ceased firing. Within minutes after the air raid siren sounded last night, a single German aircraft was spotted over London and dropped incendiary bombs. After that, large numbers of Messerschmitt fighters and bombers arrived, dropping incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs like rain, causing damage in many places. This morning's newspapers are full of news of the German "hammering tactics" threat, saying that this mad air raid by the Germans is the result of the heavy losses inflicted on Berlin by British aircraft on Sunday night. Most Londoners did not pay much attention to the air raids of the past two nights, as they have long become accustomed to spending long nights underground and only come out briefly to eat breakfast. Towns outside the London area, the southeastern coastal area, and inland counties suffered the most severe encounters, and bombs also fell in the southwest of England. A famous school was bombed. (Associated Press)

Yesterday and last night, the German Air Force continued to bomb London, as well as port facilities, arms factories, barracks, and supply depots in southern England. German aircraft also flew low to strafe aircraft parked on airfields with machine guns, and bombs fell within the airfields. German reconnaissance aircraft dropped several bombs on British merchant ships near the coast of Scotland, and the ships caught fire. A German aircraft bombed five troop transports escorted by British warships 200 kilometers from the coast of Scotland. One was severely damaged and stopped. A total of sixteen enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, twelve of which were shot down in aerial combat and four were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. Three German aircraft were missing.

A few bombs also fell elsewhere in southeastern England yesterday morning, but there were no significant material or life losses. British coastal aircraft also shot down two enemy aircraft in the English Channel. No British aircraft were lost. Enemy aircraft attacking England were unable to penetrate inland and indiscriminately dropped bombs on coastal towns in Kent and Sussex. Several houses were damaged and there were some casualties.

### Far East Crisis Intensifies; Britain and the United States Seek Close Cooperation; Britain's Position Significantly Strengthened Compared to Before; United States Moving Towards a Brave Path

Washington - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, announced last night that he had canceled his plan to fly back to London this week because the British Foreign Office had informed him that the crisis in the Far East was imminent. The British Ambassador made this statement after discussing the Far East situation with President Roosevelt. The British Ambassador indicated that Britain anticipated a crisis in the Far East as a result of London's decision to reopen the Burma Road on October 17 to transport war materials to Chongqing. (Associated Press)

Washington - British Ambassador Lord Lothian has canceled his plan to return to England for vacation because the White House feels that a crisis may occur in the Far East as a result of Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road. The cancellation of the return plan was announced by the Ambassador after visiting President Roosevelt at the White House. Although he refused to elaborate on the details of the meeting, he made it clear that it was to discuss the Far East situation. When asked when the British government expected the Far East crisis to occur, he replied that the crisis might come as a result of the reopening of the Burma Road. He had originally planned to sail to England on Sunday, but on Sunday he felt that this trip was not appropriate, and yesterday he canceled it. U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday. Horinouchi, who will soon leave the United States for Japan, had come to say goodbye to Hull. At Hull's special request, they met secretly at the State Department for 40 minutes. It is reported that Hull explained to him his views on the overall situation in the Far East. Many believe that Hull also issued a warning about Japan's attitude in bringing the United States to its current position. According to the decision of the U.S. Department of State to advise American expatriates in the Far East to return to the United States, the American citizens involved, including Chinese and Japanese citizens, total 11,000. (Reuters)

Washington - Political figures believe that the U.S. government's advice to expatriates to leave the Far East is greatly related to the reopening of the Burma Road. The Department of State issued instructions to American consuls stationed in [Manchukuo], Hong Kong, China, and Indochina, ordering them to advise American expatriates to return to the United States as soon as possible, which in fact indicates that Britain and the United States will cooperate closely in the Far East and adopt a strong position in Asia. In order to save face, Japan may be forced to take some kind of retaliatory action when the Burma Road is reopened. However, many believe that the reason why the United States advised expatriates to leave dangerous areas may be for this reason. Today's newspapers in Washington all carried this advice with excitement. One newspaper, which takes a conservative attitude towards foreign news, also placed a large headline before the news, saying, "The situation in the Far East seems to be moving towards 'giving color'." International intelligence observers in Washington commented today that Britain's position is significantly stronger than when the British government thought it should reach a compromise with Japan on the Burma Road three months ago. The reason why these observers say this is because Britain has succeeded in resisting German air raids and is gradually reducing the possibility of a German invasion of England. In addition, everyone believes that President Roosevelt's and political opponent Willkie's foreign policies have the same goal by different routes, which is also the main reason for enhancing the U.S. position. Political observers also pointed out that the President was able to issue the evacuation warning so rashly without worrying about the outcome of the November election. Some military writers recently advocated that the United States should take practical actions to curb Japan's actions. These writers believe that now is the best time for the United States to take such action. Japan cannot gain any advantage from its triangular alliance with the Axis powers, because Germany and Italy have poured all their strength into the war against England. (Associated Press)

Hull Meets with Horinouchi, Expresses a Firm Attitude

Washington - According to well-informed sources here, the suspicions held by Tokyo in the past regarding the U.S.'s firm attitude in maintaining the status quo in the Pacific have now been completely dispelled. Secretary of State Hull's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, together with the news of the U.S. advising American expatriates in the Far East to return to their country, has great significance. The Secretary of State's attitude was calm, and his conversation was gentle. However, his actions yesterday were unusual. Anyone who knows Hull knows that Hull only acts this way when necessary. Hull had this posture for the first time when he recently met with the new ambassador Henry Hay. As a result, Henry Hay preferred to meet with other officials of the State Department rather than contacting Hull. It is assumed that when the report of Horinouchi's meeting with Hull is sent to Tokyo, the Japanese hawks will know to what extent the United States is prepared to act. This is confirmed by British Ambassador Lothian's statement that he did not return to London because of the risk of a crisis in the Far East. Political observers believe that these two incidents show that the policies of the U.S. and the U.K. towards the East are closer than before. As some people expect, some observers even believe that the U.S. and the U.K. have verbally agreed that if the Japanese Navy removes the gun coverings and an emergency situation arises, the U.S. can use the Singapore naval base. All of these developments are entirely the responsibility of Japan itself, as Japan has publicly placed itself in opposition to the U.K. and the U.S. by announcing its collaboration with the Axis powers, which has greatly displeased American public opinion. Everyone here believes that the U.S. warning to American expatriates in the Far East to prepare to return home and Lothian's remarks are not intended to produce any effect, but to show that Japan is shooting itself in the foot, making its relations with the two major democratic countries more dangerous. All parties welcome the news of the reopening of the Burma Road, believing that this is a sound British policy and that it is a sign that the U.S. and the U.K. are working hand in hand in the Far East, or at least are now moving forward side by side.

U.S. Marines May Withdraw from China

Washington - Secretary of State Hull said here yesterday that the U.S. Marines may withdraw from China soon. When asked if the State Department's advice to American expatriates to withdraw from the Far East was a prelude to the withdrawal of the Marines, Hull replied that he would have something to say about this matter in a few days. After Hull met with the press, a spokesman for the Department of State immediately stated that the issue of the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from China had not yet been formally discussed, but would be considered in the near future. Hull refused to disclose the contents of his 40-minute conversation with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, but he said that they did not discuss the details of the current U.S.-Japan relationship. Hull said that he did not notify Horinouchi of the State Department's decision to advise American expatriates to evacuate the Far East. He did not expect the Japanese government to issue a similar order to withdraw American expatriates in Japan. A Department of State spokesman said yesterday that there are 7,064 American expatriates currently residing in China, 128 in Vietnam, 1,547 in Hong Kong, and 8,145 in Japan. The spokesman said that American consuls in the Far East have been ordered to report to the Department of State the number of expatriates prepared to return to the United States immediately. A Department of State spokesman said that this advice is parallel to the policies adopted in the Far East and Europe last year. Department of State officials said that American expatriates should leave as soon as possible, as ships in the Far East may soon be unavailable. (Associated Press)

Washington - President Roosevelt refused to comment on the situation in the Far East when he met with the press yesterday. The President said that he had not heard of any plans to withdraw the 1,600 Marines in China. He delegated all Far East situation issues to the Department of State. (Associated Press)

Manila - Instructions have been received here from Washington, instructing U.S. naval stations and U.S. fleets to "maintain naval strength and prepare to uphold national policies and interests, and defend the United States and its territories on the mainland and overseas."

### Britain's Far East Policy: A New Chapter Begins - Close Cooperation with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union - Ambassador Guo Speaks in London

London - Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told reporters last night that the reopening of the Burma Road was a matter of deep satisfaction, but not surprising. The result of the road's closure was precisely Japan's immediate arrest of British nationals, invasion of Vietnam, and conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The news of the reopening of the Burma Road will give the Chinese people hope that Britain's Far East policy has now begun a new chapter, namely close cooperation with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 9th)

### President Roosevelt Meets with Naval Officials - Studies Geography of Both Hemispheres - Part of the Fleet to Return to Honolulu

Washington - US Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson told reporters yesterday that a portion of the US fleet currently in California will soon return to Honolulu. Richardson's remarks were made after a two-hour meeting with President Roosevelt. It is reported that Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark also participated in the meeting. Admiral Richardson also stated that, in addition, "several thousand sailors deemed necessary" will also return to Honolulu from California with the fleet. He said that yesterday's meeting reported to President Roosevelt on the preparations for the fleet's actions. When asked if the fleet was fully prepared, he said that the fleet was "not as well prepared as hoped." He said that he hoped that the world situation would allow the remaining fleet to visit California before leaving, but he could not confirm the exact date of the fleet's departure from Honolulu. However, he said that the Honolulu fleet would not leave immediately before the fleet in California arrived in Honolulu. Also, after a two-hour meeting with naval officials, President Roosevelt will meet with British Ambassador Lothian to discuss the developments in the Far East situation. (Associated Press, 9th)

Washington - President Roosevelt said that when he met with US Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark yesterday, most of the time was spent studying maps and "learning geography."

### Canada Announces Copper Export Ban - Clearly Aimed at Japan

Ottawa - The Canadian government today announced a ban on the export of copper to all countries except those that constitute the British Empire and perhaps the United States. It is widely believed that this move is fundamentally aimed at Japan. Although the embargo announcement issued after today's cabinet meeting here does not specifically mention Japan, it is believed to be directed at that country, as Japan's total copper imports, one-third of which comes from British Columbia. The announcement stated that, in view of the needs of the British Empire and the increasing consumption of copper by Canadian manufacturing plants, all copper in Canada will be used to meet these needs. The announcement also continued that copper exports to the United States may continue, as the United States must now complete arms contracts with Allied countries. (International News Service, 9th)

### US Wheat Shipments to the East - Subsidies Suspended - Department of Agriculture Has Begun Implementation

Washington - Washington, seeing the situation in the Far East approaching a critical stage, the US Department of Agriculture yesterday decided to suspend the export subsidy program for wheat shipped to Far Eastern ports other than the Philippines. Previously, the US government subsidized wheat and flour shipped from the Pacific coast to ports in Hong Kong and China (mostly under Japanese control). According to Department of Agriculture officials, the suspension of subsidies was approved by the State Department. It is estimated that 10 million bushels of subsidized wheat and flour have been shipped to Far Eastern ports since January 1. Department of Agriculture officials declined to comment on the impact of this move on Japan. An official said that it is not known whether US wheat will be shipped to Japan proper or transferred to Japanese troops in China, but Japanese troops in China may have already obtained some US wheat.

### Japanese Securities in New York - Prices Plunge - Affected by the Far East Situation

New York - The New York stock market was extremely stable at one point today, but closed extremely unstable. This was the market's reaction to the report from Washington that the State Department had advised consulates to evacuate overseas Chinese from the Far East as soon as possible. Japanese stocks fell sharply at the close, while the general public continued to watch the development of this situation, as stockbrokers still wanted to make further speculations. Among these various factors, the most unsettling for businessmen was public opinion and the result of the presidential election. Most of them are inclined to President Roosevelt, but trading is still very good. Private property has increased by 22% compared to last year, and the contracts ordered by the government total $7,000,000,000. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Minister of Economic Affairs, Weng Wenhao, Discusses General Economic Conditions - Reopening of Yunnan-Burma Road May Lower Prices - Optimistic About the Future of Industrial Construction in the West

Chongqing - The Minister of Economic Affairs of the National Government, Weng Wenhao, met with a Havas News Agency interviewer today and gave a speech. First, he expressed his views on the possibility of war with Japan in the future due to the United States' advice to overseas Chinese to evacuate China. He said that if the United States and Japan were to go to war one day, the result would be the collapse of Japan and the restoration of China's freedom. In my personal opinion, the key to the current situation lies in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union should strengthen their relations, because if the Soviet Union maintains a hostile attitude towards Japan, Japan will have to maintain a huge defense force in Manchuria. As far as the general economic situation in China is concerned, the salaried class is the most distressed after the price rise. The government is working hard to balance prices to remedy this. The rise in prices in the interior is due to the fact that the production mechanism has not yet been industrialized, which requires a large number of imported goods, coupled with extremely high transportation costs, especially after the successive blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma roads, transportation costs have become more expensive, which indirectly promotes the price increase of daily necessities. There are some unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, but under the strict supervision of the government, they dare not openly hoard goods. It is expected that the prices of various daily necessities will gradually fall back on the day the Yunnan-Burma Road reopens. In addition, the United States recently loaned China 25 million US dollars, which has increased the value of legal currency. This loan can not only be used to purchase American goods, but also to consolidate the reserve and stabilize the currency price. At present, the industrialization construction work in various parts of western China has been obstructed due to the threat of air raids from time to time, but the government is still working hard to encourage and support it, and the future is promising. Moreover, the industrialization movement is not the main problem today. Even if China maintains the form of an agricultural country, it can continue to resist the war to conquer Japan. In short, the total production value of the industries moved from the southeastern provinces this year has reached 300 million yuan. If there are no accidents, it can be greatly increased next year. (Havas, 9th)

### Japan's Trade Prospects - Extremely Difficult to be Optimistic

Tokyo - Finance Minister Ikeda said in a speech at the National Prefectural Governors' Conference yesterday that gold is a necessary item for clearing international accounts. He said that Japan is now planning to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and there is no doubt that it will need a huge amount of gold in the future. He believes that it is extremely difficult to be optimistic about the future of trade with third countries due to the current situation. Finally, Finance Minister urged the prefectural governors to cooperate with the government to increase the production of new minerals and find ways to accumulate gold. Following the speech by Hoshino, a member of the cabinet in charge of national planning, he said that the government is now revising its trade policy in order to obtain the supply of infant raw materials from Latin American countries, French Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, in order to replace those purchased from the United Kingdom, the United States, and their colonies. The government had expected the United Kingdom and the United States to impose an embargo on Japan, so it had already obtained a large number of raw materials in advance, which he said were for war purposes. The United States' ban on the shipment of scrap iron to Japan has had little impact on Japan, but various possible steps are being taken to obtain the supply of oil. According to reports, the meeting paid close attention to the economic pressure exerted on Japan by the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the finance minister and others gave speeches to reassure the public. (Reuters, 9th)

### Today's National Day Commemoration - Shanghai Celebrates with Flags - Foreign Consulates in Shanghai are on Holiday - Citizens Actively Promote Charity Sales and Donations - The Two Concessions Intensify Security and Impose Curfew Earlier Last Night

Today is the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All sectors of the city are celebrating with flags in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, as it is an extraordinary time and no celebration in the Russian style will be held. All shops and households in the city of Jinshi are celebrating with flags in accordance with the regulations of the authorities. All industries, markets, major companies, factories, and institutions such as banks, customs, and post offices will be closed for one day. In order to express their celebration, the citizens are expanding and promoting the Cold Clothing Festival storage movement during this festive season. Companies and shops that are open as usual will voluntarily hold charity sales for one day and present the proceeds. Shops that are closed today will hold charity sales for one day tomorrow. The authorities of the two concessions have announced an earlier curfew last night to protect the security of the concessions. The Great World Amusement Park, located in an important location, has been advised by the French patrol to close down for the past two days. The details are recorded separately below:

Foreign Missions Celebrate Together

Embassies and consulates of various countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, are also closed for one day today to commemorate the National Day of the Republic of China and celebrate together. The consuls-general of various countries have informed the public yesterday that various public affairs will resume tomorrow. In addition, warships of various countries stationed in the Pei River will also fly flags for one day today to commemorate the National Day of the Republic of China. At that time, colorful flags will be flying over the Huangpu River, symbolizing China's victory in the war of resistance and the success of nation-building.

Actively Promoting Cold Clothing Funds

Since all sectors of the city launched the campaign to raise 500,000 yuan for cold clothing funds, they have actively promoted it and spared no effort. The response from various shops and factories to this campaign and their self-proclaimed donations has been very enthusiastic, so the predetermined figure of 500,000 yuan will be exceeded, as there are still two weeks until the deadline of the 31st of this month. In addition to enthusiastically soliciting cold clothing funds, people from all walks of life will also work hard to promote saving for disaster relief, building the country, charity sales for National Day, and other tasks on Double Ten Day today to express the meaning of warmly celebrating National Day. It is reported that film actor Li Qinian donated 100 yuan in national currency to the bank yesterday in response to the cold clothing funds, as a way to promote it.

The City is Under Strict Security

Today is National Day, and the authorities of the two concessions have tightened security within the concessions to eliminate the troublemaking of bad elements that hinder public order. On the Public Concession side, at midnight yesterday, non-important roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were blocked with barbed wire obstacles to prevent traffic. At the important intersections, entrances and exits were set up, and various national defense forces and the International Volunteer Corps were stationed to check vehicles and pedestrians. On the French Concession side, because the entrances along Avenue Edward VII were mostly blocked earlier, it was only necessary to strengthen the defense within the concession. In addition to the full mobilization of the police department's armored vehicles, gun vehicles, and patrol teams, the French defense forces also participated in the patrol. As for western Shanghai, since the previous day, Japanese vehicles have been searching pedestrians and vehicles on Yugu Road. Yesterday, a large team of Japanese troops patrolled in formation on Kaixuan Road and Zhongshan Road. The Japanese troops in Nanshi and Zhabei were also under abnormal security.

### Southwest Postal Transport - Surveying New Lines

When Shanghai Postmaster Zha Peilin went to Kunming this summer, he transferred to Haiphong for inspection. Officials from Chongqing and Chengdu also went to inspect. Recently, the Director-General of Posts also sent Deputy Director-General Xu Changcheng to inspect various parts of the southwest. Now that he has completed his inspection, new postal routes between Shanghai and the southwest will soon be opened up, and transportation efficiency will definitely be improved.

The principal to be paid for the winning bonds and the accrued interest will be paid starting from January 31, 30th year. The method of principal and interest repayment will be stipulated and announced by the Ministry of Finance when it is due. The winning numbers are eight lots: 115, 226, 361, 479, 573, 625, 769, 902. The principal and interest for each bond drawn this time will be discounted and paid by the four banks.

### Letter from the Bureau of Works to the Evaluation Committee - Ruling on Shanghai Rice Prices - Rationed Sales Proceed in Stages and are Not Suspended

The Bureau of Works recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee stating that, according to the opinion of the Bureau's Food Committee, the selling price of foreign rice in the city should not exceed the actual cost plus a reasonable profit. As for the amount of the so-called reasonable profit, the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee can decide at its discretion. After the price of foreign rice is evaluated, the price of domestic rice

Top-Grade White Rice

Should also be evaluated by the committee for a fair selling price. Furthermore, if the committee has difficulties in investigating the actual cost of foreign rice, the Bureau's Price Investigation Office will find ways to assist it. According to sources familiar with the matter, in the future, all transaction prices and dates of arrival of foreign rice, as well as the quantity of domestic rice, must be submitted to the relevant authorities for record from the date of the transaction of a certain foreign rice. Otherwise, it will be regarded as illegal hoarding and will be severely punished, or its business license will be revoked. Furthermore, according to the report published by the Bureau of Works yesterday regarding the rationed sale of foreign rice, it seems that it will be permanently suspended, which does not conform to

The Facts

The Shanghai Rationed Sales Committee currently has 28,000 bags of Saigon broken rice. The committee will convene a meeting to decide on the next rationed sales date. As for the rationed sales matters, proceeding in stages is a consistent method of the committee. As for the

Afternoon Rice Market

Xing Zhigang, the standing committee member of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, recently suggested to the association that, at a time when the production price of foreign rice is soaring and the source of domestic rice is scarce, and the cost of transportation for our fellow traders is difficult, if trading is conducted in two markets, not only will the market price fluctuate, but it will also affect public morale. The Rice Evaluation Committee, in view of this, resolutely sent a letter to the Grain Association to announce the suspension of rice trading in the afternoon market. However, recently, some traders have treated it as a mere formality and acted against it. After investigation, they have not taken actual sales as the end, but have engaged in speculative trading among fellow traders, rising and falling suddenly, causing a stir in the newspapers. At this time of turbulent situation and uncertain public sentiment, it is not appropriate. Therefore, it is suggested that the ban order be reiterated. I believe that there are many fellow traders who are deeply aware of the situation, and at this time of food panic, we should all have a heart of compassion and no longer engage in speculative trading.

Association Meeting

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the fact that if traders in the rice market do not trade according to the market, it will have a great impact on the entire rice market. Now, in order to discuss a proper solution, the association has scheduled a joint meeting of all supervisors and committee members at 2:00 pm on the 11th of this month at 15 Avenue Edward VII to discuss the overall solution for the entire rice market. All members will attend the meeting on time to discuss. The Shanghai Cereals, Oil Cake Industry Association has also scheduled a committee meeting on October 12 to discuss the trading method for the cereals exchange.

Xu Busun, a Suzhou native who runs Tongfengyong Chiyu Shop at 310 Nanjing Road, was kidnapped at his residence in the car garage when he was about to get into his car and drive away the day before yesterday afternoon. The details have been reported in various newspapers. However, according to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, after Xu was kidnapped, he was hidden in a grass shed somewhere in western Shanghai. However, he did escape from the bandit's den at 11:20 pm that night and arrived at his residence at around 3:00 am the next morning. The car was also found at Zhaofeng Garden on Avenue Billiard. After the patrol notified Xu's residence, the car has not yet been driven back and is still in the patrol's possession. As for Xu's escape and the whereabouts of the bandits, the reporter asked him at home, but he refused to reveal the truth, but admitted that he had been released from kidnapping. However, because he suffered some injuries, he is now in the hospital for treatment. After further inquiries, it was learned that Xu's release from kidnapping was so fast because he had redeemed himself with a huge sum of money.

### Preparations by American Residents in Shanghai: Women and Children to be Sent Home First; Boosts Morale for China's Resistance; All American Steamer Cabins Fully Booked

Following the military and economic alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Britain decided to abandon its previous appeasement policy and resolved to open the Burma Road on the 8th of this month. The United States also saw the alliance of these three countries as targeting itself and recognized the increasing tensions in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It actively engaged in communication with allied nations, especially establishing close ties with Britain. It also provided substantial loans to aid China and support its resistance, while expanding its embargo against Japan, leading to increasing resource shortages. Furthermore, with Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox declaring acceptance of Japan's challenge, it's clear that Britain and the United States are determined not to allow aggressors to act arrogantly in the Far East but rather to protect their existing interests. This is evidenced by the recent sudden visit of former Commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, to Shanghai to meet with Commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, and the U.S. Secretary of State's urging of the evacuation of overseas residents from the Far East as a preparation for further actions. This situation clearly shows that Britain and the United States are jointly resisting aggression to respond to the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to maintain the peace front of the two major oceans, which is gradually becoming clear. A reporter from Pingming News Agency, considering the U.S.'s action of urging the evacuation of overseas residents from the Far East and its significant impact on the current situation in Shanghai, inquired with various parties and compiled the following report:

Receiving Instructions and Interpreting Their Significance

Regarding the U.S. authorities in Washington's decision to evacuate their overseas residents from the Far East, the acting U.S. Consul General in Shanghai received instructions from the State Department last night. According to inquiries made by a Pingming News Agency reporter yesterday afternoon with responsible personnel at the U.S. Consulate, the evacuation of American residents in Shanghai would not be carried out through orders from the U.S. Consulate, but rather through notices, advising those overseas residents who do not need to stay in the Far East to return home. The so-called American residents who do not need to stay in the Far East are limited to those who have no business or mission in the Far East, such as American male tourists in the Far East's designated evacuation areas, as well as general women and children. Those who have business or missions in the Far East are not currently included in the advisory to evacuate and return home. Therefore, American commercial institutions in Shanghai, as well as American-owned banks and newspapers, are continuing to operate as usual.

Consideration for the U.S. Marines

The situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense due to the U.S.'s decision to evacuate non-essential overseas residents from the Far East. Yesterday morning, authoritative sources among foreigners in Shanghai further disseminated an important piece of news, stating that the U.S. Marine Detachment in Shanghai would also be evacuated from Shanghai. After obtaining this information, a Pingming News Agency reporter immediately inquired with relevant parties of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It was learned that the U.S. defense force currently stationed in Shanghai is the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, numbering about a thousand men. A decision has been made to prepare for evacuation, but the date of evacuation has not yet been determined. The evacuation steps are currently under consideration by the naval authorities.

The Chaumont Transport Ship to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month

According to the English-language "China Press", officers of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai told reporters today (9th) that they had not received official news regarding the possible evacuation of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China. It is reported that the 4th U.S. Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai has a thousand soldiers, and the U.S. North China Marine Corps has five hundred soldiers, stationed in Beijing and Tianjin, led by Colonel Walter N. Hill. The next U.S. Navy transport ship to arrive in Shanghai, the "Chaumont," is scheduled to arrive in the first week of November. One hundred and twenty American soldiers stationed in Shanghai are scheduled to return to the United States on the "Chaumont." However, if necessary, the "Chaumont" can accommodate all U.S. troops stationed in China.

Prepared to Accept the Challenge

An observer first elaborated on the significance of the U.S. evacuation of its overseas residents, stating that this move is purely a precautionary measure and is not caused by any special situation. Therefore, we should not overemphasize it. Because the United States is bold and meticulous, in case the situation in the Far East changes, it will not be negligent in protecting the safety of overseas residents. The reason why the United States is doing this is actually due to Japan's challenging behavior. In other words, the United States is prepared to accept Japan's challenge. As for the evacuation of American residents in Shanghai, the official order has not yet been received. At present, only some Americans are leaving Shanghai voluntarily, mostly women and children. Various American organizations and businesses are also only taking a wait-and-see attitude. As for the full evacuation, it will not be possible to achieve in the very short term. Once the government's official order arrives, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai and relevant authorities will begin registration and investigation procedures. Currently, there are nearly ten thousand American residents in Shanghai. The observer commented on the U.S. evacuation of the U.S. Marine Detachment from the Far East, saying that the U.S. troops stationed in the Far East, apart from the Philippines, are only in North China and Shanghai, and the number is not large. If this force is evacuated, it will only be relocated to the U.S. Far East base, and will not reduce the Far East force. It is actually a concentration of force. At that time, the U.S. fleet will be stationed dynamically, and the expansion of our troops will depend on the situation. All of the above, we still feel is too early to say. The U.S. measures are extremely procedural actions, and are by no means predictable by the general public.

American Institutions Maintain Calm

Yesterday, the news of the American evacuation of overseas residents had a quite drastic impact on Shanghai. On the American side, such as organizations and groups, the attitude was very calm. However, private individuals were slightly more nervous, and small-scale businesses were making preparations. Deposits and withdrawals at American-owned banks were also more frequent than usual. Those who have no legitimate business have made preparations to return home by ship. However, major American companies, banks, and businesses are operating as usual, and are even busier than usual. According to information obtained by reporters from the American President Lines, the American steamer bound for the United States, the "President Pierce," will set sail on October 28th. The cabins on the upper and lower decks of the ship are fully booked. Next month, the "President Coolidge" will set sail on November 7th. There are only a few berths remaining in the steerage of the ship. Most of the passengers on both ships are women and children who are voluntarily leaving Shanghai. As for the future orderly evacuation, the government authorities will send ships to transport them.

Japanese Newspapers Do Not Mention This at All

Japanese and other foreign residents here attach great importance to the U.S. evacuation of overseas residents. The Japanese residents are slightly panicked, and the Japanese newspapers do not mention this news at all. It is also heard that Japanese businesses are preparing to abandon trade with the United States. As for other foreigners, although they feel that the U.S.'s move shows great determination to protect its interests in the Far East, they remain calm and await future developments, with no signs of unrest. Foreign newspapers only publish this news in a secondary position. However, the general sentiment tends to be excited.

The Current Situation in the Concessions Will Not Change

The Chinese side believes that this news is extremely beneficial to China's resistance, so they are very excited. Yesterday, a reporter asked a key figure familiar with municipal affairs about the impact of the American evacuation of overseas residents on the status of Shanghai. It was said that although we cannot predict how the situation will change in the future, the situation in Shanghai is special, as it is an internationally co-managed city. If one country abandons its jurisdiction, then other countries will come out to co-manage. Moreover, the American executives of the concession authorities will remain in Shanghai, so there will definitely be no change. Foreign property in the two concessions is extremely valuable, and no one will be allowed to infringe upon it. Whether it is police power or political power, everything will remain the same. This can be foreseen from the current situation after the withdrawal of British troops. However, the Chinese side currently has sufficient floating capital, which will have a greater impact on foreign trade in the future. The general bourgeoisie can take this opportunity to transfer surplus funds to the Chinese mainland to develop beneficial industrial and commercial enterprises.

Financial Market Fluctuations Started Yesterday

Yesterday, the financial market in Shanghai was most affected by the news of the American evacuation of overseas residents. The situation throughout the day was extremely turbulent, with rumors flying, and the news was bearish. Most of the bulls competed to sell, foreign exchange rates fell sharply, and gold prices plummeted, showing a completely unsustainable situation. However, because all parties believe that this news is beneficial to China, various public bonds were strong. The market situation throughout the day was as follows: spot silver opened at 5,580 yuan in the morning, and then gradually declined, falling to a low of 5,480 yuan, and closed at 5,505 yuan at noon. The black market foreign exchange rates for both British and American currencies fell sharply. The British exchange rate opened at 3 pence 75 in the morning, and rose to 3 pence 8125 at noon. The American exchange rate also fell sharply, opening at 5.75 yuan in the morning, and then gradually rose to 5.875 yuan. Finally, it fell below the 6 yuan mark, to 6.03125 yuan. Public bonds rose slightly by 1 or 2 corners, American bonds fell to 16.4 yuan, and Hong Kong bonds were 3.93 yuan. All stocks trended downward. Yesterday afternoon was a short holiday without a market, and today's National Day anniversary is also a market holiday. It is expected that there will still be major changes when the market opens tomorrow.

All Steamer Cabins Fully Booked

According to the English-language "China Press", yesterday (8th), after the U.S. Secretary of State instructed the consulate in Shanghai to advise American residents to leave Shanghai, British residents here were extremely shocked. According to opinions from the American residents, a complete evacuation is impossible because there are not enough ships. The cabins of all American President Line steamers are fully booked until December. The "President Coolidge," which will arrive in the Far East at the end of December, still has a few cabins available for booking. Other Pacific steamers, besides the President Line, only have the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha lines. However, according to employees of the American President Lines, if the situation is urgent, the U.S. government will order the U.S. Maritime Commission to send ships to the Far East to evacuate American residents, or perhaps the President Line steamers will assume this responsibility. Nearly two hundred American residents have come to the American President Lines to inquire daily. The cabins for the next three ships are fully booked, and only the "President Coolidge" on the 12th still has some cabins available. It is also said that if the U.S. Maritime Commission receives government orders and implements emergency regulations, the President Line steamers will have to add temporary beds to facilitate the evacuation of American residents. American residents returning to the country must pay their own expenses. Those who cannot afford tickets will be loaned by the U.S. government, but they must repay them later. The U.S. Consulate is now also in contact with leaders of various church groups, advising them to evacuate their wives and children first. Some missionaries may be forced to return to the United States on the "President Coolidge," which will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. It is also heard that the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai will issue a notice within days, advising overseas residents to evacuate women and children.

### Chinese and Foreign Banks Uniformly Stop Foreign Exchange Arbitrage; Black Market Exchange Rate Has No Profit to Arbitrage Since the New Sino-American Loan Was Successfully Negotiated

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has made every effort to maintain foreign exchange rates, necessary imports can apply for legal foreign exchange, and the government purchases foreign exchange from major domestic exports. Therefore, the legal foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank has always been stable. The Anglo-American commercial banks are authorized to maintain the foreign exchange rate of the black market in Shanghai. Now, in order to prevent speculative manipulation of the foreign exchange market, Chinese and foreign banks have formally passed a resolution to stop foreign exchange arbitrage, in addition to restricting forward transactions and swaps. All member banks of the Chinese and foreign commercial banking associations will uniformly abide by the resolution.

Official Approval by the Association

The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is secretly maintained by the HSBC and other banks authorized by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Since the successful negotiation of the Sino-American 25 million U.S. dollar loan, the black market exchange rate has lengthened, and the value of the legal tender has invisibly increased. In order to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market, British and American banks have consulted and decided to refuse forward foreign exchange transactions and restrict the expiration of foreign exchange, so that speculators cannot apply their skills. However, in fact, because the elements of the foreign exchange market are complicated, the operators have not thoroughly handled it, so the trend of speculation has not completely disappeared. Now, the Shanghai Banking Association and the Foreign Bankers Association have formally passed the cessation of foreign exchange arbitrage. All member banks of the two associations shall comply. It is said that its purpose is to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and to seek the lasting stability of the black market exchange rate in Shanghai.

Arbitrage Disappears Invisibly

The recent value of the foreign exchange market is cheap enough to absorb sellers, and the forward value is expensive enough to absorb sellers. Therefore, those with surplus funds come out for arbitrage, buying near and selling far. The recent market price should gradually increase, and the forward exchange rate should gradually decrease. When the difference between the two is close to zero, there is no profit to arbitrage. Therefore, arbitrage is not sustainable, and must be done when there is an opportunity. At the same time, it is limited to those with strength to do it. Therefore, whenever the market is unusually tight on money, the more opportunities there are for arbitrage. The best arbitrage can get as much as 70-80% interest. However, the current black market exchange rate in Shanghai has no profit to arbitrage for the time being. If all banks can uniformly refuse forward foreign exchange transactions, foreign exchange arbitrage can be eliminated invisibly.

### Cixi Urban Area Bombed; Japanese Warships Bomb Jintang Mountain

According to telegrams received by the navigation industry this morning, four Japanese aircraft bombed Cixi on the 8th. According to the telegram, at 9:20 a.m. the day before yesterday,

Four Japanese Aircraft

Passed Ninghai, swept over Fenghua Creek, flew over Ningbo and entered Cixi airspace, circling and dropping bombs, indiscriminately bombing. Nine explosive bombs were dropped one after another. After the Japanese aircraft dropped their bombs, they escaped out to sea from the Guanhaiwei area. The heads of various agencies in Cixi immediately mobilized to express condolences to the families affected by the disaster. Various rescue and fire-fighting organizations worked at risk when the alarm had not yet been lifted, and emotions were tense.

The bombs all fell in the urban area, including two bombs falling in Taiyang Temple, killing one person and destroying five houses; one bomb falling in Zhongren Elementary School, destroying nine houses; three bombs falling in Yu Huang Pavilion, injuring one girl and destroying six houses; one bomb falling on an open space outside Xiaodongmen; and one bomb falling next to Zhongma Bridge, destroying more than ten houses. In total, two people were killed, five people were injured, and dozens of houses were destroyed in this battle, with no other losses. Also, at 9:10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed to Chuanshan ocean area and fired at Jintang Mountain,

Eight Shells Fired

The shells fell on open ground with no losses. Also, two Japanese warships outside the Zhenhai estuary suddenly fired eleven shells at Jiangnan Guanmu at around 11:00 a.m., all of which fell into the mud, with no losses to China. Currently, there are still four Japanese warships moored in the Seaport waters, with no movements. Also, according to people from Dinghai, on September 26th and 27th, the Japanese army Kushima Shigeo unit in Dingcheng suddenly sent two bombers, each carrying a large number of bombs, which took off from near the Minsheng Refined Salt Company in Dinghai Donggangpu and flew to Zhoushan, Ma Pan, Gan Lan, Ziwei and other places, flying low to drop bombs. Ma Pan suffered the most damage.

### Gong Bida's Injuries Still Serious

Gong Bida, a Hubei native and deputy inspector of the French police, No. 214, was ambushed at the entrance of the Rihui Lane, Xinxin Street, Dapuqiao, Jin Shenfu Road, at noon on the 8th. He was shot twice in the back and was sent to Guangci Hospital afterwards. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that his injuries have not diminished slightly. Although there was no change throughout yesterday, he is still in a coma.

### French Tramway Labor Strike to Be Mediated Again

The labor strike at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company has been delayed for two weeks. The two sides have negotiated several times, and most of them have been agreed. Only one or two important issues remain to be discussed. It is reported that Yuan Ludeng went to the company on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss a solution. The company stated that the labor side should resume work first, and then negotiate various issues. It is heard that Yuan and Yu Qiaqing will once again serve as mediators in order to resolve the labor strike as soon as possible. There was still no contact between the labor and management sides yesterday. It is also learned that a total of nineteen inspectors and ticket writers have disappeared one after another, namely Inspector Dong Pangen No. 7, ticket inspector Lu Guanghua No. 6, Lu Heshang No. 11, Song Baoshan No. 26, Huang Yuanji No. 6, ticket writer Lu Hongjin No. 27, Yue Guangfu No. 19, Ye Jingen No. 37, Xu Dehua No. 16, Guan Yukun No. 10, Liu Zhiren No. 5, driver Lu Bingqing No. 265, Yin Yaoting No. 223, He Haibo No. 17, Lu Yingsong No. 126, Zhu Ligong No. 354, ticket seller Xu Dasheng No. 149, and ticket inspector Feng Yimin No. 36.

### Rickshaws to Become a Public Utility: Patent Company Being Organized; Opinions Being Gathered

Due to the soaring prices of rubber tires and other materials, the operating expenses of the rickshaw industry in Shanghai have increased daily. Rickshaw pullers have repeatedly requested the Public Works Department to increase rickshaw fares in order to maintain their business. However, in order to prevent the burden on citizens from becoming too heavy, the authorities only agreed to a moderate increase. Rickshaw owners believed that the profits were too small and expressed dissatisfaction. The industry association has repeatedly submitted documents to the authorities requesting assistance. Recently, in order to protect the interests of the industry, the authorities are considering organizing a patent company to control the city's rickshaw industry and grant the industry exclusive patent rights, stipulating legal dividends and bonuses for rickshaw owners. When expenses are insufficient, they can increase rickshaw fares at any time, similar to tram and bus companies. Currently, this proposal has been notified to the industry by the Public Works Department, and they have been instructed to express their opinions. According to news from the industry association, the association is now collecting written opinions from its members and will convene a meeting of its members in the near future. If the majority expresses their agreement, they will discuss the articles of association with the Public Works Department, sign a contract, and formally establish the company. According to rickshaw owners, the patent method is of great importance to the interests of rickshaw owners and is currently being carefully considered. However, most rickshaw owners believe that the profits currently obtained are extremely meager, so they generally welcome this method. There are no less than a thousand rickshaw owners in Shanghai, all of whom are operating freely. If the patent company is established, they will participate as shareholders. At that time, the rickshaw industry in Shanghai will also become a public transportation industry along with military vehicles and automobiles.

### The Panchen Lama Statue to Be Consecrated on a Set Date: October 19th

Rongzeng Khenpo initiated the construction of a bronze statue of the Panchen Lama to allow people in Shanghai to worship it for a long time. He went north to supervise the casting on the Lantern Festival this year. Initially, only one statue was to be built, but then disciples who believed in Tibetan Buddhism in Beiping

Jointly Made a Great Vow

And also cast a statue for worship. Therefore, there is a statue of the Panchen Lama in both Beiping and Shanghai. On the day of the consecration of the Panchen Lama statue in Beiping, there was abundant rain and the ceremony was solemn. Han, Tibetan, Manchu, and Mongolian people all went

To Bow and Bless

Which was extremely grand at that time. In the middle of last month, the Panchen Lama statue was sent to Shanghai and temporarily placed in Rongzeng Lama's altar. The statue is about three feet tall, sitting cross-legged, holding a magic weapon in his left hand and making a hand gesture in his right hand. Today, Rongzeng Lama will place

Scriptures, Incense

And treasures offered by devotees in the Dharma body, and set the consecration on the 19th day of the ninth lunar month (October 19th in the solar calendar), which will be enshrined on the second floor of the Baoben Hall in Jueyuan. From the day of consecration,

Dharma Will Be Practiced for Ten Days

The offering of a thousand lamps will be held for ten days. This thousand-lamp offering instrument was also newly made by Rongzeng Lama in Beiping with meticulous craftsmanship. It is unprecedented. Therefore, the ten-day offering has been fully recognized by all devotees. Currently, many people are still going to request to offer this rare merit, taking advantage of this rare opportunity. In fact, the thousand-lamp offering period may be extended.

### British Embassy Information Office Opens a Cinema

The British Embassy Information Office at No. 28 Bund, which moved into its new office six weeks ago, is now being renovated and will be completed soon. In addition to adding dormitories for the staff of the Information Office, the large living room will be converted into a movie theater, equipped with the latest type of screen and sound system. The theater will be used to show British newsreels to members of the press and invited guests.

Courlis Will Go to Chongqing

Dr. Corliss, a professor at the University of London, has been in contact with British and American women's groups and other academic institutions in Shanghai since he came to Shanghai on the orders of the British Ministry of Information. He has given many lectures and is very popular. Dr. Corliss is scheduled to leave Shanghai and go south this week, and may take the opportunity to go to Chongqing. The night before last, he gave a farewell speech on the China Press radio station.

German Embassy Shows Movies

When the European War was raging, in order to make the overseas Chinese and related parties of the warring countries of Germany and Britain understand the truth of the war, the consulates of the two countries in Shanghai repeatedly screened European War films in Shanghai for publicity. It is now heard that the Information Office of the German Embassy in Shanghai will screen a long film next week at the German Elementary School on Avenue Haig, showing the major battles with the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, etc., from the outbreak of the European War to Germany's participation in the war, and breaking through the Maginot Line, occupying Paris, until the armistice agreement in the Compiègne Forest. All sectors will be invited to visit.

### Cholera Has Not Disappeared Yet

True cholera continues to occur, with two to six people seeking treatment in hospitals every day, so the situation is still serious.

### Shanghai Merchants Prepare to Transport Goods Via the Burma Road; Commercial Firms Prepare for Transportation; Dispatches to Ports in Vietnam and Hong Kong to Rush Delivery of Congested Inventory

Since the British government officially announced the decision to open the Burma Road from the 18th of this month, foreign firms in Shanghai have expressed their joy upon hearing the news and are paying close attention to the situation of this international transportation line. British and American import and export firms have already begun preparations to transport goods from Shanghai to the southwest and to export goods from the mainland via this line. They have also telegraphed their branches in Kunming, Yangon, and Hong Kong to actively prepare so that freight can be restored from the 18th. They will also schedule ships to transport the imported goods of six or seven million yuan currently congested in Haiphong and Hong Kong to Yangon, and then import them via the Burma Road. In addition, American firms in Shanghai have ordered several batches of tungsten, lead, tin, and mineral products from the mainland, totaling more than a thousand tons. They have now also telegraphed to urge the export to the United States after the road is opened.

Post Office to Send Mail Via the Road

According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dagong News Agency yesterday from the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the resumption of shipping from Shanghai to the southwest, mail to the southwest from Shanghai was extremely slow due to the damage to the Dian-Vietnam Railway, which required barge transportation. Now that the Burma Road is scheduled to open on the 18th, mail from Shanghai to the mainland will be transported via this line, and the delivery speed can be increased. As for the more than 30,000 pieces of mail packages滞積滯積 in Haiphong and Hanoi, after negotiations with the Vietnamese government, a portion has been rushed out of Vietnam, and the rest can also be transported in succession.

The Road Bureau is Preparing for Traffic

The Burma Road starts from Kunming in Yunnan, passes through Xiaguan, Baoshan, Mangshi, and Wanding, enters Myanmar, and reaches Yangon. The entire journey is 1,146 kilometers, of which 959.4 kilometers are in China. There are reception centers and cafeterias along the way. The road management bureau has also dispatched a large number of vehicles to engage in passenger and freight transport.

China Completes New Transportation Lines

Since the closure of the Burma Road and the Dian-Vietnam Railway, the interests of foreign firms have been greatly damaged, especially the United States. Therefore, the reopening of this road is of great significance to promoting China's foreign trade. The Chinese government has actively rushed to build many new transportation lines, such as the China-Soviet, Dian, and Beijing lines, which have been completed and put into use one after another. The new Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Beijing, and Tibet provinces have established a post transportation organization and set up management offices. Therefore, after transportation has become more convenient, in addition to being self-sufficient, international import routes have also been smoothed, and the future of the war of resistance is more optimistic.

The older of the two children was wearing a Western suit, resembling a middle school student, while the other was younger and wearing a student cap. After being taken into the police station, it was found that both children had records with the French Concession police. They are currently detained at the police station, awaiting transfer to the court for prosecution. It is reported that these children were originally from good families but were lured into this trap by specialists from the criminal gangs, leading to their downfall.

### 71-Year-Old Woman Crushed to Death by Truck

An elderly woman surnamed Yang, a 71-year-old from Pudong, previously worked as a domestic helper for a family surnamed Qin in a building at 30 Ningbo Road in the French Concession.

### Partner of Wu Feng Silk Company Accused of Speculation Failure; Zhongyong Foreign Firm Sues for Over 200,000 in Debt; Private Trading Firms Not Responsible; Court Adjourns for Deliberation and Sets Date for Pronouncement

Li Xizhen, He Shoufan, Chen Zhenqing and others from Zhejiang jointly opened the Jiu Shuang Silk Firm at 75 Guangdong Road, with Chen Zhenqing as manager and He Shoufan as associate manager. Regarding the firm's business, Li Xizhen did not interfere and the responsibility rested entirely with Chen and He. In recent years, Chen and He, attracted by the potential profits of speculative ventures such as
buying and selling foreign exchange
, entrusted the Zhongyong Foreign Firm (a British firm) at 45 Jiujiang Road to trade in US dollars in the name of the Wu Feng Firm. They conducted a total of eighteen transactions in May and June of this year, totaling over US$120,000, equivalent to over 2.7 million legal currency. Chen and He's speculation failed this time, owing Zhongyong Foreign Firm 266,782.57 legal currency. The Wu Feng Firm's capital was only tens of thousands of dollars. Chen and He, unable to raise the
funds
, were recently sued in the First District Court's Civil Division by Zhongyong Foreign Firm, represented by lawyer Rong Zhenlong, who requested that Chen Zhenqing, He Shoufan, and Li Xizhen be jointly ordered to repay the debt of over 260,000. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Mo in the Second Civil Division. First, the plaintiff's representative lawyer, Rong Zhenlong, stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Then, the lawyer representing the defendants Chen Zhenqing and He Shoufan stated to the court that the defendants operated the Wu Feng Firm, purchasing goods worth about 30,000 yuan and selling about 40,000 yuan each month. The
business situation
was like this from January to June of this year, with records available for verification. As for the plaintiff's claim that the defendant owed the plaintiff over 260,000 yuan for buying and selling US dollars in May and June of this year, this was entirely speculative in nature and did not create a creditor-debtor relationship under the law. Therefore, the defendants should not be liable for repayment and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Later, Xu Wufang, the lawyer representing Li Xizhen, stated to the court that the defendants Chen Zhenqing and He Shoufan violated the principles of partnership. The Wu Feng Firm operated silk, but Chen and He actually engaged in
private speculation
. Even if there were debts, according to Article 679 of the Civil Code, the defendant Li Xizhen had no obligation for joint repayment and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff insisted that the defendants Chen Zhenqing and others bought and sold actual US dollars, not empty transactions. Chen Zhenqing's representative lawyer said that the Wu Feng Firm had no need to buy actual US dollars, it was definitely speculative. After the court debated the arguments, it announced the conclusion of the trial and adjourned for judgment.

### Special Second Prison Paroles Criminals; Totaling 250

The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession was built with a limited area, so the capacity of the prison was set at no more than 1,600 inmates. However, since the "August 13th" Shanghai battle and the rising cost of living, the number of criminals has increased daily. By last year, the maximum number of inmates in the prison reached over 2,500, exceeding the original capacity by more than double. As the number of prisoners was high and funding was more difficult, the authorities submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice in February of this year, stating that during the extraordinary period, prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for no more than five years and those who were not repeat offenders should be granted special parole in order to alleviate overcrowding. So far, special parole has been held three times. Yesterday was the fourth batch of parole. A total of 150 inmates were paroled at that time.

Last year, Zhou Tangshi took in 13-year-old Jin Di as a child bride, intending to marry her to her younger son in the future. Unexpectedly, Zhou Jinrong did not approve and often quarreled over it. Around 5 PM on the 8th of this month, Jinrong beat Jinmei again. His mother heard the noise and tried to mediate. Unexpectedly, Jinrong pushed his mother to the ground and threw a teapot at her, causing injuries and bleeding to her head and forehead. She was called to Huazi Police No. 1188 and Huazi detective Xu Dezhong arrived, took Zhou Jinrong into custody at the Chengdu Road police station, and sent him to the Criminal Second Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant had previously beaten his father for no reason, and now he is beating his mother, which is absurd. He should be punished according to the law. Zhou Tangshi also complained about the circumstances of the attack and requested strict punishment. When questioned, the defendant pleaded guilty. Judge Zhong sentenced Zhou Jinrong to two months in prison for injuring a direct blood relative of an elder generation. He could commute the sentence to a fine of two yuan per day.

### Financial Affairs; Selling Wave Sweeps; US Dollar Once Reaches 6 Yuan Mark

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday saw HSBC's listed price unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American dollars became firmer, mainly due to reported political news from the Far East. Speculators tended to sell, releasing over one million US dollars. In addition, the Hong Kong Telegraph Company and Huahang also sought to sell about 500,000 yuan successively. Although HSBC absorbed them from time to time, the price rose sharply. Therefore, the market once loosened to 3 pence 84375 and 6 yuan 03125. The closing price was 3 pence 828125 and 6 yuan, resulting in an increase of 140625 and 28125 compared to the previous day. There is no market today due to National Day.

Huashang Sells More Than a Million

In the early morning, London large strips, US bank prices, and London gold prices were all stable. The exchange rate of British to US dollars against Shanghai was also flat. US dollars to British dollars increased by 25, while against Shanghai it was unchanged. The central government's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 1875 and US dollars at 5 yuan 75. Compared to the previous close, British dollars eased by 03125, while US dollars were mixed. After opening, speculators and Huahang competed to sell, and the market hardened suddenly. They sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign banks such as HSBC, increasing from 5 yuan 75 to 9375. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the white silver balance tax. Thereafter, foreign firms came to absorb, and the market stabilized slightly. They bought spot US dollars from foreign banks at 5 yuan 875 and 8125. At that time, a sudden sale from Hong Kong's telegraph company, totaling 4-500,000 US dollars, caused Huahang and speculators to want to sell again. They sold in competition, starting with only 10,000 yuan, and the market became increasingly hard. Huashang and the Hong Kong telegraph company sold spot US dollars to HSBC, McKelliget and others, from 5 yuan 8125 to 6 yuan 03125. At the same time, Huahang sold tens of thousands of pounds sterling to HSBC, also hardening to 3 pence 84375. At noon, the market stabilized slightly. The closing prices were British gold at 3 pence 828125, US dollars at 6 yuan, British gold for November delivery at 3 pence 8125, and US dollars at 5 yuan 96875. As a result, compared to the previous day, British dollars eased by 140625 and US dollars hardened by 28125 for current delivery. There is no market this afternoon due to Wednesday.

### Gold Plummets; Lowest at 5475 Yuan

Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash gold fell again. This was influenced by reports of various unsettling developments, such as the official British announcement that Japan would reopen the Burma Road on the 18th, and the US State Department's warning to Americans to withdraw from the Far East. This led to a strong selling wave. Before the close, the lowest price reached 5,475 yuan. The closing price was only 5,505 yuan, a drop of 210 yuan compared to the previous day. Although it had recovered after the close, the unofficial market in the afternoon fell to as low as 5,4560 yuan. It is feared that it will be difficult to rise until the relationship between the US and Japan is clarified. The trading volume was about 3,000 taels. The listed price for silver shop ornaments decreased by 30 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. Today is National Day, traditionally a market holiday.

Cash Gold Plunges by 210

In the early morning, the market was scattered. Because reports indicated unfavorable news and the exchange market eased, the market immediately dropped by 135 yuan. Gold shops and bullion houses sold dozens of taels, at 5,580 yuan. Then, money exchange firms suddenly absorbed to cover short positions, rising immediately to 5,610 yuan. Afterwards, due to selling pressure from cash shops and securities firms, it fell back to 5,580 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly reversed and absorbed, while silver shops also followed in buying, once rising back to 5,625 yuan. However, the exchange market became harder and it was difficult to sustain the high price. Cash shops and money exchange firms forcefully sold, causing a sudden drop of 7-80 yuan, retreating to 5,545 yuan. Then, silver shops also tended to sell, and there were even fewer buyers at one time, causing a plunge into the 5,500 yuan mark, reaching a low of 5,475 yuan. At the close, sellers decreased and the market recovered to close at 5,505 yuan. As a result, the market dropped by 210 yuan compared to the previous day. The market recovered to 5,530 yuan after the close, but weakened again in the afternoon, retreating back into the 5,500 yuan mark. The market fluctuated by 150 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash shops' own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than cash gold, while the buying price was more than ten yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Decreases for Three Consecutive Periods

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold was reduced by 10 yuan per tael at 9:40, followed by another 10 yuan at 11:30, and another 10 yuan around 3 PM. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed to 560 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang had a similar price. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Plummet: US Dollar Notes Reach 16 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, due to the news of the US State Department's instruction for overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate, which was seen in the newspapers, people were in a state of panic, and various rumors arose as a result. Silver plummeted by more than 200 yuan. British and American gold pounds also plummeted by 5.5 yuan, and British gold notes fell sharply by 2.5 yuan. US dollar notes once fell to 16 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 16.2 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes also fell by 1.5 jiao following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, Singapore, Robbie, Canada, and Philippine notes also tended to decline. The supply of Japanese gold notes also surged, and the evening market retreated to 1.41 yuan. The trend of Korean notes was also soft, and the evening market retreated to 1.13 yuan.

### Grains: Foreign Rice's Rise Was Fleeting

Foreign rice in the early market was affected by the tense international news reported in the newspapers. Rumors abounded in the market, and speculative hoarding took the opportunity to spread rumors about the danger of rice transportation routes from Vietnam and the possible interruption of future sources. This led to floating households and blind followers vying to replenish their supplies. Therefore, although Shenji Foreign Firm continued to sell 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2 rice at a price of only 76.2 yuan, and another telegram with a price of 75 yuan was sent, the market price of foreign rice was instead raised by more than 1 yuan. Soon, the exchange rate rose again, and foreign firms kept selling. There was talk that prices of 75 to 76 yuan had already been settled. In addition, due to recent orders of 200,000 to 300,000 bags, half of which were already on the way and would arrive soon, those who profited greatly took advantage of the high prices to sell. As a result, the midday market immediately fell back by nearly 1 yuan. Selling sentiment was very strong in the afternoon, and prices continued to fall. The result was actually slightly less than half a yuan lower than the previous day. Throughout the day, returned original unopened bags were traded, with spot transactions of more than 8,000 bags. In addition, due to the National Day holiday today, actual sales were also quite high.

Only a little over 100 shi of early and late rice of broken japonica arrived. However, the sales market was greatly constrained by the new japonica, resulting in flat selling prices, similar to before. Early Kaitam Port was 87 yuan, ordinary was 85 yuan, and the next grade was 77 yuan.

A total of 2,000 to 3,000 bags of new japonica pointed and kiln-grown rice arrived by both water and land transport. Although the arrival of goods was brisk, the outbound routes were smoother, so the arrival and sales were balanced. There was no change in the market. New Minhang japonica was 79 yuan, the next grade was 76 yuan, Xitang Rongzhong was 77 yuan, Taicang Yangjian was 64 to 62.3 yuan, and Qingjiao Dujian was 70 yuan, the next grade was 66 yuan.

Due to only scattered sales of domestic and foreign glutinous rice, it remained flat and unremarkable, with no fluctuations seen. The quoted price for Jinli special yuan was still 72 yuan, Changdan was 71 to 70 yuan, and foreign goods were the same.

### Flour: Desire to Hoard, But No Goods

Flour continued to be firm yesterday. Transactions between local customers were not lively, mainly due to the limited supply from Chinese factories. Japanese flour was also banned from being transported to the concession areas. Other inland and foreign flour could only decorate the market. However, people believed that the rebound in rice prices and the news of the evacuation of American expatriates were beneficial, and speculators generally wanted to absorb supplies. The difficulty was the lack of chips, making it impossible to develop, because the Phoenix futures trading was suspended. It was heard that the price of slightly processed bottom flour "Red Peach Blossom" on this street was 15.23 yuan, and the price of foreign flour "Double Eagle" and "Fort Brand" was 18.56 yuan. The "Old Cart Depot" brand, which had once eased slightly the day before, rose again to 18.5 yuan yesterday, on par with the factory flour customer price.

Trading in wheat remained quiet yesterday. Japanese factories were indifferent to purchases, only handling a few hundred bags of goods delivered to the factory each day, and the price remained at 21.23 yuan. Chinese factories also found it difficult to relax their purchases, and few goods were transported into the concession areas. It was heard that the asking price for new wheat in nearby Taicang was 27 yuan, and the counter-offer was 26 yuan, but no transactions had been made. It was also heard that this street handled 10 bags of barley transported from Pudong at a price of 23 yuan for medicinal purposes.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Returns Slightly

The securities gray market was very strong when it first opened yesterday, but it turned down due to a surge of selling after people began buying. Yesterday, excluding the winning bids for Category C shares, the opening bid for Hongtian Xinchang was once raised to 8.45 yuan. Afterwards, Lianyi and retail investors sold more, and the price broke through 8 yuan again, falling to 7.3 yuan. Subsequently, Runli, Yongkang, and Tongkang bought in successively, and the price rebounded firmly. The market was closed in the afternoon to handle same-day settlement, as today is National Day and a holiday. The resulting market prices all rebounded by a slight 0.35 to 0.6 yuan. The total value of transactions was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded at a price of 87 yuan.

The market prices of London foreign debts remained unchanged, while the market prices of Shanghai foreign stocks fluctuated greatly. See the market price column for details.

### Oil Market: Raw Oil Enters and Exits Briskly

Today, 700 bags of soybeans will be transported to Xiamen, 1,380 cans of raw oil will be transported to Xiamen, and 500 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: New York Silk Market Speculates

Yesterday, silk prices in the US and Japan rose significantly, especially in New York. As the situation in the Pacific became increasingly tense, the US authorities had indicated that they might ban silk imports, so speculation on the New York Stock Exchange surged. The prices of near and far-term futures of standard silk rose by about 1 jiao. Spot Japanese silk rose by 0.04 to 0.06 yuan, Shanghai silk rose by 0.04 yuan, and Guangdong silk rose by 0.02 yuan.

Spot prices in Yokohama rose by 20 yuan, and forward prices rose by 1 yuan. Silk prices in this port also rebounded upward. White factory 7-8-point silk was sold for 5,100 yuan, but there were few goods on hand.

### Japanese Silk Production Significantly Reduced

This year's Japanese silk production is far less than in the past. According to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year it was possible to harvest 51,010,000 guan of cocoons, but in fact only 39,962,320 guan were harvested, a decrease of 20%, making it one of the worst years for Japanese cocoon harvests in the past five years. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, it has greatly affected the labor force in Japanese rural areas. In addition, this year was affected by unfavorable weather, resulting in a sharp reduction in cocoon production. (According to last year's Japanese cocoon production of 44,776,593 guan, 1938 cocoon production of 40,863,284 guan, 1937 cocoon production of 45,503,284 guan, 1936 cocoon production of 41,392,474 guan, 1935 cocoon production of 44,175,526 guan, this year's cocoon production is one of the lowest years).

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market saw continued easing of foreign exchange rates, and hoarders were anxious. Goods were sold off again according to the market. However, the demand for various goods was continuously absorbed by buyers, and the situation remained very stable. Selling prices fluctuated very little. Fine yarn and thread-woven products, such as serge and thread tweed, saw selling prices increase by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan per piece due to expensive raw materials. More than 500 pieces of various goods were traded on this street, more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill coarse cloth were traded by the Guangdong-Hong Kong group, more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth were traded by the Zhejiang-Anhui group, and more than 100 pieces of flannel, blue cloth, and coarse cloth were traded by the North Road Yanjin group.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the decline in yarn prices, transactions were thin, and the range of price fluctuations was also small. The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 36.35 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen serge was 1.085 yuan per yard. The price of mid-range fine cloth remained stable, with no significant fluctuations.

Exports: Yesterday, 40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore, and 720 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, another 1,550 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 115 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen.

### "Hug Berlin" Sells Well

"Hug Berlin" occupies a considerable position in today's raincoat materials. Western-style raincoats are popular because they are light, comfortable, and the gray-yellow color is more lively than navy blue. Original colors are extremely rare. Imported goods are wholesaled at 2.2 yuan per yard, but ordinary people are mostly unable to afford them, leading to the rise of domestically produced "Hug Berlin." There is a considerable demand from the Hong Kong-Guangdong group. According to estimates, 80% to 90% of raincoats are made in Shanghai and then shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, Xiang Sheng, Xinchang, and other households opened more than 2,000 yards of Rentai, Ape-Man, and Taishan Drag Berlin raincoats, and the transaction price was 3.25 yuan net. It is found that the width of domestic "Hug Berlin" is only 30 inches, and 5.5 yards of material are required to make a piece. The labor cost is estimated to be about 4 yuan per piece, and ordinary stores in Shanghai sell each piece for 22 to 23 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Plummet

Yesterday, with the continuous easing of foreign exchange rates, the decline in the sugar market became even more severe. The association's price fixing: the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was originally 75.5 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan, and foreign sugar was 75 yuan, a drop of 1.5 yuan. The decline in transit goods was the same, at 58.5 to 59 yuan. Dutch cotton white fell by about 1 yuan, BM was 72.8 yuan, and Dutch red fell by about 0.9 yuan. The spot price was 56 to 55.9 yuan, the road price was 50.6 yuan, Taikoo Car White B was 73.4 yuan, and DY was 71.4 yuan, both down 0.6 yuan. HY was 71.4 to 71 yuan, down 1 yuan.

### Hongji Coal Added 4 Yuan

After a large batch of new Hongji white coal powder arrived at the port recently (as reported in previous newspapers), people's minds were settled and the market atmosphere turned stable. Naturally, the cost was reduced as foreign exchange rates rose. Unexpectedly, a certain firm opened the market yesterday, and its peers cut prices, uniformly increasing the price by 4 yuan. It is estimated that the price of Hongji No. 2 powder (coal briquette raw material) is 124 yuan per ton, self-delivery from the warehouse, with handling fees added. The abnormal action was truly unexpected.

### Yarn and Cotton: Why Did Cotton Yarn Skyrocket? Kicking Back and Forth, it's Still Mostly Paper Trading. Closing In and Out, the Actual Destination is Still Flat. If You Want to Get Out in the Future, I'm Afraid it Will Be Difficult to Reach the Sky.

The reason why the price of cotton yarn has risen by 1,200 yuan outside the customs this time is unusually enthusiastic. The reasons for this can be briefly described as follows:

(1) The Shanghai financial community, in view of the abundance of floating funds, implemented interest rate cuts.

(2) The Burma blockade line will be opened soon and trade will resume.

(3) Although this year's new cotton harvest has been announced, the source is controlled by a certain party and is blocked.

(4) A certain exchange, which has been rumored for a long time, officially announced its establishment on October 1 and will officially open for business. The general speculative community has been idle for a long time and has no way to operate. It uses this topic to greatly exert its skills of stirring up trouble. The fundamental problem is still that the exchange began to finalize the price. The general sellers searched for Japanese yarn and absorbed a batch of it for use as chips, so that the market can enter and exit, and transactions can be circulated. As a result, the root is tightened. The two brands of "20-count Blue Phoenix Yueqin" rose first, and people's hearts were agitated. The Tianjin gang and the Securities Gold gang were all ready to move. Everyone dragged and pulled each other, and they all rushed in. In this situation, the chips were naturally insufficient for distribution for a while. On Friday and Saturday, a certain institute announced two limit-up days. As a result, the speculative community was very happy, and "the bulls all hoped that the sky would fall." As for the actual transaction, it has shown signs of decline. Each day, each market except for the Hong Kong comprador buys 500 to 600 packages, at most 1,000 packages. It is found that the total transaction in the past week was 26,890 packages, of which the Hong Kong gang bought only 4,470 packages. The so-called peer-to-peer transaction, the paper ball is kicked back and forth, and the transaction is 22,390 packages. Reviewing the number of transactions per day increased from 2,000 packages to 4,000 packages. The paper ball transaction today is actually more than 5,400 packages. It is conceivable that the recent speculation has been fierce. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long. Yesterday, the rising peak was seen again at 1,217 yuan. International news was unfavorable, foreign exchange rates were long and long, the basis of the legal currency was more solid, gold fell sharply, and foreign merchants' stocks fell miserably. At this time, the bull front showed a significant shaking trend, so it fell to 1,165 yuan in an instant, but the public psychology, the amount of absorption, is still unwilling to give up, but the inventory is still outside 300,000 packages. At present, the outlets of all parties are narrow and difficult. As for the increasing lag in the need for cotton cloth, the small-scale cloth factories in this port still lack a way to survive, and those who have stopped have still not been able to resume work. Now 1,200 yuan, compared with 800 yuan for the secondary price of 20-count Shuangma on June 28, when the Vietnam issue was tense, has risen by 400 yuan, an increase of 50%. It is found that the exchange rate of US dollars has been reduced to 5.09375 yuan, and yesterday's price was 5.65625 yuan. Based on the above situation, the upper-end price of cotton yarn can be said to have reached its end. However, the general public is still very excited, and the market discussion is unanimously optimistic. At present, the chips are being held by everyone, and the cracks are not likely to be realized, so they will never be willing to rein in on the edge of the cliff, and the international situation is unpredictable. If you want to get out in the future, I am afraid it will be difficult to reach the sky. (Shan)

### The Environment Deteriorates Daily: Yarn Prices Fall

The yarn market began to rise and then fell, but the trend has entered a state of confusion. The truth is that the situation is tense and the foreign exchange rate is long and long, so although the bulls are determined to be optimistic, the environment does not allow it. As a result, the public's mind is weak, and the buying front is not as stable as the previous day. However, the paper ball transaction in the market is increasing day by day, and each day it ends up being more than 4,000 to 5,000 packages. It is conceivable that the scope of future changes will be expanded. Yesterday, there were 780 pieces of yarn shipped to Hong Kong, and today there were 60 pieces shipped to Xiamen and 1,825 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

The spot yarn opened in the morning. Because the bulls spread the air the day before, they shouted to raise the price in unison. The first market rose to 1,200 yuan. At this time, the buying sentiment was still strong. In an instant, it was heard that the news was unfavorable to the bulls, and the foreign exchange rate was long and long. Gold fell sharply, and the selling sentiment suddenly became fierce, falling to 1,163 yuan. However, the bulls came again to raise the price, and the military rose to 1,182 yuan, but the eating households were not prosperous, and they softened again. The closing price was 1,179 yuan. After the closing, the price could not be sold for 20 yuan due to bad news. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 6,203 packages. The market fell by 20 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Peers: 5,400 Fuzhou: 3

Hong Kong: 800 Statistics: 6,203 packages

### Factories Are Watching: Only Peers Are Optimistic About Cotton

Spot cotton trading is slightly more prosperous, but the factories rarely move. The peers are optimistic because the source is not accessible. However, the foreign exchange rate is strangely long and the gold price has fallen miserably, allowing the cotton market to be in a difficult situation. Today, there are 355 pieces of cotton shipped to Hong Kong.

Brazil 280.00 Da Xin entered 150 pieces

Also 277.00 Qingtai entered 100 pieces

Aumla 202.00 Sentai entered 100 pieces

Mitlin 292.00 Yuan Xingde entered 100 pieces

Bailuo went to 236.00 Changxing entered 100 pieces

Pingguoer 157.00 Tao Dingji entered 100 pieces

Dazhongji 257.00 Renchang entered 100 pieces

The following supplements the previous day

Bailuo went to 32.00 Shenjiu entered 400 pieces

Pingguoer 16 .00 Yuda entered 100 pieces

Another message: the foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market was quiet, because the weak Chinese business street and a part of the reactionaries sold out. As a result, the closing price fell by 3 to 5 pounds compared with the previous day. India together with the forecast, fell by 5 Robi yesterday.

The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port was quieter yesterday. Because the situation in the Far East turned serious, all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Although there were not many transactions yesterday, it was because the inventory in Shanghai was not abundant, so the selling price still failed to turn loose. In general, the opinions are that after the market has a slight turnaround, the cotton market will rise.

### Hardware: Ship Steel Plates Tighten

Especially Thick Colorful Ones are Popular

Ship steel plates have become fragmented after the relocation of shipyard manufacturers. Recently, the northern gang has been searching for them from time to time. In addition, this street is very interested in thick colorful ones, and the market atmosphere has been invigorated. People's minds have become lively. The standard is that the price has risen without falling compared to the previous market (thick colorful ones are especially the case). At present, the market selling price is 2.5 li, shouting 80 yuan, 0.5 fen sells for 70 yuan, 7 li sells for 67 yuan, and 1 fen also needs 65 yuan.

Also, the previously published "1 fen colorful sells for 50 yuan" actually sells for 60 yuan per dan. This is an error in the report at the time. This is a correction.

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Arrives and Sells Not Quietly

Western sea cucumber has recently arrived and sold quietly. Another deal was sold yesterday, including 621 yuan for selected Wangjiaxi jade ginseng, 578 yuan for No. 1 jade, 528 yuan for No. 2 jade, 468 yuan for No. 3 jade, 405 yuan for No. 4, 355 yuan for No. 5, 251 yuan for small jade, 256 yuan for selected red ginseng, 222 yuan for No. 1 red, 193 yuan for No. 2 red, 173 yuan for No. 3, 156 yuan for No. 4, and 148 yuan for small red ginseng. The transaction price is slightly firmer than before.

### Siamese Mussels 6-7 Yuan

Siamese dried mussels have recently arrived in a batch, with all colors available, and the sales are quite good. At present, large and medium dried mussels sell for 207 yuan, large dried mussels sell for 212 yuan, and outgoing office sells for 228 yuan, an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to before.

### Seaweed Market Scarce

The seaweed market is thin, and it seems that demand exceeds supply. The market price has increased by 10%. At present, Longya seaweed sells for 55 yuan, Xilan seaweed sells for 58 yuan, Wudun seaweed sells for 52 yuan, and the goods are very scarce. Lion mane seaweed sells for 64 yuan.

### The Post-War Chinese Silk Industry (Continued from the Fourth Day)

— Shi Xiang

There are still small factories that take the risk of extending credit. Their capital is inherently limited. With 60,000 yuan as working capital, they can at most purchase only one hundred fifty or sixty dan of fresh cocoons at market price, equivalent to about fifty-odd dan of dried cocoons. However, some take the risk of purchasing goods exceeding their original capital by one time. Although they purchase three hundred dan of fresh cocoons, they incur an additional debt of 60,000 yuan. Villagers demand payment of old debts as soon as the cocoon collection ends. Manufacturers are unable to make ends meet, resulting in goods being seized and prohibited from leaving the country. Consequently, disputes arise one after another. With no way out, manufacturers resort to high-interest loans (interest rates for borrowing against silk cocoons in Wuxi have reached as high as five percent per month) while selling goods at low prices to settle foreign debts, bringing money back to their hometowns to compensate and immediately prepare for production. It is thus evident how difficult it is to transport small batches of dried cocoons to factories and, after exchanging the raw silk produced for funds, returning to the villages to redeem cocoons and continue operations.

### Today's National Day Commemoration: Schools Raise Flags and Celebrate; Hold Simple Ceremonies and Lectures on National History; Step Up Efforts to Collect Winter Clothing Donations

Today is the founding anniversary of the Republic of China. All levels of schools will hoist flags, take a holiday, and hold simple celebratory ceremonies, giving lectures on the history of the founding of the nation. Efforts to collect donations for winter clothing will be intensified. In addition to staff and students donating on their own, they will also actively solicit donations from family members and friends, hoping to achieve the predetermined target before the end of October. It is reported that the schools are in the process of submitting the donations to the newspapers acting as collection agents, which will then forward them to the Chongqing headquarters, hoping to promote the effectiveness of the effort through newspaper publicity and encouragement (Dahua News Agency).

### This Newspaper Sponsors Summer Essay Contest for Middle School and University Students: Winning Essays to be Published Today; University Group: Su Yi-Huan from Southwest Associated University; Middle School Group: Guo Dong-Cai from McTyeire School

This newspaper, in order to encourage middle school and university students to make use of their summer vacation for self-study and to inspire them to strive for excellence, held the first micro-essay contest. The response was exceptionally enthusiastic. Even schools as far away as Chongqing and Yunnan provinces sent in entries. The total number of entries was no less than five or six thousand, among which there were many excellent works. However, due to the limited number of awards, it was inevitable that some good works would be overlooked. Experts were engaged to carefully evaluate and determine the winners, and the results were announced yesterday. The winning essays from the university and middle school groups will be published together today for reference. The first-place winner in the university group is Su Yi-Huan from Southwest Associated University in Kunming, whose essay is entitled "A Record of Hydrological Surveying in Tengchong." The second-place winner is Zhou Zhi-Nan from Chongqing University. Both winners have been requested to send in their recent photographs for printing and publication. The first-place winner in the middle school group is Guo Dong-Cai from McTyeire School, whose essay is entitled "Our Summer School." The second-place winner is Yun Guan-Hua from the attached middle school of Guanghua University. Photographs of the two middle school winners will be published today.

### Silver Coin Ping-Pong Exhibition Match: Citibank Forcefully Defeats YWCA

Silver Coin Ping-Pong Exhibition Match: Citibank Forcefully Defeats YWCA. To spark interest in ping-pong among the silver coin industry, a special exhibition match was added the night before last during the Silver Coin Cup ping-pong competition. The YWCA ping-pong team faced off against last year's runner-up, Citibank, at the Citibank Club. The YWCA team was coached by veteran ping-pong player Chen Linsheng, and their techniques were extraordinary. Citibank is a strong force in the banking world, with substantial strength. The event attracted a lot of wonderful attention. In the second match, YWCA team captain Zhang Yongru fought hard against Citibank's Western star player, Olyler. The two battled for five sets. Zhang's shots were like shooting stars, with excellent angles. Olyler succumbed by a score of two to three. In the overall result, two to three, the YWCA put up a strong fight but was defeated. It can be said that they lost with honor. Additionally, the competition committee announced that the scheduled order cannot be changed at will. Winning teams should submit their completed results as soon as possible for public announcement. There will be no matches today due to National Day; matches will resume as usual tomorrow. The performance scores of the two teams are recorded as follows:

### Shanghai Youth vs. Shanghai Star: Finals Today. Guangshi Basketball League, Division A: Women's Division: Zhizhong vs. Shanghai Star

The second Guangshi Cup basketball tournament is nearing its final stages in all divisions. In Division A, the perennial winners Shanghai Youth and Shanghai Star A teams are scheduled to meet this afternoon to compete for the division championship. Shanghai Youth is the runner-up of the United Cup, boasting famous players like "Big Cat" Sun Huipei, Yu Xuanqian, Li Zude, Ren Xiangcheng, Tao Shaosheng, and others. Besides veterans Liang Yunming, Chen Bangzhen, and Zhuo Guorong, Zheng Qinming of Shanghai Star A is also an outstanding talent at the front. At the time of the game, it is expected that the contest will be fierce and full of excitement. In the women's division, originally, there were two matches: the Jingwu versus Qixiu match. Both teams agreed to reschedule; therefore, only the first-round match of Zhizhong versus Shanghai Star remains. The West team previously met in the China Youth charity basketball exhibition match, and Zhizhong suffered a crushing defeat. Today, they meet again on a narrow path; it is uncertain who will be victorious. In Division B, two matches, Guangshi versus Shanghai Star B, and Flying Eagle versus Lianyi, are at critical junctures. It is predicted that Guangshi and Lianyi will be victorious, and the above two teams will compete for the championship. In addition, there are six matches in Division B. If Lingyou wins against Laoyi, they will win the "Guang" group championship. Green Duckweed has won all four matches in the "Zhong" group. If they can overcome Guoguang C today, they will also win the top spot in the group. The remaining few matches are insignificant to the overall standings. Tickets are sold for one yuan each.

### Hong Kong Football League Opens: South China Suffers Defeat

(Hong Kong Dispatch) This year's football league opened yesterday. Originally, there were three Division A matches, but two were postponed. Only one match remained, Fuhua versus Scott, held at the So Kon Po Stadium. This year, with the rise of the Sing Tao team, South China, which has dominated Hong Kong for four years, has suffered a significant blow to its strength. However, with the "Football King" Li Huitang and famous winger Cao Guicheng wearing their uniforms, and the assistance of young new talents, the lineup is still considered complete. In yesterday's first match against the Scottish army, the offensive was very strong. The "Football King" had more than ten opportunities to shoot, but unfortunately, due to bad luck, he was unable to succeed. In the end, they lost to Scott by a score of 0 to 1, which is a great pity. South China's starting lineup is as follows:

Surveying the Dieshuihe Waterfall: Completing the Survey Work

This spring, gentry in Tengchong wished to utilize the Dieshuihe Waterfall in the county to construct a hydroelectric power plant. They suggested this to the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission, which praised their request and hired Shi Jiayang, Dean of the Engineering College of National Southwest Associated University and chief engineer of the Yunnan Provincial Hydropower Survey Team of the Resources Committee, to preside over the matter. By July, when school was on summer vacation, Mr. Shi sent me and classmates Chen Qiheng and Liao Zhongzhou to investigate the hydropower situation of Dieshuihe and measure the detailed conditions on both banks, to serve as a basis for designing the plant and canals. Thus, we had a trip to Tengchong.

Staying in Xiaguan for a Month: Surveying the Hydropower of the Er River

We departed from Kunming on June 28th on a bus of the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau. Due to vehicle obstructions, we were delayed on the road for a day and only arrived in Xiaguan on the evening of the 30th. We stayed at the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau Hostel. Taking the opportunity to survey the hydropower situation in the Er River area, we stayed in Xiaguan for over a month.

The Er River (Figure 1) is the outlet of Er Lake. It flows through Xiaguan to Yangbi (Figure 2) and merges with the Yangbi River, flowing into the Lancang River. At the Black Dragon Bridge in Xiaguan, the river surface is 80 meters wide and the water is about 1 meter deep on average. From the measurements taken on July 15th of this year, the flow rate during the high-water period is known to be 40 O.M.S. (cubic meters per second). From the Black Dragon Bridge, the current begins to accelerate 500 meters to the west, and the riverbed gradually narrows to only 30 meters, with a slope of about 0.7%. Another 2 kilometers to the Tianban Bridge, the river passes through deep valleys between two mountains, a very dangerous situation. It is said that when Zhuge Wuhou of the Han Dynasty conquered the southern barbarians, he captured the barbarian king Meng Huo here four times. This is the lowest gap in Cangshan Mountain, and southwest air currents often blow into the Dali Plain from here, causing Xiaguan to be windy. The narrowest part of the valley is only 3 meters wide, and there are large protruding rocks on both banks that connect like a bridge, which people can cross over, hence the name Tiansheng Bridge (Natural Bridge). (Figure 3) The river flows through the deep valley under the bridge. At first, it was thought that the water flow must be extremely turbulent in such a narrow valley, but it turned out that the flow was slower than the upstream and downstream, at 1.5m/sec. It can be imagined that there must be a deep abyss at the bottom of the river, and there must be larger gaps under the stone cliffs on both banks. Another 300 meters ahead, huge rocks protrude in the water, causing the water to tumble and leap, and the foam rises like snowflakes. The river water in front of the rocks falls deeply to 8 or 9 meters, which is quite spectacular from a distance. The locals call it Bu Xie Mei (Never Thank the Plum Blossom), because it has white flowers all year round. People think that it is a waterfall, and its hydropower must be great. A previous association hired personnel from Siemens to investigate and planned to generate electricity, but the project did not materialize due to lack of funds. Recently, the Resources Committee plans to build a small power plant there to supply electricity to Dali, Xiaguan, Fengyi, and Yangbi. The detailed topographic map of the area near the planned power plant has been measured by us. The local people are eagerly awaiting the construction of the hydropower plant, which will begin soon.

Descending 3 kilometers from Tiansheng Bridge, the water flows entirely between the stone beds at the bottom of the valley. Downstream, the rocks are jagged and undulating, and the rushing water creates waves that gleam and reflect. The smooth places are pools of clear water, which is very refreshing. The riverbed is winding and extends to the southwest. The water surface is between 20 and 40 meters wide, and the slope is over 2%. The walls on both sides of the river are mostly steep, but the gradient is uniform, and there is very little flat land. The mountains are undulating, and the trees are lush. There are occasional county springs and waterfalls, with flying rapids echoing through the valleys, making the scenery very beautiful. The Yunnan-Burma Highway is 30 meters above the water on the right bank. On the left bank, there is an old post road, and the sound of bells can still be heard from time to time. The geology along the river consists of purple mud cliffs on the left bank and granite on the right bank. The stones are huge, with fine textures and solid quality. The arch bridges, culverts, and nearby village buildings now use stone materials extracted locally, which is very convenient. Tracing the river downstream for another 10 kilometers to the iron chain bridge, commonly known as the 40-Li Bridge, 40 Chinese miles west of Yangbi. It is also known as the Chain Bridge, which uses eight iron chains to connect both banks, covered with wooden planks, for people and horses to cross. The bridge is 18 meters long and 3.6 meters wide. The water surface height under the bridge is 1570 meters, 400 meters lower than the water surface in Xiaguan. Another 6 kilometers ahead to Pingpo, the Er River merges with the Yangbi River and flows into the Lancang River (Figure 4). The width at the confluence is 20 meters, the average water depth is 1 meter, and the water surface elevation is 1380 meters, which is 600 meters lower than the water surface in Xiaguan. The horizontal distance between the two places is 21.5 kilometers, so the total average water surface slope is 3.0%. The abundance of hydropower resources is truly astonishing.

Ten Days of Travel in Baoshan: Visiting the Martial Marquis Shrine

By July 18th, we had completed all the work in Xiaguan. Coincidentally, a classmate, Mr. Zhang, who served in the Red Cross Medical Transportation Team, came to the hostel and said that several transportation vehicles would be going to Baoshan empty. Therefore, we carried our instruments and luggage and continued westward. We passed Yongping that night and arrived in Baoshan City on the afternoon of the 30th, staying at the Highway Bureau Hostel. The hostel was commissioned by the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau to be run by the China Travel Service. It is located on Taibao Mountain north of the city (Figure 5), the former site of the Jade Emperor Pavilion. The scenery is beautiful, and the trees are lush. There is the Cuiwei Building, from which one can overlook the Baoshan Plain, one of the eighteen scenic spots of Baoshan. Therefore, ancient people often held banquets there. The hostel is still used as a restaurant. Among all the Yunnan-Burma Highway hostels, this one should have the best scenery.

We stayed in Baoshan for ten days, taking advantage of our leisure time to travel around the scenic spots and schools. We climbed Taibao Mountain, visited the Martial Marquis Shrine, crossed Wolongquan Bridge, visited Yi Zachi, tasted Yongzhu Spring, walked Lihua Pavilion, visited Shihua Cave, and visited the Tengxian Guild Hall (Figure 6). We received cordial hospitality from the local people and were able to visit the National Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Provincial Baoshan Normal School, and various county-run primary and secondary schools, witnessing the increasing progress of education in the border area, which was truly inspiring. The beautiful scenery was pleasing to the eye, broadening our minds.

Following the Ancient Tengchong-Baoshan Road: A Long March on Sedan Chairs

There is still no car access from Baoshan west to Tengchong. When the Yunnan-Burma Highway was being built, there were two original plans west of Baoshan: the southern line and the northern line. The southern line went southwest from Baoshan, through Longling, Mangshi, Zhafang, and Wanmading to enter Burma and connect to Lashio. The northern line went west from Baoshan, following the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road to reach Tengchong, through Lianshan to connect to Bhamo in Burmese territory. In terms of climate and business, this line was better. However, at that time, the Mangshi and Zhafang areas along the southern line already had a section of road built by the local chieftain. In order to save money, the authorities decided to use that road and adopted the southern line plan. The people of Tengchong had strongly argued for this, but to no avail. It has recently been heard that gentry in Tengchong, in order to facilitate transportation as a key plan to develop all industries, and to connect the border areas as a priority for strengthening national defense, have agreed with the people of Baoshan to raise funds autonomously from the people of the two counties to build the Tengchong-Baoshan Highway. The project is said to have started several months ago and has made great progress. Recently, due to the busy farming season and the rainy season, work has been temporarily suspended. It is expected that work will continue around the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. If no special difficulties arise, the thoroughfare will be opened in a year. Not only will business between Tengchong and Baoshan become more prosperous, but people from other places who come to visit Tengchong will no longer have to travel arduously for days.

Based on the above, this time we went from Baoshan to Tengchong by taking a sedan chair and following the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road to the west. Both Tengchong and Baoshan are remote areas on the border of our country. The Nujiang and Gaoligong Mountains span between them, dividing the watersheds of the Lujiang and Longchuan Rivers. The terrain is dangerous, and the trails twist up and down through high mountains, deep valleys, dense forests, and open spaces, making the journey extremely difficult. I measured from the map that the straight-line distance between the two counties is only 150 li, but the actual distance traveled is more than 300 li. The tortuous situation can be imagined. It takes four days to travel from Baoshan to Tengchong by sedan chair. On the first day, we traveled 70 li, had lunch at Lengshuiqing, and stayed overnight in Qing Biao Yi. On the second day, we traveled 90 li, crossed the Nujiang River, passed the Lujiang River, and stayed overnight in the old village of Gaoligong Mountain. This day was the longest and most difficult of the entire journey. On the third morning, we departed from the old village, had lunch at Pinghe Village on the top of Gaoligong Mountain, crossed the Longchuan River, and climbed uphill for another 10 li to reach Olive Village, where we stayed overnight. The journey was 80 li, and the hardship of the journey was only slightly less than on the second day. On the fourth day, we continued to climb uphill from Olive Village, had lunch at Qincaifeng, and from there, the road was relatively flat. After crossing another small slope, the Tengchong Plain was in sight. We reached the county seat at 3:00 PM. The arduous journey came to an end here. This is a general overview of the journey. As for the sights, sounds, and lodging conditions along the way, they will be described below.

## Page 18

We left Baoshan on August 8th. The sedan chair we took was hired from the city the day before. Because there were too many luggage and instruments, we hired four porters and six chair carriers, for a total of ten people. The wage for each person was negotiated to be 50 new Yunnan dollars, equivalent to 25 national dollars. They were all from Sichuan. When they first came to the hostel with the sedan chair, they looked haggard and their faces were dark. I was worried that they would not be able to bear the arduous journey. When I saw them packing their luggage and pushing each other, even a shoe or a hat was thrown onto someone else's burden, their behavior was despicable and disgusting. Later, they told me that they were all subordinates of Guo Runao of the Sichuan Army. In the 25th year of the Republic, they followed the army to Yunnan to suppress bandits and were dismissed in the north of Shuichang. They were stranded in a foreign land and could not return, so they had to sell their labor to make a living.

They were also addicted to opium. Each person had a small cloth bag containing opium pipes and lamps. Whenever they reached a place while walking, they would find a place to lie down and enjoy the pleasure of smoking, completely disregarding the luggage of the travelers. They would not start until repeatedly urged. I had previously read Mrs. Eberhardt's book "The Traffic of the Middle Kingdom", which stated that Chinese sedan chair carriers need to smoke opium every two or three hours. I thought it was an exaggeration by foreigners. Unexpectedly, I witnessed this scene today, and I realized that Mrs. Eberhardt's words were all based on facts. Although the authorities have set a time limit for prohibition and strictly enforce it, it is still unknown whether these people can wake up and break away from the darkness.

Visiting Xu Xiake's Travel Traces: Lodging in Pu Biao Yi That Night

We got up at 6:00 AM on August 8th. The hired sedan chair carriers and servants were supposed to come at 7:00 AM, but they did not arrive until after 8:00 AM. It took another hour to pack the luggage, so we were not able to start until 9:30 AM. After leaving the city through Zhennan Gate, we walked west along the Yunnan-Burma Highway for 6 kilometers and then took the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road. At that time, it was cloudy and foggy, and it was drizzling. At 10:00 AM, we passed Zhuge Weir. The weir was on the right side of the road, with a ten-li-long grass embankment made of stone blocks. It is said that it was built by Zhuge during his southern campaign to garrison troops. To the right is Jiulonggang, named because the mountain range undulates into nine peaks. The peaks are continuous, and the trees are beautiful, making for excellent scenery. Between the weir and the mountain, there is a flat field. When there is a lot of rain, it is stored here to form a lake, which the locals call Dahaizi. Above the hillside, houses are lined up, and where smoke rises, it is Dayu Village. Half an hour later, we passed the 25-Li Post. The sedan chair carriers asked for a break, so we got out of the sedan chair and rested for half an hour before continuing. Ten minutes later, we passed Xiyoushan Shihua Cave. Teachers and staff from the Overseas Chinese Middle School invited us to play in the cave. The cave is located on the right side of the road, under the mountain, also called Banana Cave. The entrance of the cave has a wooden gate, and Guanyin Bodhisattva is enshrined inside, with a monk guarding it. That day, we held torches, pine oil, and flashlights to enter the cave. At the right turn of the entrance, there is a bat nest on the top of the cave. The bats, seeing the light, flew away in droves, chirping loudly, countless in number, which was quite frightening. There are many forks in the cave, and it is slippery and difficult to walk. Although we hired a local guide, we did not dare to go deep. We walked about a mile and returned, and we were unable to explore it completely. There are many stalactites in the cave, with strange shapes, like umbrellas, cows, tigers, and leopards, as if they were sculptures. The stone walls are shimmering and glittering, and when touched by hand, it feels cool to the bone. At one place, the guide struck the ground heavily with a large stone, and a sound like thunder rose, deafening. The locals call it the Stone Drum, which may be what Xu Xiake's Yunnan Travel Diary referred to as "a cave below the cave".

The road west after passing the cave is dangerous and difficult to walk, because the ground is slippery after the rain, and the sedan chair carriers struggled, which took a lot of effort. When we reached the top of the mountain, it was noon, so we stopped to rest by the roadside. I took out a barometric altimeter and looked at it, and it had climbed more than 200 meters. The elevation of the Baoshan Plain is 1700 meters, and the reading on the altimeter at that time was 1950 meters. We rested for half an hour and continued to move forward. At that time, the fog in the sky had completely cleared, and there was a hint of sunshine. Since the road was relatively flat, we got out of the sedan chairs and walked. The road was entirely made of yellow earth, which was moist after the rain, making it even more beautiful. We walked for half an hour, and as the road became muddy, we got back into the sedan chairs. The highest elevation of the slope was 2130 meters. From here, we turned downhill. At 2:30 PM, we arrived at Lengshuiqing, and the altimeter reading was 2050 meters. The area is surrounded by mountains, with high peaks and dense forests. There are several thatched huts on the side of the road that also sell food, so we ate there. A bowl of white rice costs 40 cents in new Yunnan currency, equivalent to 20 cents in national currency. The dishes are only ham and cured meat, each small plate costs 1.50 new Yunnan dollars, which tastes quite good. While we were eating, we met two guests, one surnamed Ge and one surnamed He, both from Tengchong County, who had just returned from doing business in Baoshan. They asked if we were going to Tengchong to set up a hydropower plant and expressed their welcome. We set off again at 3:00 PM. From here, the mountain range began to rise again. Half an hour later, we saw the Nujiang River and Gaoligong Mountain overlapping in front of us. The high mountains were light green, and the Nujiang River was dark blue. The haze was layered, with mountains outside the mountains, no different from a natural painting. Below the mountain, there is a small plain. The sedan chair carriers told us that Pu Biao was in sight. I took out a telescope to look at it. Indeed, there was a small town in front of us, with flying eaves clustered together, hidden in the green trees and forests. The sedan chair carriers followed the small mountain road and descended windingly, walking as fast as flying, no longer like walking slowly when climbing the mountain. Before long, we reached the flat ground. I looked at my watch and it was only 5:00 PM.

There is a screen wall gate at the entrance of the town, with white walls and black characters, inscribed "Ancient Yi of Pu Biao" with "Dragon Roar, Tiger Howl" on the left and "Crane Dance, Mandarin Duck Flight" on the right. The gate is small but does not lose its majesty, and the wall is thin but clean and lovely. After entering the town gate, there is a long street lined with houses. The south of the street has small alleys, mostly residential areas. The houses in the city were originally very neat, but this spring, they were burned down by a fire due to carelessness. As a result, broken tiles and dilapidated walls are everywhere. The border town lacks fire-fighting equipment, and when disaster strikes, it cannot be contained. There is the Nanjiang River at the west end of the town, a clear stream of water. A wooden bridge is built over the river in the shape of a corridor. We went to visit it in the evening and stood on the bridge, looking north at the Big Dipper and Little Bear, and thousands of soldiers and horses to the south. The river water flowed slowly under the bridge, leisurely and far away. Occasionally, a breeze blew, and we heard the sound of distant water-powered rice mills rising and falling. There was movement in the stillness, which was very pleasant. Everyone forgot to return in the beautiful scenery, and we only returned to the hostel when the dew was heavy. Pu Biao is famous for producing garlic, and the sweet garlic made by Chunhezhai in the town is popular everywhere.

We went to bed around 10:00 PM that night. While we were sound asleep, we were suddenly awakened by the sound of bells. We heard cattle and horses passing by downstairs, mixed with the shouts of the drivers. We were all surprised at how fast it was dawn, and the traveler in the next room shouted to the waiter to bring water to wash his face. After a while, we heard the waiter lazily reply, "This is an old cow passing by. Cows are afraid of the heat and cannot travel during the day, so they start walking at night. It's the middle of the night, so why are you so impatient?" I shined a flashlight on my watch and saw that it was indeed 1:00 AM, so I went back to sleep.

Observing the Structure of the Riverbed: Climbing Gaoligong Mountain

The next morning, we got up at 5:30 AM, washed up, and had breakfast. The accommodation and two meals cost 3.50 national dollars per person. At 7:30 AM, we set off, crossed the Nanjiang River, and climbed a slope on foot. We often saw Bench Marks set by the Baoteng Highway Survey Team on the side of the road. We walked for an hour,

(1) Enrollment

Two porcelain bowls sat on the desk, filled with dark black liquid, shimmering with golden light in the poorly lit office. Ben Shan and I stood before the desk, writing enrollment advertisements. Each of us held a pen, dipping it into the bowl of liquid in front of us. The two bowls appeared to be the same color, but when the liquid-laden bristles touched the white newsprint, the colors became distinctly different: what I wrote was red, and what Ben Shan wrote was blue. On each sheet of white paper, I wrote:

"Those who can read, please advise; those who cannot read, come quickly to study,"

and after adding words such as "Qualifications," "Tuition," "Registration Date," and "School Address," I handed it to Ben Shan. His blue pen added "Meilun People's School Enrollment" and "Ages 8 to 14," completing the advertisement as follows.

Every time we wrote ten or so, we would put down our pens, wipe the sweat from our foreheads, and exchange a smile. This was a form of mutual comfort. In that dimly lit little room, I could see the light of joy and determination radiating from his large eyes in the darkness, which further encouraged me.

The stack of white paper gradually decreased, while the pile of completed advertisements increased into a thick stack. After approximately five hours of work, we had finished one hundred identical advertisements. At this point, we put down our pens, rubbed our hands, and the exhilaration had already made us forget the soreness in our wrists.

The next morning, we put on straw hats, carried buckets of paste and brooms, and tucked a stack of advertisements under our arms, acting as billposters.

Our target audience was the common people, especially working-class and poor children, so our enrollment advertisements did not need to be found on telephone poles, trees, or walls along wide, flat asphalt roads. We went to areas that "high-minded" people disdained to walk, and never did. Here, there were only dilapidated thatched huts and low-rise bungalows. All one saw were laborers in short clothes and bare feet or bare chests, and children without a stitch of clothing. When we started working, they all looked at us with curious eyes, giving us, the uncommon guests, a scrutinizing gaze. Some even directly asked about the content of our advertisements. Naturally, we could not miss this opportunity, and immediately explained that we were enrolling students for the people's school, that we did not charge tuition, did not limit age, and we also individually asked them how many children they had and whether they would like to come to our school. Some immediately agreed to send their children to school, while others said that the journey was too far, or that their children could not come because they had to work (such as child laborers in factories, scavengers, and street vendors). However, we repeatedly persuaded them, and the results were not entirely disappointing.

Simultaneously with the enrollment advertisements, another aspect of the enrollment work was to summon the students from the people's school of the previous semester, giving them a kind of responsibility, which was to persuade their neighbors and friends to study, and also to give them some enrollment advertisements to post around their residential areas. They were very happy and enthusiastic to accept this mission. The result was also very satisfactory.

The next day, before the scheduled registration time, a group of somewhat familiar faces and ragged children were already waiting outside the school gate. The noise of their conversations made us in the office feel a burst of joy.

Regarding the payment of the five-mao deposit, some were hesitant and stingy, but after a detailed explanation, they understood that it was only used to encourage students to study diligently and to limit their casual absenteeism. If students did not miss more than a week, they could get it back at the end of the semester. Thus, they relievedly took out five mao from their pockets. However, in special circumstances, such as when the family was really too poor, we could also promise to give them the preferential treatment of waiving the fee.

Within the six-day registration period, we counted a total of more than one hundred and sixty registrants. However, even a week after school started, people were still coming to register, but we could not accommodate those who came late due to the classwork and enrollment limits.

(2) Entrance Examination

Before 2 p.m. on the day before school started, the school gate was crowded again. This was the day we held the entrance examination.

After we completed the registration procedures, we made a more detailed statistic based on the resumes. As a result, those who were illiterate accounted for slightly less than half, and the rest had very uneven levels. Some could only write their own names, while others had the level of a senior primary school student. As for age, those under ten years old accounted for 75% of the total, those under fourteen years old accounted for about 24%, and those over fifteen years old were extremely rare. Therefore, we needed to have an entrance examination to determine the classes.

The examination was divided into two parts: those who were illiterate only needed to go through an oral examination. Our purpose was to observe whether the child's age was suitable for the age stipulated in our regulations, whether they could understand the language, and whether they could speak clearly. Because according to our past experience, many shrewd parents wanted to send their children under the age of eight to school to get a little "bargain." Their main purpose was not to give their children a little education, but just to lock the children in school and ask us to take care of them, saving them from being noisy and troublesome at home. But we were not a kindergarten. For such children, in the past, because they were under the age, could not understand the language, and cried and wailed, they would give us a lot of trouble, so we really could not accommodate them. After the parents were not allowed to "beg for mercy," they could only use the method of falsely reporting their age to "sneak" in. After school started, when we found out and asked them to withdraw, the parents would also use the "what's done is done" "fait accompli" to argue, making us feel a little troubled and thorny. Although we finally asked them to withdraw, the shrewd parents still did not give up their principle of "getting away with what they could" to use their "old tricks." Therefore, we had to use the oral examination as an X-ray to expose it. However, all students who came to register were admitted unconditionally except for the condition of insufficient age.

As for those who were literate, we gave them a written test. There were only a few types of test questions, and all grades were the same, but we adopted progressive questions, fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice, and the content was a mixture of Mandarin and common sense. The questions ranged from shallow to deep, in order to test the students' level and assign them to the appropriate classes.

Based on the test results, we divided these one hundred or so students into three classes: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Because there were too many students in the elementary class, it was further divided into two groups, A and B. Although when divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels in this way, there were inevitably differences in the levels within each class, we could not open more classes due to the number of teachers and the need to repair and paint the classrooms during the summer vacation. Fortunately, this was only a short six weeks, and our purpose was to give them a little necessary common sense, so that new students could enter the people's school in the next semester after this six-week tutoring, and old students could be able to make up lessons in this summer vacation, and add a little living knowledge, so this kind of class division did not matter much.

(3) Preparatory Work

Regarding the employment of teachers and staff, we had already contacted them in advance before the holidays, although that was only verbal, and they were not very certain in their replies. Now, we needed to go through the formal procedure of issuing letters of appointment. Our organization of this people's school had already been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau before the war, so we could not arbitrarily change the organization according to law. The principal was still our principal, and below him was a director, who was also our teacher. Below that were the positions of teaching affairs and discipline, which were taken up by our classmates themselves. Because our organization was like this, the letters of appointment were stamped and issued by the principal, which indeed gave us a lot of convenience. (1) Because some of the parents of our classmates were afraid that something would go wrong and were not at ease with their children running around outside during the holidays. As a result, they declined our invitation to teach at the school due to family reasons, but after having our formal letter of appointment, the parents trusted their children: secondly, because this letter of appointment was signed by the principal, it was more solemn, so the appointed classmates did not have much to refuse, except for special reasons, and readily accepted it. Otherwise, we would not know how much effort we would have to spend to sell favors to get a promise. With this reason, the work of employing teachers was quickly completed.

This year, one thing worth mentioning is that six of our graduates and alumni of the people's school also came to teach under our persuasion and encouragement. They were all female workers working in factories, but they were able to spare time to take on the entire curriculum of the elementary level (illiterate level). This spirit can prove the achievements of our "learn and teach" small teacher system.

After the duties of the teachers and staff and the teaching affairs were properly drafted, the first full faculty meeting was convened to discuss and approve the proposed distribution of duties. But in general, there was not much change. In addition, the curriculum and textbooks for each grade, and the grade-leveling issues were also within our discussion process. After this meeting, the pre-class problems concerning teachers, grade levels, textbooks, etc. were mostly completely taken care of.

In order to cultivate the spirit of student autonomy, we decided to continue to run the "Discipline Squad" and the "Cleaning Squad," each led by a captain, who were all elected by the students themselves. The task of the discipline squad was to set up posts in the main thoroughfares and maintain order during dismissal. The cleaning squad was responsible for correcting students' cleaning habits and helping younger students with cleaning work, such as wiping their noses and tidying their collars. At the same time, we decided to set up a cleaning banner and an order banner, and add two columns, "Classroom Cleaning Condition" and "Order," in the classroom diary, which were to be judged and filled in by the teachers on duty. A tally was made every weekend, and the results were announced during the memorial week of the following week. The best class would hang the banner in the classroom of that class. If the victory still belonged to that class the following week, then the banner could still be kept in the classroom, otherwise it had to be transferred to another winning class to show the meaning of encouragement

The summer schedule is easier to arrange than usual, because in normal times, teachers are unable to spare time due to school work and extracurricular assignments, so there are many restrictions when scheduling courses, and it is not easy to get a satisfactory schedule. During the summer vacation, teachers have more free time, and there are fewer restrictions, so it is naturally easier and more pleasing to arrange.

In terms of curriculum, Mandarin, common sense, and arithmetic are the main subjects for the senior, intermediate, and elementary levels. In addition, the senior and intermediate and elementary levels have two hours of singing. The senior level also has one hour of practical writing, and the elementary and intermediate levels each have one hour of games and physical education.

The school calendar stipulates that classes start on July 10, but before the 9th, we had already completed all the pre-school preparations; the list of students for each grade and the schedule were announced; the teacher's notices and the schedule were also issued, and everything was just waiting for the arrival of school tomorrow.

(4) The Beginning of a New Life

At 3 p.m. on July 10, the doorman rang the big bell. The loud chime stopped the noise of a large group of students scattered on the playground, and those outside the school gate hurried in, and we led them into the auditorium for the opening ceremony of this semester's first gathering.

Although a large part of those sitting in the auditorium were new children, they were quite orderly when singing the national anthem. More than a hundred small mouths shouted out majestic syllables at the same time, and bathed in this solemn singing, I felt a burst of unspeakable joy in my heart. When reading the Prime Minister's will and being silent, everyone stood at attention neatly and solemnly, without a sound. This situation was also not easy to see before.

The ceremony began with the director's speech. Originally, there was also the principal's speech before this, but unfortunately he was unable to attend temporarily due to being detained by something. Otherwise, we could also listen to the principal's instructions after being separated for more than ten days. What the director said was probably to explain the purpose of studying, and to encourage students to work hard and make progress, as well as to expound the "learn and teach" small teacher system promoted by our school. Then, the dean of teaching affairs and the dean of student affairs reported on school affairs and the rules of attention for going to and from class, and the ceremony was over. Then, the class teachers led the classes into the classrooms to conduct the class teacher's instructions and distribute new books and other matters. The first day's work ended here.

That night, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. My mind was full of images of the school building, the noise of the children, and the work of tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after the day after tomorrow...

(5) Extracurricular Activities

In the first few days of school, the order after class was inevitably a bit chaotic. Three days later, we could already find our "little policemen" everywhere in the school. They stood proudly in their posts, with a white cloth wrapped around their arms with the words "Discipline Officer" on them. Spirited and lively, they performed their duties. The chief of the discipline squad patrolled and inspected everywhere.

Discipline officers were selected from each class, and there were only twelve places. Therefore, many students who were not selected flocked to the office as soon as class was over, asking to participate in the discipline officer service. Because the number of places was limited, we had tried our best to expand and change the methods to allow a new batch of discipline officers to take turns to serve every day; but the result still could not satisfy the desires of 80% of the other children, so they came to the office every day to trouble us until a week later when it subsided slightly. These were certainly troublesome things for us, but this enthusiastic spirit gave us immense comfort in our hearts.

After a week of investigation, these "little policemen" all faithfully performed their duties. There were no more disturbances, rushes, or noises on the escalators or by the sand-filtered water tank. At the same time, the most energetic performance was in the ten minutes before 3 p.m., when the school gate was not yet open. The discipline officers had already arranged the students' queues neatly according to the grade and height of the classes. Row after row, they waited in silence until the preparatory bell rang, and they filed through the school gate. This action was done without any teacher giving guidance or supervision. To passersby outside the door, it might first give him a deep impression.

In addition to memorial week and low- and intermediate-level games, there was one hour a week that was the students' own time, which was the weekly meeting. In this one hour, they had the opportunity to practice public speaking. Everyone eagerly grasped this opportunity when it was their turn to speak, and never let it go easily. Although, due to their level, they could only tell stories. But some stories have deeply moved me. From their remarks, I can see that they have vigorous vitality and firm and correct beliefs. This makes me firmly believe that we will definitely be able to gradually approach a bright future.

In order to further enhance their interest in public speaking, the school also held a school-wide speech contest, and each class selected representatives to participate. The results were certainly more exciting than the usual weekly meetings. In addition, there were also cleaning and order competitions, and calligraphy competitions. These winners all received the rewards they deserved. Therefore, in our school, everyone has developed a spirit of advancing, competing, and striving upwards, both in academics and extracurricular activities.

(6) Faculty Meeting

This afternoon was indeed memorable and evocative, that is, the faculty meeting on the afternoon of August 4. We felt that there was too little contact between the teachers and staff last semester. During class, everyone took a piece of chalk from the office and went to class. After class, everyone dropped the roll call sheet, patted the chalk dust, and turned away. There were few opportunities for teachers to meet, so naturally there was no talk of feelings. Therefore, sometimes some teachers were discouraged due to student stimulation or other reasons, and thus resigned. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the convocation of the full faculty meeting was indeed urgent.

This afternoon was spent in a tense, enthusiastic, harmonious, and joyful atmosphere. At three o'clock, everyone gathered around the long table made up of eight lab tables, and the chairman stood up to explain the purpose of today's meeting. After ten minutes, we began to discuss according to the scheduled order. The first thing was the issue of teacher absenteeism. Although this phenomenon was rare during the summer vacation, it gave us great difficulty last semester, or it will continue to bother us next semester! Therefore, it became one of the discussion issues. According to everyone's opinions, it was believed that it could be divided into two reasons. One was that the teachers did not recognize the difference between "obligation" and "responsibility." Many people thought that teaching at the people's school was a "unpaid" obligation, so it didn't matter if they missed a few classes, anyway, the school had no right to interfere, otherwise they would simply use resignation to blackmail the school. Therefore, our current top priority is to hold teacher training sessions, with the aim of discussing people's education issues, exchanging teaching experiences and insights, so that teachers have a correct understanding of people's education. The second reason is that, as mentioned earlier, there is no contact between teachers, no deep feelings, or teachers are sometimes stimulated by students and other reasons, such as putting on the airs of a teacher when they are in class, and disdaining to approach students after class, so that there is no emotion between teachers and students. Therefore, they are discouraged and feel that they have no interest in people's education. The remedy is to convene regular faculty meetings, on the one hand, to connect feelings, so as to encourage and urge each other, and on the other hand, to jointly discuss teaching affairs, so that the school affairs of the entire school are shared on everyone's shoulders, and the success or failure of the school is the responsibility of all teachers and staff.

The second thing was the problem of student absenteeism: at the beginning of the school year, the students were often full of talent, but by the time of the holidays, there were very few in the classroom. This was also a serious problem that was felt last semester. Our conclusion was this: the reasons due to the school itself are: (1) teacher absenteeism, which gives students a bad impression, which has been mentioned earlier, (2) the conflict between class time and factory work time, the solution is to prepare to restore the workers' night shift. As for the reasons on the student side are: (1) students have no perseverance, (2) parents are reluctant, many of which are due to feudal ideas, thinking that letting "little girls" run around in public and mix with boys is inappropriate and thus obstructing them, (3) economic problems, students cannot but give up studying and go to work to help the family due to family economic difficulties and rising prices. At the same time, the aforementioned school class time also has a great relationship, and the improved method is to strengthen family visits to help them solve difficulties and encourage students who have no perseverance.

The third thing was to discuss the progress of the school's affairs next semester and elect responsible personnel. As a result, five people were elected to form an enrollment committee to handle all the procedures before the start of school, so as to transfer it to the person in charge next semester.

During the discussion, everyone spoke eagerly, and the enthusiasm of the situation was only seen in all previous discussions. When one of the discussion items was about to be completed, everyone touched their stomachs and looked at the big bottle of Russian soda on the table suspiciously, wondering if they could drink it. But at this time, someone suddenly proposed to hold a basketball scrimmage on the playground before taking advantage of the thirst to solve these huge sodas. Undoubtedly, everyone responded in unison, immediately threw off their coats, formed three groups of four people each, and implemented a round-robin. Even those classmates who never participated in sports at ordinary times were happily chasing the basketball at this time. Hunchbacks, protruding bellies, tall and short, fat and thin, reflecting each other, "wonderful" postures emerged one after another, and laughter could not help but arise one after another. But everyone forgot why, and bravely and decisively fought calmly. It was not until everyone was exhausted and their bodies were bathed in sweat that they stopped. At this time, the clock had pointed to six o'clock. After eating soda, everyone dragged their tired bodies and excited and happy moods on the way home.

(7) Closing Ceremony

In a semester, it is often busier at the beginning and end of the semester, and the busy thing is the hands rather than the mouth. On the contrary, it is more leisure during the semester, and then the busy thing is the mouth rather than the hands, because the registration procedures must be handled at the beginning of the semester, and the admission examination papers must be reviewed, etc. At the end of the semester, you are busy changing the semester exam papers, filling out and issuing grade reports, returning deposits, registering new and old students, etc. Now that the semester is about to end, - August 19 - reports, returning deposits, registering old students, and semester exams are all waiting for us to carry out immediately, but this year, because we have increased the authority and responsibility of the class teacher in order to conform to the principle of "all teachers and staff are jointly responsible for school affairs," the academic and moral performance of students in each class and subject is the responsibility of the class teacher to collect from each teacher, and after the settlement is completed, it is handed over to the teaching affairs office. The teaching affairs office is only responsible for filling out and issuing reports, and the work is relatively much easier.

We planned to hold a closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 19th to end the summer vacation. That day was Monday, so we had a full day on Sunday to handle all kinds of preparatory work, handle prizes, prepare to issue deposits, and fill out reports.

Everything that happened at the opening ceremony six weeks ago is still very clearly presented in my mind, and today's closing ceremony is very similar to it. We are still holding it in the small laboratory and canteen-cum-auditorium, but the podium is piled with a lot of prizes, and more than a hundred children are staring at it with wide eyes and excitement. However, the mystery they urgently need to know - who can win - will not be revealed until the last fifteen minutes, after Director Chen finishes his speech and the teaching affairs office and the student affairs office report on school affairs. These prizes are divided into four types: "Learning Award," "Work Award," "Diligence Award," and "Character Award" which combines good character and academics. All those who serve in the discipline squad and the cleaning squad with excellent results will get the "Work Award"; those whose academic performance in the semester is ranked in the top three of the whole class will get the "Learning Award"; those who never miss class or are late in a semester will get the "Diligence Award"; those whose character and academic performance are all above A will be given the "Character Award". When they accepted the prizes with excitement and joy, the closing ceremony was over. Then, each grade returned to their classroom to issue report cards and deposits, but if the students of each grade continued to come to school next semester, they only needed to exchange for a new receipt, and the procedure for returning the deposit could be omitted. More than 70% of them were unwilling to take back the deposit, that is to say, more than 70% of the students will still come to school next semester, which is enough to make us excited.

Finally, we also led all the children to the Public Works Bureau Girls' High School to participate in the "Meilun, Xiude Elementary School, St. Mary's, Public Works Bureau Girls' High School, Changping Road Elementary School Five School Charity School Joint Speech Contest," which started at 4:30 p.m., as the most meaningful ending of this semester.

(8) A Meaningful Ending

"The 20th century is the century of children!"

"We want to be children of the new China!"

"We want to make compulsory Ning schools last forever!"

As soon as we walked into the Public Works Bureau Girls' High School gate, we could see that the solemn auditorium was covered with these slogans, many of which were naturally written by children, and others were written by small teachers. Entering the arched auditorium door, we could also find slogans posted on the stage. But the main things were two pictures, one read: "Children! Listen quietly!" Below were many children listening quietly; the other read: "Children! Sit and watch!" Below were pictures of sitting postures. What was even more interesting was the "Function of Public Education" posted on the left wall: In the upper left corner of the picture is an illiterate person with his eyes covered with cloth, who is led into the public school by an arrow, and after entering the classroom and listening to the lecture, he is led into the lower right corner by the last arrow. The illiterate has become a small teacher with two mustaches, teaching others in a very serious way. This picture is quite eye-catching. In short, the venue was full of a lively, joyful, and fresh atmosphere.

It was stipulated that it would start at 4:30, but because two schools were far away and the students were too young, it was not until they arrived that all the guests, small teachers, and children participating in the conference were gathered to take a group photo, and it was already 5:30. The chairman was a female student, and as soon as she took the stage, she briefly and quickly reported the theme of today's speech - the senior level focuses on ideological theory, the intermediate level focuses on morality, and the elementary level focuses on civic common sense, as well as the participating schools, the names and numbers of the contestants in each group, and then first invited Ms. × to give a speech. Her feelings about this meeting were: it is a very happy thing that the children in this area can hold a speech contest in such a stable and solemn environment. Therefore, I hope that you children can make use of this superior environment to learn more. The speech ended with a burst of warm applause.

Then began the elementary-level competition. The first to take the stage was an eight- or nine-year-old girl, who spoke very fluently. She told the story of a child whose sincere and unwavering determination resulted in her mother's dangerous illness being cured. Her graceful, experienced, and composed posture made it unbelievable that she was the lowest grade student in the school.

Each group of elementary, middle, and high levels sent one representative from each school to participate, so there were a total of five people in each group. After each group finished speaking, the four judges immediately reported the results. When the judges were calculating the scores each time, the children from each school took turns performing, and what they performed were choruses of their most proficient songs. When these hundreds of small mouths burst out with loud and neat songs at the same time, the guests in the audience were deeply moved by the majestic singing.

Taking advantage of the break, I had the opportunity to make a more careful observation and comparison of the children of each school. Among the five schools, Xiude and Meilun had the most students, both with more than 120 people. Among them, the children of Changping Road Elementary School were the most interesting. They were all the children of Jiangsu and Zhejiang scavengers in uniform blue cloth shirts and pants, barefoot, and bald-headed. They could not get rid of the local accent when speaking, and their actions were more lively than the children of other schools.

The topics of the senior speakers were all about theory and current events in the central government. From their simple speeches, we can get encouragement and feel that the bright future is definitely not far away. In particular, the last speaker's "The Meaning of Public Education" really made us admire them.

When the judges reported the rankings of the speakers in the last group - the senior group - and issued the prizes, the chairman happily touched the cleared table and announced the end of the meeting, and the sirens of the factories around had told us that it was seven o'clock.

After stepping out of the gate with a reluctant, melancholic, and excited mood, I reluctantly looked at the lively and jumping backs and secretly blessed them.

(9) Epilogue

The semester has ended, and we are handling the work of recruiting new students, as well as sorting out school equipment and preparing for handover. However, that group of active and lively backs are still lingering in my mind, and I seem to hear them shouting in my ears: "Mr. Guo! See you tomorrow!", "...". I feel that during this summer vacation, whether it is my feelings for them or their feelings for me, they are extremely warm and harmonious. I don't remember and pay attention to when it started, and I don't know who taught them. When they are carrying their small schoolbags home in the twilight, if they see me, they will always shout: "See you tomorrow." When they are free after class, they often drag my hem, asking to play with them, and even many who have never attended my class, and I don't know their names, but they treat me so affectionately, but this is not limited to a certain teacher, as long as he is a teacher who is not perfunctory, does not often miss class, and often contacts them, he can always get the same treatment. Sometimes, I feel that when some words are told to them by us, they are very happy to listen to them. On the contrary, sometimes the same words are spoken by their parents, but they are regarded as wind in their ears. This is probably due to respecting their freedom and the result of a group life with rewards and punishments. In short, I think the reason why they are like this is because the family has failed to satisfy them. Their parents either work day and night and lack contact with them, or they have no knowledge, alcoholism, gambling, and arbitrarily beat and scold them; so there is no emotion between flesh and blood. The children can only entrust their love to the teachers, so I feel that living, learning, and guiding them in such a group will not make a teacher feel extremely discouraged and say: "I will never teach in a public school again, I never want to see them again!"

I only want to live forever in this harmonious group full of naivety, honesty, and love. I want to learn from them and guide them at the same time. This is my only wish.

### Record of the Tengchong Hydropower Survey – Continued from Page Eighteen

Reaching the mountain top, at an elevation of 1,500 meters, we boarded sedan chairs, carried by porters down the mountain. At that time, the morning mist in the mountains was thick, the shadows of the trees were blurred, the clouds and mountains were ethereal, the fields were quiet, and all the ridges were silent. Sitting idly in the sedan chairs, we only heard the porters' feet stepping on the mud and sand, making rustling sounds, their steps neat and rhythmic, which was quite intriguing. At 9:20 AM, we arrived at Machang. Upon inquiring, we learned it was called Wenxiangdao, with only a few houses, appearing like a small village. The porters asked for a break, so we got out of the sedan chairs. It happened that someone was holding a funeral, and the villagers were gathered in one place. The bereaved family set up tables along the road to treat guests. As we were resting in a teahouse, the bereaved son also came to invite us to the banquet. After several polite refusals, we were excused. We set off again at 10:00 AM. The mountain gradually entered a wild area, where people walked among the trees, with winding vines and disordered weeds. At 11:00 AM, we rested beside a canyon with a sheer rock wall and rushing water. Looking down thousands of feet, it was frightening. We started off again, descending along the valley bank. Due to the steep slope, the road was built in terraces. After walking for half an eternity, the view at the bottom of the valley gradually widened. I took out binoculars to observe the structure of the riverbed and the speed of the water flow, and every detail was clearly visible. The riverbed, like the mountain road, naturally formed terraces. At each step down, the water accumulated to form a pond. The river water flowed down the steps, changing color three times. When it flowed over the stone steps, it appeared yellow because the water was clear and the stones were yellow. When it fell from the stone steps, it became white as a waterfall due to the rapid flow. Then, it was stored at the bottom of the pond, and because the water was deeper, it presented a jade color! Emerging from here and walking on the steps again, it regained the yellow color. Such color cycles, combined with the changing water patterns, created a spectacular scene, which we enjoyed immensely. After another half hour of walking, the valley opened up, and the Gaoligong Mountains were visible in the distance. At 12:15 PM, we crossed the Yihui Bridge and descended along the right side of the valley. The mountain on the left gradually became flat, with green peaks and lush grass. At 11:30 AM, as the weather became hotter, we rested under a large yellow oak tree by the roadside. The tree was very large, with thick branches and leaves, and the trunk was covered with fruit, shaped like crabapples. Leaning against the tree, we looked out at the Lujiang River, a ribbon of water. At 1:00 PM, we set off again, descending rapidly along the road. Soon we reached the riverbank. The river was 200 meters wide, and large bridge piers were built in the center, with two iron cable bridges connecting the two banks. The eastern one was called Huiren Bridge, and its name was engraved on the stone wall of the riverbank. The western bank was called Lujiang Bridge, with a plaque inscribed "Hushui" by former Premier Li Genyuan. The two bridges were renovated by the Tengchong Chamber of Commerce, spanning the river with majesty and grandeur. The river water was gray and flowed rapidly. Nearby, there was a Zhuge Liang monument, but due to our hasty passage, we were unable to visit its ruins, which was a great pity.

Crossing the bridge, there was a small town, Lujiang Town, under the jurisdiction of the Lujiang Tusi (local chieftain). When we arrived, it happened to be market day, and local people from nearby gathered here for trade, many of whom were Baiyi and Lisu people. The Baiyi were very similar to the Yue people, with long clothes and black teeth. The women wore blue cloth wrapped around their heads to form tall hats, which were strangely shaped. I had heard people say that Baiyi girls were very beautiful (Figure 7), with bright eyes and white teeth, charming and lovely, dressed in white and blue skirts, which added to their beauty. Therefore, the locals had a saying: "Baiyi girls are beautiful, truly beautiful; Han girls are beautiful with makeup." However, according to Baiyi customs, once a girl gets married, she starts chewing betel nut with grass tobacco, which stains her teeth black and no longer protects her natural beauty. Therefore, the locals also have a saying: "Young, they look like Guanyin; old, they look like monkeys." On this day, we mostly encountered women, and the beauty of the so-called Baiyi girls was never seen. The Lisu were also a type of Yi people, with headscarves and bare feet, adorned with silver rings and clam shells. They liked to wear blue clothes with very narrow trousers. When they saw us passing by, they stared at us and whispered to each other. We originally regarded them as exotic, but who knew that they also regarded us as objects of their appreciation!

Lujiang is only 700 meters above sea level, more than 700 meters lower than Pubiao. Therefore, the climate is extremely hot. All of our companions were sweating profusely. Merchants traveling through here generally avoid eating too much, so we only ate a few biscuits for lunch. The locals also told us that there was often miasma on the 300-li road from Baoshan to Tengchong. Upon investigation, the reason may be that the temperature fluctuates too much between day and night. Outsiders are unaware and easily catch colds. It is not really a so-called miasma.

We left Lujiang at 3:00 PM and began climbing the Gaoligong Mountains. The mountain road wound through vines, with vegetation on both sides towering over our heads. From the thickets, we could hear the sound of spring water. At about 4:00 PM, we saw the Manle River, a canyon thousands of feet deep, winding down from the mountains. The river had many shoals and rapid currents, and the water hit the rocks, making a sound like thousands of horses galloping, which was frightening. We walked along the left side of the river. At 5:00 PM, we crossed the Jiyi Bridge and climbed hundreds of feet up a mountain, reaching a peak. The Manle River was already at our feet, and the Jiyi Bridge was so small that it could no longer be seen. At that time, a crescent moon was already hanging in the sky, the sky was clear as if washed, and there was not a single cloud. With a long whistle, the mountains echoed.

From here, we went down a small valley and climbed up again. The forest in the mountains was denser, with tangled roots intertwined. Even trees as big as bowls were entangled with each other, forming a twisted shape. The mountain road faced the canyon and backed against the mountain, making it extremely dangerous. The canyon was thousands of feet deep, with sheer rock walls and strange trees growing on the cliffs. Suspended springs and waterfalls flowed between them. We often heard the long howls of apes and the low chirps of autumn insects, which were especially poignant. There was a lot of bamboo in the valley, growing in clusters from the bottom of the valley. The trunks were slender and long, and many branches and leaves drooped, forming an arch shape. Two trees faced each other, forming arch bridges, which were green and lovely. People in the mountains wove bamboo into huts to live in. Others broke bamboo into pipes, extending for miles, to draw mountain spring water into their homes. Walking and walking, we finally reached Laozhai, our lodging station, at 6:30 PM. The village was on the mountainside, at an altitude of 1,490 feet. From Lujiang to here, we had climbed a total of more than 700 meters. The difficulty of climbing can be imagined. The owner of the inn where we stayed was surnamed Cun. He said that his ancestor, Cun Dajin, had used all his family property to renovate the Gaoligong Mountain road. After a year of hard work, he personally supervised the workers, opening the road on one side and providing tea on the other. He leveled steep slopes and widened narrow roads, finally achieving his goal and benefiting later generations. His spirit of public service and selflessness is truly admirable. I saw a spring couplet pasted on his door, which read: "For hundreds of years, the road was rugged; now it is smooth. For thousands of miles, merchants travel; now they arrive safely." This can truly be said to be worthy of the praise. That day, we traveled 90 li in the mountains. Because we were too tired, we went to bed early.

Terraced Fields Surround the Basin – Horns of the Olive Village

On the morning of the tenth day, we got up at 6:00 AM. After breakfast, we each paid a yuan and fifty cents for meals and lodging. At 8:00 AM, we set off and continued climbing. The mountain stones were mostly sedimentary rocks, weathered over the years, with extremely loose and brittle texture. When we tapped them with our canes, they peeled off like snowflakes. There was a lot of sand on the road, with glittering mica, indicating that it was formed by the weathering of the mountain rocks. At 10:00 AM, we reached an altitude of 2,200 meters and encountered light rain, which stopped after a while. After being bathed in the rain, the trees were even more supple and lush, with a deep green color that seemed to drip. Climbing up and looking at the mountains to the northwest, they were all deeply hidden in the thick fog and could no longer be seen. Then, the sunlight came out from the clouds. Looking back at the valley, the water vapor slowly rose from below. The sunlight illuminated it, reflecting it into white clouds, which stretched for hundreds of miles. The peaks were hidden among them, floating like small islands on the sea. I had heard of the sea of clouds in Mount Emei for a long time and longed to see it, but I had no chance. I never thought that I would be able to see this scene on the top of the Gaoligong Mountains, which was enough to satisfy my eyes and satiate my travel aspirations!

At 11:00 AM, we reached Pinghe Village, which was the top of the Gaoligong Mountains, at an altitude of 2,310 meters. We had lunch at a small shop by the roadside. There were four dishes, all potatoes, but prepared in different ways, with different colors and flavors. They were crisp and delicious, and we all praised the owner's ingenuity. After lunch, we went down the mountain. The slopes were steep and there were many gullies, and the mud was muddy after the rain, making it extremely difficult to walk. Unfortunately, we were attacked by a shower in the middle of the road. For a moment, the rain filled the sky, and the mountain trees were hidden. It was extremely cold, and I sat withered in the sedan chair, my hands numb. At 3:00 PM, the mountain gradually opened up, the clouds and fog were swept away, and we saw a basin-shaped depression in front of us, with small villages scattered on the mountainsides and terraced fields surrounding them in a neat and green manner. The scenery was excellent. Looking into the distance, the Longjiang River appeared and disappeared. After going down the mountain, we passed a stone-paved road, which was flat and clean. Walking on it, we walked lightly. Before 5:00 PM, we reached the Longjiang River by the river, also known as Longchuan River, which wound its way from the north. The river was narrow, and the flow was only one-third of that of the Lujiang River. However, the altitude was 600 meters higher than that of the Lujiang River, so the current was very fast, and the waves were surging. The river water flowed straight down, with a force of a thousand miles. We rested at the tax office for half an hour before crossing the bridge and climbing up a hill for another ten li, reaching Ganlan Village and resting there, at 5:40 PM.

Ganlan Village belongs to Tengchong County. It is built on the mountainside, with many houses, somewhat similar in style to Pubiao, but not as clean as Pubiao. As we were resting in the inn, we suddenly heard a loud horn outside the village, resounding through the air. Looking out the door, we saw a team of farmers in straw raincoats and hats, lined up from the fields. One person led the way with a large triangular red flag, with the words "Ganlan Village Cultivation Banner" written on it. The innkeeper told us that they were returning from plowing in the fields. Because the area is 1,530 meters above sea level, with high terrain, backing against the mountains and facing the river, the climate is cold. Therefore, the rice seedlings are planted later. It was already the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and the rice seedlings were only about a foot tall!

Heavy Rain Overwhelms the Mountains – Arriving at the Destination, Tengchong

We departed at 8:00 AM on the morning of the eleventh day, still climbing the mountain along the stone path. At that time, the morning mist was heavy, and all the peaks were hidden. The air was full of water vapor, and we could not sweat. After climbing for half an hour, we felt hot all over. At 9:00 AM, there was light rain, and we encountered a muddy road, which was slippery and difficult to walk on. We rested for a few miles at an altitude of 2,000 meters. After half an hour, we set off again and climbed another 300 meters. At 10:30 AM, we reached the newly built highway by the people of Tengyue. The road ran along the mountainside to the west, and was wide enough for four cars. The soil was mostly sandy, which was likely formed by the weathering of rocks, which was very beneficial for road construction. However, when we passed by, it happened to be the busy farming season and the rainy season, so work had been temporarily suspended. Along the way for ten li, we did not see a single person. At 11:30 AM, we re-entered the small road. From here, the road was even more slippery and the mud was deeper. Watching the sedan chair carriers stumble in the mud, it was even more difficult. The weather was not good, and before noon, a heavy rain suddenly fell, overwhelming the mountains, with the force of thunder and lightning. The sedan chair carriers had no choice but to

Venture to travel in haste. Fortunately, in just a few minutes, we arrived at Qincaitang, but our clothes were already soaked through. We took shelter from the rain at a small shop by the roadside. We waited in the shop for two hours before the rain weakened slightly, but the mud and water on the road had accumulated to a foot deep, overflowing into a small river. After the water receded, another half hour passed, and we finally set off again. From here, we went down the mountain alongside it. Because of the mud after the rain, the sedan chair carriers fell into the mud several times, and the difficulty of traveling was hard to describe. But soon the mountain gradually became flat, and the sky gradually cleared. At 4:00 PM, we crossed another slope and saw the Tengyue Prairie in the valley below! The sedan chair carriers showed me the direction of the county town. I took out my binoculars and saw the battlements faintly visible among the clouds and trees. As we got closer, the shops in the villages gradually came into view. The sedan chair carriers pointed to the white buildings on the outskirts of the city, telling me that one was the customs office and the other was the town government, in great detail. At 4:30 PM, we passed Nijiapu, turned right for a hundred steps, and then turned left across a long embankment. We saw a pailou (archway), magnificent and resplendent. The sedan chair carriers told me that this was the Jieguan Pavilion, five li from the city, where officials were greeted and sent off in the past. As we were admiring it, a gentleman suddenly approached the sedan chair and introduced himself as the secretary of the county chamber of commerce. He said that he had been sent by Chairman Xie to welcome us. Upon hearing this, we hurriedly got out of the sedan chairs and followed him into the city on foot, arriving at the county chamber of commerce on Wubao Street to rest. In total, the journey from Kunming to Tengchong was more than 1,500 li, and it finally came to an end.

That evening, Chairman Xie Shinan hosted a banquet to welcome us, and invited people from all walks of life to accompany us. We were all of school age and had little experience of the world. We were a little overwhelmed by such a warm welcome. During the banquet, we discussed the construction of the hydropower plant. Everyone present hoped that the hydropower plant could be established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for the industrial development of the border town. I thought that if the construction of a local public welfare project could get such "harmony" among the people, the future would be very promising.

Surveying the Dieshuihe Waterfall – Completing the Survey Work

The next day, at 2:00 PM, we were led by the chamber of commerce's Secretary Li to survey the area near the Dieshuihe Waterfall. The Dieshuihe River is one li southwest of the county town. Its water comes from the mountains of Chituoluo and forms the Daying River. It flows through Nandian, south through Qianya, out of the pass and merges with the Manmo River, entering the Nanda Jinsha River, and finally entering the sea along Ava City. The rock walls at the waterfall are steep, with a vertical drop of more than a hundred feet. Huge stones stand on the top of the cliff like a door. The river flows here, rushing and galloping, and then falls from the air, like scattered snowflakes, cotton wadding, beaded curtains, flying jade flowers, spraying clouds and spitting foam, splashing on people's clothes. The locals call it "Jiuyu Buqing" (long rain that doesn't clear up). Leaning against the cliff is an old tree, thousands of years old. Its roots have no soil, and its color is like bronze and ancient iron, covered with fallen clothes, mottled and scaly. It twists and turns out of the cracks in the stone. The old trunk lies prostrate, like a dragon raising its head, more than seven feet high and more than ten feet in circumference. There is a huge stone, eight feet wide, three feet high, and five feet wide in the middle, shaped like a giant turtle. Its head is embedded in the old tree for a foot, only revealing its neck. The body and the tree are integrated. The old trunk splits into four branches, stretching into the air, with delicate leaves in strange shapes, standing tall on the cliff, looking down at the deep pool. The torrent roars, shaking the valley, but it stands for thousands of years without being swept away by the waves, because it is intertwined with this turtle stone. Slightly above, there is the Taiji Bridge, spanning the top of the waterfall. The mountains and rivers are magnificent. On the right bank, the mountains are undulating, with a strange peak rising abruptly. On the top of the peak is a flying pavilion, facing the waterfall, called Longguangtai. Green cliffs and green rocks surround it, with beautiful trees and fragrant grass. On the left bank, green walls stand steeply and pour down. There is a peak like a wing. The ruins of the Baiyi Pavilion are there, facing the Pílu Temple stupa. The scenery of the tower and the mountains, the flowing clouds and drifting snow, shine together. The scenery is extremely beautiful. The water flows down from the bottom of the waterfall, and the slope is still very steep. There are many scattered rocks in the river, and the rapids create waves, surging and rushing. It is not until 700 meters downstream that the water surface begins to calm down slightly. The area near the waterfall is rich in hydropower, which is truly magnificent, showing that the beauty of the mountains and rivers is everywhere. It is only because this waterfall is in a remote place that it has not been noticed by the world. This time, the Yunnan Provincial Economic Committee has allocated a large amount of money to build a hydropower plant here, which is truly visionary. The border industry will gradually develop because of the establishment of this plant, and the vast river will be greatly utilized, and it will no longer be day and night to cry out in vain!

Our survey work began on the thirteenth day and lasted for more than twenty days. The topographic survey took six days, the longitudinal profile measurement of the river took one day, the water depth measurement of the dam site upstream and downstream took two days, the installation of water gauges and flow measurement took three days, the measurement of the power transmission lines from the four villages to the county town took seven days, the curved road alignment measurement took one day, and the calculation and drawing took seven days. As of now, most of the work that should be done has been completed, and the school's opening date is also approaching. For the sake of not delaying the students' studies, we hurried back to Kunming. In summary, since this three-month summer vacation, we have either traveled to the top of the mountains or worked by the flowing water. We have been close to nature, and we feel that our knowledge has increased greatly and our bodies have become stronger. It is more beneficial than spending the holidays at home doing nothing! Now that the holidays are coming to an end and the new semester is approaching, I will recount what I remember, writing under the lamp, just to leave a souvenir for the future. (End)

### Baiyi Girl

(Figure Seven) The Baiyi girl has a beautiful appearance, with bright eyes and white teeth, charming and lovely. She is dressed in white and blue skirts, which adds to her charm. The locals have a saying: "Baiyi girls are beautiful, truly beautiful; Han girls are beautiful with makeup."

### Welcoming National Day

— Ruolin

Together we wield our halberds, drawing a cross, then drawing another cross! We sacredly advance, treading the blood of our fallen martyrs!

History and our lessons are truly great. "Glorify our ancestors and revitalize the Han people." As we arrive at the 29th National Day, how should we commemorate, reminisce, inspire, and exert ourselves?

Let us reflect on the past: After 1840, we fell into a semi-colonial state. The feudal Qing government also once wanted to strengthen itself, hastily attempting to establish military industries. However, because it lacked a general industrial and economic foundation, it failed miserably. Similarly, because of the corruption of the feudal political institutions, the people not only suffered from foreign oppression but also endured internal exploitation. They rose up to resist several times, but the Qing government, fearing their great power, resorted to the most cruel means of suppression. Under the slogan of "宁赠友邦，毋与家奴" (better to give to foreign friends than to our own slaves), it acted against the tide. It surrendered to foreign powers and became increasingly licentious and shameless.

The masses could no longer endure it. At the same time, revolutionary leaders like Sun Yat-sen keenly realized that only by overthrowing the Qing dynasty and changing the political institutions could China be saved from its decline. They armed the people and, with great sacrifice, launched the Xinhai Revolution, finally overthrowing the feudal government and creating a new China.

This gave foreign powers a new understanding. In addition, they needed to change their tactics, combining both soft and hard approaches. Because of its inherent limitations, the Xinhai Revolution failed to completely eliminate the feudal remnants. Later, Yuan Shikai betrayed the revolution, hindering the success of the Second Revolution. However, Yuan's attempt to become emperor quickly ended. Subsequently, the resurrection of warlords with queues was only a fleeting flash in the pan, and they were all extinguished. But the warlord wars—the Zhili-Anhui War, the Zhili-Fengtian War, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, etc.—ultimately prevented China from unifying, and the country became entangled in civil war, allowing it to be "slaughtered" to the fullest extent. The journey from the May Fourth Movement to the May Thirtieth Movement was painful and difficult, but the successful Northern Expedition laid the foundation for the unification of the Chinese nation. No matter how they bombed with cannons, tied with economic restraints, or cunningly seized and plundered, or sowed discord, the Chinese nation was always advancing towards the path of national liberation.

We are currently in the midst of an even greater national revolution. Historically, this is a truly great moment.

The Chinese nation is emitting extreme brilliance in the darkness of the world, and she will enrich the pages of history. Now is not a repetition of the European Middle Ages (although some people are overly worried). History will never regress. China will fearlessly lead the world in the fight for justice. Those who are righteous will have much help, but everyone must rise up in order to help. Reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road is to save the world from destruction.

At this time and in this place, as we celebrate this great holiday, everyone should introspectively examine themselves. A group of licentious and shameless people who live in daydreams will be smashed down by the heavy hammer. Those who obsess over their own private interests, disregarding the entire nation, whether big bugs or small germs (such as tuanmi [speculative rice trading] and other speculators), will be eliminated before the arrival of the light.

### How to Cure "Boredom Disease"

— Naimin

Today, "boredom" has become a "popular disease" on this isolated island. It casts a shadow over everyone's hearts. It is a spiritual shackle that tightly binds people's minds in a narrow circle of thought, turning lively people into sluggish ones, slowing down the progress of heroes with great ambitions, and turning optimists into prisoners of "pessimism."

As a result, bad consequences arise. The lighter cases create a common "spirit of languor," while the more serious cases result in the "suicide boom" prevalent on the island. Both lead to the grave in a passive way, but the former is more chronic and the latter more acute.

However, "when soldiers come, generals will resist; when water comes, earth will dam." Any sudden or violent illness, as long as it is treated properly, is not without a cure. Although the methods of treating "boredom disease" used by enlightened people throughout history, both Chinese and foreign, have their own subtleties, their fundamentals are the same: work. Boredom that comes from work is of course not difficult to cure with work. Even pain that comes from "career" or "love" can be relieved by work, because at that time you have found a more noble and sacred path. The minor gains and losses of the past are, of course, irrelevant.

Thomas Edison, the world-renowned inventor, once said: "When it comes to curing boredom, work is more effective than whiskey."

Leo Tolstoy once said: "People's happiness is contained in life, and life is work."

Thomas Carlyle, the famous English novelist, also said: "Work is the best cure; it can heal any pain and misfortune on people's heads."

Friends trapped in boredom, stop wandering in the atmosphere of trouble! Quickly invigorate your spirits and take up work! Only work can save you from boredom! Only work can make you a stronger and more noble self.

### The Homecoming of a Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Nine: Astonishing News

Yu Gantang seemed to have been electrocuted, suddenly raising his head and looking at Huo Sang with astonished eyes. "What? He lent me a blank pistol? A pistol without bullets? — Mr. Huo, is that true? How do you know?" His voice was full of suspicion. Huo Sang slowly nodded, answering: ...Yes. It's true, but you didn't know it. Your friend Song Zhaoqi has told me everything. He really has quick wit, and what he said is true. That pistol, I just saw it at the police station, and the chamber is indeed completely empty. But at the time, you were intent on causing trouble for Zhao Boxiong, your whole body was controlled by mad emotions, you took the gun and left, and naturally didn't think to check the chamber." Yu Gantang, as if awakened, said: "So that's how it is! I really didn't think Zhaoqi would play this trick. He really is a—"

Huo Sang hurriedly interjected: "Really a loyal good friend, aiming to save you. Right? You should understand now."

Yu Gantang lowered his head, his two hands clasped tightly together. "Yes, yes, he meant well, wanting to pull me out of the mire. But—but at the time, I really didn't think he would do this."

Huo Sang said: "If you had known this trick at the time, maybe you would have fought him? Haha... Okay, I already know about your actions afterward. You took the pistol and rushed to 774 Yadong to find Zhao Boxiong; when you couldn't find him, you returned to Song Zhaoqi's home. Zhaoqi is a young man with insight and understanding of advantages and disadvantages. He repeatedly advised you, telling you that this matter was not worth risking, but you were still stubborn. Later, you took the empty gun again, wanting to find Zhao Boxiong, but you were caught by Detective Ni at the entrance of Changming Lane. Right?"

Yu Gantang nodded repeatedly, saying: "Yes, Mr. Huo, now you can finally believe me, I didn't kill Wang Lilan."

### Laughing to Our Hearts' Content

— Xu Yi

In other words, have we ever deceived the nation? Do we have the right to enjoy today's laughter?

Let me tell those who suffer from heart disease, "When you see the blue-white flag covering the sky, do you tremble and cannot stand? If that is true, then your illness may still be cured. — Starting today, when the sunlight shines red on the ground, use your own hands to wipe away the black spots in your heart and remove the poisonous sores in your lungs!

Listen, the laughter of the masses! That laughter shakes the entire universe, and the whole world is looking forward to the arrival of a more worthy anniversary of laughter!
