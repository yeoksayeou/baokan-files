### Serious Situation Brewing in Macau; Japanese Make Demands to Portuguese Authorities; Portuguese Troops to Withdraw from Two Islands; Closure of Chinese Customs

Hong Kong: It is reported that a serious situation is currently brewing in Macau. The Japanese troops who recently invaded the Zhongshan Peninsula are now deploying troops on the Macau border and have made several "demands" to the Portuguese authorities in Macau, including: (1) The Portuguese withdraw from Ladau and Wanji Islands (transliteration), which were previously disputed between China and Portugal; (2) Recognition of the "government" established by the Japanese in the Zhongshan District; (3) Macau and the surrounding area accept Japanese military currency; (4) The right to search houses for so-called anti-Japanese elements; (5) Closure of the Chinese Customs in Macau.

However, travelers arriving here from Macau said that there was recently a "sign of Japanese invasion of Macau." Armed Japanese soldiers are often seen gambling at gambling tables and ordering expensive dishes in taverns, gorging themselves but not paying, and the police are helpless. (Reuter's 30th dispatch)

### Extremely Severe Disaster Situation in Hebei Province; Urgent Need for Relief from All Sides; Three Million Disaster Victims in Southern Hebei; Representatives Request Meeting with Relief Committee Authorities in Chongqing

Chongqing: Telegrams from Hebei Province have continuously reported that the disaster situation has reached its most severe stage. Yesterday, this reporter specially visited a certain gentleman, a representative of the disaster victims from Hebei who had just arrived in Chongqing to seek relief, to inquire about the recent situation in the area. According to him, the disaster situation in Hebei is tragic, even worse than recently reported by telegrams. In the southern Hebei area alone, there are three million disaster victims, with property losses estimated at 100 million yuan. Currently, food supplies have been exhausted. Fights often break out in the fields over the digging of bitter herbs, and some people are eating wheat straw mixed with red clay. After eating it, their skin turns yellow, and then their whole body swells up. As for the deaths, those who have died along the way when we came could be seen everywhere, and the abandoned babies on the roadside were hoarse. The tragic scene could not be described in words. Recently, it is the spring famine, and there are no seeds. Spring plowing cannot be carried out, and the future is worrying. After we came to the rear, we learned that the Central Government cares about the people in Hebei who have suffered a disaster, and has allocated 1.5 million yuan in relief funds, to give a little. In addition to urging that it be released as soon as possible, we also appealed to people from all walks of life to expand relief. A few days ago, we visited Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee to present a banner and pay our respects, and reported on the disaster situation, earnestly requesting relief. At the same time, we visited the responsible authorities of the North China Flood Relief Emergency Relief Society and the Hebei Refugee Youth Relief Society to request assistance. The results were very satisfactory. (30th dispatch)

Editorial

### No Freedom, No Peace!

Sounds rumble, light flashes, intermittent. Suddenly bright and dark; when the wind rises, only dots and lines of white plus fire are seen, floating, scattered; in an instant, all things vanish, all sounds are silent. This kind of night scene suddenly appeared on the Huangpu River last night, a flashback, in the eyes and minds of the people of the city, everyone can't help but have different feelings!

Since Japan launched its military aggression in 1931, it has been the tenth year; China has been engaged in all-out resistance since 1937, and it has been the fourth year in thirty-four months; during this period, as far as we can remember, the Japanese have set off fireworks in Shanghai. Last night seemed to be the second time. The first time was at the end of October 1938, when the Japanese army occupied Hankou, so they forgot themselves and celebrated. Originally, the Japanese side fully believed that it would be a quick victory, and that by attacking Nanjing, they would be able to make an alliance under the city; what it encouraged its army and people to do was to take Nanjing as the standard, so it promised a single great wish. Unexpectedly, China held it back. The Japanese side therefore no longer made a second wish, and fully believed that by attacking Hankou, they would be able to control China's lifeblood and coerce China into submission, and they would be able to jump out of the quagmire and end this situation; although they only knew China's determination to resist and realized China's strong resistance afterwards, when they first occupied Hankou, they mistakenly thought they had already won and could return in triumph. The extravagance of breaking the wallet and setting off fireworks at that time, when recalled now, is no different from a spring dream; however, the excitement and joy at that time were far beyond what could be achieved last night.

The fireworks last night probably only made the city people feel a flashback! In Japan, relatively enlightened people have recently been able to openly judge that the inadequacy of the changed government in Nanjing is insufficient to end the so-called "China Incident." The long delay of the Japanese "special envoy" shows that the Japanese authorities have entered a semi-conscious state from a state of infatuation. Yesterday, the Millard Review reported a conversation after an American reporter's short trip to Nanjing; saying that during a banquet, a Japanese officer also thought that "there are still many things going on," revealing a pessimistic and decadent mood; and the Japanese guards encountered on the Shanghai train also said, "This matter is very distant and difficult to achieve results." In short, the Japanese generals, soldiers, and people are now definitely not as happy as when they first occupied Hankou a year and a half ago, due to misjudgment. The Japanese generals, soldiers, and people at least have their remaining consciousness, and still maintain their ability to understand and judge; even if they anesthetize themselves, they are close to being insane, they will not be completely out of control and happily set off any fireworks; the fireworks last night were just a helpless embellishment.

Cursing is useless, ridicule is useless, but these are not curses or ridicules, but honest words. Honestly speaking, Japan's launching of military aggression was a big mistake from the beginning. As their plans ran out and their strength exhausted, they became more and more exhausted and ingenious, so that all their plans were in vain and useless; they wasted their efforts, did hopeless things, and took a dead end; it was both boring and ineffective. Pretending to be excited and setting off fireworks, although it is a trivial matter and has nothing to do with the big picture, it is still watched by everyone, and they can see him slapping himself in the face to pretend to be a fat man. Because now, no one wants to say for sure whether this scene is the result of Jingwei being tricked by the Japanese, or the Japanese being tricked by Jingwei? But everyone is certain that this scene is not conducive to solving the Sino-Japanese problem. The Japanese and Jingwei flaunt peace, but the Japanese hold a bloody knife in their hand, and Wang Jingwei is naked without a knife. Under this situation, the "God of Peace" can only enjoy the fireworks from afar and protect himself wisely, how could he be willing to be taken as a prisoner and be appreciated by them; therefore, everyone is sure that peace is hopeless. The Japanese and Wang flaunt this way, but hope is so hopeless, then what are the fireworks celebrating?

This is not the "God of Peace" deliberately playing tricks, nor is it that the "God of Peace" is cold to the Japanese and Wang; on the contrary, the "God of Peace" must be willing to illuminate both China and Japan equally, and the Chinese people are also willing to welcome the God of Peace. This is what the Japanese deeply know, so they use this to flaunt and appeal. But alas, the Japanese only know one thing, but not the other. You must know that if the Chinese disregard everything and only want peace, then to be honest, they would not have resisted from the beginning. If China's goal of resistance has not been achieved, and they only want peace, then to be honest, they can obtain peace from Japan at any time without waiting for Jingwei to take the stage. Jingwei advocates peace, he thinks that war must end with peace; but he does not know that war is to fight for the purpose of war, not to fight for the purpose of peace; if the purpose of war cannot be achieved one day, then the argument for peace cannot be established one day. He thinks that the Chinese are happy to worship the "God of Peace", he does not know that the "God of Peace" is only a secondary god, he does not know that the main god worshipped by the Chinese is the "God of Freedom." You must know that if the main god has not arrived, how can the auxiliary gods have a seat; you must know that without freedom, there is no peace!

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Notes to Foreign Envoys; Solemnly Declaring China's Position; Any Actions by Illegal Organizations Are Completely Invalid; Chinese Government and People Will Always Resist Japanese Aggression

Chongqing: The puppet organization was formally established in Nanjing this morning. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent notes to the envoys of various countries in China, with English translations attached, solemnly declaring China's position. At the same time, it has instructed Chinese envoys stationed abroad to deliver the same notes to the governments of various countries. The original text of the note is as follows: Since Japan's aggression against China, it has not only used various methods to achieve its goal of conquering and controlling Asia and the Pacific. The indiscriminate bombing from the air has caused countless civilian casualties and property destruction. All these and other barbaric acts have strengthened the Chinese people's will to resist violence and to uphold human rights and justice. The Chinese resistance war is approaching three years, and the Japanese warlords have been driven to the brink of desperation and have set up a puppet organization in Nanjing, claiming to be the "National Government of the Republic of China." This organization is purely a puppet manufactured and controlled by the Japanese warlords. Japan obviously intends to use this organization as a tool to seize China's sovereignty, destroy its independence and territorial and administrative integrity, and thereby overturn international laws and order, destroy the Nine-Power Treaty, and eliminate all commercial and interests of third countries in China. The Chinese Government hereby wishes to reaffirm the statements it has repeatedly issued with the utmost solemnity, namely that any illegal organization, such as the one now established in Nanjing, or any other puppet organization existing in other parts of China, is, of course, completely invalid. The Chinese Government and people will absolutely not recognize it. The Chinese Government is deeply convinced that the self-respecting countries of the world will be able to uphold the laws and justice of the international community, and will not grant legal or de facto recognition to any Japanese puppet organization in China. Any act involving any form of recognition is in violation of international law and treaties, and should be regarded as the most unfriendly act towards the Chinese nation, and the recognizer shall be fully responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. The Chinese Government and people, no matter what methods Japan adopts in China, will always resolutely resist Japanese aggression, until the Japanese army is completely driven out of China and justice prevails over might.

### Monthly Aircraft Production in Britain and France Exceeds Germany

New York: Wright, Vice President of Curtis-Wright Aircraft Company, wrote an article published in "Aviation Magazine," stating that around January of this year, the monthly aircraft production in Britain and France had exceeded that of Germany, but in terms of the total number of aircraft owned by each country, the Allied countries would not be able to catch up with Germany until June or July of next year. (Reuter's 30th dispatch)

Washington: Today, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here announced that the embassy had not received any official documents from the Jingwei "government," and even if it did receive any, it would ignore them. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the officials of the Chinese Embassy here will all remain loyal to the Chongqing government. (United Press 30th dispatch)

### Craigie's Compromise Rhetoric Arouses British and American Antipathy; British Newspapers Criticize as Colluding with Japan; American Newspapers Express Indignation and Sorrow

Tokyo: The speech by Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, which has aroused commentary in both Britain and the United States, was delivered on Thursday at a luncheon of the Anglo-Japanese Association here. The Ambassador stated that no one can deny that there are various disputes between the two countries, but there is room for resolving such disputes. The goodwill of the two countries, as reflected by the wisdom of their governments, has prevented temporary resentments from turning into deep-seated anger or permanent conflicts. What he felt most was the degree to which the true disputes were shrouded in various misunderstandings and fallacies, all of which were promoted by the unwelcome attention of third parties. The truth will be revealed. The two countries have gradually realized that the other's actions have been discredited and misrepresented in the past few years. He has taken to heart the Japanese government's announced intentions and achieved successes, and has a firm sense of trust in the future of Anglo-Japanese relations. (Reuter's 30th dispatch)

London: The News Chronicle today published an article criticizing Sir Craigie's speech in Tokyo on Thursday, titled "Do Not Collude with Japan," stating that Japan's actions in China are despicable. If we now try to abandon General Chiang Kai-shek and recognize the Wang puppet government in order to buy the aid of the aggressor, then all our claims to resist aggression will become absurd and meaningless. This step will have an astonishing reaction in neutral countries, especially in the United States. The conclusion of the article reads: "If there is collusion with Japan to sacrifice the legitimate government of China, or even if people know that Britain intends to do this, then the domestic unity necessary to win the war will suffer a damaging blow." (Reuter's 30th dispatch)

Washington: The speech delivered by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, in Tokyo on February 28 has caused a painful impression on the press here. The comments in various newspapers have expressed indignation and sorrow. Several well-known figures have expressed their personal opinions, stating that isolationists in the United States had little trust in Britain, while pro-British elements were trying to dispel this view. Now Craigie's words have made the isolationists even more vocal. Some also predict that the British government is preparing to establish a Far East Munich Agreement. This move will make America's financial assistance to China, the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty, and the implementation of a moral embargo to prevent Japan from infringing on China's sovereignty and interfering in foreign interests in China, all go down the drain. Moreover, comparing Craigie's speech with Chamberlain's condemnation of Japan when the Japanese harassed the British in Tianjin some time ago, they felt that it was incongruous. They also asked: How and when have the actions of the Japanese in China, which have been condemned by more than 50 countries in the world, including Great Britain, been discredited and misrepresented? 30th of March, Reuters.

### British Political Circles' Attitude Unchanged

London - Although the list of personnel for the "new regime" organized by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing has been circulating here for over a week, this morning's newspapers completely ignored its establishment. Various circles related to the Far East expressed the opinion that the list includes Wang's old confidants and former members of the Anfu clique, which is not noteworthy, and the rest are all mediocre people. British political circles emphatically stated that the British government's attitude remains as it has always announced in Parliament, that is, Britain adheres to the Nine-Power Treaty, recognizes the legitimate government of China, and will not recognize any other regime. It is rumored that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will meet with President Roosevelt and U.S. Secretary of State Hull during his upcoming vacation to the United States to discuss the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the two "new regimes." However, this has been firmly denied by political circles here. It is said that Sir Robert Craigie's trip to the United States is purely of a private nature, as he has been working hard and needs a rest. (Reuters, 30th)

### Situation of the Establishment of the Nanjing "Government"

The flag of the Nanjing "new government" was raised this morning amidst gun salutes and military music. After the completion of the establishment ceremony, the "government officials" took a group photo. Before leaving, Wang gave a speech to the reporters. Today, the streets of Nanjing once again saw the Blue Sky White Sun flag, which is the first time since December 1937. It was seen hanging in every street and shop, but what was strange was that a small yellow flag was not seen hanging in many places to distinguish it from the flag of Chongqing. The establishment ceremony was quite simple and was completed in twenty minutes. On the central podium of the meeting place was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and two Kuomintang flags were hung. The public was strictly prohibited from entering the meeting place, and Chinese soldiers closely guarded all entrances and exits. Chinese sentries with Mauser pistols were also stationed in the garden and inside the building. In addition to the "government officials," those who attended the ceremony included army officers, reporters, and photographers. After the music was played, the officials bowed three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and Wang read his declaration. (Reuters, 30th)

London - The Chinese Embassy here received an official telegram stating that the Nanjing "new government" is nothing more than an illegal organization established and controlled by Japanese warlords. (Reuters, 10th)

### Provisional Government Abolished Yesterday

Beiping - This morning, the establishment ceremony of the North China Political Affairs Commission was held here. The Beiping "Provisional Government" was thus abolished. Wang Kemin has taken office as the chairman of the Political Affairs Commission, and other leaders have also been formally appointed. After the ceremony, Kuomintang flags were hung on all public buildings. The public is extremely indifferent to this, and most people seem unaware of the change of regime. Foreign officials are awaiting government instructions on what attitude to take towards the "new regime." Some expect that they may have dealings with the "Political Affairs Commission" in practice.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Declares Continued Implementation of Peaceful Policies Preventing the Spread of the Current European War Warns Near Eastern Countries Not to Be Exploited Territorial Dispute Between Soviet Union and Romania Awaits Resolution

Moscow - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union reconvened today. Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov immediately attended and delivered a speech, reaffirming the Soviet Union's neutral stance towards the current European war and clarifying the Soviet Union's advocacy of peaceful policy. He strongly stated that the Soviet Union has no disputes with the Scandinavian countries, Turkey, or Iran. Only the Bessarabia issue with Romania remains unresolved. However, the speech rarely touched upon Germany. The main points of the original speech are as follows: Molotov first stated, "There is still an outstanding issue between our country and Romania, namely, Romania's annexation of the Bessarabia province, which our country has never recognized." As for our country's relations with Germany, they have greatly improved compared to last year, which is completely different from the development of our country's relations with Britain and France. This is because Britain and France wanted to use "the Soviet Union as their tool" in their war against Germany, which we have rejected. In short, it can be asserted that our country's neutral policy is not in line with the tastes of the French authorities. Last year, when our country held negotiations with Finland, the Finnish-Soviet war on November 30 would not have broken out if there had been no third-party interference. The reason why our country firmly wanted to control the Karelian Isthmus was because Finland's bases there were right under the elbow of our city of Leningrad, and it would not be difficult for a third country to use these bases to plot against the Soviet Union. As for the Finnish People's Government organized by Kuusinen, it has been automatically dissolved in order to facilitate the reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland. Our country could have easily occupied the entire Finland, but we still signed a peace treaty with it, which is a clear proof of our country's magnanimity. To this day, Finland's domestic and foreign independent sovereignty have been guaranteed, and it is not necessary to conclude an alliance treaty with Sweden and Norway. Moreover, according to Article 3 of the peace treaty, neither of the signatory countries shall join any groups that are detrimental to the other party. Finland's alliance with the two Nordic countries violates this provision. In addition, there are currently suspicious military movements in the Syrian Republic and other parts of the Near East, and we must closely monitor them to understand the intentions of these troop movements. It is hoped that the Western European countries will not play with fire, because if we find that these troop movements are detrimental to our country, we will immediately take retaliatory measures. Don't say we didn't warn you. Furthermore, there are no disputes between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Iran, and the Scandinavian countries, and we are willing to maintain friendly relations with Turkey and Iran. In a word, the Soviet Union is willing to guarantee international peace on the one hand and safeguard its own security on the other. We must strictly adhere to neutrality and avoid getting involved in the war vortex. Our current policy is to prevent the war from expanding, and we will continue to implement this policy in the future while strengthening our country's military power and national power in general." (Havas, 29th)

Moscow - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov delivered a speech at the sixth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today. The original text is as follows:

Molotov's Speech in Full

"Comrade Delegates, it has been five months since the last session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. During this short period, major international events have occurred, so we must review our foreign policy issues at this session of the Supreme Soviet.  To review the recent international situation, we must pay attention to the war that broke out in Central Europe last autumn. Since the outbreak of the war, the conflict between the British-French group and Germany  has not developed into a major war, with only occasional contact on the sea and in the air. However, the peace intentions expressed by Germany last year have been rejected by the British and French governments, which is a well-known fact. Therefore, both sides are working hard to prepare for an expansion of the war. Germany has strengthened its military power since occupying neighboring countries and uniting 80 million Germans, and has become a strong enemy of the major European imperialist powers of Britain and France. Therefore, Britain and France declared war on Germany, using the fulfillment of their obligations to Poland as an excuse. It is now clear how much the true purpose of the British and French governments in waging war against Germany differs from the goals of guaranteeing Poland and Czechoslovakia. In fact, the British and French governments have declared that their war aim is to crush Germany, although they still use slogans such as defending "democratic" countries and safeguarding the rights of "small countries" to conceal their true purpose. At the same time, due to the Soviet Union's rejection of Britain and France's anti-German policy, their hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union has become more obvious, fully proving the imperialist policy of hostility towards socialist countries.

When the Finnish war began, British and French imperialism prepared to use this as a starting point for war against the Soviet Union, while still using Sweden and Norway to participate in this war. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the expanding European war has long been clear to all parties. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy has been fully demonstrated in this European war. At the beginning of the European war, the Soviet Union announced its neutral policy and stated that it would always pursue this policy in this war.

Improved Soviet-German Relations, Obvious British-French Hostility

The improvement of Soviet-German relations was evidenced by the non-aggression pact signed last August. This new and good relationship has been further strengthened in the former Polish incident, and its greatness has also been proven. The development of Soviet-German economic relations has been proven by the trade agreements signed in August 1939 and February 1940. Currently, trade between the Soviet Union and Germany  has increased, and there is great potential for further development in the future. On the other hand, our relationship with Britain and France is the opposite of the above situation. Because the Soviet Union was unwilling to be used by British and French imperialism as a tool for them to wage war against Germany and gain world hegemony, we have aroused their hostility towards our country. This hostile attitude has been most exposed in the Finnish war. Regarding the Finnish issue, I will explain it separately. In the past few months, British and French anti-Soviet policies have been proven by other facts. Two months ago, the French authorities ordered the police to search our country's commercial representative office in Paris. Although the French police conducted a very thorough search, they still found nothing. As a result, it only made the initiators lose face and proved that this hostile attitude towards our country was completely unreasonable. Regarding the recall of our country's ambassador to France, Suritz, the French government attempted to find various fabricated excuses to show hostility to the Soviet Union. In order to show that it no longer valued relations with France, our country has already recalled Suritz.

Also, regarding the issue of British warships detaining two of our country's merchant ships bound for Vladivostok in the Far East (the ships were carrying goods purchased from China and the United States), as well as the British side's refusal to deliver orders, etc., all these facts are clear evidence of British and French hostility towards the Soviet Union. Although Britain and France have attempted to rationalize their hostile policies, they have accused us of conducting trade with Germany, which is tantamount to helping Germany wage war against them. This kind of argument is not worth laughing at. We will now try to make a comparison between German-Soviet and German-Romanian relations. Miscellaneous trade with Germany accounts for half of its national foreign trade. Romania exports several times more goods to Germany than the Soviet Union (according to the ratio of national output of the Soviet-Romanian countries). However, Britain and France are not hostile to Romania, nor have they asked Romania to stop trading with Germany. Britain and France have a different attitude towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, the reason why Britain and France are hostile to the Soviet Union is definitely not because we are trading with Germany. The crux of the matter is that we are not being used by the British and French ruling class to wage war against Germany. In retaliation, Britain and France have adopted a hostile attitude towards us. We have absolutely no unfriendly behavior towards Britain and France, but they have taken various hostile actions.

As for the absurd rumors spread by Britain and France about the Red Army "invading India" and "invading the East," no one will believe them. If anyone actually believes these rumors, then that person must have lost his mind. The Soviet Union's neutral policy is absolutely not welcomed by the British and French ruling class, this point is extremely obvious. Their nerves are no longer very normal. They are trying to force us to adopt hostile and war-like behavior towards Germany, using us to achieve their imperialist goals. British and French gentlemen must know that the Soviet Union has never been and will never be used by others. The Soviet Union has always pursued its own policies, and these policies will never change, regardless of whether gentlemen from other countries agree or not.

Meaning of War against Finland: Guaranteeing National Security

I will now mention the Finnish issue. What is the true meaning of the three-month war in Finland? This war was due to our urgent need to defend our northwest border (especially Leningrad). You have long understood this. In October and November of last year, the Soviet government repeatedly decided to discuss with the Finnish government ways to ensure the security of our country (especially Leningrad). In view of the worsening international situation, we believe that this kind of discussion is extremely necessary and urgent. Due to the Finnish government's unfriendly attitude, the talks yielded no results, so the Soviet-Finnish war  was unavoidable. We dare say that if Finland had not been controlled by foreign forces and had not adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union and Finland would have been able to resolve the dispute peacefully. The Soviet government made a request at the time, but it still failed to resolve the dispute through diplomatic means. Now that the Finnish war has ended and the Soviet Union and Finland have signed a peace treaty, we should use undeniable facts to point out the importance of the Finnish war. These facts are that the Finnish authorities have built solid fortresses near Leningrad and the entire Karelian Isthmus, containing cannons and machine guns. There are no fewer than thousands of these fortresses, with tunnels connecting them to the rear, and trenches and various obstacles to trap tanks, such as landmines, etc. around them. In addition, there is the Mannerheim Line, built by foreign experts, with a style and structure similar to the Maginot and Siegfried Lines. The Finnish authorities believe that no army can break through this line, and at the same time, they have turned every town in the area into a solid position. Also, in eastern and southern Finland, the Finnish authorities have built railways and highways directly to our border (this highway has no economic importance).

In short, in 1939, Finland (especially the Karelian Isthmus) had been turned into a military stronghold, so that a third powerful country could use it to attack Leningrad and the Soviet Union. From this point of view, Finland's hostility towards us last autumn was by no means accidental. In fact, troops hostile to the Soviet Union had built a solid position in Finland, and as soon as the situation became unfavorable to the Soviet Union, they began to act. The Soviet Red Army has shattered the Mannerheim Line and won supreme glory, because only the Red Army can achieve this in difficult circumstances. At the same time, the Red Army has also destroyed the military base for attacking Leningrad. Not only that, but the Red Army has also defeated several anti-  plans that third countries have carried out over the past few years.

### Soviet Army's War against Finland Was Actually a War against Britain and France

"The hatred of the Finnish government and military authorities towards our country can also be seen from the atrocities of the Finnish White Guards against the wounded Red Army soldiers. For example, the Finnish White Guards surrounded the air-raid shelter of our wounded soldiers' hospital north of Lake Ladoga. One hundred and twenty seriously wounded soldiers were killed in the shelter. Some were burned to death, some had their skulls smashed, and others  were stabbed to death or shot to death. In addition to the seriously wounded, many of the soldiers who died in the area and elsewhere had their heads struck, or suffered fatal wounds from bayonets. The faces of some of the soldiers who were killed were covered in knife wounds. Some of the corpses had their heads severed, and the heads were missing. As for the ambulance team members captured by the Finnish White Guards, they also encountered unbelievably cruel acts. Some of the corpses were tied to trees, and their heads were cut off. These barbaric and cruel acts were the result of the Finnish White Guards' attempt to incite the public to hate our country. This is the true face of Finland's supporters of "Western civilization." It is not difficult to understand that the Finnish war was not only a war against the Finnish army. The truth is actually more complicated than this. What our army encountered was not only the Finnish army, but also the joint military power of Britain, France, and other imperialists. They supplied Finnish small capitalists with various weapons, aircraft, cannons, disguised "volunteers," money, and various military supplies, and promoted hot propaganda to the whole world, with the aim of trying to arouse an anti-Soviet war by various means. In this roar of the enemies of the Soviet Union, the loudest were the howls of the prostitutes of the Second International, the "socialists," and the cries of Attlee and Blum, the slaves of the capitalists.

### Britain and France Are Undeniably Responsible for Inciting War in Eastern Europe

When British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons on March 19, he not only expressed malicious regret for failing to eliminate the Finnish war, using it to show the  "peace-loving" imperialist heart to the world, but also explained how to incite Finland to wage war against the Soviet Union. He published the following figures for the number of military supplies that Britain had granted and actually transported to Finland. Britain granted permission to transport 152 aircraft to Finland, and 101 aircraft had actually been transported to Finland. Also, for cannons, Britain granted permission for  3  3, but the actual number transported to Finland was 114. Britain granted permission for 297,000 shells, but only 185,000 were transported to Finland. 100 Vickers guns were transported to Finland. In addition, 15,700 aircraft bombs were transported to Finland (Britain had originally granted permission to transport 22,700 to Finland). In addition, 10,000 anti-tank landmines transported from Britain to Finland, which was half of what Britain had originally granted permission for. Chamberlain continued with a shameless attitude, "Britain's preparations for this expedition were extremely rapid. In early March, an expeditionary force of 100,000 men was ready to go to Finland (two months earlier than Mannerheim had requested), and more troops will be sent to Finland later. This kind of candid admission is the true face of the peace-loving British imperialism.

As for France, we have learned from the French newspapers that the French side has transported 179 aircraft, 472 cannons, 795,000 shells, 5,100 machine guns, and 200,000 hand grenades to Finland. On March 11, former French Prime Minister Daladier declared in the parliament, "Among the countries providing military aid to Finland, France ranks first. At the same time, in order to accept the requirements of the Finnish capital, France has transported the latest bomber to Finland." Daladier continued, "Since  January 26, the French army has been ready to depart to Finland." Several French ships were preparing to depart to transport troops to Finland. Daladier also said, "The Allies are determined to do their best to help Finland." Daladier's speech has lost its sober rationality, so there is no need to discuss it in detail.

It is also necessary to discuss Sweden's position in the Finnish war. According to the Swedish newspaper, the aircraft supplied by Sweden to Finland accounted for one-fifth of Sweden's own air force. According to the Swedish Minister of the Army, "Finland has obtained 84,000 rifles, 575 machine guns, 300 cannons, 30,000 hand grenades, and 50 million bullets from Sweden. These military supplies are all the latest weapons of war."

Italy was also quite active in inciting Finland to wage war. The Italian side helped Finland with 50 military aircraft. At the same time, the "peace" faction in the United States also provided assistance to the Finnish side.

### The Heavy Losses Suffered by Both Finland and the Soviet Union in the War

According to our incomplete statistics, other countries shipped the following military equipment to Finland during the war: 550 airplanes, 1,500 artillery pieces, 6,000 machine guns, 100,000 rifles, 650,000 hand grenades, 2.5 million artillery shells, and 160 million bullets. From this, we can prove that the Finnish war was by no means a local conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland, but in fact, a war between the Soviet Union and a coalition of countries hostile to the Soviet Union. The Red Army has now destroyed this coalition, adding a glorious page to the history of warfare. At the same time, the heroic spirit of sacrifice of our people has been fully demonstrated. The Finnish war has caused heavy losses to both our side and the Finnish side. According to statistics from our General Staff, the total number of soldiers killed in action and died from injuries is 48,745 (approximately less than 49,000), and the number of wounded is 158,863. Finland is trying to reduce the total number of casualties, but their losses are indeed heavier than ours. According to statistics from our General Staff, the number of Finnish soldiers killed is over 60,000 (not including those who died from injuries), and the number of wounded is 250,000. The total number of Finnish soldiers is about 600,000. In other words, half of the Finnish army has been killed or wounded. All of these are facts. (To be continued) (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

### The Soviet Union Proposes Reopening Commercial Negotiations; British Acceptance Undecided

The British government in London had not decided last night on a response to the Soviet Union's proposal to begin negotiations on a British-Soviet commercial agreement. Foreign diplomats here suspect that Britain will accept the Soviet proposal. The Soviet proposal was submitted to British Foreign Secretary Halifax by Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky on Wednesday. It is believed that the British Foreign Secretary discussed the Soviet proposal with French Premier Reynaud at the Allied Supreme Council meeting on Thursday. (United Press dispatch on the 30th)

Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, has been on vacation in his home country from Moscow for a long time. There were rumors that the ambassador would return to his post in the very near future, but diplomatic circles here have now denied this. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### German Foreign Ministry Publishes Important Polish Archives; American and Polish Denial of the Authenticity of the Documents

After the German army occupied Warsaw, several important archives from the former Polish Foreign Ministry fell into the hands of the German army. After a detailed review by the German Foreign Ministry, those with historical value are being announced one by one. The first announcement was made yesterday as follows:

First document

The original text of a telegram from American Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Grew, to the British Foreign Office on April 2, 1935, is as follows: "In accordance with Foreign Secretary Eden's instructions, I paid a visit to Polish President Piłsudski this afternoon. The conversation did not go very smoothly, as most of Piłsudski's remarks gave me and the two Polish cabinet members who participated in the conversation a sense of inscrutability. The topic was Poland's treaties with Germany and Soviet Russia, emphasizing that Soviet policy was unpredictable, and several countries could not avoid misunderstanding it, especially Lloyd George. Lloyd George's support for Russian leader Denikin was clear evidence of a misjudgment of the situation. Piłsudski expressed the hope that Britain would pay attention to its own colonies and not repeat Lloyd George's mistakes by meddling in other people's affairs. Piłsudski also inquired about the current situation in Jamaica. I replied that if Europe's importance was only equal to that of Jamaica, we would have nothing to worry about. I further stated that we were originally unwilling to meddle in European continental affairs, but any event on the European continent was directly related to Britain. Piłsudski objected to this. In short, the impression I got of Piłsudski was that since he concluded treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union, he had decided to stick to his principles and was unwilling to change his attitude."

Second document

The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the second document with significant historical value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki, to the Polish Foreign Minister from Washington on November 21, 1938. The original text is as follows:

"On November 19, I (Potocki referring to himself) held a long conversation with Mr. Bullitt, the American Ambassador to France, who is currently on vacation in his home country, mentioning that he had an unusually cordial relationship with Polish Ambassador to France Łukasiewicz. (Note: Bullitt regularly reports on the European situation to President Roosevelt, and is deeply trusted and valued by Roosevelt and the State Department.) All of Bullitt's observations are from the perspective of a journalist, not from the standpoint of a politician, and he considers the situation to be extremely pessimistic. During the conversation with me, he declared that there would be amazing changes in the spring of 1939, and Europe would be threatened by war. He also believed that the center of gravity in Europe had shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe since the Munich Conference, where Britain and France succumbed. Bullitt discussed the situation in Britain and France, emphasizing that Britain was not prepared for war, and at the same time, it was very difficult for British industry to reorganize to adapt to wartime mass production, especially the problem of aircraft manufacturing was the most difficult to solve. Bullitt believed that the French army was still good, but the air force was also lagging behind. When the European crisis occurred in the autumn of 1938, military experts told Bullitt that the European war would last at least six years, and as a result, Europe would be completely destroyed, and all countries would become communist, with the Soviet Union reaping the benefits. Regarding the Soviet Union, Bullitt believed that since the purge of the Red Army, especially since the departure of General Galen, the Soviet army had greatly deteriorated and could no longer engage in any war activities. Today's Soviet Union is almost the "sick man of Europe." Bullitt was extremely angry with Hitler, emphasizing that only war could stop the development of German aggression. When I asked him how he predicted the future war situation, Bullitt declared that he believed that Britain, France, and the United States would greatly expand their military forces to resist Germany, and only then could there be a final decision. I then asked how the European war would break out, because I believed that Germany would not necessarily attack Britain and France. Bullitt replied that Britain, France, and the United States still needed at least two years to complete the expansion of their military forces. At the same time, Germany might advance eastward. In fact, what Britain and France most hoped for was a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, especially hoping that the Soviet Union would reveal its never-announced strength, causing Germany to exhaust its power until it could not withstand a single blow from Britain and France. I asked whether the United States would participate in this war. Bullitt replied, "There is no doubt about it, but the United States' participation must be after Britain and France have taken the first step." Today's situation in the United States, with its hatred of German Nazism and Hitlerism, is no less deep than when the United States declared war in 1917. At this point, Bullitt asked me about Poland's attitude. I replied that Poland was determined to defend its territory, and if Germany crossed the border to attack, Poland would fight back with all its strength. Finally, Bullitt discussed Germany's ambitions for Ukraine, saying that it was very dangerous for Poland. Bullitt's understanding of the "Eastern European issue" in the conversation seemed to be somewhat superficial. Signed, Potocki.

Third document

The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the third document with significant historical value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report submitted by Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki, to the Polish Foreign Minister on January 12, 1939, discussing the general situation of anti-German sentiment and the Jewish question in the United States at that time. The original text is as follows:

"What is prevalent in the United States is the sentiment of hatred for fascism, especially for Hitler and things related to National Socialism. The propaganda machine is almost entirely in the hands of the Jews. Radio, film, daily newspapers, and publications are controlled by them, accounting for almost 100%. Although they have tried their best to describe the dark situation in Germany, such as religious persecution and the situation in concentration camps, the American people are still isolated from the European situation, so it has not been effective. Currently, the American people have regarded Hitler and National Socialism as the most vicious threat in the world. However, this well-planned anti-National Socialist movement does not involve the Soviet Union. In addition, the United States is also creating a war mentality, making the American people believe that European peace is on the verge of danger, war is inevitable, and that if a world war breaks out, the United States must participate in the war to protect the freedom and democracy of the world. President Roosevelt is the first person to express hatred for fascism, and his role is twofold: (1) President Roosevelt, in view of the complexity and difficulty of domestic problems, especially labor disputes, advocates the theory of anti-fascism, shifting the public's attention away from domestic problems; (2) The United States' creation of a war mentality and the claim of a crisis of European peace are intended to make the public accept a huge military build-up plan that exceeds the United States' defense needs. The anti-National Socialist sentiment in the United States is even more intensified by Germany's harsh treatment of Jews and the resettlement issue. Jewish intellectuals such as New York Governor Baruch, newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and other Jewish friends of President Roosevelt are all participating in the movement. They all want to support Roosevelt as the guarantor of human rights, religion, and freedom of speech. These Jews in high positions in the American government, although posing as "protectors of democracy," are actually inseparably linked to the Jewish International. According to the Jewish International, it is also acting cunningly to benefit its race by supporting Roosevelt as the "guarantor of human rights." In short, it is a very skillful maneuver to hide the difficulties of American domestic politics and shift the American people's anti-Jewish attention to anti-fascism." Signed, Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki.

Fourth document

The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the fourth document with significant value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Ambassador to Paris, Łukasiewicz, to the Polish Foreign Minister from Paris on February 1, 1939. The original text is as follows: "The French Parliament's discussion on France's current foreign policy ended yesterday. As a result, the Daladier government's confidence was voted on with 379 votes to 234 votes. In the current situation, I must make some suggestions regarding Franco-Polish relations and the Franco-Polish pact. I (Łukasiewicz referring to himself) recall that in my report on December 17, 1938, I mentioned that since the September incident, that is, the signing of the Franco-German non-aggression declaration, French political figures have become more critical of Franco-Polish relations. Since then, French newspapers have also carried more articles on the Franco-Polish question. Both French leftists and rightists have commented on it. The former French hostility towards Poland has been eliminated since the September incident, and more rational arguments have also appeared at present. At this time, France's international position is deteriorating, especially since Your Excellency (referring to the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to Hitler in Berchtesgaden after the Munich Agreement), the press and political figures here have commented on Foreign Minister Bonnet's diplomatic policy towards Poland. Newspapers have accused Foreign Minister Bonnet of failing to use the opportunity during Your Excellency's visit to southern France to forge closer political relations between France and Poland. Since Your Excellency left Berchtesgaden, the newspapers here have directly attacked Foreign Minister Bonnet for improper measures. Since then, in order to avoid being attacked, Foreign Minister Bonnet has praised the difficult situation in Poland and the threat Poland will face from the Germans. However, the French not only understand that German-Polish relations have not deteriorated, but also that Poland is not threatened by Hitler's actions in Ukraine. At the same time, the anti-French movement is prevalent in Italy, making France's hope of Italy joining the so-called "Imperial Policy" a pipe dream. Under this atmosphere, Foreign Minister Bonnet's report in the Chamber of Deputies caused great dissatisfaction among the members, who considered it too bland and uninteresting. Fortunately, the French speaker's words were able to arouse the members' patriotism and allow the vote of confidence to pass with 379 votes to 234 votes." Signed, Polish Ambassador to France, Łukasiewicz.

Fifth document

The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the fifth important document copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Foreign Ministry official Graczynski to the Polish Foreign Minister on November 2, 1938. The content is as follows:

"Your Excellency, Minister, I held a conversation with the Czech presidential candidate, Mr. Landa, the former General Manager of the Třinec Iron and Steel Works. Mr. Landa described Czech policy as follows: 'For a thousand years, the Czechs have had close political relations with Germany. It was not until after independence in 1919 that there was an independent Czech policy, but I believe that the Czech Republic must return to its original state, that is, become Germany's political satellite.' Mr. Landa is a famous Czech industrialist, and his remarks are worth paying attention to. I am sending this special telegram for your perusal." Respectfully, Graczynski. (Haitong dispatch on the 30th)

### American and Polish Officials Issue Statements

Washington D.C. – U.S. Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, and Polish Ambassador to the United States Potocki issued statements today denouncing as false the German publication of a "White Paper" claiming to know President Roosevelt's attitudes on isolationism and aid to Britain and France. Hull also stated that the United States does not believe that Germany possesses such documents. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)

Berlin – According to information received indirectly from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hull denied the information about the American ambassador participating in the conversation contained in the Polish Foreign Ministry archives. However, sources here claim that American diplomats have been spreading information about Germany's aggressive intentions and encouraging Polish nationalism, hindering the peaceful resolution of European problems. (Haitong dispatch on the 30th)

### British and French Views on Soviet Foreign Minister's Speech

London – Newspapers here are giving prominent coverage to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, considering it to be a mockery of Hitler and an expression of the Soviet Union's willingness to improve relations with countries other than Germany. The "Daily Herald's" diplomatic correspondent said that this speech is nothing less than a real setback for Germany, and its significance is that the Soviet Union has resumed an independent attitude. Soviet sources in London all hinted that Moscow is not opposed to reopening British and American commercial negotiations. All of the above shows that the Soviet Union is rapidly determining that the Allies will win. If the Soviet Union effectively stops its economic aid to Germany, then the relations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in all aspects will definitely be genuinely improved. The "Daily Telegraph" editorial said that the tickets taken out of the fire by Hitler for Stalin will still be accepted as before, but there is nothing to reciprocate. The "Daily Mail" said that Molotov's speech has ended Hitler's fantasy of a tripartite alliance.

Paris – Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech yesterday has been commented on by political figures here, who said that its main points are two: (1) Finland should continue to be politically neutralized; (2) Romania occupies the province of Bessarabia (which belonged to Russia before the outbreak of the European War), and the Soviet Union has never recognized it, so it is inconvenient to sign a non-aggression treaty with Romania. It seems that the Soviet Union's future policy will be based on these two points. Regarding the second point, Romania's position is very clear, because the Soviet Union signed a multilateral convention with Romania and other countries in 1933, defining an aggressor, and has actually accepted the obligation to respect Romania's current borders. The governments of Britain and France are still taking a calm attitude towards the development of Soviet policy, because the Soviet Union's proximity to Germany must be expressed in practical actions that are beneficial to Germany before it can cause anxiety in Britain and France. At this moment, it is not yet known what the Soviet Union will do economically and politically, so Britain and France are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and when necessary, they will naturally respond accordingly. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Economic War Begins Between Britain and France Against Germany; Naval and Land Blockades of German Trade Routes; New Plan to Be Implemented Soon

Paris – The French newspaper "L'Intransigeant" quoted a dispatch from London as saying that the Allied Supreme Military Conference made a final decision yesterday to intensify the Allied blockade of Germany. What had been resolved before was only on the ocean side, but now the issue is being discussed from a land perspective. All commercial routes connecting with Germany will now be completely blocked. This new plan will be implemented soon. The economic war has now begun. Germany is abusing the neutrality of other countries, and Britain and France cannot continue to ignore this. The methods that the Allies will adopt may cause some inconvenience to some countries and put others at some risk. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

Paris – Political figures here recently said that the declaration issued yesterday by the joint meeting of the British and French Defense Supreme Committee has made a deep impression on European countries, and the Nordic countries have also adopted a more realistic view. Taking Norway as an example, the German submarine U-21 entered Norwegian territorial waters in the North Sea and attacked a British ship, and has been detained by the Norwegian authorities. This shows that the country can take strong action to safeguard its rights. As for Germany's plan to win over the Soviet Union and Italy to sign a tripartite agreement, it has obviously failed. It is now trying to win over Italy, Hungary, and Yugoslavia in order to establish a quadrilateral agreement. Among them, Hungary may join under pressure from Germany, but Yugoslavia will definitely not comply. Judging from the tone of the country's newspapers, it does not express trust in Germany and Italy, which can be known. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### German-Italian-Soviet Alliance Appears Difficult to Achieve; Italian Suspicion of the Soviet Union Remains Difficult to Eliminate

London – According to a special dispatch from here today, Swiss newspapers' Rome correspondents report that they do not believe that Italy is likely to join the Berlin-Moscow axis. A Swiss newspaper's Rome dispatch summarizes Italy's attitude towards the Soviet Union as follows: (1) Italy believes that the Soviet Union has little value as a military ally; (2) Rome has not changed its suspicion of Moscow's political and world goals; (3) Although this will not prevent Italy from continuing its trade with the Soviet Union, it is out of the question for Italy to conclude any political or military system in which communism participates. A Swiss newspaper's correspondent in Romania reports that the Romanian events clearly demonstrate the danger of "offering gifts to seek security," and that U.S. President Roosevelt has announced that this move is inconsistent with genuine peace. Romania, like other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, only hopes not to be subjected to terror and aggression, and is prepared to pay a high price to achieve this wish, but its price is also limited.

### Tokyo Municipal Employees' Union Forced to Dissolve

Tokyo – The Tokyo Municipal Employees' Union was established in 1924 and has more than 2,000 members, most of whom are employees of streetcars and buses. It usually advocates for higher wages and improved workers' lives. It was originally based on the instructions of the dissolved left-wing Japan Labor-Farmer Party and engaged in various activities. However, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities relentlessly suppressed left-wing groups. In the winter of 1937, Hashimoto, the chairman of the union's executive committee, and Kato, the leader of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, were successively arrested. The union suffered a blow from this, but still did not participate in the National Service Association promoted by the government. Later, left-wing groups were dissolved one after another. The only surviving one was this union. At this point, the leaders of the union decided to dissolve on their own after a meeting and transform the 1,000 members into the National Service Promotion Association. According to a statement released to reporters by the chairman of the union, "The era of the labor movement has passed. We are forced to participate in the National Service Movement."

### Japanese Export Trade Suffers a Major Blow; Business Circles Advocate Restoring the Link Between the Yen and the Pound Sterling

Tokyo – Since the yen's exchange rate was decided to break away from the pound sterling and link with the U.S. dollar in October last year, Japanese business circles, due to the daily decline in the pound sterling's exchange rate and the major blow that Japanese export trade will suffer, with cotton textiles almost no longer able to be exported to countries in the pound sterling group, are all advocating that the yen should restore its link with the pound sterling. The Cotton Yarn Association and cotton cloth exporters have scheduled a meeting for April 1 to discuss this matter. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### Soviet Union Develops Oil Fields in North Sakhalin

Tokyo's Hochi Shimbun reports that the Soviet Union relies heavily on oil fields along the Black Sea coast for its kerosene needs. The Soviet government, fearing disruptions in the supply from these oil fields, is actively developing oil fields in North Sakhalin to achieve an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons. Construction of kerosene pipelines has already commenced on the northwest coast of Sakhalin. Simultaneously, the Soviet government is purchasing large quantities of kerosene from the United States. According to Japanese ship crew members returning from Vladivostok, they witnessed numerous Soviet and American oil tankers docked at the port. It is estimated that since September of last year, the US has shipped as many as 2.14 million barrels of kerosene to the port. The reasons for this are threefold: (1) The Soviet Union may be selling most of its domestic oil production to Germany, necessitating the replenishment of its reserves. (2) The situation in the Black Sea region is unstable, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. (3) The United States might also impose a ban on kerosene shipments to the Soviet Union, making it necessary to prepare in advance. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Both Concessions Under Strict Guard Yesterday; Situation Unusually Tense; Unnecessary Roads and Bridges Blocked; Heavy Police and Detective Presence; Fortunately, No Incidents

With the "New Regime" commencing in Nanjing yesterday, both concessions implemented special security measures for the day, blocking unnecessary roads and bridges, and shortening tram routes. The details are as follows:

### Number of Forced Marchers Small

Since the outbreak of the war with China, Japan's domestic manpower, material resources, and financial resources have long been in a state of exhaustion. The people's war-weariness grows by the day. To address this, the Japanese military single-handedly orchestrated the "New Regime" to promote the narrative of peace. Yesterday marked the start date of the "New Regime" in Nanjing, and various organizations in the city, large and small, separately held "celebratory" parades and demonstrations in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and downtown areas, rallying coolies, children, women, and the elderly. However, most refused to participate, so each district's marchers numbered only a few dozen.

Concession Security; Troops Deployed

The police authorities of both concessions, fearing that anti-Japanese elements would enter the concessions to disrupt order or engage in other activities, decided after a meeting the previous night to implement special security measures for the day. In addition to mobilizing all police officers and detectives, they also deployed the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the Shanghai-based troops of various countries. British troops were responsible for maintaining order in the area east of Yuqiaqing Road, west of the Bund, north of Edward VII Avenue, south of the Suzhou Creek, and along the northern embankment area. American troops were responsible for the area west of Yuqiaqing Road, east of Xiaoshadu Road, north of Avenue Foch, and the north and south sections of Route Robert. Italian troops were responsible for the area west of Xiaoshadu Road and all of the extra-settlement roads. French troops were responsible for the order of the entire French Concession.

Traffic Interrupted; Strict Searches

In addition, unnecessary roads along Edward VII Avenue and Xizang Road, such as Jiangxi Road, Zhu Baosan Road, Jixiang Street, Zilai Street, Daigou Bridge, Route Macgregor, Mofan Street, Yunnan Road, Guangxi Road, East and West Water and Fire Streets, Balibao Street, Longmen Road, Danshui Road, Chongqing Road, Route Pere Robert, Route Marcel Tillot, and Route Massenet, were all blocked with barbed wire, interrupting traffic. Only the Bund, Sichuan Road, Cathedral Street, Henan Road, Old North Gate Street, Fujian Road, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, Great World, Tongfu Road, Rue Sainte-Marie, Seymour Road, and Great West Road allowed passage, with searches being conducted.

Bridges Blocked; Routes Shortened

At the same time, bridges along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Water Works Bridge, Pentang Nong Bridge, and Xizang Road Bridge, were all blocked. Only the Tianhou Palace Bridge allowed pedestrians and vehicles to pass, and the Old Zha Gate Bridge only allowed pedestrians to pass. The Zhejiang Road Bridge only allowed vehicles to pass. A large number of detectives were stationed on both sides of the bridges that were open to traffic, conducting searches. Even buses and trams were subject to inspection. The situation was even more strict than during the "January 28th Incident." The British-operated Route 16 trolleybus, which originally ran between Sanyangjing Bridge and Caojiadu, temporarily shortened its route due to the closure of the iron gate on Route Robert, and turned around at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Route Robert. Route 18 trolleybus, which originally ran between the Great World and the North Railway Station, turned at Nicheng Bridge and traveled north via Beijing Road and Tianhou Palace Bridge due to the closure of the Xizang Road Bridge.

Armored Vehicle Convoys; Tight Patrols

In addition to the special security measures on the roads and bridges, inspection teams of men and women, vehicle patrols, armored vehicle convoys, and garrison patrol teams patrolled back and forth on the roads. Attention was paid to the areas bordering the Chinese districts. A large number of armored vehicles and reserve teams were stationed in the western district for preventative measures. In the past, people could walk on the streets as early as 5:00 AM, but yesterday, in accordance with martial law, free movement was not allowed until 6:00 AM. Trolleybuses and buses were also delayed until 5:45 AM before leaving the depot. After 12:30 AM, no one without a pass or permit was allowed to travel. The curfew was strictly enforced. This morning at 0:00, the emergency measures were lifted and the original state was restored.

Japanese Side in Hongkou Also Imposes Security

As for the Japanese side, due to anti-Japanese patriots being active in their occupied areas, they increased the number of posts at various key points on land and water and at various bridges in Hongkou, such as the Yalu Road Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Li Hong Bridge, Outer Hong Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, and Jiaxing Road Bridge, searching pedestrians and vehicles. Concession troops, in groups of three to five, patrolled back and forth in the British and Japanese security areas north of the Suzhou Creek, and along the areas of North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road.

Rental Cars Forced to Display Flags

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that today (30th), some cars of the city's rental car companies were forced to display flags promoting the puppet "New Regime," causing resentment among Chinese passengers. However, the drivers and car companies, fearing threats, did not dare to tear down the flags. This was because this morning, the Dadao Police intercepted rental cars outside the concession area, in front of dance halls and gambling dens within the car companies, and while driving on the road. They stuck Kuomintang flags on the windshields of each car, and yellow triangular flags with the words "Peace and National Construction" on the rear windows, and then warned the drivers not to tear down the flags today, otherwise, they would be subject to extremely unpleasant punishment if discovered. The drivers had no choice, so when passengers saw these flags, many asked to have them torn down, but to no avail. The reporter recently inquired about this matter with Major Boween, the head of the Public Concession Police, who replied that the police department takes a neutral view on this matter and does not need to interfere. Whether or not to tear down the flags on the cars should be decided by the car companies.

### Jinghu Trains Derailed Both Yesterday and the Day Before; Dozens Injured in Qishuyan Derailment Yesterday; Engine Overturned Near Nanjing the Night Before

At the Qishuyan station between Changzhou and Wuxi, at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday (30th), a second- and third-class express train from Nanjing to Shanghai, with about a dozen cars including freight cars, was passing through the area at around 10:00 AM when it was unexpectedly targeted. Chinese troops had removed screws from the rails, dug up the tracks, and buried multiple landmines. As the passenger train passed, there was a loud explosion, shaking the heavens. Several meters of track were destroyed on the spot, the engine derailed, and the entire train overturned into the fields. Dozens of passengers were seriously injured. After the incident, the Japanese guard and military police searched the area but found nothing. Therefore, the Jinghu passenger train was delayed by several hours yesterday.

Train Suddenly Derails; Nanjing in Sight

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that yesterday (29th) noon, the last express train from Shanghai to Nanjing, carrying senior Chinese officials attending the inauguration ceremony of the Nanjing "New Regime" and many foreign journalists, was approaching Nanjing at 7:30 PM, traveling slowly.

Suddenly Derails

The engine and two third-class carriages derailed outside the tracks. No passengers were seriously injured; some suffered minor abrasions that did not require hospitalization. Railway personnel attributed the cause of the accident to negligent repairs on that section of the railway, stating that the accident site had been under repair that morning. Soon, a new engine arrived and towed the express train onward.

9:00 PM

Arrived in Nanjing one and a half hours late. According to foreign journalists traveling on the train, those included Mr. Meyer, a newsreel photographer from the American Fox Film Corporation, Mr. Robertson, a reporter from the New York Times, Mr. Gamlinberti, a reporter from the Italian Stefani News Agency, Mrs. Reichs, a news photographer, Mr. Guett, a reporter from the American International News Service, and Messrs.

### Second Anniversary of the Taierzhuang Victory; Spiritual Expressions from All Walks of Life; No Ceremonies Held in a Solemn and Respectful Atmosphere; Emulating the Soldiers' Aspirations to Implement National Policy

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Taierzhuang Victory. All sectors of the city made spiritual commemorations in a solemn and respectful atmosphere, resolving to emulate the aspirations of the martyred soldiers and steadfastly uphold the belief in resistance and reconstruction. The details are as follows:

Yesterday's Taierzhuang Victory Commemoration

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the unprecedented victory at Taierzhuang. Although various sectors of industry, commerce, banking, and finance in the city were unable to hold grand commemorative ceremonies or celebrations due to the environment, they all made spiritual commemorations of the meaning of the victory in a solemn, respectful, steadfast, and determined atmosphere. On the one hand, they rejoiced in the nation's good fortune and looked forward to the final victory. On the other hand, they all vowed to emulate the aspirations of the martyred soldiers and complete the great task of resisting the war and building the nation. Although the city did not fly flags yesterday to mark the occasion, the belief in loyalty and courage became even more solid.

Commemorative Leaflets Scattered Everywhere

Yesterday, various sectors of the city did not hold commemorative ceremonies, as instructed by the authorities. However, patriotic organizations formed by the general public, in order to express their firm national spirit and support the national policy of resistance, distributed leaflets everywhere. Many patriotic youths distributed the city party headquarters' letter to citizens door-to-door, and pasted slogans on every telegraph pole, expressing strong sentiments.

### Upper South Sichuan Salt Depot Officially Dissolved

Unwilling to Be Exploited by the Puppet Regime; Unable to Maintain the Original State

The city's table salt has been supplied by the Upper South Sichuan Salt Depot. Before the Shanghai war, the salt depot was located on Anlan Road in Nanshi. During the war, the entire area was destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in significant losses. It then moved its office to the Central Building on Edward VII Avenue to facilitate external liaison. After the fall of Nanshi, the puppet "Salt Affairs Bureau" was officially established, and puppet officials came to the office to negotiate cooperation between the two sides. The person in charge of the office understood the greater good and the initial negotiations were fruitless. Later, the puppet side went again, offering bribes and even offering more favorable conditions, but they were still rejected. After the puppet "Bureau" failed to reach an agreement after repeated negotiations, it became angry and resentful, so it sent people three times to threaten with words and even issued written warnings. After receiving the warning letter from the puppet "Bureau," the office convened a meeting the day before yesterday and all agreed that under the current serious threat, it was impossible to maintain the original state. In order to fulfill the national duty and even more unwilling to be exploited by the puppet side, a resolution was passed to dissolve the company with immediate effect. All remaining staff were also given severance pay and dismissed.

### Efforts to Rescue British Soldier Ifork Sentenced to Death

Fate in the Hands of the British Ambassador; No Comment from British Officials

Private Ifork of the Seaforth Highlanders, who was sentenced to death by Judge Jones for shooting his section commander, had his judgment sent to British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, currently residing in Chongqing. Since the pronouncement of the sentence, well-known British and American expatriates in the city have signed a joint letter to the British Ambassador, requesting that the sentence be reduced or commuted to hard labor. The rescue letter has also been submitted to the British Ambassador. According to a British official spokesman, he could not comment on this matter, as he could not determine when the British Ambassador would reply. However, he could say that the Ambassador was studying the judgment and the rescue letter. He also could not determine when a reply from the Ambassador would be received here. Therefore, the fate of Private Ifork remains in the hands of the Ambassador.

### Request to Reduce Additional Tax on Hotel Industry Under Consideration

Shanghai Municipal Council Reviewing Files; Chinese Directors Busy Negotiating

The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, facing a 150% to 200% increase in business license fees by the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited all Chinese Directors to request that the Municipal Council rescind its decision or reduce the increased tax rate. All of the Chinese Directors have formally approached the Municipal Council, requesting that the method of reducing the tax on the hotel industry in 1933 be followed to reduce the burden on taxpayers. The Municipal Council is now reviewing the files and, it is reported, will follow the method within the realm of possibility. However, as this matter will be implemented tomorrow (April 1st), all members of the Hotel Industry Association have been busy negotiating with the Chinese Directors in recent days.

### Restrictions on Highway Traffic Remain; Road Surface in Poor Condition; Little Hope for Improvement in City Traffic; Citizens Seem to Have Forgotten the Safety Campaign

Report from the Annual Meeting of the Automobile Association of China

The Continental Daily News reported that the Automobile Association of China held its annual meeting at No. 17 The Bund on the 29th. Stephen Badeau, Chairman of the Association, presented a report urging the lifting of all restrictions on the free movement of traffic on the highways connecting Shanghai to the interior. The report, read by Deputy Chairman Franklin, stated that the quickest way to restore the normal use of highways was to lift restrictions and allow the free movement of traffic. Although the war had long moved away from the Shanghai area, the term "military necessity" still made land travel temporarily impossible. In addition to the restrictions,

The poor road surface made automobile travel extremely uncomfortable. Although the Association has not been able to investigate the road conditions, according to the information received, the road surface has been severely damaged in the past two and a half years. Once the highways are opened and free passage is allowed, it will not take long to repair the road surface. Shanghai's

The traffic situation remains extremely unsatisfactory. Unless Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Nanshi are opened without restriction to reduce the current population congestion, there is little hope for improvement in the city's traffic situation. The "Safety First" campaign held last year was very successful, but citizens seem to have forgotten the lessons learned.

### Corpses and Goods Left in the Scythia; Workers Continue Salvage

Due to damaged machinery, the salvage work on the sunken Scythia has been temporarily suspended. The Scythia Relief Association, believing that there are still corpses and luggage left in the ship, hired the China Salvage Company to continue the salvage work starting at 9:00 AM on the 26th. The underwater work of salvaging the sunken ship was contracted by the ship owner to the salvage company, with a daily wage of 120 yuan in national currency. The onshore work was handled by the ship owner themselves. As the salvage machinery has not been fully completed, the work has been in progress for nearly ten days without progress. The shipowner's losses have reached more than 2,000 yuan.

### Tjisadane Arrives in Shanghai

The Java-China-Japan Lijn's Tjisadane, coming from Surabaya, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). According to the company's announcement yesterday, the ship will arrive in Shanghai at noon today. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared small boats and land at the New Customs Wharf at approximately 2:00 PM. However, the ship is carrying a large amount of cargo, approximately 4,500 tons, resulting in a heavy load and deep draft. Therefore, it is uncertain whether it can enter the port this afternoon at the Wusongkou due to the receding tide. If it is not possible, it must anchor outside the port and wait until the tide rises at around 5:00 PM to enter the port. Passenger disembarkation will also be postponed.

### Import Duties to Be Paid by Shipping Companies

In order to extend the deadline for paying import duties, the Jianghai Customs will continue to collect the taxes due in accordance with the second paragraph of the ship's annual report, with the shipping companies responsible for paying the taxes. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war in August 1937, some shipping companies have failed to pay the taxes on imported goods within the tax payment period, and goods that have not been taxed have been temporarily treated as free due to the extraordinary circumstances. From now on, all taxes and extension fees due on the above-mentioned goods shall be paid by the shipping companies in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of the ship's annual report.

### Post Office Near Tiantong Road Opens to the Public

Kunming Parcels Being Shipped in Batches

The Shanghai Postal Administration has resumed accepting bulk commodity parcels and small packets to Kunming, but the senders are crowded. In just two days, they received no less than 10,000 parcels.

Today, they will resume accepting parcels that have been registered, and two batches have already been shipped to Haiphong for forwarding to Kunming. Once the parcels that have been taken are cleared, they will continue to accept shipments to ease the congestion. It has also been learned that small packets have also been temporarily suspended from acceptance starting today due to excessive shipments and insufficient transportation. It has also been learned that parcel acceptance to Hebei and other places had previously been suspended due to shipping difficulties. Now that shipping conditions have improved, bulk commodity parcels, bulk small packets, and individual parcels from Qinghe, Nanguan, Zhengjiakou, Jingxian, Hejian, Jianqiao Town, Jiahe, and other agencies under the Hebei Post Office have resumed acceptance. Other procedures are the same as for other parcels. It has also been learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration has opened the main doors near Tiantong Road to facilitate parcel delivery.

### Method for Voting on Resolutions at the Taxpayers' Meeting Changed; Hand-Raising Abolished; Classification Method Adopted; Proposals Must Be Submitted in Writing Seven Days in Advance

The annual meeting of Western taxpayers is scheduled to be held at the Race Club on the 19th of next month. However, it is reported that the rules of this session, such as Articles 7, 8, and 9, will be changed. According to the voting method, hand-raising could have been used, but it was feared that it would be difficult for the chairman to count. The new rules have decided to adopt a classification method, with "For" and "Against" doors set up. A reporter will be assigned to each door to count the number of people. The number of votes for and against will be calculated based on the number of people passing through each door. If the number of votes is the same on both sides, the chairman can cast a vote as a taxpayer to decide. The new rules also stipulate that only those who have one or more votes in the voters' list can obtain the list of names from the Taxpayers' Association. When someone passes through the "For" and "Against" doors, the reporter should count the number of votes they are representing. In addition to the above three articles, the existing rules of procedure can still be used. The Shanghai Municipal Council has also solemnly stated that anyone wishing to propose a resolution or ask a question at this annual meeting of Western taxpayers must submit it in writing to the Secretary of the Municipal Council seven days before the meeting. The Council will only accept proposals with the formal signatures of the proposer and the seconder. As for motions made on the floor, they must arise directly from the agenda being discussed.

### Forgeries Discovered in the City

Recently, counterfeit two-cent National Government stamp tax stamps have been discovered in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The patterns are crude and the printing is more blurred than genuine stamps. Some people have been holding these counterfeit stamps. Because there is currently a shortage of genuine one-cent and two-cent stamps, a few shops have failed to examine them closely, resulting in accidental purchases. The Party Bureau has noticed this matter and is conducting a thorough investigation.

the thirteenth time

for principal and interest repayment, the principal repayment is 1,125,000 yuan, and the interest payment is 393,750 yuan. After consultation between the National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, an agreement was reached on discount payment. It is heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, upon the order of the head office, will make payments starting from March 31st, with Shanghai paying in six installments and also paying for remittance transfers. After receiving the order, the bank has made all preparations. Because the 31st falls on a Sunday, a regular holiday, the discount payment is scheduled to start on April 1st (Monday). All bondholders can obtain discount application forms from the Central, China, and Communications Banks.

Payment in Installments

Furthermore, the 18th repayment of principal for the 24th Year Public Bonds of the Republic of China, amounting to 400,000 yuan; the 7th repayment of principal for the 25th Year Reorganization of Guangdong Financial Public Bonds, amounting to 1,200,000 yuan; and the 6th repayment of principal for the 26th Year Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging Project U.S. Dollar Bonds, amounting to 40,000 U.S. dollars, are all scheduled to begin payment on March 31st.

The election of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors for 1940 is scheduled to be held on April 11th.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: Statement of Budget Estimates

The biggest reason for the increase is due to the depreciation of the national currency and the contraction of exchange rates, which has led to a sharp increase in the exchange allowances for staff pensions and other retirement funds that the bureau should pay according to regulations. As for the increase in the aforementioned "extra expenses in various departments," it is due to the recent decision to provide rice subsidies to lower-level Chinese staff.

London Agents: Regarding the amount of remuneration for the London agents, the bureau has reached an agreement with the agents to revise it. As a result, this expense is expected to save about 50,000 yuan this year.

Education Department: The education expenditure budget for this year, after revision, totals 3,262,970 yuan, an increase of 923,050 yuan over the previous year. The reason for the increase is largely due to the depreciation of the national currency and the rise in commodity prices. It has been stipulated that education expenditure should not exceed 2% of the total tax rate (equivalent to 2,711,400 yuan). Therefore, this year's education expenditure, excluding miscellaneous income, is estimated to require a deficit of approximately 509,590 yuan. When submitting the aforementioned budget, the Education Committee attached a proposal to abolish the above-mentioned method of limiting the amount of education expenditure. The Finance Committee did not approve this proposal. However, in view of the current abnormal situation, all education expenditure budgets for this year were temporarily approved, and the Education Committee was requested to consider raising tuition fees as soon as possible, and the heads of the Finance and Education Departments were requested to further review the aspect of saving expenses.

Prisons: The bureau has now formed a special sub-committee to consider whether the amount of food required for prisoners in prisons can be appropriately reduced.

Libraries: 20,000 yuan has been approved this year for the library to purchase new materials.

The above budgets have been submitted by the Finance Committee to the Board of Directors and passed at a meeting on the 20th of this month. (To be continued)

### Dozens of Gangsters: Attempt to Rob Gold Bars Foiled; Gold Bars Worth Over 100,000 Nearly Robbed

A large gang of robbers attempted to rob gold bars in western Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 29th). The incident occurred at around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday when the Tongfeng Silver Smelting Workshop in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, western Shanghai, was entrusted by a certain silver shop on Nanjing Road to melt gold nuggets into gold bars. At that time, the workshop had finished melting, and a number of gold bars worth over 100,000 yuan were placed under the seat cushions of a private car. The workshop sent guards to escort the gold bars. However, as the car was driving out of the lane, a large group of gangsters, about 20 or more, suddenly appeared, ten of whom drew pistols, ordering the car to stop and threatening the driver with guns. Several robbers then began to thoroughly search the body of the guards in the car. Because they found nothing, they shouted in frustration and fled. At that time, the robbers did not check the seat cushions, so the gold bars were safe and sound. Afterwards, the workshop reported to the police and the nearby Volunteer Corps headquarters. Therefore, after the incident, the Volunteer Corps once mobilized to stand guard.

Fuxin Flour Mill: Workers' Armed Fight; Injured in Hospital; Perpetrators Arrested and Sent to Court

Yu Jinzhi, a worker at the Fuxin Flour Seventh Factory, No. 101, Lane 109, Chengdu Road, had previously contracted work in the factory and hired more than 100 workers. However, Yu suddenly resigned recently, and the factory hired Xue Yougui as the new foreman. According to the regulations, the workers have no direct relationship with the factory. Therefore, when the foreman resigns, the workers also lose their jobs. At about 10 a.m. on the 28th of this month, was

the time for handover between old and new workers.

To prevent problems, the factory had reported in advance to the Xin Zha Police Station, which dispatched Western Constables No. 281, West Third Road Head, and Chinese Constables No. 2609, 2418, 486, and 2515 to be stationed. The new foreman, Xue Yougui, was also well aware that the old workers might take action during the handover. He hired two Shangtian Moving Company trucks and led 55 workers to the factory. Unexpectedly, when the trucks arrived at the gate of the Fuxin Factory on West Suzhou Road, they were blocked by more than 100 old workers, leading to

a conflict and a mutual brawl.

The weapons used were carrying poles, iron bars, spears, truncheons, and lime powder bags. In the midst of the melee, the front of the two Moving Company trucks was destroyed, with losses estimated at approximately 1,500 yuan. On the side of the new workers, twelve people, including Su Shiyuan, Pan Wenlin, Yan Junsheng, and Li Baoyu, were injured. Among them, Guo Yuanzhi was the most seriously injured. The Western Constable who was suppressing the scene was also beaten severely by these people, and was hit on the head by a flower pot, causing him to lose consciousness. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Chinese and Western Constables had to

use their guns in self-defense,

firing dozens of rounds, wounding two old workers, Liang Youwang, Huang Hong, and Huang Xuecai, as well as a passerby, a barber named Gao Jinfu, by stray bullets. They were sent to the hospital for treatment. The police also arrested four old workers who started the trouble: Liu Debiao, Hong Youzhui, Li Gaowang, and Liu Wenqi, along with eight carrying poles, three spears, one iron bar, and a quantity of lime powder, and took them all to the police station. Chinese Detective Wang Shidong then began

an investigation.

Yesterday morning, except for the injured, the other four, Liu Debiao, Hong Youguo, Li Gaowang, and Liu Wenqi, were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges of disrupting public order and presented the case, requesting a postponement. The defendants then retained lawyers Wang Yaotang and Yu Enliang to defend them in court. Judge Fu ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed to April 5th.

### Infanticide by Poisoning

Gong Xuesan, a 37-year-old Yangzhou native living at No. 271 Julai Road in the French Concession, runs a coal briquette business. Gong's wife, Ms. Wei, is 23 years old. At 4 p.m. on the 29th of this month, Ms. Wei was in bed with her second son, named Xuesheng, who was just three months old. Ms. Wei fell asleep for a moment. Gong's eldest son, named Chusheng, who is five years old, was also in the room. He saw a Lysol bottle on the table, picked it up, and poured some out to play with. The child, without knowing the danger, then saw that his younger brother, Xuesheng, was awake in bed. Chusheng then poured the Lysol into a spoon and fed it to Xuesheng, causing Xuesheng to convulse from poisoning and cry loudly. Ms. Wei woke up from her sleep when she heard the child crying and realized what had happened. She immediately told the child's father. They sent the baby to Guangci Hospital, but because the poisonous liquid had already entered his abdominal organs, treatment was ineffective. He died at 2:30 p.m. yesterday.

### Social Anecdotes

The hooligan Shi Heshang, a native of Changzhou, together with his accomplice Yang Chunlin (nickname "Little Green Dragon"), a native of Yangzhou, extorted money from Feng Chunshan, a truck driver of Tailong Coal Yard, at the southern end of Wuzhen Road Bridge on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, for parking the truck there. Feng was stabbed to death on the spot by Yang Chunlin with a sharp knife, and the arm of the worker Li Deyi was also stabbed. After the incident, Yang took the opportunity to flee, and Shi Heshang was detained. Until the night before last, Chinese Detective Weng Peiyu of the Xin Zha Police Station arrested the main culprit, Yang Chunlin, and sent him back to the First Special Court yesterday for detention pending further investigation.

Sun Dingchen, a 25-year-old youth from Jiangyin, who lives at No. 30 Huanlong Road, was adopted by his parents at the age of seven as a child bride for his same-age compatriot Cao Donglin. When Sun was seventeen years old, he expressed his opposition to this old-fashioned marriage and requested that the engagement be dissolved. Recently, Sun hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Cao Donglin for dissolution of the engagement. The court, based on the complaint, was tried in the Seventh Civil Division by Judge Li Liang. Yesterday morning, the court ruled that the engagement between Sun Dingchen and Cao Donglin was dissolved, and the litigation costs were borne by the defendant.

Lu Qikai, a native of Nanxiang and a partner at Bao Xing Pawnshop at No. 172 Route Labor神父 (Route du Père-Robert), was arrested by the French police in January for receiving stolen hats belonging to the hat-snatching gang Zhao Yuelong. He was then sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Minsheng sentenced Zhao Yuelong to two years in prison, and Lu Qikai to eight months in prison for continuously insuring stolen goods. Lu was dissatisfied with the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Third High Court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi ruled to overturn the original verdict, finding Lu Qikai not guilty.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to an article in your newspaper on March 30, which reported a news story about a wife accusing her husband of adultery. I was greatly shocked. My wife, Yin Junnong, has not returned to her husband's home for a long time. For the past three to five years, she has been living in her parents' home, which your newspaper refers to as initially living in a foreign-style house at No. 60, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai, and then at the residence at No. 553 Lafayette Road, which I originally rented for the purpose of setting up a small family with Yin Junnong. On the day of the court hearing, my wife and I went out and there was no such thing as posting bail of 3,000 yuan. The statements in your newspaper that I do not engage in legitimate work and am a dissolute person are absolutely untrue. I respectfully request that you correct the record. Therefore, I am writing to you, hoping that you will investigate and deal with the matter accordingly.

Sincerely,
Lawyer Le Junwei
March 30

### New Six Cup Table Tennis Tournament Tonight: Friendly Nations Qingyun Jia Decide Champion; Starts at 6:30 at the Eight Immortals Bridge Central Youth; Female Youths and Hualian Women First Do Exhibition Match

The first New Six Cup Team Table Tennis Championship organized by Zhejiang Industrial Bank will have the final match between the defending champion Qingyun Jia and the Friendly Nations team tonight. The two teams will decide the champion at the Eight Immortals Bridge Central Youth Gymnasium at 6:30 p.m. The tournament starts with an exhibition match between the two strong female table tennis teams, Female Youth and Hualian Women. At that time, honorary chairman Shen Shuxiong will give the awards, and Xu Jiying will give a speech. The referees specially hired Chen Linsheng, Xu Duo, Ding Du, Fu Zhongqiu, and Yu Binqi to take charge. According to the current strength of the Friendly Nations team, it is very strong. In the International Cup final last week, it was unfortunate that the lineup was wrongly arranged, resulting in losing to Qingyun's hand. Tonight, in addition to the team's fierce generals Zhang Liansheng, Wang Changhou, Gao Zipei, and Zi Zhijun, they decided to use Yang Zhaoxiang, a smashing general, and the whole team became a pure attacking player, vowing to avenge their shame. Qingyun Jia is a victorious teacher. Lu Hanjun, Li Zongpei, Zhang Zhihong and others are known for their intelligence and skill. Supplemented by the cutting hand Zhang Ying and the hard draw Lang Depei and Chen Zhensheng, their strength is becoming more and more powerful. Although the Friendly Nations team is fierce and good at fighting, it may still be difficult to resist Qingyun's edge. However, a dramatic battle will definitely have a wonderful performance. The tickets are divided into 50 cents, one yuan, two yuan, and three kinds of yuan. The list of four teams is as follows:

(Female Youth) He Xuchu (leader), Huang Tongyin (captain) Zhang Yongru, Huang Guangmei, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin, Xu Ruilan, Yang Chengdi, Tao Lanying, Wang Mingxia, Qu Lanzhen,

### International Badminton Doubles Tournament: Chinese Champions Win Men's Doubles Title

### Western Youth Association's Humiliating Anti-China Performance

The Circus performance hosted by the Western Youth Association at the gymnasium the other night, featured a segment titled "Shanghai Street Vendor" in which the performers dressed as vulgar Chinese people and put on an abominable show. The rampant insults against the Chinese people were outrageous. This was worse than the old days when foreigners, unaware of China's current situation, used queues and bound feet to represent China. The Chinese audience in attendance booed, but the organizers and performers ignored them. As a result, some audience members left their seats and exited. Mr. Bratt, the Western Youth Association's athletic director, has always had good relations with the Chinese athletic community. It is deeply regrettable that such an event insulting the Chinese people occurred while Mr. Bratt was away from Shanghai and under the direction of Xia Bao. It is hoped that the athletic community and public opinion will urge the Western Youth Association authorities to rectify this situation and guarantee that similar events will not occur again. Otherwise, to maintain national dignity, the Chinese community should withdraw from all competitions organized by the Western Youth Association to show their refusal to cooperate.

### Commercial News: Finance: Hong Kong Gold Prices Rise; Gold Sets New Record, Breaching the 5,400 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the Shanghai cash market suddenly experienced a vigorous surge, especially at noon, surpassing the 5,400 yuan mark. As the end of the month approached, many short positions held by parties without strong backing were gradually being liquidated. Meanwhile, foreign exchange rates were stable for British currency but tight for American currency, and Hong Kong gold prices reported significant increases, leading to increased activity among new bullish investors. The morning started fairly stable, opening at 5,360 yuan. Due to the need to redeem cash collateral, the long positions were squeezed, and the price dipped to 5,340 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market tightened, the price gradually recovered. At noon, buying intensified, and Hong Kong gold prices surged, causing the price to soar past 5,400 yuan, reaching 5,413 yuan. The noon closing price was 5,410 yuan, an increase of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday settlement holiday, the price rose further to 5,435 yuan. The total transaction volume in the first half of the day was over 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold rose by 5 yuan, reaching 545 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

Intense Buying at Noon

Although the US dollar exchange rate fell sharply from the opening price per tael (ten liang) in the morning, the market was unable to rally due to the month-end financial situation. Instead, there were more sellers, causing the opening price to rise by only 5 yuan. Gold shops bought ten taels from silver shops for 5,360 yuan. Subsequently, some spot gold dealers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the gold, and a certain securities firm also made significant purchases, driving the price up by 20 yuan. The securities firm bought ten taels from silver shops for 5,380 yuan. However, gold shops and silver shops took the opportunity to sell aggressively, and two-cash exchange shops showed a strong desire to sell. At that time, the US dollar exchange rate eased, and buyers hesitated, gradually lowering the price by 40 yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to cash exchange shops for 5,340 yuan. After that, a certain silver shop suddenly reversed course and started buying, stabilizing the market slightly. The price hovered around 5,350 yuan. Unexpectedly, around 11:10 am, buying intensified sharply in the market. Cash exchange shops switched from selling to buying, securities firms resumed heavy buying, and silver shops continued to purchase. In addition, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and the number of sellers decreased, causing the price to jump by 73 yuan. Cash exchange shops bought 30 taels from gold shops for 9,413 yuan. The noon closing price was slightly lower at 5,410 yuan, with cash exchange shops selling 20 taels to securities firms. As a result, the closing price was 55 yuan higher than the previous day. The price fluctuated by 73 yuan throughout the day. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday settlement holiday, it was reported that the price had been pushed up to around 5,435 yuan outside the market due to buying by securities firms and cash exchange shops. Cash shops sold their gold at higher prices than the spot market, while buying prices were reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and trading was minimal.

Jewelry Gold at 545 Yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in the morning was still 540 yuan at large Tonghang stores. Around noon, the price was increased by 5 yuan. There were no further changes after that. As a result, the large Tonghang stores revised their price to 545 yuan. The new Tonghang stores set the same price as the previous price. Buying prices were reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Chinese Merchants Continually Buying, US Dollar Exchange Rate Tightens Again in the Afternoon

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The informal market for British and American currencies only lasted for half a day and tended to be calm. However, Chinese merchants mostly held bullish views and continually bought forward contracts. Fortunately, Chinese banks still had a willingness to supply, so the market was able to remain stable. In the morning, overseas British and American exchange rates fell by 7.375 points, causing the market to return to a state of stable British currency and tight American currency, at 4 shillings 1 40625 and 6.0625 yuan, respectively. Shortly after, foreign banks showed a willingness to sell, and Chinese merchants engaged in some buying, but the situation had already eased slightly. At this time, the US dollar strengthened to 6.09375 yuan. Later, speculators continued their activities, but Chinese banks such as Overseas Chinese and Mainland banks supplied each other, offsetting their positions. As a result, the market was once very stable. However, around 11 am, the number of sellers decreased, causing the market to soften again. Therefore, by the noon closing, the US dollar had tightened again to 6.0625 yuan. The British gold price was still quoted at 4 shillings 1 40625 (equivalent to a British-US exchange rate of 3.51375 yuan). As a result, the British exchange rate was stable compared to the previous day, and the US exchange rate was tighter by 0.09375. The futures market trend was similar to the spot market for British gold, with no significant changes from the previous day. The US dollar exchange rate, however, tightened again.

In the morning, London large-denomination notes were stable for both near-term and long-term contracts. New York silver was also stable. London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rates for British currency against US dollars, Shanghai currency, and French currency were all stable. The US dollar depreciated slightly by 7.375 points against British currency, decreased by 1 jiao against Shanghai currency, and decreased slightly by 4 points against French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings 1 40625 for British gold and 6.0625 yuan for US dollars, reflecting stable British currency and tighter US currency by 0.09375 compared to the previous closing prices, due to the depreciation of the foreign exchange rate. After the opening, foreign banks showed a strong willingness to sell, and the market eased slightly. It was reported that speculators sold US dollars for April delivery at 5.9375 yuan. At that time, spot US dollars could be settled at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced without change. The balance tax on silver was announced to be one cent higher. After that, although Chinese merchants continued their activities, Chinese banks and foreign banks still showed a willingness to supply, resulting in a long period of market stability. It was reported that speculators bought British gold for April delivery at 4 shillings 046875, and also bought US dollars for the same month from Mainland China at 5.90625 yuan. Around 11 am, the willingness of sellers weakened slightly, and the market situation tightened again.

However, by the noon closing, British gold was at 4 shillings 1 40625, US dollars were at 6.0625 yuan, British gold for April delivery was at 4 shillings 046875, US dollars were at 5.90625 yuan, British gold for May delivery was at 3 shillings 96875, and US dollars were at 5.75 yuan. As a result, compared to the 7th, spot British currency was stable, US currency was weaker by 0.09375, next month's British currency was stable, and US currency was reduced by 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Again

Yesterday, there was strong demand for British and American gold pounds, as the sudden rise in Hong Kong gold prices caused the Shanghai spot market to surge. There were many sellers of British gold notes in the morning, but the market suddenly turned firm in the afternoon. American gold notes also saw increased demand due to the softening of the pound price, generally rising for repurchase. The morning price rose to 16.27 yuan, then briefly softened as some profit-takers sold off their holdings. However, the price soon rebounded, reaching 16.42 yuan in the evening market. Hong Kong notes continued to trend downward. There was some supply of French franc notes. Dutch and Philippine notes remained in strong demand. Japanese gold notes had already started to rise, reaching 1.285 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes broke through the 1 yuan mark again, reaching 1.005 yuan in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 1 yuan each, British gold notes and Dutch notes rise by 1 jiao each, Philippine notes rise by 5 fen, American gold notes rise by 2 jiao 6 fen, Hong Kong notes fall by 5 li, and French franc notes fall slightly. The remaining prices were unchanged.

### Rediscount Rate Rises Again by Five Yuan

Yesterday, the rediscount rate for bills of exchange rose sharply, exceeding 60 yuan per thousand yuan. In the morning, it rose from 61.5 yuan to 64 yuan. The afternoon was relatively stable, remaining at 64 yuan, a further increase of 5 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers Association remained at 1 jiao 8 fen for both the morning and afternoon markets, without any changes.

### Grains: Siamese Rice: Over 28,000 Bags

The rice market this morning saw various kinds of foreign rice rise by 5 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao due to continued active trading by local and visiting merchants. First-grade Saigon rice traded at 44.5 yuan, second-grade at 41 yuan, fire-milled rice at 43.5 yuan, and small-milled rice at 40 yuan. However, speculative and retail traders were not as firm as before, and instead of buying more, they took advantage of the high prices to sell their holdings, creating a crowded market. This caused visiting merchants to become wary, and both mainland merchants and local shops hesitated to buy more, taking a wait-and-see approach. Sales gradually slowed down, the market became more crowded, and the overall situation reversed, with prices declining. As a result, not only were the morning gains erased, but prices also fell further by 6 or 7 jiao. The closing prices were only 43.5 yuan for first-grade Saigon rice, 40 yuan for second-grade, 39.8 yuan, 43 yuan for fire-milled rice, 42.5 yuan, 39.12 yuan for small-milled rice, and 39 yuan. Only mixed broken rice and rice bran, due to limited supply and broad demand, remained strong, increasing by about 5 jiao. Although glutinous rice briefly tightened in the morning, it softened due to the influence of foreign rice. Liyang special yuan rice sold for 38.5 yuan, which was also 4 or 5 jiao lower than the previous market. The informal market for thick and thin japonica rice also reportedly tightened first and then weakened, but ultimately remained flat, similar to the previous situation.

A large quantity of foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Danish merchant firm Cheng Yang Line's Nuihock Meihe Wheel brought over 2,500 tons of foreign rice from Siam, totaling over 28,000 bags. It arrived at the port at 4:30 pm yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou around 6:00 pm. Unloading is scheduled to begin this morning. Today, 2,566 bags of foreign rice, loaded onto Jardine Matheson's Yisheng Wheel, will be transported to Yantai (Zu).

Spot sales of foreign rice were active in the morning. In addition to mainland merchants continuing to buy, merchants from both North and South came to the market to inquire. Sellers took advantage of the low exchange rate to raise prices, increasing the prices of Saigon, Siam, and small and large milled rice by about one yuan. However, as prices rose, floating traders sold their holdings, and the release of futures rice also had an impact. The spot rice market had already retreated by 3 or 4 jiao by noon. The return of futures rice was due to scattered long positions being closed out. The morning market had failed to rise in tandem with spot rice. The afternoon saw a surge in selling pressure, and the market fell sharply. Therefore, the return of futures rice was 5 or 6 jiao lower than the previous day. The highest price for second-grade Saigon rice was 50 yuan, and the afternoon price was 49.2 yuan. Small-milled rice was 48.5 yuan, once quoted at 49 yuan, and fell to 47.2 yuan in the afternoon. First-grade Saigon rice opened at 52.75 yuan. The total trading volume for futures was 500-600 tons, and for spot rice, 5,000 bags. The sales price of British-China Shipping Company's original packages of foreign rice is as follows:

April delivery for first-grade Saigon rice: 52.70 to 52.50
Spot delivery: 52.00

April delivery for second-grade Saigon rice: 50.00 to 49.50
Spot delivery: 49.20 to 49.00

Delivery in 2-3 weeks for small-milled rice: 48.50 to 48.30
Spot delivery: 48.00 to 47.20

April delivery for Saigon broken rice: 41.30

Rice and paddy market in Wuxi: Since the 29th, the weather has cleared, and boats carrying rice are arriving in succession. Negotiable packages have shifted to a wait-and-see approach. Although rice mills are selling, they need to wait for previously placed orders to be fulfilled before discussing further business. Some sellers are eager to unload their goods, and rice prices have been falling sharply in recent days. High-quality white japonica rice has fallen from 26.5 yuan per dan to within the 25 yuan mark. High-quality brown rice has fallen from 25 yuan to within 24 yuan, a decrease of 1.35 yuan. Japonica paddy rice has fallen from 13 yuan per dan to 12.3 yuan, a decrease of 7 or 8 jiao to 1 yuan. On the 29th, the market price of brown and white japonica rice rebounded by 5 or 6 jiao. According to a review of this year's red market, the Rice Association has sold over 70,000 dan of rice to Japanese merchants in batches on behalf of its members. In addition, a large quantity of food rice in this city, along with flat rice, totals over 100,000 dan, which should offset the more than 200,000 dan of paddy rice stored for the New Year. Based on the current stock of paddy rice in various warehouses and factories, there should be nearly 600,000 dan. This shows that since the beginning of this spring, the supply has not been weak. If there is no large outlet to Japanese merchants, the accumulation will increase, and rice prices will inevitably fall again (Liang).

### Flour and Wheat Tend to be Quiet; Over 6,000 Tons of New Foreign Wheat Arrive

The flour market was quiet yesterday. Since the expiration of the flat-price flour promotion, the factory price had increased to 13.8 yuan, leading to a decrease in retail sales in this street. Each store's daily wholesale volume was only 5,000-6,000 bags. Merchants going to places like Beiyang and Tianjin found it difficult to make a profit on the shipments, and the merchants' price was as high as 15 yuan, resulting in sluggish trading. The opening price for the returned old-brand flour was 13.72 yuan, and the afternoon price was 13.7 yuan, slightly weaker than before due to depleted inventory. It was reported that the "Warship" brand transfer inventory could not be exported and was priced at only 13.3 yuan. The "Double Lion" brand was priced at 13.22 yuan. The factory price was still 13.8 yuan. In addition, 3,300 bags of flour will be shipped to Yantai today.

The wheat market was also quiet yesterday. Recently, due to tight credit conditions, new囤戶 were rarely seen, and exporting merchants and Japanese factories showed little interest. It was reported that Fufeng Factory had a new ship of fixed-price wheat arrive, totaling over 6,000 tons, which is currently being unloaded. Another 8,000 tons of American wheat is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month, and more will follow. However, the national wheat situation is such that existing inventory is depleted, and new supply has not yet arrived, making it difficult for the market to ease. Yesterday, Fufeng sold 1,000 bags of wheat to Changzhou at a price of 23.5 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Merchants Order Directly; 20-Count Double Horse Yarn: Market Enthusiasm Runs High, Prices Rise Again

The yarn market continued to rise, with prices rising sharply. This was because Hong Kong merchants directly purchased 20-count Double Horse yarn from Shenxin No. 9 Factory at a spot price of 980 yuan. As a result, market enthusiasm ran high, and some buyers became even more eager, making the market even tighter. The market price gradually rose. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn initially traded at 1,045 yuan and closed at 1,061 yuan, an increase of 21 yuan from the previous day. However, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets were weak, so there were also sellers trying to unload their holdings. The previous day, Shenxin Factory offered 1,000 bags of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 980 yuan and 150 bags of 20-count New Heavenly Maiden yarn at 988 yuan, all for cash payment, and were purchased by Hong Kong merchants.

The spot yarn market opened stable in the morning. It was reported that British and American exchange rates had tightened, and the situation had tightened slightly. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,045 yuan. Subsequently, it was reported that the US dollar had strengthened, and bulls were very active, buying more shares and boosting the market price, reaching 1,064 yuan. The price then pulled back slightly after closing. It was reported that there was increased fatherly encouragement in the afternoon. The total trading volume for the day was 3,560 bags. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 21 yuan. On the 31st, 18 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, 15 bales to Hong Kong, 115 bales to Guangzhou Bay, 10 bales to Haikou, and 720 bales to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each merchant is as follows:

Tonghang: 1,995, Hong Kong: 1,230
Yunnan: 280, Ningbo: 55

Total: 3,580

### Cotton Market Sees Little Progress

The raw cotton market was very quiet. The factory showed no signs of improvement, so although the yarn market continued to rise, the cotton market was not affected at all. This was because the price of raw cotton was declining and cheaper. The current situation of raw cotton is as follows:

Another message: Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet in the morning, but the market was relatively firm. Later, due to the selling of spot goods and the dumping by some overseas cotton merchants, the market weakened. As a result, the closing price rose by 2 points for near-term contracts and fell by 4 points for long-term contracts. India fell by 1 rupee, including forecasts. Egypt was stable.

The trading of Shanghai spot foreign cotton was subdued due to the month-end and tight credit conditions. Traders showed little interest in buying raw cotton. The factory also showed no intention of buying. It is unlikely that there will be any improvement within the day. The factory price for the cotton market yesterday, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6.0625, is as follows:

20-count American Midling: 288.90
20-count Below Grade: 277.50
32-count: 304.70
32-count Below Grade: 293.50
42-count: 308.50
42-count Below Grade: 297.00

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans Stalled

Yesterday, the trading of yellow beans was very scarce. Buyers believed that there was a possibility of future supply sources being疏通, so they took a wait-and-see approach, seemingly expecting something. However, sellers believed that transportation obstacles might not be easily eliminated, so they remained firm and refused to loosen their grip. As a result, the market stalled and trading was scarce. Only some retail traders in this street slightly embellished the market by trading 200 bags of Wuhu yellow beans, over 100 bags of Anqing yellow beans, 80 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans, and one cart of Jiangbei green beans. The prices were not significantly different from the previous market.

### Raw Peanuts Fall by Ten Yuan

The local raw peanut market has been in decline recently due to sharply falling production prices, abundant inventory, and sluggish sales to merchants. The market price could not be sustained. Yesterday, over 100 bags of Bengbu raw peanuts were sold at a price of 36.7 yuan to 34 yuan, a sharp drop of 10 yuan from the highest price.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Fluctuates; Kawakita Milk Gains Huge Profits

The securities market yesterday was weak, indicating investor uncertainty. Only搶帽子 trading was relatively lively, while formal trading remained scarce. The market should have declined due to the rising gold and environmental factors, but spot prices could not be manipulated, so they rebounded slightly after falling. The establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime was not enough to stimulate the market, and most people viewed it with indifference. Therefore, fluctuations in the debt market remained very small. Yesterday's trading saw small drops as intraday long positions were liquidated. The Type C debt also broke below the 9 yuan mark, but there were no large sellers in the market. In the afternoon, short covering was more active than long liquidation, so the market price rebounded slightly, fluctuating up and down without any significant changes. As a result, the price fell slightly by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 12.6 yuan.

The 30th shareholders' meeting of the British-owned Hutchison Bank's Krao Rubber Company will be held on April 11th. At the same time, the final dividend will be distributed at 1 jiao 2 fen of national currency per share, for a total of 2 jiao 2 fen of national currency for the entire year, including the interim dividend.

The 1939 profit of the British-owned Kawakita Milk Co., Ltd. reached over 330,000 yuan of national currency, which, together with the accumulated balance from the previous term, totals over 399,000 yuan of national currency. After distributing a dividend of 1 yuan 5 jiao of national currency per share, totaling 60,000 yuan of national currency, and setting aside a legal reserve of 30,000 yuan of national currency, the remaining amount will be rolled into the next term.

London, 29th (Friday) dispatch: Today, in the Chinese foreign debt挂牌 market, only the Jinghu Railway bond rose by 1 pound to 21 pounds. The rest were stable.

London, 29th (Friday) dispatch: Today, in the掛牌 market for British-owned Far East companies, only Gu Raklim Pang Rubber shares rebounded by 3 pence to 19 shillings. The rest were unchanged.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Raw Sugar Spot Price Rises Again by One Yuan

The sugar market yesterday reported from the Netherlands that the price of coarse white sugar was 8.925 Dutch guilders per KG C.I.F., down 7.5 points. The local association's price盘稍 saw a slight rebound. The spot price for No. 24 coarse white sugar was 62.8 yuan at local warehouses and 62.7 yuan for new goods and 62.5 to 62.3 yuan for old goods at foreign warehouses, up 3 or 4 jiao.

The price of the local factory's雪白 sugar was 62.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. The price of the domestic sugar from Dongxiang raw sugar was 42.5 yuan, higher than before. Qingchen gradually stabilized, but there was no sign of easing.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Arrives in Succession

The bituminous coal business, although it had developed slightly in the previous week, entered a sluggish and dull state again yesterday. As new goods arrived in succession, merchants in this street and客家 tended to wait and see. However, sellers, due to high costs, remained firm and unwilling to easily sell, resulting in quiet trading and a stalemate. The previous day, Dalongxing arrived with 2,200 tons of Karkhada block coal, which was stored in a concession warehouse. The同業 price was 230 yuan per ton for screened blocks and 220 yuan for coal dust. The warehouse charged its own freight and handling fees.

### Textiles: Eastern Cloth Cornering Causes Prices to Rise; Domestic Cloth Prices Also Increase

Due to it being the end of the month yesterday in the domestic cloth market, sales were good and hoarders were holding onto their stock, causing a lack of supply on the market. Cornering of eastern cloth caused prices to rise, and the domestic cloth market also showed strength. White fabrics, fine cloths, fine twills, and coarse cloths were in high demand among dealers. Selling prices increased by one to five jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloths also increased by one and a half to five jiao. In the afternoon, eastern cloth prices rose again. Domestic cloth quotations varied. The volume of gray fabrics traded on this street was nearly 100,000 bolts, bleached and dyed cloth over 200 pieces, Guangdong and Fujian dealers traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, Zhejiang and Jiangxi dealers traded cloth from Ewo and Lun Chang totaling over 200 pieces, Tianjin dealers traded over 50 cases of cotton cloth and bleached foreign yarn cloth, and Anhui northern ports dealers traded over 3,000 bolts of bleached and dyed cloth.

The rising trend of eastern cloth continued strongly. White fabrics and fine cloths rose by about one yuan per bolt both in the morning and afternoon. Fine twills rose by five jiao. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at a high price. It reached 30 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, and closed at 30 yuan and 4 jiao. Mid-range Color Ball and Trumpet brands were particularly scarce and in high demand, rising to 30 yuan and 1 jiao. Foreign firms placed orders for about 2,000 pieces of fine cloth for the next month, with Dragon Head starting at 31 yuan and reaching 31 yuan and a jiao. Mid-range brands were quoted at 30 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Demand on this street was very strong. Four Gentlemen Serge rose to 9 jiao and 5 shi, with trading for next month opening at 9 jiao, 4 fen, and 2 li and a half. Market sentiment was extremely strong.

### Rewriting Old News: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (440)

(From this newspaper dated the twelfth year of Tongzhi during the decadent Qing Dynasty)

Organizing the Book Collection

The Tianyi Pavilion library of the Fan family in Ningbo has long been renowned for its vast collection. However, due to the chaos of war, it has gradually deteriorated. The clan elder, Zongtai, ordered over ten descendants to check the catalog and organize the books. After three months, they had only processed less than one percent of the collection. Nevertheless, they had already borrowed over two hundred yuan from the River Works Bureau's funds. As the River Works funds come from shop and property donations, shopkeepers have enthusiastically set up donation barrels along the streets. If this property donation money were used for disaster relief in Yan, Yu, Qin, and Jin provinces, everyone would eagerly contribute. Using this money to remove manure and clean the streets, while not urgent, could still be considered a measure to prevent disease, as each person sweeps in front of their own door. However, first removing the old soil mounds from the base of the wall behind the government office has already cost considerable funds. Now, they are also removing old soil mounds in front of the government office, which seems to take at least half a year. Furthermore, using these funds to organize the Fan family's book collection? Is it appropriate to use public funds as financial support for the Fan family's descendants? The government office's informants were well aware of these complaints. They reported to the prefect, who then instructed that the work be suspended until funds could be raised. The Fan family members are said to be lamenting the on-and-off nature of the project.

Catching an Imp

Last night, a live "Imp of Impermanence" was captured on the north bank of the Ning River. Patrolmen took him to General Ge at the You Sheng Temple, who sent him to the county magistrate. Magistrate Shi immediately held court. The imp was found to be from Cixi. He and an accomplice, one dressed as the Black Imp of Impermanence and the other as the White Imp of Impermanence, painted their faces and let their hair down. They waited by the newly opened river at night for lone travelers to pass by, then jumped out and danced to scare and rob them. This had been going on for many days and they had gained quite a bit. Yesterday, they saw a woman passing by and were about to rush up, but the woman jumped into the river, fortunately surviving. Her companion informed the patrolmen, who then captured one of them. The White Imp of Impermanence's whereabouts are unknown. The magistrate ordered the captured imp to be beaten with one thousand strokes and detained for one month, it is said.

### On the "New Life Movement"

— Zhang Mengzhao

The New Life Movement is a national life reform movement. It was initiated by Chairman Chiang in Nanchang in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Its purpose is to eliminate habits of our nation that are unsuitable for the times and environment, and to move towards a life that is suitable for the times and environment. In essence, it seeks to rationalize the lives of the people, using the traditional Chinese virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as guiding principles for daily life. This movement is overseen by the New Life Movement Promotion Association and has now been implemented throughout the country. The New Life Movement before the war was magnificent for a time! However, how many people could truly practice the rules of the New Life? In the isolated island of Shanghai after the war, the people have long thrown the rules of the New Life to the four winds! The enjoyment of life is extravagant and indulgent! Restaurants and dance halls are filled with singing and dancing! In the alleys and corners, the sound of mahjong tiles is deafening! Using the special environment as an excuse? To live a decadent life! As for the decline of will! The weakness of spirit! Foreigners are amazed and consider it a miracle! While brave soldiers on the front lines are risking their lives to defend the country, shedding blood! The isolated island of Shanghai, far from the embrace of the motherland, actually has such absurd phenomena? Isn't it a miracle? As for the displaced and exiled compatriots who have lost their homes! Living in shelters, their lives are disciplined. Simple food, worn-out clothes, the work and rest of the refugee production agencies are timely, and the collectivized life is disciplined and rationalized. The spirit is solemn and tense, which is truly in line with the times and the New Life. Because the refugees have suffered the cruelty of war, everyone has a common hatred of the enemy and practices a hard life! Because of this, there has never been any shameless behavior among the refugees. But the so-called intellectual class, the so-called wealthy merchants, are only concerned with petty gains, accumulating and hoarding, and do not know "propriety", or "righteousness", are corrupt and shameless, and are becoming more and more aggravated today, and cannot be saved! Confucius said: Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country. If the four pillars are not established, the country will perish! Throughout the history of Song, there were treacherous and shameless officials above, and muddled and ignorant people below, which eventually led to the loss of the country and the mountains! The people become slaves! Can we not be afraid?

The New Life Movement is a movement of revitalization and revival, of being strict with oneself, restraining oneself, and reforming oneself! Everyone stands on their own post, buries themselves in their work, respects propriety, righteousness, knows integrity, shame, observes discipline, and takes responsibility. It is something that must be done in person, not only in times of national crisis, but also after the completion of the victory against resistance and the establishment of the country!

The New Life Movement, most of all, requires respecting one's integrity, and thinking about national disasters and family feuds at all times! Will the country be restored (liberated)? Will the family prosper? Sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, work hard and strive to achieve it, give up hobbies (such as smoking, drinking, etc.), abandon entertainment, eat coarse food, wear homespun cloth, and strive to make life militarized! Rationalize daily life! Be frugal, hardworking, and train your spirit! Read more books by ancient sages and loyal ministers, cultivate one's personality, "be unyielding in the face of power, not tempted by profit, and unwavering in poverty and humility," and be sure to follow them faithfully! As I write this, I am reminded of Boyi and Shuqi (the two sons of the ruler of Guzhu), who, because they were ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou, gathered ferns on Shouyang Mountain. Although they eventually starved to death, their personalities and spirits still have a vigorous vitality today! Truly, can the country be destroyed? But the will must not be lost! If the will is not lost, the country may not be destroyed! If the will is lost, the country will ultimately be unsavable. Practicing the rules of the New Life and eliminating the old corrupt habits is self-help and teaching the country. In other words, saving the country is saving oneself, and do not indulge in the sounds, colors, dogs, and horses, burying oneself, and being despised by foreigners.

### The New Life in Guilin

— Xin Xu

People are full of strength and vitality, and the city is full of order and cleanliness.

When Guilin is mentioned, the first thing people praise is the so-called New Life. The simplicity and strength of the people here are beyond the reach of people from other provinces. Strength has always been a characteristic of the people of Guangxi. Although their bodies appear short, they are as strong as iron. Their dark brown faces show that they have been exposed to the sun and fully absorbed ultraviolet rays. People walk upright, their whole bodies seem to be full of vitality, and they have a great and fearless spirit. In recent years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the municipal government to promote the New Life Movement, the entire city of Guilin, whether in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, or other aspects, is in line with the principles of the New Life and full of vigor.

The clothing of the citizens is exceptionally simple. Most of their clothing materials are local gray cloth. On the street, you can see that most people are wearing a set of gray Zhongshan suits, which are ironed so that there is not a single wrinkle, and are very neat and clean. Under their feet are a pair of not very expensive leather boots, and their hats are ordinary casual hats. In winter, they also add a dark-colored cloth coat. This is the appearance of ordinary people. As for the soldiers, they wear dark blue line cloth, not gray cloth, and this is the same from officers to soldiers. Although modern women are not completely absent here, they are indeed rare. Female students in schools are never seen wearing gorgeous clothes. Male students all wear blue uniforms, neatly dressed, and their hats are the same as military hats—no, they are militarized all over. Looking at their appearance, dark brown faces, very strong, and roughly the same as soldiers, except for the color of the uniforms. Not only is their appearance like this, but their lives are indeed militarized. You can see it in the classroom and in the dormitory. There is nothing on the bed except a mat and a quilt, and it is the same in winter and summer. Guilin City also has a special feature, that is, citizens are prohibited from perming their hair. Wearing high-heeled leather shoes is regarded as a prostitute, so ordinary citizens do not wear high-heeled shoes.

The people of Guangdong and Guangxi are most famous for their emphasis on food hygiene. Guilin is of course no exception. Furthermore, due to the strict management of the authorities, there are special health inspectors in ordinary restaurants to check. Every summer, there is always a large-scale food hygiene movement. If food is found to contain bacteria, in addition to supervising the disinfection of the store, a fine will also be imposed as a punishment for damaging the health of citizens. In summer, the soda and ice cream sold in coffee shops are relatively hygienic. In addition, the fresh meat and fish stalls in the morning vegetable market are set up at a specified time and in a specified place.

Citizens have always gone to bed early and risen early. Since the implementation of the New Life, they have gotten up even earlier. After getting up, they take a walk, exercise, and take deep breaths. Many citizens are also accustomed to running in the morning. Therefore, in the morning in Guilin, there are always many people running in large strides on every street. This may be why most people in Guangxi are strong and sturdy. The houses of the citizens are short and clean. The furnishings in the houses are mostly elegant and clean. Imported goods are almost extinct. The signs of shops on the street are not as messy and scattered as in Shanghai. Under the guidance of the Health Department of the Municipal Government, citizens carry out cleaning and sweeping of their houses once every season.

Regarding the aspect of citizens traveling, in addition to the traffic rules issued by the police station, there are also large warning signs "Walk on the left" posted on the telephone poles all over the streets and alleys. If you are careless and walk on the right side of the street, a "traffic person" will come to correct you. It is difficult to find a rickshaw on the streets of Guilin. As for the sedan chairs used in the north, they have never been seen. This is because they are strong and hardworking and cannot bear to have people pull or carry them. When they walk, they only see them rushing forward without turning their heads, but they are strangely energetic. Residents of Guilin always walk in single file when gathering, dispersing, and buying tickets, and there is never any conflict.

The logo of the New Life is shield-shaped: the meaning of the shield indicates self-defense. The center of the shield is a "compass," the meaning of which indicates that life has a certain standard. The shield has four colors: red, yellow, blue, and white. Red indicates the spirit of struggle, enthusiasm, courage, and progress. Yellow indicates a bright and selfless attitude. Blue and white are the meaning of the blue sky and white sun.

### The "Four Musts" Creed for Women in Xindu

— Yan Jie

In Xindu—Chongqing, a wartime city, our women have enthusiastically promoted and realized the "New Life Movement". How do they implement it? They have a creed of "four musts". Now I write it down below, so that women in the "isolated island" can use it as a model.

(1) Must Have Faith

They all believe that the New Life Movement is a good way to save the country, save the nation, and save themselves, and then the New Life Movement can generate power.

(2) Must Have the Determination to Promote It

They believe that everything in society is small at first and then becomes large, near at first and then becomes far. But many Chinese people make the serious mistake of being able to speak but not act, so they must get rid of this bad habit and make great determination and sacrifice to proceed unimpeded.

(3) Must Persevere

They deeply feel that the Chinese people's five-minute enthusiasm has long been ridiculed by all nations. But they believe that if promoting the New Life Movement is only promoted today and forgotten tomorrow, what use is it? Therefore, the women of Xindu believe that they should use a persistent mentality to constantly encourage themselves and persuade their family members and children, so that everyone can be cautious and not forget, and constantly strive to promote it. In this way, the New Life Movement will move towards the bright road of "daily renewal, daily renewal".

(4) Must Extend It to Others

The nature of women is gentle and kind, and they are also the linchpin of the family. If they can set an example in everything and extend it to others, they can not only persuade their children with love, but also move their relatives and friends with sincerity, and set an example for their neighbors, and can also extend it to the public and move the whole country.

### New Life and Tuberculosis Prevention

— Ping

The prevalence of lung disease in our country is of course due to the lack of public health and the lack of popularization of all tuberculosis prevention facilities, which is undeniable, but the reason why most patients often lead to tragic results is not due to the above reasons, but to two other major reasons: one is the patient's delay in seeking medical attention, and the other is the patient's excessive reliance on medicine.

Delay in seeking medical attention and reliance on drugs are common problems among general lung disease patients in our country. The reason is that they do not yet know the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, so they make one mistake after another. During this tuberculosis prevention movement, in order to reduce the tragic pain suffered by general lung diseases, we really have to strike the morning bell and beat the evening drum to wake everyone up and make everyone have a deep understanding of early diagnosis and early treatment.

(1) Early diagnosis, because the earlier lung disease is detected, the easier it is to treat, and the faster it is to recover and restore health. Not only can you avoid all pain, but you can also reduce infection to others, so this early diagnosis is very important for protecting personal health and social stability.

(2) Early treatment, lung disease is not an incurable disease, but there are no special drugs at home and abroad. The mortality rate of lung disease among Europeans and Americans has gradually decreased because they have improved specialized treatment, so that often desperate patients can also escape danger and preserve their lives, and the earlier this appropriate treatment is, the greater the hope of restoring health.

In this tuberculosis prevention campaign, we have two ardent hopes: one is that from now on, due to the efforts of all parties in tuberculosis prevention work, lung disease in our country can be gradually reduced, and the other is that in the future, luxury patients can reduce tragic results, but how can we truly reduce lung disease in our country? I dare to say bluntly that only by popularizing early diagnosis and eliminating the source of infection can we reduce lung disease. How can we reduce the tragic consequences for patients? I dare to say bluntly again that only early treatment can save the general patients from being trapped in a tragic fate. General patients, do not hesitate on a wrong path, and quickly look at the road to health and move forward!

### Inaugural Address

— Yi Min

The strength of a country's economy depends on the development of its national products. It is undeniable that the national industry of our country is immature and its products are backward. During the Former Qing Dynasty, the national goods industry never escaped the stereotype of official supervision and merchant management, and was restricted everywhere, leaving no room for free development. Since the People's Republic of China, the national goods industry has developed day by day. Although it has undergone various disturbances and setbacks, the foundation of the national industry has become more and more solid. The daily necessities of the people, which were all supplied by imports in the past, can now be made domestically, and their quality is even better than that of imports. Since August 13th, although inland transportation has been difficult, patriotic people must use domestic goods as wealth for the products they use, and they are happy to buy them even if the price is doubled. What is particularly rare is the great success of sales in Southeast Asia and the Americas. In the past year, 50-60% of the products of national goods factories were sold to Southeast Asia. Although it is due to the patriotism of overseas Chinese, it is also due to the excellent quality of the products, which are welcomed by all parties. In this case, the hard work and spirit of many national goods industrialists is not wasted, and the future of the national industry is greatly hoped for. This newspaper has been publishing a special issue on national goods for five years, advocating and promoting it with pen and reading, and it is deeply welcomed and praised by people in society. In this extraordinary period, it is necessary to urgently restore it, so it is specially continued. The content is as follows:

(1) National Goods News (all news about the progress of the national goods industry and all the dynamics of the national goods industry, etc.)

(2) New National Goods Products (introduce new products and describe their advantages in detail)

(3) Overview of National Goods Factories (one factory per week)

(4) Sales of National Goods Abroad (especially focusing on Southeast Asia)

(5) Common Sense of Household Daily Use (with the aim of promoting national goods)

As mentioned on the right, this journal is willing to make a small contribution to the national goods industry with cotton strength, and deeply hopes that like-minded people in society who are enthusiastic about national goods will support and assist each other, and express their great opinions to promote the development of the national goods industry. This is the beginning of the resumption of publication, and I would like to state a few words to seek correction from all readers.

### National Products in Southeast Asia

— Ju Chen

National Products Sell Well in Southeast Asia

According to a Havas news report on the 2nd of this month: The Nanyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Development Company), run by the Japanese, will increase its capital from 20 million yen to 40 million yen this month to expand its business in Southeast Asia. After reading this news, we feel that this is a futile effort, because Southeast Asia can almost be said to be the place with the most overseas Chinese, with about 8 million people. Moreover, these overseas Chinese have a relatively high level of knowledge and a very strong sense of national consciousness. Their concern for the motherland's war of resistance does not diminish because they are far away. Therefore, the boycott of Japanese goods is extremely enthusiastic and widespread. Taking Singapore as an example, there are more than 2,000 people secretly investigating whether overseas Chinese are buying Japanese goods. Those who violate the rules are first warned, and then fined to donate to national salvation funds. If they sell Japanese goods, their ears are often cut off. In fact, overseas Chinese are all patriotic, and with this method of mutual encouragement, no matter how much capital the Japanese increase, Japanese goods will not be able to rise. At the same time, the overseas Chinese are eager to be patriotic, so national products sell especially well in Southeast Asia.

Population and Land of Southeast Asia

The Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippine Islands, Vietnam, Siam, Burma, etc., are collectively referred to as Southeast Asia. The area of ​​the land is estimated to be more than 3.8 million square kilometers, and the population is estimated to be more than 10.57 million. The products are coffee, tea, cocoa, coconut, rice, etc. The commercial port is Singapore, which can be reached in ten days from Shanghai. There are many postal ships of various countries coming and going, and the commerce can almost be said to be controlled by overseas Chinese.

Procedures for Shipping to Southeast Asia

In one month of November last year, national products transferred to Southeast Asia and Batou Sumatra for sale reached 50 million yuan, breaking the record for national products sold abroad; this shows that the sale of national products to Southeast Asia is not affected by the war of resistance. The national products sold in Southeast Asia are mainly light industrial products and agricultural products, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, paper umbrellas, cigarettes, soap, matches, ham, vermicelli, MSG, medicinal materials, leather, etc. In September of the 7th year of the Republic of China, one of the articles in the National Product Certification Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated: "Any industrial product manufactured by the people of the Republic of China, with excellent quality and conforming to the provisional national product standards, may directly apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, or be transferred by the local competent authority to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the issuance of a national product certificate..." Article 7 states: "Any industrial product with a national product certificate may apply for a national product industrial export certificate when exported abroad, but it must be certified by the original factory that it is indeed a product of the factory. The commodity inspection bureau or inspection branch of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall be the competent authority for issuing the aforementioned export certificate. In places where no inspection bureau or inspection branch is established, the customs supervisor shall sign the certificate, and if there is no supervisor, the tax commissioner shall sign on behalf of the supervisor." Article 8 states: "Anyone applying for a national product industrial export certificate shall first obtain an application form from the nearest competent authority, fill it out item by item, and submit the bill of lading, invoice, and certificate issued by the original factory of the goods for inspection, together with the certificate fee, for verification and issuance. The aforementioned export certificate shall be applied for one certificate for each distribution location, regardless of whether the industrial product is one or more types, and the certificate fee shall be 2 yuan in national currency per certificate." Article 9 states: "The competent authority for issuing the export certificate mentioned in the preceding article shall, if there is no false information in the application form and attachments, issue a national product industrial export certificate according to the filled-in application form." and so on. This is because after the war of resistance, the situation is different. Some places are temporarily submerged, and some places are also controlled. Fearing that inferior goods will be mixed into national products, those who have previously obtained a national product certificate from the former Ministry of Industry must re-apply for a national product certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to show seriousness. Moreover, after every six months, a report form should be made, because there are often changes in various places during the war, which cannot be permanently applied. At the same time, a national product certificate list should be obtained from the Chamber of Commerce for each batch of goods transported. If we transport it to Southeast Asia, it will be regarded as enemy goods, and the loss will be small. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce temporarily issues the National Product Certificate List, one of which states: (Any industrial product manufactured by the national factories in the Shanghai urban area that have obtained the National Product Certificate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and wish to sell it abroad or in various ports in China may apply to the Association for a National Product Certificate List in accordance with these measures. The scope of the Shanghai urban area is temporarily limited to the safe area within the two special zones, and it will be determined at any time according to the actual situation. Article 3 states: Any industrial product that has not yet obtained the National Product Certificate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs may also apply to the Association for a National Product Certificate List in accordance with these measures due to the urgency of transportation and sales, but from the date of obtaining the List, it shall apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a National Product Certificate in accordance with the regulations within two months. Other detailed procedures can be inquired at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.)

Points to Note for National Product Merchants

Since national products sell well in Southeast Asia, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are happy to use national products because of their patriotism, our national product manufacturers and farmers must always be more motivated to avoid disappointing overseas compatriots. Based on what I have seen, there are several points that should be reflected upon:

(1) Is the quality of the goods excellent? Shoddy products are easy to cause resentment.

(2) Is the price self-restrained? Although the interest is low, if you can sell more, you can make more profit.

(3) Is the delivery on time? If the goods cannot be delivered on time when an order is placed, it often causes many difficulties for the other party, resulting in a loss of credibility.

(4) Is the packaging solid? If the decoration is not exquisite, it will lose its beauty, and if it is not solid, it will be easy to break and decay when traveling across the ocean.

### Affordable Socks

— Pu Chang

The socks for a family, young and old, are quite expensive when calculated at the current prices. Therefore, smart people do not allow any slack in even the smallest parts. According to my experience, only Shenyu brand hemp socks are the most affordable (produced by Shanghai Renyu Machine Knitting Factory). Although I am a very clumsy person and not worthy of being called a smart person, and even less like a specialized person who can analyze the texture and explain the reasons, my experience and facts tell me very clearly. At the same time, friends who have worn Shenyu brand hemp socks have said the same. The most obvious feature of Shenyu brand hemp socks is that the texture is thin, uniform, and clean. When worn on the feet, they are refreshing and smooth, looking almost like silk socks. They are comfortable and fit everywhere. After many washes and sun exposure, the color is still like new, and they do not lint at all. They are certainly stronger than silk socks and even stronger than ordinary hemp socks. You who have always worn silk socks may also want to try them. The price of hemp socks is much cheaper than silk socks after all. Past history

Introduction to National Product Factories

### General Situation of Merlin Canned Food Factory Excellent and Hygienic Products Can Be Called Formidable Rivals of Imported Goods Sells Well in the UK, US, and Southeast Asia Truly Wins Glory for National Products

— Zhong Wangshu

Past History

Merlin Canned Food Company was founded in the 22nd year of the Republic of China with a capital of 50,000 yuan. It increased to 100,000 yuan in the 23rd year, 150,000 yuan in the 26th year, 200,000 yuan in the 27th year, and 400,000 yuan in the 28th year. The total annual turnover has also increased from 70,000 yuan to more than 1 million yuan.

Current Situation

The current chairman is Mr. Dou Yaoting, the manager is Mr. Tu Kaitai, the factory director is Mr. Chen Runshui, and the engineer is Mr. Ikhler from Europe. The outline of its manufacturing and sales is recorded as follows:

(1) The types of products are divided into fruit jam, soy sauce, baking powder, vegetables, fish and meat, chicken and duck, and fruit. There are many detailed items, which cannot be listed in detail.

(2) The main markets for sales before the war were Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin, including Nanjing and Hankou, which accounted for an equal proportion. Only 15% were sold abroad. After the war, the Yangtze River basin market was naturally lost, but new avenues have been established to replace it, namely, promoting sales to the Southeast Asian islands and increasing exports to the United Kingdom and the United States. Before the war, exports to the UK and the US accounted for about 10% of the total turnover, but now they have increased to 25%. Exports to Southeast Asia also account for 25%. There are many reasons for this good performance, but the excellent quality and hygiene of Merlin products are the main reasons. Regarding sales in this city, most of them are Western restaurants and food merchants, and the sales volume accounts for half of the total. Recently, the sales of products have been booming, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. Although the selling price has risen slightly due to the sharp increase in costs, it is still three times cheaper than imported goods.

(3) Manufacturing Procedures The following is a description of the manufacturing process of green beans, one of its main products: 1. Material Procurement: Green beans are originally a Western variety. Merlin ships bean seeds from France and distributes them to nearby rural farmers, and purchases them from them during harvest. 2. Shelling: After being transported to the factory, the bean shells are removed by machine (bottom picture). 3. Classification: The beans are classified manually according to size. 4. Cleaning: The beans are washed with water. 5. Cooking. 6. Cleaning: Washed again. 7. Canning (top picture): The cans are filled by machine, and the weight of each can is equal. There is no air in the can, so it can be stored for a long time. 8. Steaming: Placed in a steam pot for disinfection. Statistically, it takes only one and a half to two hours from the transportation of raw materials to the canning, which cannot be said to be very fast.

Children's Weekly

### How to Use Spring Break?

— Yong

As usual, the schools in this city will have a seven-day spring break starting from April 1st. Now let me talk about the meaning of spring break: Every day, we bury ourselves in our books, and we inevitably feel tired in our minds. Therefore, we want to take advantage of this warm spring weather to adjust our body and mind. This is originally a good meaning. Therefore, during each year's spring break, many children gather a few classmates for a trip; and many other children follow their parents on the occasion of returning to their hometown to sweep the tombs, staying in their hometown for a few days. But I know that there are also not a few children who waste this spring break arbitrarily; in other words, the school gives them seven days of vacation, and every day they just wander the streets and mess around with naughty children, and even spend every day in theaters or game venues; spending the spring break in this way completely loses the meaning of the school's spring break. After reading this article, I hope to correct it if there is, and encourage it if there is not, especially at this time, it is impossible to take a hike or travel, or to return to the province with parents; therefore, it is easier to embark on this wrong path.

Since hiking trips and the like are impossible, does that mean that we have no opportunity to appreciate nature or find some extra-curricular knowledge during this year's spring break? This concise conclusion is completely wrong. The following two methods can give a satisfactory answer to this question.

1. You can go to the local public library or museum, etc.; during school hours, you do not have enough time to observe in detail, but during the spring break, you can. Other things, such as reading newspapers, can also be done carefully because there is more free time during the holidays. Can't these help you acquire extra-curricular knowledge?

2. To appreciate nature, the several parks in this city, such as Zhaofeng Park, etc., cannot be said to be insufficient. In the same way, you can also invite a few friends, just like going on a hike or trip in the past, bring a ball, and play on the grass. When you are tired of playing, sit on the grass and eat some refreshments; after eating, you can bring your books and hold an on-the-spot sketching competition. This method is sure to be happily implemented by everyone.

Children, finally, I hope that you will not be immersed in joy every day during this spring break, and you should also find some time every day to review your homework. When it is raining and you cannot go out, you may invite a few classmates to your home to hold some calligraphy competitions, arithmetic games, etc.

How to use spring break? According to the above methods, you will no longer feel meaningless or uninterested.

### Flying a Kite is a Beneficial Game

— Lang

"Clothes are wet with apricot blossom rain, faces are blown by gentle willow wind." In this sunny and breezy season, it is the perfect time to enjoy ourselves. As for enjoyment, it is very complicated, but we should seek what is noble and beneficial to our body and mind. Only the game of flying kites is the best. Dear children, your school is about to have spring break. During this holiday, you may take some time out from your studies to try flying kites. That is much better than other useless games.

Kites are also known as paper eagles. According to the story in Duyi Zhi: "When Hou Wei surrounded the city, Jian Wen made paper eagles and flew them into the sky to send an emergency message to the outside." Zouchu Lu also records: "Li Ye of the Five Dynasties made paper eagles in the palace, and used a thread to ride the wind as a play. Later, he used bamboo as a flute on the head of the eagle, so that the wind entered the bamboo and the sound was like a zheng, so it was named a kite." From this, we can know that the manufacturing of kites is very early, but recent kites do not tie bamboo as a flute, but are still called kites. The method of making them has many types, such as figures, fish, birds, etc. When they are released by the wind, they are lifelike. If you fly a kite at night, you can also tie a small lantern on it, commonly known as a lantern kite. When the lights are lit, it seems to be competing with the stars in the sky, which is very spectacular.

On a sunny day with a gentle breeze, it is very happy for children to invite their companions to fly kites. At the same time, because they have to pull the kite up, they have to keep winding and unwinding the thread with their hands, and their feet have to run. Since the hands and feet are in motion, all parts of the body are also active at the same time, exercising the body, strengthening the muscles and bones, and improving health a lot. Moreover, in the shape, it arouses the lofty will and supreme tendency of children, and embodies a sense of enterprising in the game. Therefore, this kind of entertainment is very desirable. However, it is not easy for children who live on isolated islands to find a square to fly kites. Then it is better to hold it on the school grounds or playground.

### Specific Gravity

— Jin Zhen

Today is Sunday again. It has been a bit spring-like these days, and it is getting light especially early. When the clock struck seven, everyone in Ah Hui's family got out of bed, but today the bell rang eight times, and Ah Hui was still lying in bed. On weekdays, he had already gone to school to attend classes. His mother had urged him several times, and he slowly got up from the bed, muttering, "Today is a holiday, there is nothing to do after getting up, why not sleep a little longer." These three sentences were heard by Ah Ming, and he shouted loudly outside: "Brother! Come quickly! There is something fun here! Come and see!" He thought that perhaps this could speed up his brother's movements. The lazy Ah Hui was so shouted by his brother that he quickly put his clothes on, without even buttoning them, dragged his shoes, and ran out of the room with sleepy eyes, saying in his mouth: "Where? Where?" Who knew that on the table were placed two cups of the same size and depth, filled with water, and a piece of wood floating in one cup. Ah Hui was so angry.

"Is this supposed to be fun! You lied to me!" Ah Hui complained to his brother with a resentful tone.

"Don't be angry, you should know that there is a fun trick in these two cups. Let me ask you first: Which of these two cups is heavier?" Ah Ming asked him with a smile.

Ah Hui thought carefully: two cups of the same size, filled with the same water, and a piece of wood floating in one cup. He asked, "Of course, the cup with the wood floating in it is heavier." After he finished speaking, he turned around to wash his face.

"Don't go, you should know that in fact it is not what you imagined. The weight of the two cups is the same." Ah Ming knew that his brother would not guess correctly.

"I don't believe it." "Okay, I can try it for you right away." He went to find a basket and a scale. He carefully weighed the basket, then put the cup in the basket and weighed it again, being very careful not to spill the water in the cup. Then he weighed the cup with the wood in it again, and the result was not what Ah Hui said. Ah Hui was of course defeated, but even though he didn't guess right, he wanted to know why he didn't guess right? And Ah Ming was also willing to tell him:

"These two cups were originally the same weight, and the water inside was also the same weight. But one of them has a piece of wood floating in it. According to ordinary people's eyes, of course, they would think that the one with the wood is heavier. You should know that in a cup filled with water, how can you put a piece of wood in it? For example, in a basket full of apples, it is so full that it cannot be fuller. If you put another pear in it; when you let go of your hand, the pear will fall to the side of the basket, unless you take an apple away and then put the pear in. This is the same principle. When the wood is put down, some water has to be squeezed out, and the amount of water is less than the amount of water in the cup without wood, but the most interesting thing is that the amount of water squeezed out is exactly equal to the weight of the wood. Therefore, although the contents of these two cups are different, the weight is the same." How did you know that the amount of water squeezed out is equal to the weight of the wood? Ah Hui asked his brother.

"This is based on the principle invented by the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes, and other scientists have proved that his principle is correct. Even now, it is still correct. That principle is: all floating objects (such as wood, cork, etc.) because they are contained in a container (such as a cup), and the weight of the liquid (such as water) discharged is equal to the weight of the object itself." Speaking of this, the voice of his mother calling Ah Hui to wash his face interrupted the conversation.

### Children's Works

### Do You Have a Heart That Cannot Bear to See Others Suffer?

Yan Shaohua, a 14-year-old elementary school student

Dear merchants who hoard rice, grain, coal briquettes, etc.:

Please forgive my rudeness in suddenly writing this letter. I have no other intentions. All I want to ask is this sentence: "Do you have a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer?" Please answer me!

"Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." This sentence comes from Mencius. At that time, it was a time of mutual wars between the states, with corpses all over the fields and blood flowing into ditches. Of course, Mencius, as the second sage of China, could not bear to see such a situation, so he said this!

However, today's China, especially Shanghai, is no less than it was at that time; although the war has shifted to the west, how many refugees have increased in the concessions, and how many beggars have frozen to death on the streets?

Let's not talk about that for now, but what is the matter with the recent surge in rice, grain, and coal briquettes? Please answer me!

The fat of the poor has been squeezed out to fill your pockets, which has become an indelible fact; is your heart as black as coal briquettes?

How many people have felt difficulty because of the skyrocketing rice prices, and even committed suicide, jumping into the Huangpu River...

Please reflect on it, what would you do if you encountered this situation?

Since Mencius said, "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer," then please take out your "heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." But I don't know if you have a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer? My words are finished here, and what I earnestly desire is: I respectfully hope that you will release your conscience!

### Black Brother (12)

— Yimu

At that time, a blue lightning bolt rose from the east, looking like a knife. It swept across the sky three times and then dimmed. The sun was setting in the west, descending to the horizon like a blood-red ball.

The surging sound of the Golden River went straight to Hans's ears. He stood on the edge of the gap where the waterfall was pouring down, looking down. The water reflected the blood-red sunset, looking like flames, spitting out endlessly there. The sound of the water grew louder and louder, like thunder, making his head dizzy. He trembled, untied the water bottle from his belt, and threw it into the rapids. He suddenly felt a chill that went straight through his limbs. He struggled for a while, then shouted loudly and fell down. The sound of the water drowned out his shout. The surging water rushed over a "black stone."

Poor Little Geller had been guarding in the house, waiting for Hans to return, waiting anxiously. Who knew that he wouldn't come no matter how long he waited, which made him panic. He immediately went to the prison to inform Hihua of everything that had happened. Hihua was so happy when he heard the news, saying that Hans must have become a black stone this time, so the gold in the Golden River could belong to him alone. However, Little Geller always felt very sad in his heart, crying all night long. The next morning, after he got up, he saw that there was no bread or money in the house, so he went to another goldsmith to work, working hard every day and with excellent results, so he soon accumulated a sum of money, enough to pay Hihua's fine. So he went to the prison and gave all the money to Hihua. Hihua was immediately freed and safely left the prison. Hihua was very happy, thinking that the gold in the Golden River would soon be in his hands, but Little Geller begged him bitterly to find Hans, at least to know his whereabouts.

### Crime "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

What is sin? The Bible gives us many answers. The most common names are "lost path," "transgression against God," "debt," "sickness," "bondage," "arbitrary." We do not assume that the ideal of sin is unique to Christians. Christian conscience has a special feeling about sin, but this ideal of sin is the most universal. We find it in historical records; ancient Egypt, Silver Africa, Mexico, all had many kinds of sacrifices; rites of atonement are a major source of Greek poets' dramas, Iphigenia, Ares, and Antigone's novels. Reading Socrates' works, we know that he also expressed tacit approval for the things that warned him against doing evil and reminded him to do good. Plato's "Last Judgment" also came from this. The Roman poet Ovid admitted, "I see the better things and approve of them, but I follow the worse." At that time, Hales, Julian, and others all believed that the disasters of the country were directly caused by the sins of their people. Those who disobey God are punished with their whole family. Like Achan and his family's cattle and sheep, they were all killed. The result of sin not only affects the families of offenders but also affects their descendants. When evil is committed, later generations are guilty because of it. The people of Israel and Judah suffered many punishments because of the sins of their kings. God's law lost much of its effect because people practiced superficial rituals, because religion developed the greatest danger, like the Pharisees who quibbled over words, adhered to the letter of the law, and did not follow the spirit of the law. The Hebrew prophets rose up to say, "Does God not delight in obedience more than in sacrifice?" "O man, God has shown you what is good; what does he require of you but to do justice, love kindness, be humble, and walk with God?" Sin caused the Son of God to die. We must not take this lightly. To take it lightly is to blaspheme the way of the cross of God, because people have mutual relations, and those who have not sinned cannot avoid being punished with those who have sinned. "No one lives for himself, and no one dies for himself." Many people in the world now realize that the source of all troubles is sin, and the only power to subdue this sin is the gospel of Christ Jesus. All good people bear their sins and acknowledge them, just as Paul confessed himself to be the chief of sinners. When we read the biographies of those loyal masters, we know that we all have the same idea, that is, we feel that no matter how hard we try in our lives, we still offend God in thought, word, and deed. "What we ought to do, we have not done." This is a common sin we commit. I live my life comfortably, but I have forgotten many of my duties. Today, we claim to be faithful disciples of the Lord, but at the end of the day, I am afraid that many will not be able to answer these questions: "Have you sacrificed to preach the gospel to the Gentiles? How have you tried to save your fellow sinners?" "What examples have you set for drunkards, gamblers, and prostitutes? Have you often truly prayed, examined yourselves, and repented? Have you set aside a few percent of your income for the Lord?" When we think of these questions, if we are truly honest people, we must admit that we have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. I hope we will repent as soon as possible, for it will be too late when the night comes. If you want to study in detail, 1227

### Stars Talk About the Secrets of Success

— Yong

Claudette Colbert: "Before entering the film industry, I worked as a teacher in a certain state in the United States for several years. Later, because I didn't like this profession, I quit. This path allowed me to concentrate on my film career and created my current position."

Paul Muni: "Being able to listen to other people's advice is the only secret for us actors to embark on the path to success. As for me, the main reason I can succeed is because I can accept my wife's guidance in all aspects."

George Brent: "The reputation of stars is indeed very important, but if a star only knows how to work hard for reputation, he will not succeed."

Basil Rathbone: "Silver screen work is originally difficult enough, but if we have a prudent attitude, are we still afraid of not succeeding!"

Cary Grant: "I think the most important condition for the success of stars is that they should have patience. In other words, they should not have too high expectations. Which of today's big stars did not climb up from a low position by relying on their continuous efforts?"

### Li Yanxiu Returned North Yesterday Afternoon

— Haisheng

—Two Thoughts Expressed Before Leaving

Li Yanxiu stopped performing at the Gengxin Theater, and stayed for more than 20 days while waiting for the ship schedule, until yesterday when she took the Shuntian round north. The ship departed at half past twelve in the afternoon. She boarded the ship with her parents at eleven o'clock in the morning. Many people came to see her off. Although she expressed her farewell to her friends in Shanghai, she was very happy to return to her home that she always missed. She thanked all her friends who came to see her off with a smile. Before getting off the ship, the reporter had a brief conversation with her. She said two thoughts: (1) Shanghai is better than Beiping, because there is no flying sand here, the population is large, and there are things here that are not in the north, such as double-decker buses. (2) It is more difficult to sing operas in Shanghai than in Beiping, because the standard of Shanghai audiences has improved, and they pay very close attention to old operas. On the contrary, Beiping is changing its customs and gradually welcoming new operas. Moreover, there are many local dialects in the words recited on the stage that Shanghainese do not understand. For example, a very interesting sentence cannot arouse the audience's interest, which will make the performers feel bored. Talking about the truth, the wheel was about to untie the cable, and the reporter said goodbye and came out.

### Ye Qiuxin Joins Kuide Troupe

— Jing

Ye Qiuxin, a mother of two children, left the Tianyunlou Xinliu Troupe and stayed at home to fulfill her responsibilities as a virtuous mother and good wife. She had no activities. Recently, the Kuide Troupe stopped performing at the Royal Palace Grand Theater and returned to Tianjin yesterday. Zhao Zhongsan, the leader of the troupe, talked to Ye Qiuxin and settled the matter. When the Kuide Troupe performs in Tianjin, she will be hired to join the stage and given a script for a new play, "Happy Enemies," which will probably be performed when she takes the stage. Qiuxin is scheduled to leave around the 17th of next month. Perhaps Qiu Yunyan, a Kun actress who is seeking further studies in the north, will travel with Qiuxin, but Qiu Yunyan is going to Beiping. According to her, she does not plan to form a team to perform immediately after arriving in Beiping. She wants to bury herself in hard work, first strive to study drama, and then seek a greater future. Someone invited Qiuxin to cooperate the day before yesterday, but she had already joined the Kuide Troupe, so it did not happen.

James Cagney, who returned from the war, lost his original job. He drove a rental car for a living. He was sentenced for selling smuggled alcohol while delivering goods for a customer. After Glenda George paid the fine for him, he cooperated with Humphrey Bogart, who was selling smuggled alcohol, disregarding the law and acting recklessly. He also received help from Jeffry Lynn, a graduate of law school. From this story, we can see the playwright's dissatisfaction with the current society. Although James Cagney finally upheld justice and shot Humphrey Bogart, in fact, he did it for Patricia Lane.

The director's handling is very excellent. (1) Tense and vivid. For example, the fight between Paul Kelly and James Cagney at a nightclub in Hunter? James shooting Humphrey Bogart, etc. (2) Delicate. Introducing the appearance of James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Jeffry Lynn; James returning home after the war; and the love between Jeffry Lynn and Patricia Lane, etc. (3) All are exquisite and lovely. Rich in emotions. The scenes of James boxing Jeffry Lynn; James in a bar after bankruptcy; and dying on the steps of the church after being shot are all touching. (4) The process is concise and beautiful. For example, the carnival scenes after the end of the alcohol ban, and the collapse of the building and the citizens' close-ups when James went bankrupt.

Among the actors, except for Jeffry Lynn's role, which is weaker, the rest are very hardworking.

Entertainment News (1) Cartoonist Jiang Dongliang, in addition to his recent paintings, is also engaged in publishing.

### Twenty Kinds of Ballads

— Xiuyan Drawing

(3) Fate in Tears and Laughter

Everyone is already familiar with the plot of Fate in Tears and Laughter.

"Fan Jiashu is a young man studying in a university. He is a guest in Beiping and falls in love with a female storyteller singing drum ballads - Shen Fengxi.

It is not easy to please everyone by adapting a recent novel into a ballad and broadcasting it through orchestras, but Fate in Tears and Laughter is successful.

### The Young Hero Xia Cungu

— Haixing

Adapted into a Children's Historical Drama

After "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," Wei Ruhui immediately began writing "Zheng Chenggong," which is connected to "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," but at the same time, he also wrote a three-act children's historical drama "Xia Cungu." According to Wei Ruhui, Xia Cungu was a young hero in the late Ming Dynasty. He was from Songjiang, had great ambitions, and joined the army at the age of fifteen. He followed Mr. Chen Zilong in launching an uprising in Taihu Lake and had many heroic battles. At the age of seventeen, he was captured by the Qing army and martyred in Nanjing. Although it was only a short two-year struggle, there were many moving materials that could inspire the youth's loyalty and patriotism.
