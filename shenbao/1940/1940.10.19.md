### After the Reopening of the Burma Road, a Large Amount of Military Supplies Are Continuously Transported to China, Totalling 1,500 Tons, Divided into 500 Vehicles, Forming 16 Teams; Wang Shijie Issues a Statement Urging Allied Nations to Increase Assistance

Rangoon: The Chinese Consul here announced this morning that the first batch of transport vehicles entering China via the Burma Road since March has safely arrived in Kunming. These military transport vehicles left Lashio seven minutes after the British reopened the Burma Road at midnight yesterday. The Chinese Consul stated that the transport vehicles carried various goods, including some munitions, and were not attacked by Japanese aircraft on the way from Lashio to Kunming. It is reported that hundreds of other new American trucks left here last night by railway to Kunming, which will help transport the large quantities of goods that have been piled up in Burma since March to the interior. (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

Lashio, Yesterday: After the reopening of the Burma Road at midnight last night, another 1,500 tons of military supplies, divided into 500 vehicles, forming 16 teams, departed for Kunming today. Mr. Statte, a British Customs official here, was already exhausted by 5 pm today, having issued over 600 permits. The goods listed in these permits are all kinds of military supplies to be transported to China, such as munitions, aircraft parts, and other important items. (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

Manila: The Manila Bulletin has learned that 53 American aircraft destined for Chongqing will be shipped to Burma from Manila tomorrow. Twenty of them have been here for several months, awaiting the reopening of the Burma Road. As for the American aircraft originally intended for Thailand, which were recently ordered by the State Department to be detained here, they will remain here for a long time. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)

London: Reuters Far East correspondent, former editor of the North-China Daily News, Mr. Green, reported that seven minutes after midnight, the first batch of 4,000 trucks waiting in Lashio for the reopening of the Burma Road began their perilous journey to Kunming. All drivers had a farewell banquet before departure and promised to hold a banquet with wine after arriving in Kunming, firmly stating they were not afraid of Japanese bombing threats. The trucks are all painted earth-green and most will travel at night. At the same time, a large number of workers are stationed along the way to repair any damage. Since the road was blocked three months ago, the Chinese have firmly believed that it would reopen, so military and other materials, except gasoline, were piled up on the Burmese side like mountains. It is estimated that there are 100,000 tons of goods currently stored in Lashio and 500,000 tons in Rangoon. Since the Vietnamese side has ceased freight to China due to the Vichy government's capitulation to Japan, the Burma Road has become the only route for China to access the sea, with twofold value in importing and exporting Chinese products. The road can be considered one of the world's great engineering projects, with a total length of 772 miles, of which 124 miles were built by the Burmese government from Lashio to the border. 181 miles west of Kunming were built two years before the war, as part of the Chinese government's national road construction plan. The remaining 367 miles must pass through mountains 3,000 to 8,000 feet high, as there is no other way to go. No matter how difficult, it must be built forward. In addition, heavy rains often occur from July to September every year, causing landslides and other incidents, making it extremely dangerous. Although the road started in October 1937, it was not fully completed for light motorcycles until April 1940. In the past two years, it has been greatly reformed, with comfortable rest areas built along the way, the road surface improved and strengthened, and ditches dug to drain rainwater. At present, the entire journey can be completed in six to seven days, which is quite comfortable. Most of the road within Yunnan Province is only 300 miles away from the Vietnamese border, so it is quite threatened by the new air bases that Japan has acquired in Vietnam. However, since the Chinese have overcome natural obstacles to build this road, they must be confident in their ability to keep it open. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)

Chongqing: Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie recently issued a statement praising the British for reopening the Burma Road and warning the people that the Japanese will launch intense air raids afterwards. At the same time, he also called on friendly nations to give China greater assistance. Wang said, "Three months ago, after the Burma Road was blocked, British and American newspapers strongly condemned this British action, and it was difficult to find a newspaper that agreed with it. Blocking this essential international commercial route was formally opposed by the US government. At that time, world public opinion was extremely pessimistic, but I believed that the Anglo-Saxon concept of justice would ultimately prevail, so I considered this plan to be temporary. However, when I expressed this view to many people at home and abroad at that time, I was greatly criticized. Today, my belief has proven to be correct, and I am very gratified. The reopening of the Burma Road should be regarded as another guarantee of the Anglo-Saxon concept of justice and order. In the past three months, we have indeed experienced some dark days, but our people are determined to endure any sacrifice for the benefit of China and world order, which makes us very optimistic. At present, we have four to five million armed personnel fighting on the battlefield, and more than 40 million refugees waiting for relief. The Japanese have repeatedly bombed our civilians, cultural institutions, and charitable organizations. Now that the Burma Road has reopened, the Japanese bombing will continue and intensify. Therefore, on the one hand, I should warn our people to increase their efforts, and on the other hand, I should warn our true allies to provide China with timely and effective assistance, so that this war for freedom and independence can be won." Luo Jialun, president of National Central University, also broadcast this morning, saying that the reopening of the Burma Road has further consolidated Sino-British friendship and demonstrated the end of the British appeasement policy. Luo also asked the British and Americans to give China effective assistance. (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

Lashio: The Burma Road was reopened last night at midnight, transporting war materials and other supplies to the National Government of China. The first batch of transport vehicles departed from Lashio for China seven minutes after midnight. This batch of vehicles included 60 American trucks, carrying all kinds of goods and munitions. Reporters were granted special permission to see the goods, but could not disclose their contents. As the first batch of transport vehicles left for China, news arrived from Rangoon that four American ships had arrived in that port in the past week. According to well-informed sources, these ships were all fully loaded with important materials to be transported to the Chinese government. (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

Lashio: It is reported that the vanguard of 2,000 trucks carrying more than 100,000 tons of wartime supplies needed by the Chinese defense forces has arrived at its destination today via the swift journey of the Burma Road. The first batch of 200 trucks has arrived in Kunming. The drivers said that the journey was peaceful. At the same time, another 50,000 tons of war materials, including airplanes, are still piled up in Rangoon, ready to be transported to China's wartime capital by 3,000 trucks. When these trucks return, they will carry tungsten, tung oil, tin, antimony, pig bristles, and other Chinese products through Rangoon to various countries, mainly the United States. Precautions have been taken in Lashio against possible air raids by the Japanese. (International News Service dispatch on the 18th)

Tokyo: Today, all newspapers here prominently published news from Lashio, London, and Washington regarding the opening of the Burma Road, and all pointed out that the British decision would only increase suffering. Miyako Shimbun claimed that Britain's reopening of the Burma Road, causing itself to be involved in the China Incident, is tantamount to digging its own grave. Hochi Shimbun, regarding Britain's reopening of this road, stated, "Britain and the United States are now bound to nail themselves to the cross together." (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

### Hong Kong Will Adopt Its Original Stance

Hong Kong: The Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, Mr. Smith, stated on the 17th that Hong Kong will resume the stance it adopted before the closure of the Burma Road regarding the transportation of armaments and other munitions. There were some restrictions on the transportation of munitions before, and it is not yet known whether we will revise them. (Dispatch on the 18th) Hong Kong: According to a statement issued by the Colonial Office today, the Hong Kong government intends to restore the trade status between Hong Kong and China to what it was before the Burma Road Agreement was established. This means that from midnight today, all bans on the transportation of goods to China, including gasoline, kerosene, and railway materials, will be lifted, but the ban on military uniforms and bullets will remain in effect, as this is another issue promised by the British last year and is not related to the Burma Road Agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)

Hong Kong: Hong Kong authorities announced today that the embargo on munitions and other goods passing through Hong Kong to China will remain in effect and will not change until the current Anglo-Japanese agreement is terminated. This was published by Qu as an editorial commenting on a Japanese report from Tokyo, which described Japan's sharp reaction to the lifting of the ban on munitions transported to China via Hong Kong. According to the official, the export of certain goods that are not related to the Burma Agreement will still be prohibited, but we will also restore the old status of Hong Kong before the embargo on munitions leaving the border. (United Press dispatch on the 18th)

Lashio: Since Britain reopened the Burma Road despite opposition from Japan and the Axis powers, hundreds of trucks fully loaded with 100,000 tons of war materials set off early this morning in a long line of rumbling vehicles for the Chinese interior. These trucks departed seven minutes after midnight yesterday, carrying weapons, munitions, aircraft, gasoline, oil, medical supplies, and other raw materials. Most of these raw materials come from the United States. At the same time, all sectors of Burmese society learned that Britain is now considering canceling the ban on munitions from Hong Kong to the mainland. People generally recalled that Tokyo had warned that if the munitions embargo on the Hong Kong-Guangxi road was lifted, Japan would take a strong stance. Countless secret branch roads are built along the Burma Road, so that transport vehicles can safely avoid when Japanese bombers appear. However, observers said that it will be easier for the Japanese to attack the road than before because they have built new bases in Vietnam, but Chinese military leaders are completing air defense facilities along the road, greatly reducing the above-mentioned convenience. Knowledgeable people believe that the strong Far Eastern policy held by the United States is the encouraging factor in the British decision to reopen the Burma Road, and the capitals of Britain and the United States must be watching the changes in the situation afterwards with the greatest concern. (International News Service dispatch on the 18th)

### Japanese Troops in Shenzhen Prepare for Retaliation

Hong Kong: Well-informed sources here said today that the Japanese troops stationed in Shenzhen north of Hong Kong are preparing to occupy Shayuchuan (transliteration) to retaliate against the reopening of the Hong Kong-Guangdong Road and to cut off all military supplies transported from Hong Kong to the mainland. The Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong has protested to the British authorities in Hong Kong.

— Editorial: The Distress of Wealthy Bourgeoisie in Shanghai

In the current state of affairs, those who struggle for a living should undoubtedly feel the most distress and vexation. Yet, as the environment and facts reveal, the changing international situation brings anxiety and worry to the wealthy, even more so than to those struggling for a living. This is simply because of insufficient foresight and a fear of gain and loss. Is it wise to hoard foreign exchange? Given the current tumultuous times, with no end in sight, can one be sure it won't be forcibly seized? Is it wise to hoard gold? Not only is it sought after by all parties, but its circulation in the market is already limited. Even if gold is hoarded, can one be sure it won't become "dead money"? Therefore, they turn to hoarding daily necessities, seeking to exploit the general poor. This seems to be a sure bet with no risk of loss. Little do they know that the wealth gained is ill-gotten, and the prices are already high. Can one be sure that the rise will never end and that there won't be a reversal? Thinking this way and that, they don't know what to do. This is the true predicament of those who own assets today.

Buying foreign exchange and hoarding gold has been profitable since the war began, so the wealthy flocked to this path. But the control of foreign exchange everywhere in the occupied areas makes those who own foreign exchange tremble with fear. The British restriction on the import of British currency has further left those who own foreign currency feeling lost and disoriented. As for gold, if the environment changes, it will share the same fate as foreign exchange. Moreover, if war breaks out in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the channels for using foreign exchange will inevitably become narrower, and the gulf between them will deepen. People do not want foreign exchange unless they have a real need. So will those who own foreign exchange take their drafts south to Sydney or east to New York? This is not only a small minority of the propertied class but also a practical impossibility for the vast majority. At this point, it is truly a case of having too much wealth and being better off with less.

I believe that the solution to this problem is not difficult, as long as the premise is determined, the rest can be easily solved. Therefore, what I ask is, how will China's war of resistance turn out? It is unreasonable to say that China will not be defeated by the war in the first year of the hasty response but will be defeated by the fourth year of the long and experienced war of resistance. Nor will it be defeated in the era of the appeasement policy of various countries towards Japan, but rather when democratic countries are working together to maintain world justice and are helping China, which is resisting for the sake of justice. Again, the success or failure of the war depends directly on military affairs and indirectly on the economy. China's vast land and abundant resources are superior conditions for the war of resistance. Now that it has the support of the two major powers, Britain and the United States, which hold the financial reins of the world, even without material assistance, the guarantee of credit alone is enough to add color to China's finances. Moreover, the fact will never be mere lip service. If China's finances are sound, then the legal tender itself will not be a problem. If the legal tender itself is not a problem, then it is unnecessary to think of escaping capital and buying and storing foreign exchange and gold.

Speaking of speculation, its name is as if great profits are easy to obtain, but in reality, losses are easy and profits are difficult. Moreover, most of those who engage in speculation are laymen. Laymen want to get rich, and they have money but nowhere to use it. They use it for speculation, thinking it is better than gambling. Little do they know that it is no different from gambling, and they can lose their fortunes in an instant. Therefore, speculation is ultimately not as stable and reliable as investment. Investment is indeed for profit, but if one focuses on the size of the profit and does not consider the longevity of the profit, then a temporary profit is not enough to be a profit. Moreover, the greater the profit, the greater the harm and the greater the risk of loss. Understanding this, one should know what to take and what to leave. If the foundation of the legal tender is not defeated, then one should start from the legal tender and not accumulate more foreign exchange and gold to become rich. If those who have foreign exchange want to keep it as foreign currency, then they can buy China's foreign currency bonds, which are much better than depositing it without interest in foreign banks. If it is thought that foreign currency may appreciate when the situation is peaceful, then why not take advantage of today's high foreign exchange rates to convert it into legal tender and buy Chinese bonds, the interest of which is generous and the profit of which is very substantial. If it is thought that this kind of investment still has no hope of great profit, then the best investment is to develop in the free zone. It should be known that there is absolutely no room for free development for Chinese people in the occupied areas, and there is no opportunity to operate and make profits. If there is a profit, they must share it with others, and if there is a loss, they must bear it alone. As for extortion and blackmail, begging for leftovers and sharing the dregs, they are just like tigers and are too lowly to be mentioned. The free zones today are mostly virgin lands, regarded as barren because they lack the scientific spirit to operate them. So it is as if a beautiful woman is covered in dirt, with no way to appreciate her natural beauty! It should be known that those who create great undertakings and become wealthy, their starting point is not in the metropolis, but mostly in desolate and wild areas, in places where few people go. With decades of operation, they have become cities with five capitals and industrial hubs. This can be found among the wealthy figures in European and American industries. Today, in various places in the southwest, there are endless mountains and ridges, and the heavens hide great wealth. In the past, when people were not enlightened, they were misled by superstitions such as feng shui, so they were not developed. Today, the situation is different. The government presides over it from above, and the people support it from behind. The only concern is the lack of manpower and capital. The wealthy bourgeoisie in Shanghai, if they have a long-term vision and a grand ambition to get rich, should take advantage of this once-in-a-millennium opportunity to form a syndicate, gather large sums of money, and send technical groups to the interior to investigate, make investment plans, and implement development, whether it is industry, commerce, agriculture, or mining. The results and benefits will definitely be more generous and greater than those of the already developed provinces in the southeast. Moreover, the Chinese government is giving preferential treatment and providing various conveniences to those who invest in the interior, so it is attracting them to come. In the future, the development of the southwest and northwest will be based on this war of resistance. Only those who are small-minded and focus on the immediate benefits and who have a long-term vision will surely become the industrial strongholds of China in the future. Who will be chosen and who will enjoy the reality? This is something that the current bourgeoisie in Shanghai is well-qualified to pre-select. Then why worry and fret, forget their great future and boundless benefits!

Road's reopening has gone against prior agreements. Neutral observers here believe that the Japanese may blockade Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the American ship "Minnesota," carrying some repatriated overseas Chinese, has arrived here from Guangzhou. (International News Service dispatch on the 18th)

Hong Kong: It was revealed here today that the supplies transported to China's wartime capital via the newly opened Hong Kong route are limited to gasoline, trucks, and railway materials. Munitions are not allowed to be transported into the Chinese mainland via this route. Supplies transported to the wartime capital will be shipped by sailboat via Shayuchuan (transliterated) in Moss Bay (transliterated), and then transported by truck to the mainland. It is reported that the Japanese army is concentrating in Shenzhen, a village on the Sino-British border, preparing to occupy Shayuchuan. If the Japanese army occupies this area, the supplies from Hong Kong to the mainland will be completely cut off, as all important areas around Hong Kong have fallen into the hands of the Japanese. According to reports, Shayuchuan, due to its isolated location, was once a haven for pirates. Neutral observers today predict that the Hong Kong route, which reopened following the Burma Road, will provoke a "relief bloodbath" on the Japanese side. The possibility of Japanese retaliation has caused new tensions in Hong Kong, but in general, the residents of Hong Kong are still calm. They are waiting for the situation to unfold, with no signs of cowardice on the surface. (International News Service dispatch on the 18th)

### Chongqing Observers' Comments

Chongqing: The Burma Road was reopened at midnight yesterday. Observers here have commented that the road is still one of the important channels for China's foreign trade. Not only that, but this British move is enough to show that the country has recognized the global importance of Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, it is firmly believed that all countries should cooperate to curb Japan's ambitions. At a time when Britain is waging a life-and-death battle against Germany, this kind of awakening is very important. In addition, US President Roosevelt recently referred to the Soviet Union as an ally, suggesting that the US and Soviet Union may also cooperate to deal with Japanese aggression. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

Chongqing: After the Burma Road was reopened this morning, it was reported that dozens of trucks had traveled from Lashio to the Chinese border. All sectors here have expressed their appreciation for this British move. United Press reporter Stewart will report on the reopening of the Burma Road and the reaction in China at 7:00 am tomorrow, sitting at the China International Broadcasting Station. His speech will also be broadcast throughout North America by the American Broadcasting Company. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

### American Newspapers Publish the News in Large Print

Washington: American newspapers published the news of the reopening of the Burma Road in large print. The Washington Star stated that this move is a clear indication of Britain's repeated determination to abandon the appeasement policy and adopt a firm stance with the United States to reject Japan's continued infringement of the rights and interests of Western countries in the Far East. It also stated that the reopening of the Burma Road is not only a sign of Britain's vigor and vigor because the danger of German invasion has obviously passed, but also a precursor to the revival of the Chinese spirit and efforts to drive out the enemy. The United States has a legitimate concern for the development of the Burma Road, because China is not only a friend of the United States, but also the first line of defense against Japan and the new Tripartite Axis. The United States is using this to threaten the United States, advocating that the US government take an action: (1) do not supply raw materials to China, such as providing unlimited loans to the Chongqing government; (3) contact Britain to share or fully bear the management of the Singapore naval base and other British bases in the East. It is also said that the United States is very supportive of the transfer of US destroyers to Britain and the embargo on certain exports to Japan. The United States is now working hard and is ready to support the government, eager to be driven by the government. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### America Wishes to Continue Trade with China, Jones Expresses Active Economic Assistance to China, Currently Negotiating with Song Ziwen, Details Unknown

Washington - Federal Loan Administrator Mr. Jones declared here last night that he is currently negotiating with former Chinese Finance Minister Mr. Song Ziwen regarding further economic assistance from the United States to China. This statement by Mr. Jones is considered here as a definite indication that the United States is preparing to grant further loans to the Chinese government. As for the full details of the loan, they are obviously not yet finalized. However, it is widely believed that Jones would not have revealed the content of his conversation with Mr. Song Ziwen unless the loan to China had been agreed upon in principle. Mr. Jones made this statement at a press conference yesterday afternoon, which Mr. Song Ziwen also attended. Mr. Jones said that Mr. Song Ziwen had informed him that China could accept a credit loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States. However, Mr. Jones did not specify the amount of the new loan under consideration. Mr. Jones said that he is very willing to provide as much assistance to China as possible. He recalled that the amount that the semi-official Import-Export Bank could lend to China is no longer limited. Previously, new loans to any country were limited to only 20 million US dollars. This regulation was repealed by Congress a few months ago. Mr. Jones said that the United States is also considering purchasing new raw materials from China, including some important minerals, and "certain items that our country has never purchased from China as part of loan conditions." He declined to specify what these goods were. Mr. Jones further stated that even if Japan bombed the Burma Road, the United States' attitude towards China would remain unchanged. When asked whether China would repay the United States' loans by transporting goods from Burma Road to the United States, Mr. Jones said that Mr. Song could answer this question. Mr. Song told the press that China has other outlets and does not rely entirely on the Burma Road. He added that China had been exporting goods through the Burma Road in the past three months. Mr. Jones concluded this rare press conference in Washington by announcing that he would meet with Mr. Song again in the next few days. Mr. Jones had previously stated that the United States is happy to assist China. He said that in the past seven years, the United States has lent China a total of 85 million, and new loans are currently under discussion to determine whether they can be established on a "foundation of perfect friendship." He said that there are no ongoing negotiations regarding the sale of armaments to China, but the United States can sell other raw materials. (18th dispatch from Central News Agency)

Washington - Former Chinese Finance Minister Mr. Song Ziwen, with a special mission, has come here to discuss new loans to China with American officials today. After the meeting, reporters learned that this new loan may be secured by tung oil, tungsten ore, and other items. Other details are currently unknown. (17th dispatch from Reuters)

Washington - A new US loan to China is currently being discussed by Federal Loan Administrator Jones and Bank of China President Song Ziwen. Jones stated that the proposed loan would likely be repaid with tung oil, tungsten, and other goods. He also said that the meeting has not reached the point where details can be finalized (18th dispatch from International News Service) Washington - Informed sources in political circles here say that President Roosevelt has decided to assist the Chinese government and intends to expand the scope of assistance. Song Ziwen has discussed with US Secretary of Commerce Jones the establishment of new credit loans for the purpose of purchasing armaments. According to a report from Manila, an American cargo ship carrying 33 aircraft has arrived in Manila and will be transported to Chongqing via the Burma Road along with the 20 aircraft that arrived earlier (18th dispatch from Huitong News Agency).

### Automobile Tested with Kerosene, Excellent Results

Chongqing - Recently, Mobil Oil Company in Hong Kong successfully tested the use of "Komit" kerosene instead of gasoline to drive a car, with very satisfactory results. The car used for the test was a 1928 eight-cylinder Nash sedan, but with the following components added: (1) In addition to modifying the original fuel tank for kerosene, a supplementary fuel tank with one gallon of gasoline was installed; (2) Three valves were installed to freely switch between gasoline or kerosene into the main fuel line; (3) A cast iron preheater was installed, connected from the exhaust pipe, with the preheater mounted on top of the original carburetor, and the carburetor reinstalled on top of the preheater. To use kerosene instead of gasoline, gasoline must be burned first. It only takes three minutes to switch to kerosene from the fuel tank. The car's power at the start is very strong, enough to carry five people uphill. The engine temperature when going uphill is 200 degrees Fahrenheit, slightly higher than the 183 degrees when driving uphill with gasoline. Now there is a shortage of gasoline in the country, and various vehicles rely on it for operation, so the demand is very high. Kerosene has more reserves in the country, is cheaper, and is easier to import. It seems that all government agencies can adopt this test as much as possible. As for the allocation of components and other technical issues, it is said that inquiries can be made to Mobil Oil Company branches in various locations. (18th dispatch)

### Tense Situation in the Pacific, US Navy Confident of Contingency Plans, Secretary of the Navy Issues Warning to Japan, Japan's Threat Not Taken Seriously

Philadelphia - Secretary of the Navy Mr. Knott warned Japan here last night that the US fleet is on standby in the Pacific. This warning from Mr. Knott to Japan is among the strongest issued by senior US officials. He said the US Navy "is prepared to show its hand in the Pacific if necessary." Mr. Knott said that the construction of US air and sea bases in the Aleutian Islands and the Central Pacific is six to eight months ahead of schedule and is currently being accelerated. The construction of air and naval bases in the Caribbean islands is also following the same pattern. He said, "When this construction process is completed, our country and the entire Western Hemisphere will be safe from the combined invasion of the enemy. (18th dispatch from United Press)

Washington - Virginia Democratic Congressman Darden told reporters here last night that the US fleet currently stationed in the Pacific does not need to worry too much about Japan's threat to the Pacific coast. Darden, chairman of the Congressional Committee, was sent to the Pacific to inspect US defenses. After a 15,000-mile air journey, he issued a statement expressing confidence in the strength of the US fleet. It is said that many Americans are worried about the increasingly tense relations between the United States and Japan, but this fact is incomprehensible because the US fleet is truly impregnable. He also said that Washington seems to be unnecessarily concerned about the tense situation on the US Pacific coast or Hawaii. (12th dispatch from United Press)

US Navy in the Pacific, Striving to Establish New Outposts

Washington - Members of the US Senate Naval Affairs Committee recently returned from inspecting the Pacific region. According to their report, the Pacific coast is very safe and the enemy cannot carry out serious attacks.

Deputy Committee Chairman Weldon, a Democratic member from Virginia, reported that the Committee found Hawaii to be impregnable. This leader also reported that Wake, Johnston, and Palmyra Islands will be used as air stations after dredging. He said the Committee opposes fortification on Guam, but he also said that it would be better to establish a fleet base in the Philippines. He estimated the cost of fortification on Guam to be between 400 and 500 million. (18th dispatch from International News Service)

US Senator Pittman Discusses the Purpose of the Tripartite Pact

Reno, Nevada - Senator Pittman strongly criticized the signing of the Tripartite Pact by the Axis powers and Japan during a meeting here yesterday. This seasoned Washington leader declared that Hitler and Mussolini made Japan join the Axis not to regard Japan as an ally, but to keep American warplanes stationed at home to prevent war with Tokyo. Mr. Pittman continued, "The Axis powers intended to prevent the United States from continuing to aid England, thereby benefiting the Axis powers in the European war." (18th dispatch from International News Service)

US-Canada Joint Defense Committee Plans Pacific Defenses

Washington - According to today's news, the US-Canada Joint Defense Committee has recently shifted its attention to the Pacific and North America to prevent a sudden attack from the Far East. The US-Canada Joint Defense Committee includes naval, land, and air force experts and people's representatives. The Committee will also discuss what steps Canada should take to avoid the threat of attacks from the Pacific. The Committee has toured the Pacific defense centers of the United States and Canada, leading to speculation that the defense negotiations between the two countries will have a huge impact on the Far East. It is reported that the United States will not lease Canadian bases, but will adopt them according to cooperative agreements when necessary. Military sources believe that the joint defense talks between the United States and Canada in the Pacific and the talks between the United States and representatives of Australia and New Zealand are one of the main reasons for the increased US attitude towards Japan in the Far East. They pointed out that if the United States cooperates with Canada and adopts Canadian Pacific bases, the US defense line in the Pacific can extend from Alaska to Hawaii and enter the Panama Canal. Any attack from the Far East would then be impossible. (18th dispatch from United Press)

Washington - President Roosevelt today informed Congress that he has allocated one million dollars for preliminary survey funds for the development of hydropower in the international rapids area of the St. Lawrence River for national defense purposes.

Japan Has No Intention of Attacking the Dutch East Indies, German Foreign Minister Deeply Displeased

London - The official newspaper of the Dutch government-in-exile in London reported yesterday that Japan cannot immediately advance to the Dutch East Indies and go to war with the United States, making German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop "extremely" dissatisfied. The newspaper said that Germany is currently trying to cause a war between Japan and the United States so that the United States' attention in Europe and Africa can be diverted. According to the newspaper, "The United States must be incited again to oppose Japan, and Japan needs to be forced to advance south. Britain must be forced to take some action in the Far East so that Japan has no choice but to enter the war." The newspaper also said, "German propagandists are loudly suggesting that Japan take action in the South Pacific that would cause a US-Japan war. The German Foreign Minister is also spreading rumors that the Netherlands, under the influence of British forces, is in danger of being forced to lease its naval bases in the Dutch East Indies to Britain, in order to provoke the feelings of the Japanese people. (18th dispatch from United Press)

London - A semi-official newspaper of the Dutch government said that, according to special intelligence received by Dutch people in London, Japan's attitude has caused Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to incorrectly estimate the East, and the situation in the Dutch East Indies has not deteriorated recently. Therefore, Mr. Ribbentrop is quite dissatisfied. Mr. Ribbentrop once said that the Netherlands, under the influence of British forces, would be forced to lease its naval bases in the Dutch East Indies to the United States, in order to provoke the Japanese opposition to Holland. However, the Dutch East Indies have not been attacked or seriously threatened, so there is no need to lease naval bases. German reports of Japanese plans to attack the Dutch East Indies may have aroused the enthusiasm of some soldiers in Tokyo, but the Japanese government has not. It can now be proved that the Tokyo responsible authorities have issued telegrams reflecting the Japanese government's policy, and German newspapers do not publish them. Japan's attitude of restraining rash actions is not to Berlin's liking, and Washington's reaction to the German-Italian-Japanese pact has strengthened the position of more responsible and stable Japanese politicians.

### Japan Obtains Gasoline in the Dutch East Indies

New York - The New York Times published a message today from an unspecified source saying that a measure has now been completed, namely that Japan's oil needs can obtain 40% from the Dutch East Indies within these six months. It is said that the final decision on this matter will be resolved after today's meeting between the Japanese economic delegation to the Dutch East Indies and representatives of local private oil companies. The development of this matter is mainly driven by the pressure that Japan has put on the Dutch East Indies government. According to the terms, the Dutch East Indies will supply Japan with 14,000,000 million barrels of oil in six months. (18th dispatch from United Press) New York - The New York Times reported this morning that the Japanese economic delegation has reached an agreement with the Dutch East Indies in Batavia to supply Japan with 40% of the gasoline produced in the Dutch East Indies. (18th dispatch from Huitong)

New York - The New York Times reported that Japan has actually reached a compromise agreement with the Dutch East Indies to purchase oil from the Dutch East Indies for the next six months, the quantity of which is sufficient to meet 40% of its oil needs. The Royal Dutch Shell Group's branches will supply three-quarters of this amount, with the remainder supplied by the Mobil Oil Group. It is said that payment will be made in either pounds sterling or US dollars. (18th dispatch from Reuters)

### Balkans and Near East: Situation Increasingly Tense; Bulgaria Will Follow Romania's Lead in Joining the Axis Powers; Italy Threatens Greece and Turkey, Preparing to Settle Old Scores

Budapest: Eden is reportedly heading from Egypt to Turkey, causing the situation in the Balkans and Near East to rapidly become tense. The "showdown" seems imminent. This rumor comes from Ankara. Meanwhile, due to the Axis powers' access to the Black Sea via the Balkans, Britain is preparing to evacuate its citizens from protectorates for safety. The rumor that Romania will join the Axis powers adds to this belief. According to various sources, Eden's trip will involve discussions with the new Soviet ambassador to Turkey, the Turkish president, and the Turkish army chief of staff. Turkish sources completely deny rumors that the Soviets are negotiating a military mutual assistance pact. However, the Axis powers, seeing hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops near the Romanian border, have been urgently strengthening their position in the Balkans. Greece, meanwhile, remains on the British side. It was learned yesterday that Greece has finalized an agreement to purchase 100,000 tons of wheat from the Soviet Union, worth approximately $7.75 million. This brings Greece closer to the Soviet Union. The Greek government is also reportedly purchasing the same amount of Australian wheat from Australia. (October 18 International Dispatch)

Rome: Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, threatened Greece and Turkey in an editorial yesterday, using the phrase "final reckoning." Gayda, in the semi-official "Italian Daily," criticized Greece and Turkey for assisting Britain. He stated, "Britain is now isolated. The only ones still colluding with Britain are Greece and Turkey. Greece secretly continues to allow the British navy to use its bases. History will settle accounts with these countries." (October 18 United Press)

London: The British "Observer" published an article by a renowned expert commenting on the Near East war. His conclusion was that, regardless of the Axis powers' intentions in their new actions in the Balkans, they clearly lack confidence in handling this difficult problem. The Balkan campaign, while potentially having long-term implications for the Egyptian campaign, has no immediate relevance. He stated that Italy cautiously observed and made secret preparations before joining the war, without causing any disturbances. When it saw France unable to sustain itself, it seized the opportunity to participate. Its prudence was witnessed by all. Now, in dealing with the Egyptian war, it remains very cautious. The German army's entry into Romania appears, on the surface, to be an attempt to employ a pincer movement to seize Egypt – a combined offensive with Germany advancing from the north and Italy advancing from Libya. Those with shallow understanding might say that the British forces in Palestine and Egypt will be doubly besieged. However, cool common sense does not support this view. Unless Turkey weakens, Germany is unlikely to use force in the East. Turkey has not shown any willingness to concede. Protracted delays will only strengthen resistance, which is what Italy fears. Germany could pressure Greece by passing through Bulgaria, and Italy could also approach Greece from the northwest. However, neither Germany nor Italy seems willing to start a war in that part of Europe at present. It would be foolish to underestimate Italy's offensive strength in Egypt or to disregard the Italian commander's skill in capturing the important outposts of Sudan and Kenya. The German army's entry into Romania may also have a slightly unfavorable impact on British defenses, as the Axis powers' intention is to tie down British forces, preventing them from concentrating in Egypt. In other words, the German operation has only a disruptive value for the British forces. (October 18 Reuters)

British Diplomatic Activities Closely Watched by Berlin

Istanbul: British diplomatic representatives from various Balkan countries will hold a meeting here within days. The British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendall, arrived here last night. The British Minister to Romania, Hoare, is already here. The British Minister to Yugoslavia and the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, will arrive here in the near future. (October 18 Huitong)

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry recently told foreign journalists that no conflict would occur between Germany and Greece or Turkey. Germany is not concerned with the internal affairs of Greece and Turkey, except for measures that affect the war against Britain. Germany will, of course, pay attention to the activities of British diplomats in the Balkans. (October 18 Huitong)

Eden's Visit to Egypt: An Important Mission

Stockholm: Eden's visit to Egypt has drawn extraordinary attention in London. It is understood that British Prime Minister Churchill entrusted Eden with two missions: (1) To persuade King Farouk of Egypt to declare war on Italy under any circumstances. (2) To resolve differences of opinion among senior British commanders in the Near East regarding strategy. The central point of contention is whether the British forces in Egypt should firmly defend Egypt with a large force or make a strategic retreat at an appropriate time. It is said that the Chief of Staff of the British forces in the Near East and the commander of the British fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean advocate a timely naval withdrawal. They agree with the views expressed in the book "Britain and the Mediterranean" by British naval writer Williams, believing that the Mediterranean cannot be defended after Italy's entry into the war and that the Cape of Good Hope strategy should replace the Mediterranean strategy. The British authorities have banned the sale of this book in Egypt. (October 18 Huitong)

Malta: According to current reports, Secretary of War Eden visited Malta last Sunday on his way to Egypt.

German Troops in Romania Increase; Submarines Dismantled and Shipped to the Black Sea

Bucharest: Currently, there are 15,000 German troops in Romania, mostly technicians. It is expected that the total number will increase to 30,000 by October 31. (October 18 Reuters)

Belgrade: It was heard yesterday that three German submarines have been dismantled and shipped via the Danube River to Graz, for possible use in the Black Sea. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. If this news is true, then the number of German submarines dismantled and shipped to Graz has reached seven. According to well-informed sources, the Germans are rapidly developing Constanta as a Black Sea base, with several German naval experts in charge. (October 18 United Press)

Sino-German Friendly Relations Remain Unchanged, Germany Says

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated today when receiving foreign reporters that there has been no change in the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. The relationship between the two countries is quite solid, lasting, and stable. (October 18 Reuters)

New York: The "New York Times" carried a dispatch from Helsinki stating that the German delegation in Moscow has notified the Soviet Foreign Ministry that the Soviet Union's attempts to expand its power in Egypt must cease. Germany and Italy intend to "protect" the Balkan countries from further Soviet aggression. The Soviet Union should supply millions of tons of urgently needed grains and other products to the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. The German side also suggested "economic cooperation" so that Germany would retain its markets in the Baltic Sea and Bessarabia. (October 18 Reuters)

Germany Increases Troops in Poland to Guard Against the Soviet Union

London: Well-informed sources here stated today that Germany is also greatly increasing its troops stationed in Poland in response to the Soviet Union's recent strengthening of its concentrated forces near the Polish border, as a show of opposition. It is reported that more than 100,000 German troops have been sent to the Soviet-German border, from the Baltic coast of Poland to the mouth of the Danube River on the Black Sea. It is said that some of the German regiments currently stationed in Poland were transferred from the English Channel coast. Some quarters here interpret this as Hitler potentially abandoning his plan to invade the British Isles. At the same time, British newspapers estimate that the continuous air and sea attacks by the British side on the invasion bases along the English Channel coast have resulted in 40,000 to 50,000 German casualties or those who have lost their ability to fight.

### Suñer Appointed Spanish Foreign Minister; Germany and Italy Pleased; Himmler Visits Spain

Berlin: German newspapers welcomed Suñer's appointment as Spanish Foreign Minister, viewing it as a sign of Spain's determination to participate in the European reorganization and European politics. The "Berlin Financial Times" stated that Suñer's two-week visit to Germany and Italy, where he met with key figures such as Hitler and Mussolini, had already demonstrated Spain's friendly relations with the Axis powers. Germany welcomed Suñer's appointment as Foreign Minister because his visit had gained the sincere sympathy of the German and Italian peoples, and General Franco's announcement of this appointment at this time was very significant. The "German General Gazette" stated that Suñer's appointment as Foreign Minister at this stage of the European war proves that Spain understands its position as a Mediterranean power. (October 18 Huitong)

Milan: The Italian newspapers today all welcomed the appointment of Suñer as Spanish Foreign Minister. "Sella Daily" commented that Suñer's appointment as Foreign Minister is a sign of Spain's political realignment. (October 18 Huitong)

### Breaking Through Anti-Aircraft Defenses; German Planes Continuously Bombing Britain; Distributing Leaflets Intentionally Insulting the British Prime Minister; Britain Uses New Weapons to Defend Against Night Raids

London: German planes dropped bombs on various districts inside and outside the city again this morning. However, London residents had already taken shelter in underground shelters. In addition to London, explosions were also heard in the Midland area, as German planes carried out intense short-term bombings in that area. Most of the damage in the area was to residents' property, and some factory buildings were also hit. London experienced intense anti-aircraft fire before midnight, which then subsided somewhat until early this morning. Reports from many places indicate minor damage, and churches were reportedly badly bombed, but fortunately, there were no casualties. Around 11:50 pm on Thursday, German planes were reported to have approached the skies over the northwest towns. This morning's air raid in London seemed the same as last night. Very few German planes were able to penetrate the skies over London. The leaflets dropped by German planes last night even called British Prime Minister Churchill a "thug," claiming that Churchill was carrying out extremely sinful war actions. The leaflet also featured a recent photo of the British Prime Minister, with a cigar in his mouth, a rifle in his hand, and a narrow-brimmed top hat. The title of this picture was "Inciting Murder." (October 18 United Press)

London: Canterbury Cathedral, famous for its long history and magnificent architecture, was almost destroyed yesterday evening. A squadron of German Messerschmitt fighter-bombers flew to Canterbury, diving through the clouds and dropping 20 high-explosive and incendiary bombs, three of which landed in the cathedral area. The deputy dean's office was slightly damaged, and one bomb landed in the garden in front of his office. However, the cathedral itself was undamaged. Deputy Dean Johnson and others took refuge in the vaulted corridors and were not injured. More than ten private houses in Canterbury were damaged, but most of the bombs fell in open spaces, and only one member of the Home Guard was killed. (October 18 Reuters)

London: As German planes engage in prolonged and light night raids over London, the British Royal Air Force is now ready to deploy its new defensive weapons and manufacture powerful bombers for longer air raids on the continent. Very few German planes flew over London last night, and the air raid, which lasted a long time from midnight, was very slow. In the previous few hours, many bombs were dropped in various areas, mostly falling outside the city, with very little damage and few casualties. According to the Air Ministry, four German planes were shot down yesterday, and three British fighters were also lost. It is generally expected that Britain's deployment of new secret weapons to defend against night raids and the use of new aircraft to intensify attacks on Germany and German-occupied areas will soon be realized. According to the semi-official News Association, the time is now ripe for the British Air Force to test its new fighters and bombers. Countermeasures against the new tactics of the German Air Force have finally been researched and completed, and have the effect of accelerating the activity of older aircraft.

### Italy Claims Large-Scale Attack on Egypt is Imminent; Saying All Preparations are Complete; Aden Continues to be Bombed by the Italian Air Force

Rome: A special correspondent for the Italian "Popolo d'Italia" revealed today that General Graziani and his troops are now preparing to attack Egypt, the nerve center of the British Empire. All offensive preparations are complete, and they can be launched as soon as the weather improves. Since the Italian army reached Sidi Barrani, two major problems have been solved: (1) The supply of food and water. (2) The elimination of small groups of British troops near Sidi Barrani, allowing the small enemy forces on the southern flank of the Italian army. The Italian army has now advanced 30 kilometers from Barrani and is now directly facing the British army's fortified positions protecting Mersa Matruh. The British army has at least three army divisions and one armored division stationed there. Britain is well aware of the importance of Egypt, so reinforcements continue to arrive in Egypt, with a large number of military supplies arriving in recent days. (October 18 Huitong)

Rome: An Italian military bulletin stated that the Italian air force bombed Aden, causing a large fire. Airfields near Eldabba, Matruh, and El Ghardaqa were also bombed by Italian aircraft.

### Anti-French Demonstrations Held in Thailand

Bangkok: Relations between France and Thailand have become tense again after the Thai government ordered all Thai students to leave France immediately. Although Thai authorities had previously announced that they would suppress anti-French demonstrations, anti-French demonstrations continued throughout the country yesterday. Thai students demanded that the government take direct action against French Indochina. Bangkok is planning a large-scale, unprecedented anti-French demonstration tomorrow. It is heard that the procession will pass through various government agencies, reiterating the demand for swift action. It is learned that the French authorities will notify the Thai government today that Vietnam does not intend to send a border delegation to Thailand to negotiate the redrawing of the Vietnamese border. Some people here, seeing that the Vichy government has rejected Thailand's demands, believe that Vietnam will refuse to send a border delegation to negotiate with Thai officials. It is widely believed that Vietnam may agree to discuss the disposal of several small islands on the Mekong River but will continue to reject Thailand's major territorial demands.

### Philippines Disrupts Japanese Spies; A Japanese Person Arrested at an Airfield

Manila: The U.S. Army today received a report from Olongapo that a Japanese person was found on the U.S.S. Langley. Immediately, a wide-ranging investigation was launched in the Philippines. The Manila Daily Bulletin newspaper announced today that the Japanese person found on the plane was thinly dressed and wet, indicating that he climbed onto the plane by swimming at night. The naval authorities detained him for questioning on suspicion of espionage. The details of the case are difficult to obtain because another espionage case is under secret investigation here, which is related to the sale of military intelligence by Philippine Constabulary officer Romanillo. Because the Romanillo espionage case involves complex international relations, the authorities are keeping silent. It is learned that several Filipinos have been arrested in connection with this spy ring, and other people, although not arrested, are also under investigation and surveillance.

### Paris Under German Occupation

As I thought this, I walked towards the entrance of the underground station, where a musty smell assaulted my nostrils. Following a group of young women heading to the office, I descended the steps into the subway, and this scene reminded me of a quintessential aspect of Parisian life. At the same time, a fully armed German soldier, complete with backpack and rifle, arrived. We boarded the train together and set off together, everything seeming quite natural and ordinary.

Arriving at the Place station, a man wearing dark trousers and a single-breasted, brass-buttoned, navy-blue uniform walked up. He seemed very familiar with everything, but somehow didn't belong here. Before I could clearly identify him, he had already changed trains halfway through. He was a German railway employee, commonly seen in Germany, except this man had a military insignia on his arm. I wondered to myself, "Am I in Paris or Berlin?" I had to take a closer look at the shop girls to confirm that I was indeed in Paris.

Ascending to street level, the scene was not what one would expect on a holiday morning. The sidewalk was unusually sparsely populated, similar to the middle of the road. The whole city was frighteningly calm. Fortunately, a German infantry unit was drilling in the square in front of the Louvre Museum. Their loud military songs and the rhythm of their orderly steps broke through much of the silence. Finally, they passed through the Louvre gates, marched past the statue of Napoleon, and continued to the square of the Comédie-Française, singing joyfully along the way. Their songs seemed to carry a hint of killing intent, and the citizens seemed to cover their ears and walk away to avoid their edge. In fact, these German soldiers mostly sang love songs dedicated to their girlfriends, much like the French song "It's nice by the blond girl."

The sandbags in front of monuments and public buildings had been removed by the German army, which made the city look slightly restored and reduced the depressing state. However, the Ministry of Navy on the Rue Royale was guarded by German sailors, and German sailors often peered out of the windows of the building, a scene that was in harmony with the restaurants full of German soldiers. Anyone wanting to go to the American Embassy had to take a detour, because the German military headquarters, located in the Hôtel de Crillon, was in between, and ordinary people were not allowed to pass in front of the entrance.

The German army stationed in Paris was not comparable to the German army of 1914. In the autumn of 1914, I witnessed the situation of the German army in occupied Brussels. On the one hand, the German high-ranking officers there were mostly tough and brutal, and on the other hand, the soldiers were undisciplined. Drunken soldiers blocked Belgian women on the road and forced them to kiss, and officers walking nearby turned a blind eye. Such scenes cannot be found in the current German army. They behave solemnly and in accordance with discipline. Not only is there no drunkenness, but there is also no sign of frolicking and debauchery.

The army in Belgium in 1914 was merely an occupying army. The meaning and mission of the German army in Paris today are different, which goes without saying. Because today's German army bears the responsibility of military propaganda. Every German soldier is a model of the National Socialist Party, and the officers express a friendly demeanor.

Paris is, in reality, no longer a military zone, and there seems to be no reason to see so many German officers and soldiers. They are simply everywhere and requisitioned various houses. What exactly they are doing is incomprehensible. They are simply inspecting the property of Paris and its surrounding industrial centers. They want to thoroughly study the financial, industrial, and commercial conditions of the former French capital, Paris, so that they can rebuild this metropolis of a revitalized Europe in accordance with the ideals of National Socialism.

Walking through the working-class district, I heard workers talking in the corners of the streets. Usually, people talk about how improved the situation of workers is under the National Socialist Party or under Soviet rule. In the past, I often heard praise for Soviet politics, but I had never heard praise for the National Socialist Party.

The middle-class people of Paris have now become "bookworms." Besides food, the things I see Parisians buying are mostly books. They use these readings to temporarily relieve their mental and physical pain.

The liveliest thing in Paris today is the soldiers who come to visit. Every day, several thousand German soldiers enter the city from suburban barracks. They drive in military vehicles, parading through the city, and have a few hours of free time to buy sundries in the city. On the roads and in the city center, you only see soldiers holding large and small bundles, wrapped in pink or green paper. These are the colors of the wrapping paper used by various stores.

The soldiers mostly use a special mark issued by the occupying military headquarters. This mark cannot be used in Germany and is only circulated in occupied France as designated by the German military headquarters. Each mark is equivalent to 20 French francs. German soldiers' daily pay is 44 marks, so when they enter the city, their pockets are full, and they always carry hundreds of francs. They can buy all kinds of sundries, mostly clothing, shirts, soap, and perfume. Women's silk stockings in various stores were bought out by the German army on the third day of Paris's fall.

As dusk fell, these sightseeing soldiers returned to the barracks in a long line of military vehicles. Seeing them passing through the Rue Lepic, each one had a smiling face and was very happy. On the belt hooks hanging from their waists, they hung countless large and small paper packages. They ran up to the terrace of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, ready to enjoy the panoramic view of the city of Paris. It would be best to have a military band playing a tune from the opera "Louis" next to them, then they would be even more elated. (The End)

### Finance: Lack of Buyers for Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The British and American exchange market was once again weak, due to frequent negative news, such as the United States being ready to go to war in the Pacific at any time, and the establishment of a new Sino-American loan exceeding 25 million yuan. Therefore, speculators sold all day long, and telegrams from Hong Kong were also blocked. Fortunately, outside firms had strong appetite, and the weakening trend was slow. As a result, British was level and American was up .03125, calculated as British gold at 3 shillings 7 8125 pence, and American exchange at 5 yuan 8125 cents. The spot market trend was the same as the spot price.

Speculators Selling All Day

Early morning saw London large strips, with both near and far terms level. New York silver prices remained level, and London raw gold was fixed. Exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, etc., were level. American against British fell half a point, against Shanghai slightly four points, and against France there was no market. The central government's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices: British gold at 3 shillings 7 65625 pence, and American exchange at 5 yuan 78125 cents, compared to the previous day's closing. Both British and American exchanges had not changed. After opening, Chinese banks sold, and the initial state was still level, calculated as sales to outside firms for American exchange in the current month at 5 yuan 78125 cents. However, soon, speculators and Hong Kong telegrams came to sell, and the market became tight. Speculators and Hong Kong telegrams sold South-Lee and American Bank American exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 8125 cents. Later, speculators sold to outside firms American exchange for the current month, weakening to 5 yuan 84375 cents. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also saw no increase or decrease. After this, Chinese merchant speculators continued to sell, and at that time, negative rumors spread widely. There were no buyers. The American Bank entered Chinese merchants for American exchange in the next month at 5 yuan 8125 cents. As noon approached, rumors gradually dissipated, transactions decreased, and prices softened. Closing prices were British gold at 3 shillings 7 65625 pence, and American exchange at 5 yuan 78125 cents, with no gain or loss compared to the morning opening.

Hong Kong Also Threw Out to Shanghai

The market remained tight in the afternoon. Speculators sold to outside firms American exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 8125 cents, and Hong Kong telegrams also sold to outside firms American exchange for the same month at 5 yuan 84375 cents. The closing potential was stable, calculated as British gold at 3 shillings 7 8125 pence, and American exchange at 5 yuan 8125 cents. The current month was the same price as the spot price. November saw British gold at 3 shillings 65625 pence, and American exchange at 5 yuan 78125 cents. As a result, compared to the previous day's closing, British gold spot price was fixed, and November was up .015625, and American exchange, both term and spot, were up .03125.

Hong Kong American Exchange Alone Was Volatile

Hong Kong, 18th (Friday) – This morning, the exchange market opened level, and the American exchange presented volatility. British exchange spot, term, and Japanese exchange spot all saw no change. American exchange spot was tight .0625, at 23 yuan. Shanghai exchange spot decreased 2 yuan, to 394 yuan (yesterday's closing was 396 yuan). At 11:00, it was stable. Shanghai exchange spot rose 1 yuan, to 395 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable. All exchanges saw no gain or loss. The market opened at 2:30 PM, still reporting stability, with no change.

Tianjin: British and American Both Contracting

Tianjin, 18th (Friday) – This morning, the exchange market opened reporting level. London telegraphic transfer softened .0625, to 3 shillings 59375 pence. New York telegraphic transfer tightened .03125, to 5 yuan 5625 cents. Shanghai exchange rose 5 jiao, to 104 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. "United Notes" black market rose 2 yuan, to 77 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen.

### Foreign Exchange Arbitrage: Prohibited by Itself

The local foreign exchange market has both spot and forward transactions. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the prices of near and far terms are different. The difference between the June and July forward exchange rates for US dollars this year was .125 and .09375, and the arbitrage could reach a monthly interest rate of 1.5 and 2.2 points. The spread between July and August was .0625, and the arbitrage could reach a monthly interest rate of 1 point.

The spreads for August to September and September to October were both .0325. Transactions between banks could reach a monthly interest rate of more than 5%. And the current month and the next month (ie October and November) used to have price differences. For example, the opening price yesterday (the 17th) for the British exchange spot and the October forward price were both 3 shillings 8125 pence, and the November price was 3 shillings 796875 pence. The price difference between October and November was .015625. The spot price for US dollars and the October forward price were both 5 yuan 84375 cents, and the November forward price was 5 yuan 8125 cents. If the swap is for one month, a monthly interest rate of 5.3% can be obtained. Yesterday (the 18th), the black market for foreign exchange opened with the British gold spot and the October and November forward prices all at 3 shillings 75 pence, and the American gold spot and the October and November forward prices all at 5 yuan 75 cents. By the close, the British gold spot and the October and November forwards, the prices were all 3 shillings 765625 pence, and the American gold spot and the October and November forward prices were all 5 yuan 78125 cents. Throughout the day, the rises and falls in all term and spot prices were the same, canceling each other out. There was no profit to be made from arbitrage. No one was interested in foreign exchange arbitrage. Therefore, to eliminate arbitrage, it is only necessary to make the prices of foreign exchange futures and spot prices the same, and it will be prohibited by itself without any prohibition. (B)

### Gold Market: Mostly Settlement of Long and Short Positions

Yesterday, the local market for cash gold bullion was extremely volatile. Both the morning and afternoon markets saw a trend of first falling and then rising. It was not easy for the short sellers with no goods to even give out a two-fen interest. However, the trend of selling out of the market did not stop yesterday. Because of the talk of a new Sino-American loan, and it was heard that the US Navy was ready to act in the Pacific, the foreign exchange tended to loosen, so the bulls, although they possessed strength, found it difficult to rest easy. All parties were restless, and both long and short positions were being closed. The market showed a spiral pattern. Opening in the morning under the selling pressure of gold firms, it saw 5,720 yuan, and then continued to fall to 5,680 yuan. The foreign exchange stopped loosening and suddenly tightened, and money shops and silver shops covered short positions, suddenly seeing a surge to 5,755 yuan. At noon, news of selling increased, and a downward wind rose, falling back down. In the afternoon, the silver shops' helping selling enthusiasm was strong, and it continued to fall, seeing a low price of 5,670 yuan. However, the money shops rose again to cover short positions, and gold firms re-entered, and the price rose again, closing at 5,715 yuan, a net loss of 23 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was several thousand taels, with mostly settlement of positions by both sides. Gold ornaments, customs gold, etc., were all level.

Bullion Fell Twenty-Three Yuan

In the early morning, the exchange market was soft and hard. The opening price was flat and weak. Gold firms first released securities to help with ten taels, at 5,720 yuan. Before long, gold and silver shops came to the market and sold fiercely, immediately breaking into the 700-yuan level, calculated as gold firms selling twenty taels to silver shops, for 5,680 yuan. However, a certain silver shop's buying intention suddenly arose, and it took in low, and the price rose again, calculated as silver shops entering money exchange businesses for twenty taels, for 5,740 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange was reporting hard, combined with negative news, and so the securities and money exchange businesses sold together. Securities helped to sell thirty taels to money exchange businesses, falling to 5,705 yuan. Later, due to the softening of the exchange market, the money exchange businesses suddenly covered short positions, and the silver shops also absorbed them, raising the price to a high of 5,755 yuan. The silver shop did twenty taels for the midday close, at 5,733 yuan. When the market opened in the early afternoon, people's hearts became more depressed, and the silver shop did ten taels, with an opening price of 5,700 yuan. At that time, the silver shop helped to sell strongly, and cash gold firms also came to sell, falling to 5,670 yuan. Later, relying on gold firms and money exchange businesses to absorb them, it began to rise again. Gold firms entered money exchange businesses for twenty taels, for 5,730 yuan. However, cash gold firms continued to sell at high prices, causing the price to fall again. Silver shops stuffed ten taels to gold firms, at 5,715 yuan, as the evening closing price, smaller than the previous day's net loss of 23 yuan. The whole day had an eighty-five-yuan fluctuation. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the bullion, and the intake was reduced by more than thirty yuan. The current bid gold was lower than the listed gold by fifty to sixty yuan, and it was rarely opened.

Ornamental Gold Remained Unchanged Throughout

The price of silver building's ornamental gold per tael remained unchanged throughout. The Datong Hang still hung at 590 yuan, and the Xin Tong Hang was similar to the above price, with the intake lower by about thirty yuan.

### Foreign Currency Market Was Flat

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the bullion price fluctuating slightly lower. British and American gold pounds also fell slightly by five jiao. British gold notes still had few transactions, and the market price stood still. American gold notes had initially risen to 16 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen, but immediately fell, ending at 16 yuan 6 jiao 4 fen, a net loss of 1 jiao 4 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell slightly by 1 fen. The rising wind of Japanese gold notes had been suppressed, and the evening market retreated slightly to 1 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen and a half. Korean notes had equal supply and demand, and the market price stood still. The evening market remained at 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen.

### The Soviet Bank Has Returned to Its Original Address for Business

The JiangSu Bank on JiangXi Road in the port has temporarily moved its Shanghai branch to No. 5 Hualong Road since the outbreak of the war. The United Communications Office for the retreating banks in the occupied areas was rented at No. 675 Julai Road. The bank has recently moved all of the Shanghai branch and the communications office for the retreating banks back to their original address at No. 371 JiangXi Road in order to facilitate depositors.

### Damaged Banknotes (Continued from the 17th)

— Shen Yun

(Explanation) The original banknote of the same denomination as the broken note can be folded in half and then folded in half again, and then checked against the broken note to see if the remaining amount exceeds the folded line by more than half. Then it can be exchanged for the full amount.

(II) If the voucher has been broken, but more than a quarter of it remains, half the amount will be paid.

(Explanation) According to the explanation in the first item, check the broken banknote to see the remaining amount. If it has not reached the folded line by half, only half of it can be exchanged.

(III) If the voucher has been broken and the remaining amount is less than two-quarters, it will not be exchanged.

(Explanation) All damaged banknotes that are less than half of the full note will be invalidated. It is not worth a penny.

(IV) Vouchers that are soiled by mud, wet by water, or burned by fire, but whose words, numbers, number, and pattern can still be identified, will be exchanged for the full amount.

(Explanation) Most of these banknotes are moldy, rotten, and burnt, and will break as soon as they are touched. Do not use thick paper to patch them. Use transparent paper to wrap and glue them together, and the original note must be straightened and not folded. Because if you use thick paper to patch them, the number and pattern will often be covered, and whether the broken note can be exchanged! You must see if the numbers on both sides are complete and whether the pattern is connected. If you inspect and tear off the patched thick paper, the number and pattern will also be torn off. Because of this, it cannot be exchanged for the full amount, and it cannot be folded. Because the paper is scorched and moldy, and it is easier to break if it is folded again, this is also related to whether or not it can be exchanged for the full amount.

(V) Even if each voucher has been split into many pieces, but it can still be identified after putting it together, it will be exchanged for the full amount.

(Explanation) After this kind of broken banknote is put together, the number and pattern must be complete and complete before it can be exchanged for the full amount, and it must also be glued with transparent paper.

(VI) In all the above articles, vouchers with broken paper cannot be combined into one for calculation.

(VII) All vouchers that are pieced together, and several pieces are combined into one, will not be exchanged.

(Explanation) Items 6 and 7 have the same meaning. Banknotes cannot be pieced together if they are incomplete or broken. For example, if the middle of a full banknote is damaged by insects or fire, but the left and right sides are still intact, but the area is less than half, this type of banknote will be invalidated and is worthless, or it is thought that although the banknote is incomplete, the numbers on both sides are the same, and the middle can be pieced together with the same broken voucher to exchange the full amount, but according to the bank's exchange rules, the banknotes are broken and incomplete on the top and bottom, and must be continuous before they can be exchanged for the full amount or half the amount. (To be continued)

### Food: More Than 90,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in One Day, No. 2 Saigon and Four Kungs Are Gradually Falling

A huge amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French Postal Shipping Company cargo ship Yalu directly transported 5,900 tons from Saigon, and the Los also directly loaded 1,600 tons from Saigon, totaling about 80,000 bags. The above news has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that the two rounds have arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon one after another and stopped at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf for unloading. Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson also arrived in port at 4:00 PM yesterday, carrying 14,723 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Yesterday, a total of more than 90,000 bags of foreign rice arrived throughout the day. (Ancestor)

With the successive arrival of foreign rice, there have been new transactions at low prices. With the listing of domestic rice and late rice, the actual sales of the local merchants are small, and it is difficult for speculators and hoarders inside and outside the industry to act against the trend and raise prices that are far from the facts. The market is gradually going downstream from the natural trend. In addition to the entire batch of French rounds that arrived yesterday, many zero batches of various companies' rounds have also arrived. There are two major batches of French rounds arriving within the next week, and there are also many other goods in transit, so the early market opening price fell section by section. No. 2 Saigon is particularly popular with fixed arrivals, and the decline is the most fierce. Yesterday, the market was down a small amount of 1.34 yuan in the morning and another half yuan in the afternoon. The others fell by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was about 70 yuan higher, and the middle and second classes varied. No. 2 ranged from 64.5 yuan to 63 yuan, No. 1 Siamese had no market, No. 2 ranged from 63 yuan to 61.5 yuan, Huojiao ranged from 69.5 to 66 yuan, and Xiaojiao ranged from 62 yuan to 61 yuan. It was heard that more than 100 tons of No. 2 Saigon returned to their original packages, priced at 75 yuan. In the afternoon, there was an opening price of 73.56 yuan, and rumors spread that 1,500 tons had been traded, and people's hearts became softer. The return cargo has also been reduced to within 74 yuan.

The arrival of new japonica, pointed rice, and kiln-grown wild rice is still not prosperous. There are only more than 2,000 stones in total by land and water, but new japonica accounts for half of them, so the intention to sell new japonica is quite loose, seeing a fall of one yuan, with a special opening price of 76 yuan, determined japonica at 72 yuan, and kiln-grown goods are scarce and popular, increasing by one yuan to 75 yuan, and wild rice is average, still at 79 yuan. The supply and demand for Duyang pointed rice is equal, and the market is fixed, with a special opening price of 71 yuan for the original package of Du pointed rice, a market price of 70 yuan, and 70 yuan for the original package of Yang pointed rice.

The market for broken japonica yesterday had no gains or losses. The Changsu japonica was 85 yuan for the high-grade and 74.5 yuan for the second-grade, and the Nangang early rice was 82 yuan for the original package and 80 yuan per dan.

Yesterday, there were distiller activities for glutinous rice, and the owners were very firm, so the market color turned fixed. Jinli specialty yuan was still 756 yuan, and Changdan determined goods were 734 yuan. Hong Kong specialty yuan was 74 yuan, long grain was 73 yuan, and determined to 70 yuan. Sticky tea was 66 yuan, etc.

### Returned Flour Is Very Scarce

Yesterday's flour sales were not strong, but the market remained calm as usual. Because the supply from various factories is insufficient, and only 5-6,000 bags are approved for sale. The transport of inland and Japanese factory flour into the concessions is also blocked, leading to the increasing scarcity of old license plate returned goods, with prices reaching 19.23 yuan. Because the stack orders are almost extinct at the moment, the few goods are even more in short supply. Due to the lack of arrivals of foreign flour and the exhaustion of the current stock, it is following the same expensive path as the returned old car flour. The price of the triangular brand flour opened at 18.8 yuan, which is up another yuan, and it is also heard that the street office has processed 500 bags of red peach four-numbered flour, priced at 15.6 yuan, and the rest have few transactions.

The wheat market had no development yesterday, because the arrivals were scarce, and the factories also had no special interest. In addition to the sporadic delivery of 3-500 bags to Japanese factories, there was no goods to be collected from inland and Chinese factories, so the selling price also had few changes. The market is still in a state of restraint.

Eight thousand bags of flour were exported to Weihaiwei on the 19th, and 300 bags of corn were transported to Weihaiwei, and another 600 bags were transported to Yantai.

### Oil Market: Winding Price

Yesterday's oil market still had a winding and retreating trend. Vegetable oil, in the early morning, continued the tightening trend at the close of the previous day, and there was no shortage of hoarders selling out, so the market price was more than two yuan lower. After entering, there was an eager trend to pull up, and the market price recovered a lot, which was equal to the previous day, but the strength was not enough, and the result was still a tired path, which was cut by 1-2 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Although bean oil is scarce, the sales market is squeezed by vegetable oil, and there is no opportunity for self-improvement. It still follows vegetable oil in advances and retreats. At the moment, vegetable oil speculation has been slightly hit, but it has not been able to wake up the illusions. Yesterday, the factory bean oil also had futures to do, and the transaction was a factory bean oil for the second half of November at 86.5 yuan, which was a trade between sellers and buyers. There are more than 500 dan of the current factory oil at 85.5 to 85 yuan, and the old stack order is 83.5 yuan. 250 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil are priced at 74 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yanzhi soybean oil delivered in seven days are priced at 76 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were opened, with the price ranging from 71.5 yuan to 73 yuan, and then falling back to 72 yuan. 100 pieces of futures were ordered for delivery in two weeks, with the price ranging from 72.5 yuan, 150 pieces for delivery in four weeks, and the price ranging from 74 yuan to 73.5 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao vegetable oil were priced at 102 yuan to 100 yuan. 500 barrels ordered for delivery in November were dropped from 104 yuan to 103.25 yuan, then raised to 104 yuan, and then lowered to 102.25 yuan for the close.

### Yarn Market: Speculative Sentiments Wavering, Cotton Yarn Intended to Rise but Instead Falls

The yarn market initially experienced a large surge, which was followed by a downward trend. The minds of general factory owners are in a state of confusion and uncertainty. In reality, with yarn factories reducing production and the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, prices should be expected to rise. However, the upward momentum compared to the low point is not insignificant, and the amount of yarn taken away by Hong Kong compradors is also considerable. Whether sales will pause temporarily or continue is unknown, leading to indecision on both the bullish and bearish sides. In this uncertain market atmosphere, ten bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai today.

The current yarn market opened this morning with strong momentum due to the enthusiastic sentiment of the previous afternoon. Bullish traders took the opportunity to raise prices, creating a forceful trend. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached a new high of $1,270. However, as those who had made profits began to sell, and with bulls unwilling to buy at the high price, the market fell back to $1,252. As prices slightly decreased, buyers became active again, and the price gradually rose to $1,262. The performance of the exchange was mediocre, and both bullish traders and short-term speculators rushed to sell, causing the market to steadily decline to $1,231. After the closing bell, there was a slight rebound. The total trading volume for the half-day was 5,245 bales. The price of 20-count "Changing Horse" yarn fell by ten dollars. A breakdown of the amount purchased by various parties is listed below:

### Spot Cotton Remains Firm and Expensive

The spot cotton market remains firm and expensive. Factories are making minor adjustments, but trading among fellow businesses has improved. Reports indicate that the price of foreign cotton in the New York cotton market is quiet. Initially, there were fewer sellers, but later, purchases from fellow businesses and some short covering resulted in closing prices that were slightly lower by one or two points, except for October, which rose by five points. Indian cotton, including futures, fell by one rupee.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has become quite active in recent days, however because of the limited stock in Shanghai, large-scale transactions could not be opened. Nevertheless, the intention of all parties to purchase is extremely strong, giving the impression that there is nowhere to buy goods.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Supported by Loans

In the unofficial securities market yesterday, rumors spread that China and the United States were engaged in new loan negotiations for a substantial sum. This boosted morale, and a buying spree swept away the sluggishness of recent days. Market prices rose sharply, increasing by nearly one dollar. Meanwhile, the market price had been slowly declining for almost ten days, and many had closed out their floating profits. With a new stimulus, rising prices became easier. The opening price in the morning was only up by ten cents, but it gradually rose thereafter. Tong Shun Ren Chang first bought in, followed by Yong Feng Lian Yi and Heng Fu absorbing the stocks. However, Yi Tai sold No. 24 shares. Type E shares were still being offered. Jiu Feng and Hu He Ji also divested their holdings. By noon, prices had risen by seventy or eighty cents. In the afternoon, Hong Da bought in, and Jiu Feng and Tai Feng both had needs. Type C shares were temporarily raised to eight dollars. Later, Xie Da Lian He sold more, while No. 41 and No. 16 shares were again in demand. Yi Tai continued to sell Type E shares, and Sheng Da also divested their holdings. The market price dropped slightly by twenty or thirty cents. The final result was that market prices rose across the board by thirty cents to eighty-five cents. The transaction volume was around 1.1 million dollars. A simplified table is listed below:

In stock trading, 100 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were transacted at a price of $24.50.

Public industry stocks are steadily rising, and prices have made further progress. Most stocks have recovered about one-third of the losses from the major crash two weeks ago. Whether they will rise further depends entirely on future political developments.

London, October 17 (Thursday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks showed slight fluctuations in paper bank shares. HSBC's London-registered shares continued to rise by £1.5 to £60, while Hong Kong-registered shares fell again by £5 to £65, with no trading activity. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £10 and 5 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

### Sino-British Cotton Mill Continues to Issue New Shares

Sino-British Cotton Mill Co., Ltd., in light of the excellent results of its previous new share offering, plans to issue 240,100 shares from the remaining 799,500 unissued shares. These new shares will be sold at a price of $7.50 (national currency) per share (face value of $5 per share, previous sale price of $5.50 national currency).

### Jardine Brewery Issues New Shares

Jardine Brewery Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., has been established for three years. Its equipment is new and its products are sold throughout the Far East. Business has also been quite good.

It is understood that the company will publicly offer new shares within the next week, with the British company Lien & Co. undertaking the offering. It is reported that the offering price will be $6 national currency per share.

### Dried and Fresh Fruits: Miscellaneous Road Longans Rise in Price

The price of miscellaneous road dried longans has risen due to the imminent arrival of supplies from the production area. According to telecommunications from Tong'an yesterday, the price of large-sized goods has risen by more than twenty dollars compared to before. However, transportation is very slow and expensive, so the declared costs make it difficult to relax for the time being.

### Carrying Naval Dependents Away: US Flagship Departed for the Philippines Yesterday; Admiral Hart Also Aboard; Preparations for Evacuating American Nationals Continue Amidst Much Activity; US Navy Club Buildings to Jewish Community Association

The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, weighed anchor and departed Shanghai at 11:20 AM yesterday. Regarding the destination and whether the fleet commander, Admiral Hart, was traveling with the ship, the US Navy maintained strict secrecy and declined to comment. However, reliable sources confirmed that the ship was heading to Manila and that Admiral Hart had already departed to be stationed there. Given the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, it was essential for Hart to arrive and command the overall situation. It is reported that in addition to the dependents of senior US Navy officers, there were also 21 reservists from Shanghai on board the ship. As for previous reports that the ship would return to the US after arriving in Manila, it is now understood that this has not been fully decided. The ship must wait for orders from Washington after arrival before determining its course of action, whether to return to the US or remain stationed in the Pacific. According to investigations, there are still three US Navy vessels remaining in Shanghai, namely Admiral Hart's private yacht USS Isabel, and the Yangtze Patrol gunboats USS Luzon and USS Guam.

American Nationals to Depart, with Infinite Reluctance

Among the American nationals in Shanghai, the number of women and children who have applied to the American President Lines to reserve cabin space in preparation for evacuation has increased to over 300 as of last night, bringing the total to approximately 3,600 people. Although the majority of American women and children in Shanghai have packed their belongings and are preparing to return home, the situation remains calm. According to investigations conducted by reporters among the American community in Shanghai, the American women and children generally view this evacuation as a vacation back home, rather than an act of refuge. The wife of a prominent American national smiled and told reporters, "Our departure is just a temporary vacation. We firmly believe that we will return to this land in the near future." This demonstrates the strong bond between China and the US. Their imminent evacuation is truly a last resort. Therefore, the American Women's Club of Shanghai is still proceeding with all its future plans as usual and is not planning to dissolve.

US-China Commerce Not Expected to Be Hindered

The livelihood issues of those returning to the US are also worth noting. Most have relatives in the US to rely on. However, some American women in Shanghai who have jobs may face considerable difficulties in finding new employment after returning to the US, which is why they are reluctant to leave China. Nevertheless, according to investigations conducted by reporters, no one has expressed resentment towards the government's evacuation plan. It is acknowledged that the evacuation plan will inevitably interrupt social enterprises. However, the majority of men will remain in Shanghai, which will prevent US-China commercial relations from being hindered. Even if there is an interruption, it will only be temporary and limited to Shanghai, the Yangtze River basin, and various parts of North China. Since the opening of the Burma Road, the trade between the US and Free China will inevitably prosper extraordinarily.

Six Evacuation Ships May Be Available

The US government is expediting the evacuation of American nationals by dispatching large ships to the Far East to carry them. The confirmed ships are the President Monde, President Washington, Mariposa, and Manhattan. The first three ships will depart in succession, while the Manhattan will be the last to depart. All of the above ships are expected to arrive in the Far East in early next month. In addition, according to information from the American community, the President Lines' President Pierce and President Coolidge will also arrive in Shanghai soon. Therefore, there will be six ships carrying American nationals from the Far East next month. The four large ships departing from the US to the Far East will carry as many evacuating American nationals as possible. It is also reported that the President Washington increased its cabin capacity last week. However, it is still unknown whether these ships will be able to carry all the numerous American nationals scattered throughout the Far East. However, it is reported that if the ships are insufficient, other methods will be considered, or more ships may be dispatched to the Far East to transport them.

Reservations Are Extremely Enthusiastic

The President Lines' President Pierce, scheduled to depart Shanghai for the US on November 1st, has had all its cabin space fully booked. The President Coolidge, originally scheduled to depart Shanghai on October 24th, has been rescheduled to depart Shanghai on November 6th. The reason for the delay may be to wait for American nationals from North China who plan to transit through Shanghai to return to the US. It is reported that as of yesterday, the company has received approximately 3,600 applications for cabin reservations, mostly from women and children, which may mean that all of the President Lines' ships coming to Shanghai in the near future will be entirely occupied by American nationals.

Clubhouse Sold to Jewish People

According to foreign sources, the buildings of the US Navy Fourth Regiment Club on Bubbling Well Road have been sold to the Shanghai Jewish Community Association for a price of one million yuan. According to an employee of the Jewish Community Association yesterday, they expect to start occupying the buildings in July. The Fourth Regiment Club must move out within three months. The purchaser has already paid the first down payment of 50,000 yuan, but it is not yet known when the full price will be paid. The current buildings of the Fourth Regiment Club were originally owned by the Shanghai

Race Club

as the International Recreation Club, and are one of the most exquisite buildings in Shanghai. It is said that the price obtained from this sale did not exceed the price when it was purchased. This transaction was concluded because the Shanghai Jewish Community Association has received notice from the landlord to vacate its current clubhouse on Muirhead Road immediately. The Jewish Community Association considered the clubhouse on Muirhead Road to be too small and insufficient for its needs, which led to the purchase of the Fourth Regiment Club.

Jewish Community Association

Due to the fact that the association's finances are not sufficient to purchase the buildings, it has issued shares for subscription by various members in order to accumulate funds. Each share is priced at 100 yuan in legal tender or 10 US dollars. It is said that the received share funds will be repaid no later than 1950. The Fourth Regiment Club moved in April 1938, shortly after the International Recreation Club moved out. Before moving into the buildings on Bubbling Well Road, the Fourth Regiment Club was scattered in different locations, all within

American Military Zones

Including the junior officers' club at the intersection of Seymour Road and Wuting Road, the soldiers' club on Gordon Road, the Second Battalion club on Weihaiwei Road, and the officers' club on Xiaoshadu Road. After acquiring the buildings of the International Recreation Club on Bubbling Well Road, all the clubs for soldiers and officers were merged into one, named the Fourth Regiment Club.

### With Reopening of Burma Road, Market Conditions Immediately Become Lively; Two Batches of Goods Have Already Been Shipped from Rangoon; Mail Delivery Will Take One Month; Joint Transportation Already Underway on Trial Basis

After the Burma Road was reopened and transportation resumed, the Chinese government dispatched a large number of heavy-duty trucks to transport goods. In the future, military equipment and essential supplies can be imported through this road, and major local products can be exported through this road, making it one of China's international channels. From this road to Rangoon and then to Southeast Asia and Europe, the journey is shortened by 2,000 nautical miles. Regarding the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai, since the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by Japanese warships and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was interrupted, the joint transportation of passengers and goods between Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou was forced to be suspended. Now that the Burma Road has reopened and joint transportation has resumed, the various industries that have been quiet for a long time are greatly encouraged, and the market immediately becomes lively.

Goods Transported to Rangoon

The Burma Road officially opened yesterday and transportation has resumed. Two batches of goods transported from Shanghai to Rangoon via Singapore have already been shipped. It is reported that there will be a Glen Line ship leaving Shanghai next Thursday, passing through Hong Kong and Singapore, and going directly to Rangoon. It is managed by Tung Yick Shipping Co. and Hongyun Navigation Bureau. Currently, merchants are registering with these two companies to load goods, and it is expected that there will be a full load of goods transported to Rangoon at that time. The Shanghai-Vietnam route has been interrupted for two weeks. It has long been rumored that the French company has decided to dispatch cargo ships to resume navigation.

Imported Rice Arrives; Two Ships Have Arrived in Shanghai First

It is now known that the two ships that arrived in Shanghai first, the Yalu and Lac, arrived at the port one after another yesterday afternoon. They were loaded with a large amount of imported rice from Saigon, totaling 7,400 tons. Both ships are docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. The Lac is scheduled to resume navigation to Haiphong and Saigon from Shanghai first tomorrow (the 20th). The Yalu is scheduled to depart for Vietnam next Wednesday (the 23rd). The third ship, the Jindia, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th and is scheduled to resume navigation to Haiphong on the 27th.

News Navigation Route

In addition, the mail ship Dardennes has opened up a new route, the journey from Saigon to Little Luzon, from Little Luzon to Shanghai, to Kobe, Japan, from Kobe directly to Little Luzon, and then from Little Luzon to Shanghai, and then back to Saigon. Hong Kong is not included due to the diplomatic relations between Britain and France. The mail ship has already gone from Saigon to the Philippines and will arrive in Shanghai from Little Luzon on the 30th of this month. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Kobe, Japan, on November 1st. It is found that the Dardennes was blocked in the Far East after the expansion of the European War, and is now temporarily sailing on the new Far East route.

Parcel Registration

The Burma Road was opened yesterday, and Southwest mail can be transported along this road. However, at the beginning of the opening, there must be a lot of military supplies waiting to be transported, and the transportation of goods and mail bags must be behind. Therefore, at this time, the post office is still difficult to immediately collect and send Southwest commercial parcels. Now, for the parcel part, registration will be done first, and the printing of heavy items will be waited for a notice. The Burma post office will have a postal delivery list transferred in the next few days to prepare for the collection and delivery. However, according to the observation of the business unit, the Southwest mail can be transported by the Burma Road, the fastest time is also required after a month. Regarding the Japanese aircraft will be bombed after the road is opened, and whether the postal delivery will be affected when bombed, it is said that the Yunnan-Vietnam Road was also constantly bombed before, and did not hinder the postal delivery. Therefore, the situation of the Burma Road will naturally be the same. The first Yunnan-Vietnam Road is a train, the Burma Road is a highway, and the transportation efficiency is inevitably inferior.

Joint Transport Trial

After the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, various transportation companies stopped accepting joint transport goods. Now, due to the opening of the Burma Road, the joint transportation of Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou has resumed. In addition to sending people to Rangoon and other places to inspect, joint transport goods are also being tried to be received. It is transported from Shanghai to Rangoon, from the railway to Lashio, and then from the Burma Road to Yunnan. However, the water feet and freight are more expensive than other roads before. It is also heard that several trucks have been approved by the government to drive specifically on the Burma Road to load passengers and goods.

Commercial Goods Portage

After the opening of the Burma Road, although 5,000 trucks have been allocated to drive, the input is limited to military equipment and necessities, and the output is generally tung oil, tungsten sand, and bristles, which are the main local products. Because of the loan and barter relationship with the United States, ordinary goods will be transported by portage. After the Ministry of Communications established the portage management office, the trial run of the Yibin to Kunming section was quite successful. According to its freight, it is cheaper than road transportation, and the amount of transportation can be developed as much as possible, without being restricted by modern materials. It is heard that there are more than 10,000 porters on the Burma Road. Now, beside the Burma Road, carrying goods in groups, there is no need to worry about the military supply and trade migration in the future.

### French Concession Tram Strike Resolved; Officially Signed This Morning; Some Vehicles May Be Able to Start Operating This Afternoon

The long-suspended French Concession tram workers' strike has gradually become clearer after various parties took on the task of mediation. So far, the labor and management sides have completely approached each other. All seven labor and management agreements and two addenda were originally scheduled to be officially signed at 3:00 PM yesterday, but it was heard that it was not fulfilled yesterday because the labor side's opinions were still waiting to be discussed. Therefore, it has been rescheduled to this morning (the 19th) for the labor and management sides to officially sign the resumption of work agreement. It is also heard that if time permits, some vehicles may be able to leave the factory and operate this afternoon. The relevant document will be officially announced by the labor and management sides after signing.

Management Attitude; Workers at a Loss

The English-language North China Daily News stated that after 2,500 Chinese workers of the French Concession Tram Company went on strike, the buses and trams of the French Concession and the settlement were completely suspended for four weeks. The representatives of the strikers today (the 18th) have directly negotiated with the manager of the company, Favrefet, and the public vehicles of the French Concession and the settlement are expected to resume normal operation tomorrow. According to an employee of the French Concession Tram Company, the long-term unresolved strike is all due to the attitude of the mediator, the Rice Jiang Company, in conveying the strike workers.

Wage Increase; Almost No Problem

As for whether the management will accept the main points of the seven-point demands raised by the labor side on October 7, it was not possible to find out this morning. Favrefet said that both sides should be able to agree on a solution this afternoon. Although he could not say that the company will accept all the demands of the workers, it can be said that the wages of the workers will be increased.

Temporary Workers; All Dismissed

Temporary workers hired after the strike will be dismissed, because it was stated when they were hired that they would only be employed during the strike. Also, this morning, some rickshaw pullers in the French Concession went on strike to protest against the rickshaw owners increasing the rickshaw rent. Sixty rickshaw pullers in the Dakang Lane on Conscience Road held a "meeting" to encourage people to join the strike.

### Japanese Troops in Shanghai Suburbs; Completely Withdrawn; Fierce Counter-Offensive on the East Battlefield; Chinese Aircraft Reconnoiter the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

After the Chinese troops on the East Battlefield recently launched a fierce counter-offensive in the Tianmu Mountain area, the Japanese troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways have been forced to withdraw completely to provide reinforcements. According to reports, the Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shanghai, except for a small number of naval landing forces, are all Japanese security forces with no combat experience. They are currently stationed in the three districts of Shanghai, Suzhou, and Jiaxing, and the number is extremely small, with a total of only two or three battalions. The Chinese mobile units are concentrated in the areas of Jiaxing West, Huzhou, Liyang, and Yixing, and are more active than before. In the middle of last week, at about 1:00 AM in the middle of the night, the Chinese Air Force once conducted a night reconnaissance along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and went to Jiaxing and the airspace over Songjiang. At that time, the Japanese troops stationed along the road were very panicked.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cables All Sectors; Strive to Save and Deposit; Absorb Idle Capital to Increase Production and Balance Prices; Cultivate Thrift and Achieve the Goal of National Construction

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday cabled all party members, civil servants, and front-line and rear-area soldiers, farmers, workers, merchants, and students throughout the country to strive to participate in the Saving the Nation by Economy Deposits. The cable stated, "The War of Resistance has reached its later stages, and the development of economic strength is essential for victory. In order to absorb idle capital, increase production, and balance prices, all party members, civil servants, and front-line and rear-area soldiers, farmers, workers, merchants, and students throughout the country should strive to participate in the Saving the Nation by Economy Savings movement, purchase and deposit savings bonds, or open an account at the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau for savings deposits. Not only should they continue to join the association on a monthly basis, but they should also universally advise relatives and friends to actively save, in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the goal of national construction. It is hoped that this will be strictly followed."

### Japanese Officer Shot on Yuyuan Road in Western Shanghai; A Young Man Suddenly Opened Fire on Two People Walking Together; One Was Shot in the Head and Said to Be in Critical Condition

A shooting occurred on Yuyuan Road 668 Lane in Western Shanghai at around 1:40 PM yesterday. The victims were two Japanese plainclothes officers, one of whom was shot twice in the head and immediately fell to the ground. The details are recorded below:

Ambushed on the Way, Two Injured, One Killed

At about 1:45 PM yesterday afternoon, two Japanese plainclothes military officers from the Jisi Feier Road Japanese Military Police Headquarters walked out of the headquarters. They passed through Qianjia Alley, a small road, and arrived at Yuyuan Road 668 Lane, intending to contact the Military Police Headquarters at 669 Lane (i.e., Yuguang Village) across the street. When they reached the middle section of 668 Lane, next to a bamboo fence, a young man who had been lying in ambush took out a pistol, aimed at the two officers, and fired. One officer was shot in the head on the spot and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and struggling to breathe. The other officer escaped unharmed.

Strict Search, But Nothing Gained

The shooter, seeing that the purpose had been achieved, fled into the small alleys in the Chinese area without a trace. Soon after, the Japanese military police unit in Yuguang Village across the street heard the news and sent dozens of military police officers to the scene to conduct a strict search for the shooter. When the Jing'an Temple Police Station reported, it also immediately drove multiple police vehicles carrying armed detectives to assist in the arrest. However, the shooter had already disappeared without a trace. The situation was very tense for a while.

Traffic Interrupted, the Situation Is Serious

At the entrance of the Fire Brigade at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, the Japanese authorities immediately joined forces with the so-called medical staff to cut off traffic. All Route 20 trolleybuses and buses on each route were not allowed to pass and detoured back. Police officers from the Ludong Police Station were also standing guard with guns, and the situation was serious. When the reporter rushed to investigate at about 4:00 PM, traffic had not yet resumed. It took more than an hour before the situation returned to normal. However, passers-by had to follow the sidewalk and pass after being searched. All vehicles, when traveling in the middle of the road, were also boarded and searched by the Japanese military police.

Injured Officer Sent to Hospital for Treatment

When the reporter went to the scene to investigate, the Yuyuan Road 668 Lane area was still extremely tense. Three to five Japanese military police officers were holding guns in their hands and were very serious. All residents living in the lane were strictly searched before they could enter or exit. As a result, nothing was found. All the small vendors were blocked outside the lane and were not allowed to enter and sell. The injured plainclothes Japanese officer was then sent to the Japanese Military Hospital in Jiangwan by the headquarters for treatment. However, it was impossible to find out whether he was killed or not at that time.

### Clearing Up the Source of Domestic Rice; It May Be Realized; Japanese Side Has a Tendency to Accept; Foreign Rice Enters the Customs at 70 Yuan

The authorities of the two concessions are quite determined to stabilize the food supply in the city. They have consulted and taken effective steps several times. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with a senior official of the authorities yesterday and asked whether the authorities had obtained any clues about clearing up the source of domestic rice. According to the official, the authorities of the two concessions have consulted with the Japanese side several times on this matter, and have negotiated on the large-scale transportation of domestic rice to Shanghai. According to the attitude of the Japanese side, it seems to be acceptable. The official continued, "If this matter is realized, a large amount of domestic rice will arrive in port." Yesterday, the market saw a decline, and the highest-priced foreign rice had entered the customs at 70 yuan.

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai (Shaoxing, Zhuji, Yuyao, Shangyu, Shengxian, Xiaoshan, Xinchang) has been established for 30 years. The association held a meeting on the 13th of this month and decided to hold a celebration conference for the 30th anniversary on November 3rd.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Approves; Telephone Surcharge; Private Residential Telephones Increase by 70 Percent; Business Telephones Collect 120 Percent

Yesterday (the 18th), it was learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council has temporarily approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's current telephone bill, with an additional surcharge of 165%. When the Shanghai Telephone Company's stock opened at 32 yuan in the city's securities market yesterday morning, it rose to 44 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. It is generally believed that this is due to the Shanghai Municipal Council's "temporary approval" of the telephone surcharge. However, people in the securities market said that the Shanghai Municipal Council only approved the Telephone Company to increase the surcharge by 70% for private residential telephones, and 120% for business telephones. Officials from the Shanghai Municipal Council refused to disclose details about the telephone surcharge this morning. However, it was heard that although the Shanghai Municipal Council has temporarily approved the additional charge, it must be agreed with the French Concession authorities before it can be finally approved.

### Wah Mow Laundry Company Strike; Workers Smash Police Car; Three Officers Injured and Nine Workers Arrested; Management Does Not Accept Demands

At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, striking workers of the British-owned Wah Mow Laundry Company in Yangshupu clashed with police officers, resulting in one police car being smashed and police officers firing warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd. The details obtained are recorded below:

Laundry Giant; Thriving Business

The British-owned Wah Mow Laundry Company at 278 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, is a large-scale laundry, divided into two departments: laundry and ironing. It has branch offices at 1176 Jing'an Temple Road and 22 Maersiai Road, managed by the British manager, Kleno Qian. It employs more than 200 workers, and undertakes the washing of clothes for the Cathay Hotel in Sassoon House and major foreign companies. The business is extremely prosperous.

One Week Strike; Conditions Rejected

Recently, due to the high cost of living and soaring prices, all the workers of the company requested the management to increase wages. Because the management did not give a satisfactory answer, the workers went on strike a week ago. After mediation by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the workers also agreed to resume work, but put forward eight conditions, including (1) wages during the strike period will be paid as usual, (2) annual salary increase of 20%, and (3) reinstatement of dismissed worker representatives. As a result, the management rejected these demands.

Prevent New Workers; Causing Disturbances

After the strike was deadlocked, the management hired more than 50 new workers to work, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a large number of striking workers gathered in front of the gate to prevent the new workers from entering. When the Secretary-General intervened, a conflict occurred. At one time, the striking workers threw stones and bricks at the company. At that time, Miss Qian Ling Qiaofei, a Western female officer, was the first to be injured, and the two Indian police officers were also beaten.

Police Car Damaged; Shots Fired to Disperse

The company authorities immediately telegraphed the police station and sent two police cars carrying a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the situation. Because there were a large number of workers, at that time, a police car was smashed by stones, and the police officers and others were surrounded and had to fire more than ten shots into the air as a warning to disperse the workers. Afterwards, the injured were taken to the Gongji Hospital for treatment by car, and it was also heard that nine workers who had caused the incident were arrested and taken to the police station for questioning.

### Panchen Lama Bronze Statue; Consecrated Today; Thousand Lamps Offered Every Day

Master Rong Zeng has built a bronze statue of the Panchen Lama and will consecrate it in the main hall of Jueyuan in Hartung Road today. A Dharma assembly will also be held. It is found that statue-making was most popular in the Jin, Wei, Tang, and Song dynasties in China. Today, there are still rubbings of statues from the Northern Wei Dynasty, which are treasured by the world. Buddhism attaches the most importance to

Making Statues to Attack Virtue

Believing that it can bring auspiciousness and peace to all beings in the three realms, eliminate external physical diseases, internal mental distress, prolong life, have full blessings, and enjoy as desired. It can also guide the souls of the dead to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. Therefore, this decision to hold a consecration Dharma assembly, in addition to being held daily by all believers

Offering Thousands of Lamps

Promote wisdom and blessings, illuminate the hidden and the bright. The original ten days (200 yuan for daily offering) have now been extended to 20 days due to the large number of offerings. In addition, a special seat for the deceased is offered to supernaturally liberate the dead souls, and a longevity seat is set up

Prolong Life Blessing

Participants are very enthusiastic and are still registering. Each special seat costs 10 yuan, and an ordinary seat costs 2 yuan. Although the cost varies in amount and the blessings vary in size, Buddhist Dharma is equal, so the merits are the same. This decision to make the statue costs about 30,000 gold, which are all from

Master Rong Zeng

One's offering, not soliciting donations from outside. Master Rong Zeng is a Bhikkhu, how can he have such a huge amount of money? It is actually formed by the accumulation of offerings from his tens of thousands of disciples from Tibet to Qinghai, Gansu, Mongolia, Yan, Hebei East to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, South to Hong Kong and Guangdong, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, as well as in Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Estonia, Latvia, India, and Siam.

### Yong's Li Gonglin Assassinated, Died Yesterday – Gunman Burst into Room and Fired One Shot – Bullet Pierced Temple, Also Wounding a Cook

Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, an assassination occurred at the Continental Hotel, No. 69 Yu Qiaqing Road, Public Concession. The victim was the hotel's general manager, Li Gonglin, who was shot in the left temple and died on the spot. The details are as follows:

Discussing Accounts

Li Gonglin, a native of Ningbo, was 40 years old and currently the general manager of the Continental Hotel at No. 69 Yu Qiaqing Road. He previously held important positions in the Ningbo Native Association, was a senior staff member at the Hengdali Watch Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, and worked for the Quartermaster Department of the Military Affairs Ministry of the National Government. He lived at No. 33, Racing Club Apartment, No. 1069 Edward Road. He went to the Continental Hotel to work every afternoon as usual, and intended to convene an accounting meeting due to accounting issues related to the Continental Restaurant affiliated with the Continental Hotel.

Gunman Bursts In

He went to a small room on the mezzanine of the Western Cuisine Department of the restaurant. After he was seated, Sun Yifei, the director of the Western Cuisine Department, came to talk to him. Suddenly, two men broke into the room, one wearing Chinese attire and the other Western attire, both in their thirties. After entering, they asked Li, "Are you Li Gonglin?" Li immediately replied yes. Unexpectedly, the man in Chinese attire suddenly drew a gun and fired at Li. The bullet entered from Li's left temple and exited from his right temple. Li immediately fell to the ground and bled profusely.

Two People Hit

At that time, Chen A'san (46 years old, Ningbo native, residing at No. 599 Da Tong Road), a cook in the restaurant's Western Cuisine Department, happened to be next to Li. The bullet that hit Li, after exiting, struck Chen A'san's left arm. The bullet did not exit. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two gunmen left together and fled. It was reported that three men dressed as blue cloth workers were watching outside the door. The tea server outside the room heard the gunshot and rushed inside to check, finding both Li and Chen lying on the ground. They then reported to the responsible police station from the accounting room, and a large number of detectives were dispatched to investigate, but the perpetrators had already fled far away.

One Dead, One Injured

An ambulance was urgently called to take Li Gonglin and Chen A'san to Baolong Hospital. Li Gonglin died before arriving at the hospital. The bullet in A'san's arm was removed by the doctor, and his injuries were relatively minor. It is said that Li was usually quite honest and tolerant, had no enemies, and had no other external activities. This sudden assassination was unexpected, and he had not received any letters beforehand, so the reason for his attack is unknown. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.

### Robbery on Yuanchang Road – Police Opened Fire During Arrest – One Thief Wounded, One Officer Injured

The home of a certain family surnamed at No. 50 Yuanchang Road, Hongkou, was suddenly invaded by three thieves at 11:30 AM yesterday. Two of them were armed with pistols. As a result, they stole over 1,400 yuan in cash and jewelry and fled. At that time, nearby police officers who had received the news rushed to arrest them. The thieves, realizing the situation was bad, fired their guns to resist arrest. The police also returned fire. For a time, gunshots rang out, and pedestrians fled in terror. As a result, one thief was wounded on the spot but still managed to escape. Police officer No. 191 was also injured by a thief's bullet and was sent to the hospital for treatment afterward.

### Extra Twist in Li Yuying Case – Seamstress Demands Payment – Plaintiff's Lawsuit Dismissed

The sudden death of Li Yuying (also known as Jie Ru), the head nurse of the Sino-Western Sanitarium at No. 536 Bushi Road, caused a social sensation. Although the main figures in the case, Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang, were acquitted in the first trial, Prosecutor Zhao Changmin of the Special Second Court has appealed to the High Third Branch, and the trial is expected to begin soon. It is anticipated that the truth will be revealed. However, after the case occurred, an unexpected twist arose: the China Funeral Home filed a lawsuit in the civil division of the Special Second Court against the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, seeking over 1,000 yuan in funeral expenses. This case has not yet concluded and is still under trial. Recently, Bao A'rong, a seamstress from Albert Road, also sued the hospital and Li Shizhen, demanding 81 yuan in tailoring fees. Li commissioned three lawyers, Li Zhongdao, Wu Zhiping, and Wang Hengyi, to appear in court and argue that Lu Lingqing had stated that he would be responsible for all of his daughter's funeral and tailoring expenses and would pay for them. Therefore, there was no reason for the plaintiff to seek payment from the defendant. Moreover, the clothes sewn by the plaintiff were not taken from the defendant's residence but were entirely handled by Lu Zhenqing, so the claim should be made against Lu. The court reviewed the arguments, declared the debate closed, and rendered a judgment yesterday morning: "Main text": The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the litigation costs are to be borne by the plaintiff.

### Seventeen-Year-Old Woman Sues to Inherit Deceased Sister's Estate and Sues Great-Niece for One-Quarter of Property - Yesterday, the Judge Facilitated a Settlement Between the Two Parties

Wang Zhang Zaihua, a wealthy woman from Nanhui, has been married to Wang Yonglin, a giant in the pawn industry, as his second wife for many years. She has no children. Wang Yonglin's first wife, Xie, gave birth to a son named Mingji, who passed away long ago. He left behind one son and one daughter, the son named Jingren and the daughter named Ningwa. Wang Yonglin's concubine, Cheng, also gave birth to one son and one daughter, the son named Yizhi and the daughter named Zhengan. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), Wang Yonglin died of illness in Shanghai. His household affairs were managed by Wang Zhang Zaihua. Zhang had a large private

property, including a passbook in the name of Hua Ji with a deposit of 10,000 yuan in the Zhengxiang Tongji Money Shop, a 2,000-yuan IOU from Wang Yizhi, a passbook in the name of Zhang Ji with a deposit of 200 yuan in the Qiachang Pawnshop, and thirteen trunks of clothing placed in an upstairs room at No. 6 Peace Lane, Avenal Avenue. Seven trunks were deposited in Zhengxiang Tongji Bank, containing various items of clothing, as well as Shanghai Four Banks Trust Household Type B No. 291, Datong Bank Aizi No. 26, and a Hua Ji household safe, containing over 30,000 yuan, as well as some gold and passbooks. The above property is all Zhang's private property. In March of this year,

Zhang died of illness. Her older sister, Zhang Zaihe (widow of the Sheng family, 77 years old this year), in accordance with Article 1238, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, hired lawyer Huang Jiyuan to file a lawsuit in the First Special Civil Court against Wang Jingren, Wang Ningwa, Wang Yizhi, Wang Zhengan, etc., requesting confirmation that the estate owned by Wang Zhang Zaihua should be completely inherited by the plaintiff alone, regarding the properties

of all of Wang Yonglin, such as Ji Hong, Ji Tai, Qia Chang, Tong Ji, Xiang Tai Pawnshops, New China Bank, Zhengxiang Tongji Bank, Hua Shang Electric Company stocks and deposits, land and real estate etc., also requested

to be divided into four shares. The plaintiff requested one-quarter. The court accepted the case and yesterday Judge Tao opened a civil court to summon. The defendant Wang Ningwa did not appear nor did she appoint a lawyer to appear in court. The plaintiff Sheng Zhang Zaihe commissioned lawyer Huang Jiyuan to represent her in court. After Judge Tao finished questioning the ages of the defendants, the defendant Wang Yizhi’s lawyer, Zhao Xizeng, immediately rose and asked the court to postpone the hearing to facilitate an out-of-court settlement. Defendant Wang Zhengan’s attorney, Yan Qishi, had no comment. The plaintiff’s attorney agreed. Judge Tao then announced that the case would be postponed to November 6. If the parties failed to reach a settlement, the trial would continue. He then adjourned the court.

### Japanese Military Training Instructor Suddenly Hanged Himself

On the afternoon of the 16th of this month at 11 o'clock, Kamei Hideo, a Japanese military training instructor at the East Asia Common Culture Academy, for unknown reasons, suddenly hanged himself in his dormitory room in the academy that night.

### Publishing News - Essence of Western Books Autumn Edition Published

The Essence of Western Books, published by the Xifeng Press, translates the essence of Western books and can indeed make up for the shortcomings of those who cannot read Western books in their entirety.

### Doctor Yao Juyan Kidnapped Last Night and Escaped - Bandits Injured Three Passersby in a Car - Japanese Military Police Arrested All of Them - Yao Has Been Released and Passersby Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Yao Juyan, a local Shanghai resident, 40 years old, graduated from the Medical Department of the Imperial University of Japan. He is a venereal disease doctor. He lives at No. 869 Wuding Road in western Shanghai and has a clinic at No. 9 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession. Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, Yao Juyan was returning home from the clinic in his own car (No. 8018), driven by his chauffeur Jiang Mao Xiang. Usually, the car would stop outside the iron gate upon arrival, and the chauffeur would honk the horn, after which the servant at home would open the gate. Yesterday, the car had just arrived at the gate, but it stopped abruptly. Before the chauffeur could honk the horn,

five kidnappers emerged from the side of the road, all with pistols, warning them not to make a sound. The five bandits then successively boarded the car and ordered the chauffeur Jiang Mao Xiang to drive. Seeing the pistols, the chauffeur did not dare to resist and drove westward. When they reached the intersection of Wuding Road and Jiaozhou Road, they ordered the car to stop again. The bandits then drove the chauffeur out of the car. A bandit acting as the driver sped away, but when the car passed the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road in western Shanghai, due to the inexperience of the bandit driver,

three passersby were hit. The car's machinery was also damaged as a result and could not move. The kidnappers had no choice but to drag Yao Juyan out of the car and pull him along. When they reached Jessfield Road, they were spotted by several Japanese military police officers. Suspecting their behavior, the Japanese military police ordered them to stop. Yao Juyan, who had studied in Japan and spoke Japanese fluently, told the Japanese military police what had happened. The Japanese military police then took Yao and

the five kidnappers to the Japanese military police headquarters at No. 94 Jessfield Road. It is reported that Yao Juyan has been released by the Japanese side and has returned home. The injured pedestrians, Zhang Liu (20 years old), injured in the chest; Zhang A'mei (15 years old), injured in the face; and Chen Dayuan (28 years old), injured in the head, were sent to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment after being called by the police with an ambulance.

### Case of Whittle Involved in Stealing Copper Blocks - Japanese Side States Position - No Cooperation in Arresting Whittle - Police Authorities Will Not Withdraw Arrest Warrant

According to the Shanghai Times, Swiss national Whittle recently colluded with others to steal a large amount of copper blocks worth 2 million yuan from the warehouse of the American firm Ruifeng Transport Company. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department obtained an arrest warrant signed by the Swiss Consul General to Shanghai, Fontanel, and went to the White Lodge Building to arrest Whittle, but was blocked by the Japanese military police. Fontanel submitted a representation to the Japanese authorities last week, and yesterday (the 17th) received a formal reply from the Japanese Consulate, stating that the Japanese army would not cooperate with any attempts to arrest Whittle for "military" reasons. This is the first time the Japanese side has officially stated its position on this shocking theft case. According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, Fontanel told reporters this morning (the 18th) that although the Japanese authorities refused to cooperate with the Public Concession police authorities in arresting the thief Whittle, the arrest warrant he issued for Whittle

would not be withdrawn. The case is not closed, and Whittle must be arrested before the case is settled. He will protest to the Japanese authorities again for their refusal to cooperate. The police are still continuing to investigate the case and are closely interrogating Penter, Whittle's accomplice, who was arrested in Hongkou on Monday morning.

### Weather Forecast

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in North China and the Yellow Sea would change from cloudy to overcast with south to east winds. Due to a low-pressure system over Henan, the weather in the Yangtze River basin would be cloudy with showers and rain, with no fixed wind direction. The East China Sea would change from cloudy to overcast, with light and unfixed winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai was a high of 80.4 and a low of 64.9. On the same day last year, the high was 83.1 and the low was 64.8.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: Our director, Zhang Guoquan, reported the blackmailing letter he received from hooligans to the police. The case is under investigation after the suspects were arrested. However, your newspaper stated yesterday that "our organization was founded by Mr. Wang and Gao Xiangsheng, and was later taken over by Zhang Guoquan." This is completely untrue. Our organization was founded on November 1, 1938, and a board of directors was established at the same time, appointing Mr. Zhang Guoquan as director. On January 27, 1939, we registered with the Public Concession Police Department and were issued Registration Certificate C No. 23. We also received a grant of 10,000 yuan from the National Relief Commission as a foundation to start our work. There was absolutely no participation by Mr. Wang or the so-called Gao Xiangsheng. However, in past charity organizations, there was a Wang Guangdao, the head of the Infant Relief Center, who was arrested and sentenced by the police authorities on June 16, 1939, for fraud. Therefore, our organization has absolutely no connection with the Infant Relief Center run by Mr. Wang. Your newspaper's statement that it was taken over by our director, Zhang Guoquan, is obviously a mistake. Although this statement is just an ordinary news item in your newspaper, it is of great importance to our organization's reputation. We have always admired your newspaper as an authority in the press, and you have always made every effort to protect and promote social undertakings. Therefore, we are writing to you to request that you publish a letter to the editor to correct this error. We would be most grateful for your assistance. Sincerely, The Secretariat of the Shanghai Poor and Out-of-School Children's Relief Institute, October 17, 1940.

The final showdown of the charity basketball challenge, the sixth main game, will be held tonight at the China Youth Gymnasium between the Shanghai-Qing team and the Paramount team. The event will then be closed. According to the organizers of this charity event, under the chairmanship of Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Nanchiao College, five games have been held, and the proceeds from ticket sales and the auction of game balls have been considerable, with outstanding results. In addition to the college band playing on the field today, Yuan himself will be present to auction off two game balls from the previous game and this game. It is expected that this will break the previous record. There will also be a side show before the game, with a women's basketball performance at 9:30 PM between the Youyou team and the Jingwu team, and two Sino-Western men's basketball matches starting at 7:30 PM between the Western Youth Giants and the Paramount B team. Tickets are sold for ten yuan and five yuan. Many have already been sold at various presale locations. After the results of this charity match are obtained, a grand award ceremony will be held on the opening day of the Chrysanthemum Exhibition on the 24th.

Strength Review

Paramount has won all five games. Tonight, Xu Wenkui will assist again. With the addition of veterans such as Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xianglong, and Feng Nianhua, they will surely have even more outstanding performances to maintain their winning honor. Shanghai-Qing was the champion of the previous China Youth League. Unfortunately, they lost to Paramount in the Combined Cup and ranked first. They are invincible in the Guangshi Cup and still occupy the top position in Group A. The lineup is outstanding and the strength is strong. Captain Da Mao is tall and strong, and his throws and passes are unique. Ren Xiangcheng has made great strides in his skills recently. In addition, there is Li Zude who is good at dribbling, Tao Shaosheng who is a top scorer, Shen Yugong, Chen Bangzhen who is an iron gate, etc., which is indeed the ideal lineup except for Paramount in Shanghai. Even if Chen Xuechong is unable to come to participate in the game, it will not diminish their fighting power. At the same time, in order to avenge the defeat in the Combined Cup, the three armies will definitely go all out tonight. The intensity of the competition and the brilliance of the performance can be imagined. After the game, there will be a match between the women's teams Youyou and Jingwu. Both teams have first-class players from the isolated island, and their strengths are exceptionally equal. Liu Zhenbao of Youyou has recovered from illness and will play tonight, adding strength like a tiger with wings. The tension of the performance is expected to be no less than the game between Paramount and Shanghai-Qing. As for the Sino-Western men's basketball match, the Western Youth Giants team, taking advantage of its victory over Nanyang, will challenge Paramount B. The latter is full of talent and has veterans such as Lu Dazhen. They should be able to avenge Nanyang and bring glory to the Chinese people.

### Western League Group A - First Week - Donghua to Fight French Businessmen Soon - Starts at 2:30 PM at Yiyuan Stadium - Group B Yousheng to Fight French Army at Aurora

In the second week of the National League Football Group A competition, Donghua will play French Businessmen at 2:30 PM this afternoon at Yiyuan Stadium on Albert Road. Donghua has undergone a major reorganization this year and has a strong military presence. In the first game last week, they defeated the Jewish Club with a score of 4-3, achieving a good start. Although the French Businessmen team has veteran famous defenders Klet, Bayer, and famous forwards Botox, Robert Stoff, etc., the team's combat effectiveness has not been seen as strong. In the first game last week, they encountered Saint Francis and were miserably defeated with a score of 1-3. Today, Donghua's forward line will have Xu Wenkui and Jia Youliang assisting, and they are confident in defeating French Businessmen. Another Group A match between Northwest China Children and Lax, as well as Group B, C and Reserve Leagues, are scheduled to kick off today. Except for the Yousheng team, which is a transformation of the Ge Lian team, playing against the French Army at Aurora Stadium, the remaining matches are mostly Western teams. The tickets for the Donghua vs. French Businessmen match at Yiyuan will be sold for six cents each. The South Stand is still not open, and all spectators will enter from Albert Road.

### Zhejiang Lishui and Three Other Areas Re-establish School Military Training Head Instructors, Appointing and Assigning Them to Respective Schools

(Jinhua Correspondent) In Zhejiang Province, the school military training head instructor system in various areas was previously established according to regulations. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, schools have moved eastward, leading to a de facto suspension. In the previous semester, the Political Department of the military control zone, to facilitate the evaluation of the service performance of school military training instructors, first reinstated the system in Lishui urban area, Bihuzhen area, and the Shengxian Taiping Changle area, and appointed concurrent head instructor personnel. Now, as the first semester of the 29th year has begun, schools have successively started classes. All previously appointed head instructors, except for Huang Zihou, the head instructor of Taiping Changle area, who remains in his original position and continues to serve concurrently, Fang Ren, the head instructor of Lishui urban area, and Sun Tongshu, the head instructor of Bihuzhen area, have resigned. Therefore, Sun Tongshu, an instructor at Yingshi University, is specially appointed as the head instructor of Lishui urban area, and Ying Dexian, the director of teaching affairs at the Provincial Joint Middle School, is appointed as the head instructor of Bihuzhen area. Furthermore, a head instructor position has been added in the Fenxiang area of Ningbo, with Lu Luchang, an instructor at Xiaoshi Middle School, serving concurrently.

### Hunan Provincial Government Chairman Emphasizes Health Education

(Leiyang Correspondent) Xue, the Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, believes that health education is of utmost importance to the rise and fall of the nation. It has been decided that the administrative policy of Hunan Province next year will place special emphasis on health education, and the Health Experiment Office will be responsible for its implementation. Furthermore, considering physical education to be the basis of health education and to encourage young people to strengthen their physique, it has been decided to hold a provincial sports meet in March and April next year. The Education Department has been instructed to prepare everything, and it has also been decided that a grand county-wide children's health competition will be held in all counties across the province on Children's Day next year.

It was originally planned to use Leiyang Zhongshan Park as the provincial sports field, but after expert surveying, it was found that the park's site was too small to accommodate the necessary facilities. It is now planned to renovate the former site of the Fifth Security Regiment at Yu Bentang outside the West Gate.

### Throw Out Our Javelins

— Wang Ting

— In Memory of Mr. Lu Xun

Today marks the fourth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death.

For the past four years, China has been in an unprecedented period of turmoil in its history—the War of Resistance is using astonishing force to strangle the old, mediocre, and weak China to death, while a young and newborn China is standing up from the flames of war and bloodshed!

Countless brave young warriors are paving the way through thorns and weeds, rushing to the forefront of history.

Although Mr. Lu Xun held a sharp javelin and fought bravely during his lifetime, his life was spent in solitary battles. If he could live to this day and see the glimmer of dawn before sunrise and this large group of warriors galloping through thorns and weeds, how happy he would be, and how much more powerful his sharp javelin would become!

However, he died four years ago—this is indeed an irreparable loss for China. But what is gratifying is that he has been buried in the hearts of every living Chinese person, and thousands of young "Lu Xuns" have grown up in the flames of war.

The moment before dawn is the darkest. The accomplice foxes and idle lapdogs cannot help but bark twice in this darkest moment. Throwing out our javelins to strike them is the responsibility of our generation who have not yet died and is the best way to commemorate this great warrior!

Our descendants have the right to demand a peaceful, free, and reasonable life!

### Promoting the Spirit of Lu Xun

— Wei Min

Four years ago today—October 19th, in a corner of the motherland—Shanghai, a long-lasting giant star fell from the high sky, and a bright lamp was extinguished in the darkness. For young people, it was undoubtedly like the lighthouse that indicated the path was short in the vast ocean, that was the passing of our teacher, Mr. Lu Xun!

We know that Mr. Lu Xun initially studied biology and later changed to medicine. However, when he saw through the darkness of the unreasonable and realistic society, he said, "If I study medicine, I will cure the rich and powerful in the future and exploit and squeeze others. If I cure the poor, they will be exploited by others forever!" So he decided not to study medicine and switched to literature. He aimed his sharp pen at these social villains and followers of foreign forces and attacked them. At the same time, he called out for the injustice of the working masses. Exposing darkness, revealing injustice, hating evil like an enemy, and the fighting spirit of unyielding, un-surrendering, un-compromising, and beating "stray dogs" are all worth learning from us, especially today, this spirit needs to be promoted!

On the cornerstone of laying the foundation for the Chinese New Culture Movement, and in leading young people to face the journey of light, our teacher—Mr. Lu Xun's achievements will never be extinguished! And the teacher's spirit of hard work and perseverance is really too great!

Lu Xun's great contribution can be divided into two aspects: one is in creation, and the other is in translation. In the former, Mr. relied on his keen observation and sharp pen to create the style of "miscellaneous essays"; in the latter, Mr. introduced Western literature to China under careful selection, and sowed excellent seeds in the barren garden of Chinese translation.

Mr.'s personal life was frugal and thrifty. He said that he had never worn good clothes or eaten anything that was considered good, but he did not relax at all in striving for the liberation of the entire nation and striving for the realization of a reasonable society. He was constantly fighting and moving forward on the road to democracy and freedom!

However, it is regrettable that the national liberation war has not yet blossomed into brilliant flowers, and our teacher—Mr. Lu Xun has already closed his eyes, and the cause that Mr. had worked hard for all his life—national liberation—has not been completed before Mr.'s death.

However, it doesn't matter, Mr. Lu Xun's legacy has been taken up by thousands of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters! I remember that on the first anniversary of Mr.'s death, Guo Moruo once said such a sentence——"Lu Xun, before, there was no Lu Xun: after Lu Xun, countless Lu Xuns!"

Mr. Lu Xun has sown the good seeds of new literature through hard work, and today is the season for germination and flowering. Our generation should work hard to irrigate and cultivate it! May our writers, especially literary and art workers, work harder today, learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit and promote it!

### How Can I Get My Youth Back?

— Qin Ji

The unique beauty of women is almost completely lost,

Losing youth, how can one not feel moved?

There is a medical term called "menopause," which refers to women. What does it mean? It means that when a woman reaches a certain age, usually around forty-five, white hair gradually appears, and wrinkles gradually appear at the corners of the forehead. The skin loses its captivating luster, and the breasts lack muscle tension. The unique beauty of women is almost completely lost. What follows is aging. Who can not feel moved by the loss of youth? If one is still childless at this time, it is no wonder that the husband wants to hide a beautiful woman in a golden house with confidence. It is even more sad and difficult to forget. Because when a woman reaches menopause, ovarian function has stopped, menstruation has stopped, and childbearing can be said to be hopeless. This is really worrying! But it is useless to just worry. If the sisters have a little medical knowledge, they should know that this is all due to the decline of internal secretions. Finding the right medicine is not hopeless. However, it is okay to try to remedy it when menopause has arrived. What is even more important is to prevent it before it happens! Because the decline of internal secretions during menopause is still a natural physiological phenomenon, and there are many young girls who have not yet reached menopause but are already sallow and emaciated and have withered complexions. This is a pathological condition, so how can one not plan early and blame oneself later!

Chapter Nine: News from the Driver

I was slightly shocked. "Not upstairs? But he went out?" "Yes—he only went out half an hour ago."

"Where did he go?"

"I don't know. He went out alone and didn't say anything before leaving. Sir, what do you want to talk to him about? Are you looking for me, or are you looking for him?"

Old Mao's suspicion of me is indeed very serious. He is clearly trying to question the reason why I broke into his room. Why is he doing this? Is it a sign of guilt?

I simply answered directly: "Yes, I also want to say a few words to you." At this time, I was standing on the cement steps at the entrance of the gatehouse. Because I wanted to ask him questions, I retreated back into his small gatehouse and stood next to the small square table.

Old Mao also followed in. His thin, yellow cheeks looked very tense. Because he had confirmed that his suspicion was not unfounded. He asked me, "Sir, what do you want to ask?"

I thought for a moment and said, "There is a very important thing, you have to tell the truth."

Old Mao opened his two ginkgo-shaped eyes. "Of course. I have never told a lie, and I don't need to tell a lie. Anyway, Miss Wang was not killed by me, it's none of my business, why should I tell a lie?" He hesitated slightly and asked back, "Sir, just ask. What important thing is it?"

I also looked at his eyes and suddenly asked, "Last night, before the gunfire, did you ever enter this house?" I pointed to the main house with my hand, still staring at him without blinking, but I couldn't catch any flaws. Because his gaze did not evade, nor did he show any fear, only a slight surprise.

He asked me in surprise, "Sir, what does this mean? Didn't I already tell you this morning? I haven't been in there."

"Really not?—You have to tell the truth, this is a point of doubt in this case that we want to find out. It doesn't matter if you admit it. We will never treat you as the murderer just because you admit that you walked in."

Old Mao was a little anxious, but he still stared at me. "Of course I'm not the murderer, but I really haven't been in there. I admit what? I just told you, I had a headache after I came back, so—"

I waved my hand to stop him and said, "Okay, I know this too, you don't need to say it again. What shoes were you wearing when you went out to see the play last night?" (140)

### Oath of War

Lu Xun's Quotations

Recorded by Jingwen

Although autumn comes, and winter comes, after that, spring will still follow.

Joy will not avoid you unless you avoid joy yourself. Pain will not pursue you unless you pursue pain yourself.

Those who harm other people's teeth and eyes but oppose revenge and advocate tolerance must not be approached.

Don't be afraid of disappointment in hope, we should seek hope in disappointment.

Have the courage and perseverance to face these dark sides. Merely shouting about the bright future is actually deceiving and neglecting oneself and the audience.

A truly brave person dares to face the miserable life and dares to face the dripping blood.

Life is not afraid of death, laughing and dancing in the face of death, and advancing over the people who have crossed over to destruction.

Humanity is something that everyone must strive to earn, cultivate, and maintain. It is not something that others give or donate.

### A Casual Talk About Hollywood's Handsome Men

— Qinghui

Among Hollywood's young leading men, there is no shortage of handsome and beautiful men; however, the most perfect and highly praised ones are probably only these four at present!

(1) Clark Gable. For ten years, he has captivated women all over the world and has been hailed by fans as the lover on the screen. He possesses all the beautiful qualities of a man: dark brown skin, six feet one inch tall, wide shoulders, strong arms, and a forty-four-inch chest. His hair is also beautiful. Although it is very short, it is neatly combed and sometimes hangs down on his broad forehead, revealing an extraordinary heroic spirit. His sharp eyes contain infinite male charm, the two dimples on his cheeks are a manifestation of perseverance, and the mustache on his lips can be called unique in the film industry and is the most standard. Most of the women who welcome him are women over the age of twenty-five.

(2) Robert Taylor. No one dares to deny his handsomeness. He has been called the most beautiful man since Valentino. He has gorgeous and wavy hair, long and affectionate eyebrows, bright eyes, a straight nose, lips that are neither too thick nor too thin, and a beautiful skull. What is especially commendable is his well-proportioned, six-foot healthy physique. Most of the women who welcome him are professional women who have just entered society, such as female secretaries, female clerks, elementary school teachers, and senior female college students.

(3) Tyrone Power. He is almost the same as Taylor. He has the same beautiful face as Taylor and is also equally young. He is a naturally romantic and handsome man. His fine and thick eyebrows are the most characteristic, and it is said that they are a symbol of romance. Power can be said to be a standard pretty boy and also a romantic and suave handsome man. He is welcomed by women for two reasons: one is his unrestrained and romantic personality; the other is his lively and talkative attitude. The women who welcome him can be said to be girls who are just beginning to fall in love and are at the age of puberty, or general middle school girls.

(4) Errol Flynn. His beauty is relatively difficult to describe. He is not as beautiful as the above three, but his loveliness is unsurpassed. His whole body is a manifestation of perseverance, his facial contours are also extremely upright, his pupils are clear and bright, his nose is straight, and the obvious and interesting dimples on his cheeks contain gentleness, which is the opposite of Gable's. His voice is also very loud and comfortable and has a seductive quality. His personality is just like the characters he plays in his films. He is a typical hero. The women who welcome him are generally women with more intelligence and talent.

### Complete List of Same Plays (1)

— Yu Chu

The same play, but with many names, is a common occurrence in Peking opera. Therefore, there are often plays that are very familiar, but are not known due to their unfamiliar names. It is not until after watching them that one realizes that this is the common play. (For example, "Calling Lang to Visit Mother" can be labeled "North Heavenly Gate", but few people may know it.) Therefore, based on what I know, I have recorded it below for reference, but it is inevitable that there will be omissions. As for the fact that famous actors, in order to satisfy their desire for leadership, often turn the character they play into the name of the play, or change the title without authorization, they are not included.

Twin Beauties' Strange Romance—Also known as "Famen Temple," and has the names "Embroidered Shoe Record" and "Jade Bracelet Record," but they are not commonly used. Among them, the excerpt "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" is also named "Selling Cockerels." "Suing in the Buddhist Hall" is also called "Knocking on the Pavilion in the Temple." "Cinnabar Well" can be named "Identifying Each Other by the Well."

Bi Yang Lake—That is, "Trial of Li Qi with Changting." Fuliancheng performed this play under the name "Yicheng Courtyard." Jin Shaoshan played the entire play under the name "White Silk Record." Hao Shouchen called this play "Sai Taisui."

Duel with Knives and Foot Battle—Also known as "Battle of Daizhou," it is an excerpt from "Ningwu Pass," followed by "Farewell to Mother and Chaotic Arrows."

Empty City Stratagem—If this play is listed as the opening play, it is formerly known as "Playing the Qin to Retreat the Troops" or "Cleverly Retreating Meng Da." The name "Empty City Stratagem" has become the exclusive patent for performing the grand finale or the closing play.

Jiameng Pass—Because the protagonists in the play are the two fierce generals Ma Chao and Zhang Fei, it is also called "Two Generals." Ma and Zhang fought at night, so it is named "Night Battle of Ma Chao" or "Fighting Ma Chao with Lanterns at Night."

Tide Pearl—Also known as "Bi Chen Pa," also known as "Cui Zi Assassinating Qi."

Town of Tanzhou—Also known as "Nine Dragon Mountain." The name of this play is determined by the height of the character's name tag in the play. If the old man's brand is on top, it is called "Town of Tanzhou." If the young man is on top, it is named "Nine Dragon Mountain."

Searching for the Orphan and Rescuing the Orphan—Tells the story of the Zhao and Tu families, so it is also called "Destroying Tu with Zhao" or "Tu Zhao's Revenge." There are also the names "Cheng Ying Ascending to Heaven," "Shouyang Mountain," and "Eight义图."

Hate of Swallowing Wu—This is a long play composed of important episodes such as "Crying for the Spiritual Tablet," "Quickly Setting Up the Camp," and "White Emperor City." In the south, this play is called "Snow Brother's Hate" or "Second, Third, and Fourth Books of Running to Maicheng" and "The Complete White Emperor City."

Xingyuan Making Peace—Also known as "Falling Flower Garden," or "Second Plum Blossom."

White Liang Building—Can be called "Conquering the Eight Monsters in Luan Stone Mountain" or named "Xinglong Gathering." The above is based on Wu Zhen in the play. If it is named "Chang Yuchun Rescuing the Emperor," then it is based on Chang Yuchun.

### A Large Number of Film People Running Side Businesses

— Hai Xing

Hong Jingling, Wang Xianqi, Han Langan, Yin Xiucen, and others plan to jointly operate a business, probably manufacturing medicines. A friend of Hong who is familiar with this field has joined the cooperation. Hong said: "Movie stars in Hollywood all have side businesses. They already have huge salaries, so they don't need to worry about this. We really need this. We don't have any savings on weekdays. When we get older and can't make movies, what should we do? We have to leave a way out, so we plan to do some business to prevent the future."

Knight Nine advances Eight, Knight Eight advances Six, Cannon Seven moves to the Eighth Rank, Knight Six retreats Four, Cannon Eight advances Three,

Pawn Three advances One, Knight Eight retreats Nine, Knight Four advances Three, Knight Nine advances Seven, Pawn Three advances One,

Explanation: According to the diagram, the black side is at a disadvantage. However, by responding appropriately, a draw can be achieved. The concern is that the red side might use multiple pawns to win. Red's Chariot Nine advances One and Nine moves to the Fourth Rank, and Pawn Three advances One are all skillful moves. Red's Cannon Five moves to the Seventh Rank is to respond to the opponent's Cannon Eight moves to the Seventh Rank to allow the preemptive movement of the chariot. Red's Advisor Four advances Five and Chariot Four advances Four are both responses to Black's Chariot Four advances Two to seize the initiative. Later, Red's Knight Four advances Three prevents Black's Cannon Eight from moving to the Fifth Rank to capture the pawn and occupy the center. From this point, the red side can win or draw without fear of losing. Another way to play this game will be published later. In yesterday's publication of "Meng Yi Ji Kuan," the red side had 70 moves and should have had a pawn, while the black side had a soldier at moves 34; this is specifically corrected.

### Stage Plays to be Adapted for the Silver Screen: "The Wilderness" and "Tragedy on the Lake"

— Ling Bai

Following the decline of folk films, the trend of modern dramas is naturally on the rise again. However, the problem, as perceived by filmmakers, lies in the lack of good screenplays. The popularity of folk films was mainly due to the abundance of such scripts. Therefore, adapting stage plays for the screen is comparatively simpler. Under this principle, the Kuo Lien Motion Picture Company is preparing to produce "The Wilderness" and "Tragedy on the Lake."

"The Wilderness" is a successful work from Cao Yu's trilogy. Previously, "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise" parts one and two were both adapted into films by Kuo Lien, and the results were very good. The satisfaction of this decision is naturally expected. Wang Yin will serve as both the adapter and director of the play, and will also play the protagonist, Chou Hu. In addition, Yuan Meiyun, Mei Xi, Bai Hong, Han Lan'gen, and Jiang Ming will also assist in the performance.

"Tragedy on the Lake" is a one-act play written by Tian Han during his time at the South China Society. It was performed many times and was a sensation at the time. Due to its excellent structure, Yang Xiaozhong is adapting it into a screenplay while directing "Zhuo Wenjun" simultaneously. He has also renamed it "The Soul Returns." In addition to being directed by Yang Xiaozhong, Chen Yanyan will play the protagonist, Bai Wei, and Sun Min will play the old teacher. It is said that in order to emphasize the dramatic atmosphere of the scene, directorial techniques will be used to enhance the sense of terror.

Both of the above scripts will be filmed at the China United Film Studio because the authorities at Kuo Hua have already designated the China United Film Studio as the main base for filming and performing modern dramas.
