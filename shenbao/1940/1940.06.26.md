125 Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing

Two Shot Down by Chinese Forces

Intense Encounter Battle Occurs in Suburbs

Chinese Air Force Returns Safely to Base

Chongqing: One hundred and twenty-five Japanese aircraft, divided into four batches, intruded into Sichuan Province around 11:00 AM on the 25th and attacked the Chinese capital. Several squadrons of the Chinese Air Force took off to intercept them, and the most intense encounter battle occurred with the Japanese aircraft groups in the suburbs of Chongqing. Brave Chinese airmen launched a fierce attack, dispersing the Japanese formation and immediately gaining control of two Japanese bombers. They concentrated their strongest firepower on the two aircraft, which were hit and crashed, one in the eastern suburbs of Qianjiang and the other in the northern suburbs of Pengshui. The remaining Japanese planes fled. The Chinese Air Force returned safely to their bases. (Dispatch of the 25th)

Chongqing: During the air raid on Chongqing yesterday afternoon, a 500-pound bomb dropped by a Japanese aircraft pierced the roof of the British Consulate-General's office, which had the British flag painted on it, and destroyed the building. The British diplomatic corps and personnel of the British Consulate-General all resided in the building, and the offices of the British Embassy, the air force attaché, and the military attaché were also located there. The explosion shattered the doors and windows of the Consulate-General, and the Embassy's car was destroyed, with the chassis facing upwards. Another bomb damaged a building that the British diplomatic corps had recently rented but not yet occupied. An incendiary bomb landed five yards from the window of the office used by British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr when he was working in Chongqing, but it did not explode and only created a large hole six feet in diameter. When 54 Japanese aircraft attacked yesterday, four members of the British Consulate-General staff, including B. Lott, Meade, Pensted, Croften, and Warburton, took refuge in air-raid shelters. According to B. Lott, he saw a Japanese bomber flying directly towards the Embassy from the south bank of the Yangtze River and took refuge in an air-raid shelter. Although a bomb fell near the shelter, no one inside felt any discomfort because the shelter entrance was fitted with a partition to block the force of the explosion. Six Chinese people outside the French Consulate-General's air-raid shelter were tragically killed by the bombing. The British flag painted on the roof of the British Consulate-General was very clear and could be seen even from the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is hard to believe that the Japanese pilots did not see the British flag. The buildings of the British Embassy and Consulate are now piles of rubble. After the all-clear was sounded, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo visited the British Embassy to inspect the damage. To ensure the safety of personnel and documents, the British diplomatic corps and Consulate-General have set up offices in the naval barracks and taverns on the south bank of the Yangtze River. With the offices of the British and French Embassies moved to the south bank, only the Soviet and German Embassies remain in Chongqing. "Consulate Street" is now scarred and desolate. Last night, it was dark and deserted, and the city was extensively attacked, with bombs falling in almost every section. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo Declares

Japanese Warships to Sail to Vietnam

And Dispatch Personnel to Station There

To Monitor Whether the Agreement is Implemented

Tokyo: The Ministry of the Navy announced that it has been agreed to send a part of the Japanese fleet in South China to Haiphong to temporarily monitor the passage of goods destined for China through French Indochina. According to the recent Franco-Japanese agreement, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Army, and Ministry of the Navy have decided to dispatch inspectors, including representatives from the three ministries, to be stationed in Haiphong, Hanoi, and cities along the border of Yunnan Province to monitor whether the Vietnamese authorities are effectively implementing this agreement. According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning, because the French government has agreed to Japan dispatching military experts to Vietnam to inspect on the spot the actual situation of stopping materials and goods from being transported to the Chongqing government through Vietnam, the Japanese government has decided to send some military experts and Yanagisawa, the former consul in Hanoi, Sonmura, etc., to the area. Some staff from the Japanese Consulate General in Hanoi will assist in everything. Part of the inspection personnel will depart soon. Before they arrive, several naval and army officers and junior officers will travel on a Japanese warship to the area so that they can pay attention to stopping materials and goods from being transported to China through Vietnam. The ship will arrive soon. The types of materials and goods prohibited from being transported to China through Vietnam will be decided after an on-the-spot investigation by various military experts. Yesterday, the counselor of the French Embassy in Tokyo notified the director of the Eurasian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Governor-General of Vietnam has decided to continue to maintain a general blockade of the Vietnamese border before this matter is completed. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that, in accordance with the recent agreement between France and Japan prohibiting military supplies from being transported to Chongqing through Vietnam, many Japanese military specialists and government officials will soon be dispatched to Haiphong to monitor whether the agreement is being implemented. These specialists will be composed of representatives from the Japanese army, navy, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will be stationed in Haiphong, Hanoi, and various towns along the Vietnamese border. It was also stated that, before the specialists from Tokyo arrive, some Japanese army and navy officers and other officials will travel by warship from Guangzhou to Hanoi to inspect the current situation in Vietnam. The goods being transported into China through Vietnam that should be prohibited will be examined and decided after the military and political specialists from Tokyo arrive. Vietnam will continue to implement its general blockade before the Japanese representatives arrive. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo: The Japanese General Headquarters announced that arrangements for dispatching a part of the Japanese fleet stationed in the South China Sea to Haiphong in French Indochina have been completed. The fleet "will temporarily monitor matters related to goods being transported to China via Vietnam." The General Headquarters' declaration did not state that the Japanese navy would immediately implement a blockade of Vietnam, but it is generally believed that this action is the second step in the Japanese government's attempt to cut off the supply lines to the Chinese government.

British Government Determines to Use All Its Power

To Aid the Revival of the French Nation

The Bordeaux Government Surrenders to Germany

Churchill Expresses Deep Pain

London: Prime Minister Churchill said in the House of Commons this afternoon, "Any movement by Frenchmen outside the power of their enemy to operate to defeat Nazi Germany and to strive for French freedom and revival, we must aid to the utmost of our strength and resources. As for our relations with Bordeaux, I can only say that they have announced their submission to their enemy and are completely in the power of the enemy. This makes our relationship difficult, but we rely on the true genius of the French people, and on their judgment of their plight where they know all the facts, and will strive to maintain a communicative contact with them from within their prison. We have been united in war and peace, and we regard as a reliable ally for the progress of liberalism and comprehensive civilization, the great French nation and its people, who are now in such a state of sorrow, the House must feel deeply, as of this day, there is no need to add difficult words or to denounce them, we know that life and power will enable us to save France from the destruction and bondage imposed by the enemy's strong power and rage, and other causes, we hope that the French Empire, which has spread all over the world, will remain under the protection of sea power and continue to fight side by side with its allies, and at the same time we must pay attention to our own salvation and effective defense, because the happiness of not only Britain and France, but also the whole of Europe and the world, depends on it. The security of Great Britain and the British Empire has not been decisively affected by the encounter with the French fleet, but has been greatly affected. When Reynaud was Prime Minister, seeing France's failure and surrender imminent, when many hopes were pinned on the French elite army, which was gradually declining under the enemy's attack, he asked me to meet in Tour, so on June 13, I went with the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Aircraft Production, Pierre Pucheu Broc. I saw that the situation described in this conversation with the French government did not match the facts. Of course, a member of the Cabinet Secretariat kept a record, and that member was also stationed there at the time, but I do not want to say more about this today. Reynaud explained the situation on the front line and the situation of the French army, which I knew deeply, so Reynaud asked me whether Britain would relieve France of its obligation not to negotiate an armistice or peace agreement without the consent of its ally Britain. Although I knew that France was suffering greatly, I felt obliged to tell them that I could not agree and asked them to continue to appeal to the United States (to be continued).

Tagore Calls on Comrades

To Continue the War Against Germany

French Communities in Various Places Rise Up in Response

Reynaud May Go to Britain to Participate

London: Reynaud's military adviser, General de Gaulle, the host of the "French National Committee," said in a speech tonight, "I firmly believe that all parts of the French Empire are willing to continue the war, and I have reason to believe that our navy will never surrender. General Noguès, the Governor-General of French Morocco, General Worth Hoacher, the Commander of the French Forces in the Near East, and Governor-General Catroux of French Indochina have been in contact with each other by long-distance telephone. Since I issued an appeal yesterday, French expatriates in Britain have asked to enlist in the army, and the enthusiasm is almost unbelievable. At the same time, I have also received telegrams from French communities in Tangier, Syria, Bandama City, the capital of Egypt, Madagascar, the capital of Uruguay, and New York, all declaring their determination to resist the war. Once some important leaders of our country arrive in Britain, the National Committee can be officially announced. I also believe that former Prime Minister Reynaud, who would rather resign than surrender, can also come to London in a short period of time. At that time, if all French territories can form a resistance force to resist Germany and Italy, the National Committee should request the formation of a new French government within British territory in order to continue to complete the entire war of resistance. As for the Pétain cabinet's decision to strip me of my military rank, it will absolutely not influence my past attitude." (Havas dispatch of the 24th)

General de Gaulle, the initiator of the French National Committee, delivered a broadcast speech to French army, navy, and air force officers, technicians, and workers here last night, saying, "Regardless of the conditions of the armistice agreement signed between France and Germany and France and Italy, its meaning can be summed up in one sentence: France and the French people have been shackled and offered to the enemy. Fortunately, in our French nation, there are still a large number of men, women, young people, and children who are unwilling to accept and recognize this kind of surrender conditions. In short, France's position has not fallen into an irreparable situation. All my army, navy, and air force officers, technicians, and workers, no matter where they are now, should come together and cooperate with those who are determined to continue fighting. I dare to say that the army we organize will be the most elite army in France and the best mechanized force in the army and navy. We will fight side by side with our allies and will be able to restore freedom to the world and make our country reach its greatest state." (Havas dispatch of the 25th)

London: After the "French National Committee" was established here, a large number of volunteers, either in military uniform or in civilian clothes, went to the committee to register and enlist. Most of them were veterans of the last European War and the current European War, who came after hearing General de Gaulle's speech announcing the organization of the People's Front Committee. Even though General de Gaulle was dismissed from his post by the government, he still wears his military uniform as usual. According to reports, the total number of telegrams sent by overseas Chinese communities to the committee vowing to be a shield for the committee is no less than several hundred.

Japanese Right-Wing League Demands

Change in Foreign Policy

The Yonai Cabinet Suffers a Major Blow

Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch states that the "East Asia Construction National League" and the "Holy War Implementation Parliamentarians' League" held a joint meeting on Sunday evening, unanimously believing that the government should change its foreign policy to adapt to the new situation caused by the European War. The joint meeting urged the chairman of the East Asia Construction National League, Suekichi Yasuzumi, and the chairman of the Executive Committee of the League, Matsui Iwane, to submit a draft declaration and a resolution, which were unanimously adopted by the meeting. The declaration stated that it is expected that those who support the old order will be attacked as a result of the European War, but Japanese leaders are still influenced by past views and fail to recognize reality, and still advocate maintaining the status quo. This kind of policy is caused by the inertia of relying on Britain and France, which will inevitably reduce Japan's international reputation and miss a golden opportunity. In order to save the crisis, all political forces that hinder the country's future should be eliminated immediately. This is the only way to build a "New Order in East Asia." In view of Japan's mission in Asia and the need to further build a new world, we hope that Japan's foreign policy will be fundamentally changed. The original text of the resolution states that the policy of non-intervention in the European War should be abandoned, and countries that advocate maintaining the status quo should be driven out of their forces in Asia. The status quo in Asia should be changed immediately, and Asian resources should be obtained by Asians. The "East Asia Construction National League" was established in March of this year, with Suekichi Yasuzumi, Matsui Iwane, Matsuoka Yosuke, Adachi Kizo, Nakano Seigo, and Hashimoto Kingoro as the core figures. Suekichi Yasuzumi serves as the chairman. Its purpose is to implement political reform plans and change the traditional pro-British and American policies. It can be said to be an alliance of right-wing groups. On the day of the opening of the founding meeting, Suekichi Yasuzumi publicly advocated taking the Dutch East Indies as soon as possible. The colors of the Yonai Cabinet are very strong because Suekichi Yasuzumi, Matsui Iwane, and Matsuoka Yosuke all resigned from the position of cabinet councilor when the Yonai Cabinet was established. The "Holy War Implementation Parliamentarians' League" was also established in April of this year and is a combination of right-wing members of the House of Representatives. Its purpose is also to oppose Britain and the United States and oppose Yonai. At the same time, it wants to become the center of organizing a new party. Most of them belong to the Kokumin Domei, the Toho Kai, and other large parties. From this, we know that Japanese politics are indeed increasingly uneasy due to the influence of the European War. (Dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo: Political observers here said today that the increased momentum of Japan's one-party political movement may be a prelude to a new cabinet controlled by domestic extremists. After Prince Konoe Fumimaro, president of the Privy Council, resigned yesterday, the merger of all political parties into a single nationalist party is inevitable. It is also heard that Konoe is about to accept the position of leader of the new political party. Political figures believe that the establishment of a one-party system will lead to the overthrow of the Yonai Cabinet. The new cabinet will be composed of the extreme faction of former Italian Ambassador Shiratori Toshio. Shiratori advocates that the Japanese army and navy cooperate with the Rome-Berlin Axis. Some people also believe that the new cabinet controlled by the Shiratori faction will cause serious consequences in the Far East. It is generally expected that the cabinet will directly consider the demands of the extreme faction for Japanese military action against French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the vice president of the Privy Council, Hara, will succeed Konoe as the president of the Privy Council. The Yonai Cabinet, which aims to resolve the Sino-Japanese War, has become weak because it cannot resolve the Sino-Japanese War. The Yonai Cabinet's attempt to make the Chongqing National Government yield has failed, and it has not yet found the final basis for cooperation with the "Wang Jingwei regime." The government has also refused the demands of radical elements to adopt an aggressive foreign policy in the southern capital of Asia. This demand was raised again on Sunday evening at a joint meeting of the "East Asia League" and the "Holy War Implementation League." (United Press dispatch of the 25th)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers all welcomed the formation of a single, powerful political party under the guidance of an active leader. Konoe's resignation was expected long ago, and the public was not surprised. The newspapers all said that Konoe's efforts would encounter various difficulties before success, but hoped that a truly strong political party would be established under his leadership and receive enthusiastic support from the whole country. The Asahi Shimbun said that political transformation must not merely dissolve the existing political parties, but reassemble the party members and retain their old ideas. The new political party movement should not only aim at obtaining power. The Mainichi Shimbun said that Japan's position today is very different from yesterday. Japan must go further than dealing with the China Incident and must cooperate to build a new world order. The necessity of rebuilding the country's political institutions lies in this point. The Kokumin Shimbun expressed that there are many difficulties ahead, and hoped that Konoe can attack this problem with a clear understanding of the country's rising power.

American Republicans Vigorously Criticize

Roosevelt's New Deal

Oppose the United States Getting Involved in the Vortex of War

Philadelphia: The Republican convention, which opened here yesterday, is now facing two important tasks: to choose candidates for the presidential election in November and to formulate policies for the country. The party's foreign policy platform is "straddling," standing midway between isolationism and the Roosevelt administration's policies. The main points of its platform are approximately: (1) adopting a stronger stance against the United States getting involved in the vortex of war; (2) a strong national defense program; (3) assisting countries resisting aggression within the conditions of international law. In addition, the party will vigorously criticize President Roosevelt and accuse him of driving the United States into the vortex of war. As for who the Republican presidential candidate will be, opinions are quite divided. However, the people with the highest voices are generally Robert Taft, the son of President William Howard Taft, Wendell Willkie, a giant in the electric power utility industry, and former President Hoover. It is expected that the first ballot will be held on Wednesday. Robert Taft was elected as a senator of Ohio in 1938 and became a political figure. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)

Philadelphia: Minnesota Governor Stassen said at the Republican National Convention here last night that the United States is now facing the same fate as Britain and France. Unless a new leader is elected to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere, it will be difficult to avoid this misfortune. Stassen condemned President Roosevelt's administration for paying no attention to the world situation and lacking activity. Stassen said that the United States must clearly understand the limits of its own interests. The United States will never allow philosophies that the United States does not recognize to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere and make its army aggressive. The United States will also not allow any saboteurs who are in contact with foreign aggressors to subvert the government of any country in the Western Hemisphere. Our main principle is to take decisive steps to defend the Western Hemisphere. Stassen denounced the United States for assisting aggressor countries, saying that the United States has been supplying raw materials and manufactured goods to aggressor countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, and condemned the "New Deal" for paying no attention to American national defense during the past seven years when the shadow of dictatorship has almost covered the globe. Stassen said that the United States today has not engaged in preparations in the sea, land, and air to meet the minimum needs, and has not provided material assistance to the Allied forces, nor has it found a way to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere, and criticized President Roosevelt for failing to entrust the affairs of the army and navy to people with knowledge and ability in the past few months. The appointment of Republican Stimson as Secretary of the Army last week was only the last repentance after encountering failure. Stassen said that President Roosevelt's plan to force young people is a copy of Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin's methods, and advocated national unity to suppress Fifth Column elements, and recognized the current administrative department's measures to eliminate Fifth Column facilities as scratching an itch. Stassen also raised questions, "What good is the current administrative department doing to improve the world environment? Is it not recognizing the Soviet Union? Is it not laying mines at the London Economic Conference? Is it not failing to advise the people of the facts heard from the capitals of Europe? Is it not continuing to sell arms to those aggressor countries? If not, then the dispatch of ministers and ambassadors is not appropriate. Our lack of preparation is already a fact. Our nature is so weak that we cannot supply the Allied forces with sufficient materials as we wish. Our leaders, who have not fully prepared for the military equipment for self-defense, are striding forward on the road to the world and taking the world's peace as their responsibility. This has been the case for a long time. Our brave words have long sought to stop aggression to protect other countries, and now we know that the need for self-defense has not been prepared. We should decide that those who support fascism or communism should not be allowed to be American civil servants. We

Commercial News and Finance. Foreign Exchange Sees Few Sales in the Afternoon.

Yesterday's market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no fluctuations. The unofficial English-American exchange market was unpredictable, initially easing but eventually tightening. Although there were no special changes in the environment, operators acted prudently and adapted to the situation. A certain rumor in the French Concession of this city caused tension in the market, demonstrating the nervousness of the people. In the morning session, the Chinese banks initially exerted pressure to sell, and speculators also sold, causing the US dollar exchange rate to rise to 6.125 yuan. However, the Hong Kong Electric Company absorbed the supply, hindering the downward trend, and the rate stabilized in the afternoon. Later, the Sino-Italian Bank suddenly bought, and speculators, influenced by market rumors, turned to buying, pushing the US dollar price to 6 yuan. The softening trend continued until closing, resulting in an English gold rate of 3 shillings 9 6875 pence, and a US dollar rate of 6 yuan, the same as the previous day. The US tight currency forward rate was also the same at 0.09375.

Chinese Merchants Initially Continue to Sell.

Exchange rates for English against US, Shanghai, and France were all stable. US against English fell by 3 and a half pence, against Shanghai fell slightly by 1 jiao and 2 fen, and against France there was no change. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 9375 pence for English gold and 6.0625 yuan for US dollars, both slightly lower by 0.03125 compared to the previous closing. After opening, Chinese merchants and speculators sold, and the market became tight. Foreign banks absorbed Chinese speculators' US dollars at 6.125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 7.25%. Afterwards, Chinese banks also showed a willingness to sell, but Hong Kong Electric Company soon made a strong purchase. Although Chinese banks sold a considerable amount, the market softened again. Initially, Hong Kong Electric Company entered into a 6 yuan July US dollar exchange rate with Chinese banks. By the afternoon close, the price remained unchanged, with a stable underlying trend. The resulting English gold rate was 3 shillings 96875 pence, and the US dollar rate was 6.09375 yuan.

The Sino-Italian Bank Suddenly Makes a Purchase.

At the beginning of the afternoon session, the Sino-Italian Bank suddenly made a purchase, causing Hong Kong Electric's July US dollar exchange rate to fall back to 5.96875 yuan. Speculators also bought the foreign banks' current month US dollars at 6.0625 yuan up to 6 yuan, and money changers bought US dollars from American banks at a combined price of 6 yuan, making the market tighter than in the morning. It was heard that there was some news in the city, causing panic again, and there was a lack of selling, leading to further softening. The resulting English gold rate was 3 shillings 96875 pence, the US dollar rate was 6 yuan, the July English gold rate was 3 shillings 84375 pence, and the US dollar rate was 5.90625 yuan.

The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 7 jiao and 5 fen, to 116.75 yuan. The "Lianchao" unofficial rate was slightly lower by 2 jiao and 5 fen, at 98.75 yuan. The exchange market turned tight, and gold prices soared.

Yesterday's market situation for cash bullion: It rose sharply against the prevailing trend, which was very comforting. This was due to the tight exchange market in the afternoon, as well as the impact of certain rumors. In terms of trading activity on the day, there was considerable fluctuation. The morning market atmosphere was very good, opening at 5,450 yuan, and once falling back. Later, due to the eagerness of bullish retail investors to sell, it saw a low price of 5,390 yuan, and the midday close was 5,420 yuan. The underlying trend in the afternoon was firm. After opening at 5,440 yuan, it immediately rose to 5,520 yuan amid buying pressure. However, retail investors selling at high prices were still frequently seen, causing it to fall again after rising. Ultimately, the exchange market tightened, and gold shops and others provided strong support, and it reappeared at a high price of 5,540 yuan before closing. The result was 5,535 yuan, a huge increase of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. Overall trading was still active, at about 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops ultimately raised prices by 20 yuan, while customs gold and others remained stable.

Bullion Rises 135 Yuan.

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially reported a drop in exchange rates, and the US dollar was slightly tighter. The market opened 50 yuan higher, with gold shops buying silver shops' gold at 5,450 yuan. Subsequently, operators sought to sell at high prices, and the exchange market suddenly softened, causing buyers to hesitate. It soon fell back by 45 yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels of silver shop's gold at 5,405 yuan. Later, relying on the continued purchases by gold shops, as well as the follow-up purchases by money changers and securities firms, it rose again by 40 yuan, with silver shops trading 10 taels with each other at 5,445 yuan. After this, buyers decreased, and those with floating profits from the previous day took advantage of the high prices to sell. A certain securities firm and silver shop strongly sold, and it fell back again by 55 yuan, with silver shops selling 20 taels to gold shops, retreating to 5,390 yuan. At noon, a certain money changer suddenly made a purchase, strongly buying more than 200 taels. In addition, short positions in retail were also covered, and it ultimately rose again by 30 yuan, with money changers buying 10 taels from gold shops, making the midday closing price 5,420 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was firm, and it opened 20 yuan higher, with gold shops retreating to 5,430 yuan. However, after this, securities firms, gold shops, and jewelry shops jointly bought in, and the exchange market softened, and there was a shortage of sellers. It soon soared by 90 yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from gold shops at 5,530 yuan. Later, a certain money changer's long positions emerged, and it once returned within the 5,500 yuan range, with silver shops selling 10 taels to gold shops at 5,490 yuan. However, ultimately, due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange, and at that time, there was some positive news in the market, gold shops and others came to strongly absorb it again, and it leapt up again by 50 yuan, with gold shops buying 30 taels from securities firms at 5,540 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops traded 20 taels with each other, making the evening closing price 5,530 yuan. The result was a squeeze higher by 125 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from the main brand of gold shops was 10 yuan higher than bullion, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Listed 20 Yuan Higher.

Initially, the big shops' selling price for silver jewelry gold per tael remained at 550 yuan. By 9:30 AM, it was listed 10 yuan higher. At 3:00 PM, it was raised another 10 yuan. There were no changes after this. It is estimated that the big shops have changed their listed price to 570 yuan. The new shops had the same price as the above, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan. Foreign Currency Suddenly Rises in the Afternoon.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Bullion was unable to break away from the consolidation trend in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the emergence of rumors, the rising trend suddenly intensified. The demand for English-American gold pounds increased sharply, and market prices rose. The supply and demand for English gold notes was balanced, and market prices remained unchanged. American gold notes were initially quite stable, and in the afternoon, they rose to 16.7 jiao, an increase of 3 and a half jiao compared to the 7th. The supply of Hong Kong notes has decreased, and market prices have rebounded by 4 fen. There was some demand for Canadian notes, and market prices rose sharply. There was no shortage of demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean notes, and market prices all trended upwards. The former rose to 1.095 yuan, and the latter rose to 0.975 yuan. Securities and Domestic Debt are Frequently Attacked, and Buyers Hesitate.

The securities market: Yesterday, it turned slightly weaker again, and the market situation was erratic, but there were no major fluctuations. After the Xujiahui incident was resolved, the environment deteriorated again yesterday, and people were uneasy. Although public debt had a significant impact, because there were very few on-the-table accounts, it did not cause a great disturbance, because various related parties were very limited. However, buyers have since become hesitant again, and only those covering short positions made slight improvements. Due to the unfavorable environment and news, on-the-table transactions became increasingly scarce. Yesterday, Deutz & Gelder sold the most throughout the day, and the rest were very limited. Hongda Yongfeng in the morning, and Jiufeng Lemao and Xieda in the afternoon, were all supplied by Deutz & Gelder. There were relatively few scattered retail investors. As a result, the market price, except for Type E, which did not fluctuate, all retreated slightly by 5 fen to 2 jiao and 5 fen. The total number of transactions was 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 500 shares of Chinese Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan.

London, 24th (Monday) dispatch: Today's market situation for English merchants' Far East company stocks was uniformly weaker. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell by half a pound, to 13 and a half pounds. Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels shares fell by 5 pounds, to 20 pounds. Mercantile Bank shares fell by half a pound, to 6 pounds and 5 shillings. HSBC Bank English registered shares fell "pounds, to 65 pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares fell by 4 pounds, to 68 pounds. Jardine Matheson Bank shares fell by half a pound, to 11 and a half pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 24th (Monday) dispatch: Today's listed market situation for Chinese foreign debt remained stable. All bonds on the upper and lower ends did not change. Cotton Yarn Market Strange Phenomenon: Many Manipulate Market Prices, Leading to Armed Clashes.

The yarn market is stagnant and lacks characteristics. The market is quiet, because the end of June is approaching, and most people are busy handling the June futures affairs. Verbal disputes and disagreements occur between the long and short sides, often due to improper price increases and decreases. As a result, there are scoldings, arguments, and even armed fights. Spot trading is quiet. However, due to the intervention of major players, prices are limited to within 950 yuan, and people's hearts are gradually stabilizing.

The spot yarn market opened peacefully in the morning. There was some buying in the market. In addition, a certain yarn rose due to some demand in the north. This yarn was stimulated by it and improved somewhat. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 968 yuan. Later, due to a lack of excitement among buyers, it fell to 945 yuan. Midway, it recovered to 960 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,459 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 7 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows.

Counterparts: 1,410; Mainland: 4; Hong Kong: 15; Ningbo: 30; Total: 1,459. Textile Mills Close Their Doors: Cotton Merchants Lower Prices to Sell.

Spot cotton trading is very rare, because textile mills have poor appetites. In addition, yarn sales are lacking, and market prices are unstable, so there is absolutely no intention to replenish raw materials. As for the counterparts, there are sufficient stocks in hand, and there is also a lack of enthusiasm. Therefore, the cotton market has been unusually dull recently. Even if there are occasional transactions, market prices are very low. This is because the end of the month is approaching, and funds are tight. Generally, cash is needed, so they have to sell in the market. As a result, the market is trending downwards, and the future is still easy to fall and difficult to rise.

In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very weak yesterday morning. Later, due to the closing of long positions, closing prices fell by 35 points compared to the previous day. Only the near-term price rose by 3 points. India, including forecasts, fell by one rupee.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: As the exchange rate tightened in the afternoon, transactions became a dead market, and all parties were quiet. If there are those who urgently want to sell, even if they drastically lower prices, no one will inquire. Recently, Japanese yarn has been very active, and there is still a glimmer of hope for raw cotton. The Grain Market: Timely Rain Moisturizes Seedlings, and Rice Prices Fall.

The rice market currently has its inland Zhejiang route suspended due to passport issues.

After one devaluation, the market continued in this state yesterday. The morning opening was generally rare to inquire, and sales were abnormally stagnant. The general hoarders not only inherited the momentum from the previous day, but also saw this kind of environment, so they competed to lower prices to sell. However, the market felt even more depressed, and transactions were increasingly declining. Whether it was rural villages or stores, they all watched with their hands in their sleeves.

The foreign rice market followed the previous day's weakness, and the market fell with the people's hearts. The opening prices for various foreign rice varieties fell immediately. The struggle to sell off by floating hoarders and the competition to sell for profit recovery caused the market to fall again and again. Siamese No. 2 has fallen into the 60 yuan range, and Saigon No. 2 has also reached 60 yuan. Xiaojiao Bank's stockpiles fell to 59 yuan, and Mitsubishi Bank's stockpiles fell to 58.6 yuan, all about 1.5 yuan lower than the previous night. However, various mainland groups and re-exports were still interested, so they took the opportunity to absorb spot goods, and gradually recovered in the afternoon. Due to rumors about the Annam issue in the evening market, people's hearts suddenly rose, and Xiaojiao rice rose steadily, reaching 60.05 yuan at the evening close, which was close to the previous night. Although there were no transactions for other rice varieties, the situation was also upwards. There were no new agreements for foreign rice transactions. 3,000 bags of re-exported Siamese No. 2 were recovered at prices of 62.7 yuan to 63.5 yuan, and 18 bags were priced at 67 yuan to 68 yuan, and 26 bags were priced at 66 yuan to 67 yuan, totaling 272 tons. The current total for foreign rice is 4,700 bags.

Due to the recent increase in rainfall, sources for thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice varieties have stabilized, and the price of rough rice has fallen back. The number of shipments arriving at the port has increased, and yesterday, more than 2,000 bags arrived, causing rumors that the unofficial market outside the market saw a sharp drop in foreign rice. The general guests' intention to pay has turned to laziness, and the cargo owners have stopped raising prices and loosened up. The selling price has fallen by one yuan. Changbang Teqing Japonica is 74 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica is 72.3 yuan, and the fixed price for old goods is 69 yuan. Qingsi Thin Indica is 72.3 yuan, and the fixed price is 70 yuan. Nangang Early Indica is around 68 yuan.

The glutinous rice market is tired and stagnant, and the route is also weak. However, because prices are generally low, cargo owners have no intention of selling urgently, so the opening price is relatively stable, only devaluing by half a yuan. Except for Jin Li Zhen Te Yuan, which still requires 60 yuan, ordinary special goods are sold for 59.5 yuan, Chang Dan Bai Yuan is 58.9 yuan, and Jiangbei goods are 56.7 yuan. The Rising Trend in the Flour Market Gradually Subsides. There is Talk of Finding Ways to Procure New Wheat.

Wheat Flour: The rising trend in the market subsided yesterday. After the No. 2 flour factory raised its prices by half a yuan the day before, it will not raise them again for the time being. All factories have stopped selling to customers and hoarders, and only supply their own sales. Slightly more than 10,000 bags were wholesaled throughout the day. The selling price of goods returning to their hometowns is not uniform, and there is no formal market. However, the overall situation, due to the rain, the fall in rice prices, and the news that new wheat sources are being cleared, people's hearts are inevitably affected, and the market is gradually getting back on track.

Wheat: Yesterday's new wheat trading was quiet. Except for the sporadic purchases by Japanese factories, such as smuggled goods, there were no large transactions. The market still believes that the supply is limited, and the fees are high, so the cargo owners are still demanding high prices.

Also in the news, new wheat sources, such as the Jing-Wu area, have several batches to transport. Yesterday, it was heard that a certain factory was negotiating with a certain party to find ways to clear the way and send villages to purchase, and the goods may flood in within a week. Oilseed Cakes and Soybean Cakes Sell Well Due to the Rain, and Prices Also Increase.

Yesterday's market for soybean cakes was very active. The continuous rain was very beneficial to farming. Farmers are in the season to fertilize, so the market was lively, buying was strong, and prices increased every day. The highest price has reached 13 yuan. According to statistics, Dayou Factory sold 43,000 pieces of Four-Brand Cakes at prices ranging from 12.85 yuan to 13 yuan. Orders for the first half of July were also placed at 13 yuan. Shen Ji Cakes sold more than 10,000 pieces at prices ranging from 12.4 yuan to 12.5 yuan. Orders for the first half of July were placed at 12.7 yuan. Feizi Cakes sold 4 trucks at a price of 12.5 yuan. Today, there were 445 bags of soybeans shipped to Little Luzon. Grain Market: Coarse White Sugar Continues to Fall.

Yesterday's sugar market saw foreign exchange rise, but interest was rare, so the trend softened again. The association's price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was initially 68.5 yuan to 68.4 yuan in foreign warehouses, and later returned to 68.5 yuan, falling by 0.8 yuan. Re-exported goods were 54.2 yuan, down 0.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar with the B mark had the same reduced rate as before, at 80 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 59.3 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. For domestic sugar, a Guangzhou group opened dozens of bags of Haikou foreign numbers, with high-quality goods at 64.5 yuan to 66 yuan, and secondary goods at 61 yuan. Yesterday, 1,230 tons of Dutch sugar arrived. Grey Cloth Prices are Gradually Stabilizing.

There is now development in the cloth market, and the market shows signs of vitality. Since Dongbu grey cloth rebounded, the opening prices for our factory's grey cloth are cheaper, attracting dyeing factories to purchase. The demand from various inland areas is still strong. The opening prices for each cloth are stable, and the speculative elements have been reduced. Selling prices should follow the natural trend. The most actively traded grey cloth on the street is rough cloth, grey cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, totaling more than 20,000 pieces. The Hong Kong group purchased more than 2,000 pieces of twill rough cloth, and the Zhejiang and Anhui groups purchased 3,000 pieces of fine cloth, poplin, flower flannel, and other goods.

Dongbu's shipping costs have risen too much and are now falling back. In the morning, the peak of Dragon Head fine cloth reached around 34 yuan. However, although actual sales are active, there are no wholesale buyers, and the market has become weaker again. Prices for mid-range brands are relatively firm, still requiring 30 yuan to 31 yuan. Sijunzi Serge was once sold at 9.4 yuan, but ultimately fell back to 8.85 yuan due to the sale by counterparts. New Circular Sycee from Tongan in North-South Goods are Unavailable.

According to the Tongan News, this year's Osmanthus flower seedlings are extremely abundant. However, due to excessive rain recently, most of them have withered, turning abundance into a shortage. According to customer letters, based on the current situation, only 30% will bear fruit in the future, so the market price of new circular sycee is unlikely to be cheap. Five Metals: Large Tinplate Prices are Expensive and Sales are Sluggish.

Merchants from other ports no longer purchase large tinplate, and factory owners on this street rarely inquire, resulting in an unusually sluggish market. Although yarn factories, roller workshops, lock factories, and machinery factories have recently inquired, there are no real deals. It is found that the original boxes of No. 24 patterned goods have been out of stock for a long time. The current flow in the market and among several hardware shops is only scattered, so the buying and selling parties use the number of sheets as the market price. Currently, each sheet sells for 35 yuan, which is nearly 10 yuan higher than before. In total, one box (50 sheets) requires 1,750 yuan, which is more than 500 yuan higher than the previous market price, so customers are closing their doors and uninterested due to the high price, and there are no real deals. The Decline of China's Silk Industry by Yi Zhi

Post-war silk factories were on the verge of bankruptcy, but they also experienced unexpected prosperity. Generally speaking, some Shanghai silk factories that were operating cautiously with capital of around 20,000 yuan three years ago now have surpluses of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, which is not uncommon. This business is indeed a great event for China's silk industry, and it seems that the rise of Chinese national capital can be expected soon. However, it is very regrettable that in this year, the objective environment is that foreign capital wants to develop its power in China, and Chinese capital must sacrifice its own existence to be its life-sustaining soup, and it will never allow China's national industry to truly develop. Therefore, when the Shanghai silk factories were enjoying unprecedented prosperity, some people had already foreseen that "the setting sun is infinitely good, but it is a pity that it is near dusk." Due to this situation, the raw material problem of Shanghai silk factories quickly shifted from being able to seek completeness under grievance to a situation where they could not survive even under humiliation. Therefore, opening small silk factories in the inland areas has become a new trend in the Shanghai silk industry.

This new trend has been called by some as another way to strive to continue the life of China's silk industry, and most of the operators of small silk factories are also happy and think that they are practicing economic guerrilla warfare. However, in view of the prizes awarded, the general small silk factories are precisely compromise-like, far exceeding the elements of combat. In fact, all evaluations of small silk factories should not be "economic guerrilla warfare", but rather pitiful parasites under the contradictions between foreign financial groups and warlords! However, because the taste of "parasitism" was not bad last year, it also attracted Shanghai silk factories to follow in its footsteps. According to the author, this is probably the main motivation for the new trend of Shanghai silk factories.

In this way, the fate of small silk factories at the moment "Shanghai's large silk factories are no exception" is the fate of parasites. Their existence is not a progressive phenomenon of the silk factory industry striving for survival, but rather a manifestation of the decline of the silk factory industry. Before the victory of the anti-Japanese war and construction, it is almost impossible to say that such an operation would have a future or be able to maintain a glimmer of hope.

The most concerning issue for Shanghai people now is the transportation of products from small inland silk factories to Shanghai. It is rumored that silk threads brought to Shanghai have to pay 12% donation tax. In fact, it is probably not a nature of buying road routes. That is to say, the crux of the silk thread transportation problem to Shanghai is not simply a donation tax issue, because according to news from a certain newspaper, this 12% is called "excessive profit". It can be seen that even if the payment is made in full with humiliation, the arrival of silk threads in Shanghai is still uncertain.

Originally, there were two steps to the "control" of Jiangzhe silk: The first is to control the big ones and relax the small ones. The reason is that this can reduce the resistance to anti-control. At the same time, to monopolize this enterprise all at once, its subjective power was not enough to encompass the whole situation in the previous year. Moreover, after the war situation shifted westward, the Jiangzhe silk area, if only relying on the power of control to replace free production, is also an impossible fact (a previous year's example is that the output of small silk factories in Wuxi was more than that of Huazhong), so it must attack large silk factories to make them submit and consolidate its "control". During this period, small silk factories survived and even enjoyed some sweetness. (To be continued)

Old News Re-copied: 67 Years Ago (426) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty). The Author of Jin Ping Mei

The highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, and the next is to establish words. Although the three are judged by their lightness and weight and have their order of precedence, they are all called immortal. To express one's opinion truthfully is not something to be done rashly. Therefore, inviting shame and causing blame, or incurring eternal misfortune due to temporary rash words, is certainly out of the question. Even if one narrates the past events of predecessors or describes the anecdotes of contemporaries, if one does not harbor the intention of supporting the world's morality and maintaining its reputation, or if one's intentions are profound and one's words involve absurdity, or even deliberately seeks to hunt for beauty and display novelty, follows the habits of gorgeousness and imitation, and imitates the behavior of frivolity, then the speaker is indulging in momentary pleasure, and the listener is providing evidence for later generations. How can the harm be limited? The Book of Changes warns against sealing one's mouth, and the Book of Poetry punishes jade flaws, also saying that language is the root of chaos and the ladder of disaster. Therefore, one must settle one's body before moving, and change one's mind before speaking. Otherwise, being fond of talking will lead to poverty, which is deeply despised by those with knowledge. In the past, there was a scholar who was jealous of Yan Shifan's lewdness and tyranny and wrote the book Jin Ping Mei. It was originally written out of anger and as a game. Unexpectedly, after its completion, it became popular at the time. The scholar had always enjoyed a great reputation. Because of this, he repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. In the year of Yi Chou, he was certain to be the top scholar in the palace examination. The examiner carried the scroll. In the morning, when he was about to fill out the list, he saw bloodstains all over the scroll. He was greatly shocked and dared not record it. Later, when he asked the reason, a rat had urinated on it, causing it to stain the scroll. The scholar ultimately died in poverty. This is because the pen of a scholar first cuts off his own salary and rank. To be published tomorrow.

Spring and Autumn: Medical Knowledge – Getting Vaccinated by Kuang Xihua

The weather is very hot, and newspapers are publishing conspicuous headlines about the discovery of real cholera. White-clad health workers are stopping people in the streets, and doctors are coming and going especially hurriedly.

"Get vaccinated." It seems to be very fashionable these days.

However, it is undeniable that public health knowledge is still not very widespread. Among many people in Shanghai, doctors excepted, very few truly understand the meaning of the three characters "vaccination." The facts before our eyes are not exhausted: some people pay more than ten yuan in consultation fees to have a foreign doctor give them a vaccination, but most people want to escape when they are stopped by the white-clad health workers specially dispatched by the health department on the street. Yesterday, a friend with a higher education asked me, what exactly do they inject when they give a vaccination? I replied that they inject hundreds of millions of dead bacteria, which almost gave him a big shock.

Based on the above points, it seems very urgent to spend a little time and a little paper at this time to explain the meaning, purpose, and precautions of getting vaccinated.

"Getting vaccinated" is academically called preventive inoculation. In fact, it is very simple. A certain type of killed bacteria (usually killed by heating) is injected into the human body. After a considerable period of time, the body produces antibodies. When the body encounters that type of bacteria again, it already has the ability to resist and will not get sick. Even if it does get sick, it will definitely be much milder.

The vaccinations that are currently referred to mostly mean combined cholera-typhoid prevention inoculation. That is, cholera bacteria and typhoid bacteria that have been killed by heating are diluted with sterile physiological saline. After animal experiments or cultivation experiments prove that the efficacy is indeed effective and the application is safe (usually each cubic centimeter contains 200 million cholera bacteria and 500 million typhoid bacteria), it is injected into the human body subcutaneously in three doses. The first dose for adults is half a cubic centimeter, and the second and third doses are one cubic centimeter. Each dose is spaced six to ten days apart. The dose for children is reduced according to age. After the second injection is completed, there will be three to six months (and in some cases up to two years) of protection against cholera and typhoid infections.

However, not everyone can get vaccinated. Patients with heart disease and kidney disease, as well as those in the second half of pregnancy, should not be vaccinated. Vaccinations should also be postponed during other illnesses and during women's menstrual periods.

Two to three hours after the injection, redness, swelling, pain, nausea, headache, and fever usually begin to occur at the injection site. The strength of the reaction is related to each person's physical condition, and there are also people who have no reaction at all. To avoid increasing the reaction, do not drink alcohol or exercise after the injection.

There is one more point that needs to be specially explained. Antibodies are not produced immediately after getting vaccinated. Usually, antibodies only begin to be produced in the blood one week after the first injection. The antibodies gradually increase after the second and third injections, and only then does the preventive effect occur. Therefore, in the one or two

German General to Use New Weapons to Attack Britain in Conjunction with Italy

Berlin: The German official "German News Agency" announced last night that after Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the German Fleet, inspected the German Navy stationed on the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France on June 17 and 21, all parties were deeply convinced that the German Navy was prepared to attack Britain. The German side anticipates that after Germany and Italy cease their attacks on France this morning, the two countries will launch a joint attack on Britain. Well-informed sources claim that the German army's preparations for the final blitzkrieg are almost complete. They believe that Germany will soon launch its long-publicized offensive against Britain. German newspapers are filled with reports of British aircraft bombing German civilians, proving that once a German-British war breaks out, the fighting will be extremely fierce. One German newspaper even issued a warning, "Anyone who indiscriminately bombs German territory will soon receive a sufficient lesson." (June 25 United Press dispatch)

Pétain Government Declaration Criticizes Britain for Inadequate Assistance

Bordeaux: Before surrendering to Germany, the French army put up a final fight. It is reported that before the Pétain government succumbed to Mussolini's armistice terms last night, the French army launched a counterattack against the Italian army in the Alps, inflicting heavy losses on the Italian army. After nine months and twenty-one days of war, France declared peace before this morning, but the price of peace is quite heavy under the conditions demanded by Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini. The cabinet has instructed General Huntziger to sign an armistice treaty with Italy in Rome, which will take effect six hours after notifying Germany. The cabinet also declared the first day after the signing of the armistice treaty as a national day of mourning. The Pétain government issued a declaration criticizing Britain for "inadequate assistance" and claiming that France will henceforth determine its foreign policy without relying on the whims of Germany and Italy. The French government also requested the United States to "understand France's sorrow." The statement stated in brief, "We do not deny the mistakes our country has made. Under the current circumstances, every French citizen should bear a share of the responsibility." The government also issued a warning to Britain, stating that it should be cautious when accepting French citizens who have been "abandoned by our country." The last wartime intelligence received here last night reported the French army's final victory. It is believed that German troops will begin occupying French territory this afternoon. The Bordeaux area will not be occupied for the time being, but German troops may build bridges fourteen miles outside the city. It is currently believed here that Prime Minister Pétain is directly negotiating with Führer Hitler to request that the French capital be moved back to Paris. (June 25 United Press dispatch)

Editorial

### Coping with the Situation in Vietnam

The international upheaval caused by the European situation has immediately triggered a reaction in the Far East: Japan is intensifying diplomatic pressure to lock down the overland transportation routes through French Indochina (Vietnam) and British Burma, a situation that China is unwilling to tolerate silently. Since the beginning of China's resistance war, its diplomacy has weathered several important junctures, always managing to follow the correct path and make appropriate responses. There's no need to recount past events, but recent actions such as Song Ziwen's flight to America, Foreign Minister Wang's declaration of significant resolve, and the repeated serious protests lodged with France have all been extremely critical.

Observing Japan's recent posture, its demands to blockade French Indochina and British Burma are presented in parallel, a two-pronged approach. However, there is information that France has completely accepted the demands while Britain has yet to make a definitive statement. To prevent Japan from taking further advantage, China will inevitably concentrate all its strength and exhaust every means to strive for victory in this diplomatic struggle. Of course, we must see through Japan's loudest claims: first, the so-called dispatch of troops to invade Vietnam and forcibly blockade China's overseas passages; and second, the so-called "strengthening of ties with Germany and Italy." In reality, these two tactics are not two separate matters but rather two sides of the same coin. If Japan's connections with Germany and Italy cannot be strengthened, it would absolutely not dare to invade Vietnam in isolation or act arbitrarily. If it rashly invades Vietnam, it will inevitably seek further connections with Germany and Italy after the fact. In short, regardless of which comes first, in the international situation, it will immediately become an enemy of Britain. At the same time, its confrontation with the United States will also become more acute. What becomes problematic is that France is currently in internal turmoil. Does the French colonial administration in Vietnam align with the Bordeaux government? How will it act as a friend or foe in the international arena? Assuming Vietnam is friendly to Britain, how will it resist aggression? How will Britain support it in jointly resisting aggression? And how will the United States provide effective assistance to Vietnam? These points cannot yield definitive answers until the evolution of events.

As for China, it is continuing its resistance war against Japan, so it must strike Japan as much as possible in any location, especially in Vietnam, which has close strategic, economic, and transportation ties with China. This is what Foreign Minister Wang has already expressed and will undoubtedly be seen and heard by all. However, the problem is not simple. If China is forced to take action in Vietnam, there are two seemingly very delicate questions: First, will the Sino-Japanese War therefore become closely linked to the European War? Second, under this conflicting reality, what attitude will the Soviet Union likely take? These two questions cannot be ignored, but analyzing their essence can provide answers. Regarding the first question, Japan, as a result of encountering resistance due to invading Vietnam, simultaneously steps into the two whirlpools of the Sino-Japanese War and the European War. But as far as China is concerned, as long as it does not have direct conflicts with any other country, it is still only engaged in the Sino-Japanese War. Regarding the second question, it is deeply believed that the Soviet Union can recognize that China's resistance war is fundamentally for national liberation and, objectively, for establishing stability in East Asia, which is consistent with Soviet interests. Therefore, it is likely that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain its sympathy for China.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that China has no need to worry or feel confused in its diplomatic policy. What needs careful consideration is how to establish appropriate limits in fact for implementing this policy? That is, after the principles openly expressed in declarations and protests to the French authorities in Vietnam, how should the limits be clearly indicated? If these limits are exceeded, then major measures must be taken immediately. Of course, such measures are by no means motivated by any desire for French Indochina, but are only necessary in wartime for military strategy, to seek the integrity of territorial sovereignty, not to seek the expansion of territorial sovereignty. This is a solemn meaning that is obvious and requires no further explanation.

### Japanese Positions Near Yichang Continue to be Bombed by Chinese Air Force; Chinese Aircraft Concentrate Bombing, Several Fires Break Out; Fierce Fighting for Mountainous Areas Near Dangyang

Location: On the 25th, the Chinese Air Force continued to sortie, bombing the remnants of the Japanese army near Yichang.

Chongqing: According to Chinese military sources, the center of gravity of the fighting on the west bank of the Xiang River has shifted to the mountainous areas northeast and southwest of Dangyang. The Chinese army is continuing to fiercely counterattack the Japanese army in Dangyang and Yichang. The fighting is very fierce in the mountainous areas northeast and southwest of Dangyang. It is reported that the Chinese army has two goals in its counterattack: one is to cut off the route from Dangyang to the Xiang River bank, and the other is to isolate the connection between Dangyang and Yichang. The Japanese army in Dangyang, due to the precarious situation of the Japanese army in Yichang, has been repeatedly attacking southwestward in recent days in an attempt to relieve the siege of Yichang, but has not succeeded. It is reported that a certain unit of the Chinese army has advanced to He Rongzhen, southeast of Dangyang. If this information is true, the Japanese army's retreat route in Dangyang may be cut off, as He Rongzhen is one of the important towns on the Han-Yi Highway. If the Japanese army wants to break through and retreat eastward along this highway, it must pass through He Rongzhen. (Express News Agency dispatch of the 25th)
