### After the Chinese side bombed the Haiphong railway bridge, a foreign spokesperson clarifies their position. Given the current situation in Vietnam, this action was purely self-defense, and according to the road regulations, there is the right to self-regulation when necessary.

Chongqing: Regarding the Chinese authorities bombing the Haiphong railway bridge on the Yunnan-Vietnam railway and independently regulating the Kunming-Haiphong section of the Yunnan-Vietnam railway, this reporter visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the reasons and position of the Chinese side, who provided the following detailed explanation: Japan is now demanding that Vietnam allow it to use Vietnam as a military base to attack Yunnan under the guise of transit. Militarily, we have no choice but to take necessary measures, and bombing the railway bridge is purely for self-defense. As for the Kunming-Haiphong section of the Yunnan-Vietnam railway, it is entirely within our territory, and we have the right to independently regulate it in case of emergency. Moreover, according to Article 24 of the Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Regulations (in the event of war between China and another country, the railway is not subject to neutrality and is subject to China's regulation), our right to independently regulate the railway is stipulated in the regulations. The agency currently regulating the section is the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Line Area Command, and the director and staff below have not been replaced (19th dispatch).

Chongqing: Regarding Japan's repeated pressure on Vietnam, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue another statement tonight to explain China's position (19th Havas dispatch).

Chongqing: According to the opinions of foreign military observers here, it is generally believed that even if Japan lands in Vietnam, it may not attempt to attack Kunming. They all believe that the Japanese will try to establish control in Vietnam in order to obtain important raw materials and establish naval, land, and air force bases, and then quietly observe the development of the international situation before continuing their actions, while simultaneously exerting pressure on the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The aforementioned observers also believe that the Chinese side's

### Japanese troops in Tianjin and Beijing are on high alert, defending against attacks by Chinese troops

Hong Kong: Tianjin news: In recent days, the Japanese troops in the Tianjin and Beijing area have been on even higher alert. Beijing has received reports that a large number of troops are preparing to attack Tianjin and Beijing, so the Japanese army has fully mobilized to implement defenses. Every night, clear gunfire can be heard in the west of Beijing. The Japanese are extremely uneasy. The number of Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin has also increased compared to before, and they are distributed for defense in the suburbs (18th dispatch).

Hong Kong: Tianjin News: The train on the Tianjin-Pukou line was bombed near Hanzhuang in Tengxian County on the evening of the 15th, and the locomotive was completely destroyed. Full traffic has been blocked as a result. The Tianjin-Beijing train was also delayed on the evening of the 15th (18th dispatch).

Destruction of various railway bridges on the Vietnamese border is not felt to be premature, because Japan has so many "observers" stationed in Vietnam that they may be able to occupy the bridges and wait for reinforcements to arrive, leaving the Chinese side unable to take destructive measures. Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Chinese army speaking to reporters, there are no major military developments in southern Guangxi. The Japanese army may be deploying troops, but so far no large-scale reinforcements have arrived in the southern Guangxi region (19th Reuters dispatch).

Chongqing: A foreign spokesperson recently declared that China's destruction of the Haiphong bridges and the takeover of the Haiphong-Kunming section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was purely a measure of self-defense. In view of the situation in Vietnam, China's actions have become necessary, and China is now acting in accordance with the rights stipulated in the French-Japanese treaties. The spokesperson repeatedly stated that, "In view of Japan's request to Vietnam to use its territory as a base of operations to attack China, the Chinese government has had no choice but to adopt this measure to cope with the situation. The destruction of the Haiphong bridges was purely a matter of self-defense. The Haiphong-Kunming section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is entirely within Chinese territory, so the Chinese government may manage this section of the railway in an emergency, and the Chinese government's authority is based on Article 24 of the 1903 French-Japanese Railway Agreement, which stipulates that if China is at war with a foreign country, this road does not have to abide by the rules of neutrality but must be placed under China's complete disposition. The headquarters of the Chinese army stationed on this section of the railway has now been authorized to manage the section of the railway." The spokesperson also stated that unless the Japanese army actually lands in Vietnam and begins to move towards China, the Chinese army will not enter Vietnam. According to recent unconfirmed news, Vietnam and Japan have agreed on the landing, but have not yet agreed on the transit of Japanese troops. If the Japanese army does not send troops to Vietnam, the Chinese army will also not enter Vietnamese territory. Furthermore, according to news from Guilin, Vichy has agreed to cede Guangzhou Bay and northern Vietnam to Japan, but people in Hanoi advocate armed resistance (19th United Press dispatch).

Hanoi: Regarding the negotiations between France and Japan, officials here are keeping the details secret, only saying that the negotiations are still in progress. French and Japanese representatives are now carefully consulting to ensure that the diplomatic agreements previously reached in Tokyo can be implemented in the future without any difficulties (19th Havas dispatch).

### French troops are indeed ready, automatically resisting invading Japanese troops

Hanoi: The Japanese military delegation stationed here expressed fear last night, believing that even if the local French civilian authorities allow the Japanese army to transit through Annam, the troops stationed in Annam may come out to interfere and obstruct it. At the same time, French officials confirmed that the French army, under the leadership of Commander Martin, is indeed ready to attack the Japanese army when it transits through Annam. French generals here do not want to allow the Japanese army to invade Annam, which would incite the Chinese army to enter Annam in opposition. Therefore, they would rather automatically resist the invading Japanese army. This view is said to be most strongly held by French officials close to the Chinese border, because the Chinese and French armies there are very friendly and amiable. Although, both Japanese and French officials say that the date of signing an agreement is very close, the Japanese delegation is packing up and ready to retreat suddenly, but some quarters believe that this attitude of the Japanese is just a bluff. A small number of Chinese here have prepared to evacuate Hanoi and have withdrawn all the funds stored in local banks. The evacuation of Japanese residents continued until yesterday. The business of most Japanese shops here was sluggish last night, with doors open but no customers. The general mood here mostly tends to shift allegiance to the de Gaulle Committee in London, but there is no practical indication of this at this time. Local French clearly believe that to enhance resistance to the current Japanese pressure, internal unity is the most important factor. Therefore, divergent views such as loyalty to Vichy or allegiance to the de Gaulle Committee seem not as urgently to be resolved as before. Many believe that the United Kingdom may also oppose the tendency of French people here to change their attitude and defect to the de Gaulle Committee, because this development would undoubtedly increase Britain's responsibilities in the East at a time when German air raids are threatening Britain. The general mood of the French people here is still friendly to British merchants, who hope to maintain their friendly commercial relations with Britain. Furthermore, according to several quarters here last night, even if a French-Japanese agreement is expected to be signed this week, continued negotiations will still be necessary, because it is heard that the current French-Japanese agreement under negotiation is quite similar to the agreement recently reached between Tokyo and Vichy, and there are still a number of minor issues that will have to be resolved in future negotiations (19th United Press dispatch).

### The Soviet Union and the United States both express deep concern, and the Japanese side says it will prepare for the worst

Moscow: The local newspapers here pay close attention to the situation in Vietnam. The Labor Daily published a special article today discussing the Vietnam issue. It is said that the situation in the southwestern Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. Judging from the telegrams reported in the newspaper, Vietnam is in danger of being drawn into the war. Japan has asked Vietnam to establish naval and air bases in Vietnam. This move is of great importance to China, because the Japanese military authorities hope to invade Vietnam and establish a new base for invading China (18th dispatch).

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull expressed deep interest yesterday in reports that Japan intends to move its troops into Vietnam. Hull said that he did not believe Japan would break its promise to maintain the status quo in the Far East and take action. When reporters asked Hull whether he would send a representative to Japan, Hull gave a negative reply, saying that the State Department would wait for the situation to unfold before deciding whether Japan had breached the agreement. News reaching here said that Japan is putting strong pressure on the French authorities to allow the Japanese army to enter Vietnam (19th International News Agency dispatch).

Washington: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that regarding Japan's demands on Annam, the Japanese side has not yet received any threats of active action, but when discussing recent news reports regarding the Far East, which generally believe that Japan has a tendency to invade Annam, Hull said that the Japanese government is not sure whether it will violate its recent statements. The statement Hull was referring to expressed the intention to maintain the status quo in Annam. As for the future developments in Annam, Hull is watching and waiting and does not want to make any comments at the moment (19th United Press dispatch).

Hong Kong: Tokyo News: The Kokumin Shimbun commented that the joint Anglo-American approach to Japan over the Japanese-Vietnamese Hanoi negotiations shows that the two countries are deliberately obstructing Japan's efforts to resolve the China Incident. In the past, Britain and the United States admitted to maintaining the status quo in Vietnam, so Britain and the United States strongly opposed Japan's actions to go beyond maintaining the status quo in Vietnam. Under this attitude of Britain and the United States, Japan will be forced to prepare for the worst (19th dispatch).

### Thai representatives make new demands, Vichy indirectly condemns Japan

Vichy: Officials in the Vichy government indirectly condemned Japan today because Thailand demanded territory from Vietnam. After Thailand's previous demands for territory were rejected, the French side issued its comments stating that Thailand's move was due to the fact that Thailand's Nationalist Party, "under the guidance of some Japanese leaders", is growing stronger. Observers here believe that a hardening of the French attitude towards Japan can be seen in these remarks (19th International News Agency dispatch).

Editorial

### The Thrifty Savings of Shanghai Residents

The sovereignty of the Shanghai concessions belongs to China, but during wartime, because of treaty relations, the rights and interests of various countries coexist in Shanghai, so people from all countries who care for the Shanghai concessions strive to strengthen their international character in order to maintain everything in the concessions. Regardless of the belligerent countries' forces fighting elsewhere, they coexist peacefully within the Shanghai concessions and the Huangpu River; when Chinese troops enter the concessions, they receive the treatment of the so-called "Isolated Army camp"; people from belligerent countries within the concessions are also treated equally as residents within the boundaries; all of this shows the international nature of this time and place. Of course, residents do not lose their ancestral nationality or forget their national concepts because the place they live in has a strong international character. For example, British merchants in the concessions openly called for returning home to join the army, and batches of them departed happily in great splendor. They also organized wartime fund associations in the concessions, collected large sums of money, and remitted them to Britain as contributions from wartime overseas Chinese to their motherland. They also accepted orders from the British government regarding commercial affairs, taxation, and the donation and interest methods of postal savings, all of which were in line with their wartime national obligations; all of this was not restricted by the international status of the concessions. There is almost an unwritten basic principle: that all actions do not hinder the order of the concessions, and all actions do not directly undermine the peace of the concessions themselves, then it will definitely be tolerated by the international concessions and by the opposing countries; therefore, although Britain and Italy have military conflicts and diplomatic difficulties, they go to extremes, while British and Italian officials and civilians in Shanghai act according to their own needs. Various examples can illustrate the great unevenness of the Shanghai concessions.

The purpose of China's national frugal construction savings movement is to enable Chinese citizens to voluntarily participate in savings, so as to cultivate a thrifty atmosphere in society; and the accumulated savings can be used for productive construction projects, in order to realize the grand vision and confidence that national construction will be successful. This is the minimum contribution that citizens can make to the country during wartime, benefiting both themselves and the country, which is a peaceful act. Under this movement, administrative agencies and local groups cooperate and act; savings bonds are issued with guaranteed principal and interest, and there are incentive measures, but they are not promoted by the military or solicited by the police. However, within the Shanghai concessions, it cannot proceed smoothly because it does not hinder the order of Anning, but because of the so-called environmental relations. Chinese residents in the concessions who miss their country cannot help but feel emotional!

Drawing swords and brandishing bows, glaring eyes and cracked teeth, are actually unnecessary in many matters, and are often not allowed in many environments; moreover, since resentment is not the mother of success and grief and indignation are not effective methods, why resent and grieve and be indignant! Take frugal savings as an example. On the one hand, it transcends the scope of the country and is a common virtue of mankind. On the other hand, it is the basis for any country to use national resources to develop production and construction projects. This matter has absolutely no room for criticism; and when it becomes the people's will, there is absolutely no room for prohibition; and there is no need to resent and grieve and be indignant because of the so-called environmental relations. In other words, if I want to be frugal, who can prevent me from being frugal? If I want to save, who can prevent me from saving? If anyone wants to obstruct me secretly, then I will grit my teeth and be even more frugal and save more, who can do anything to me? Being able to be frugal and being able to save means that I can contribute according to my will; why bother calculating the name and the method?

Taking Shanghai under special circumstances as an example, it is estimated that there are tens of millions of idle funds, or even 500 million. This is precisely because Shanghai is so special that it is impossible to conduct a thorough investigation and obtain accurate figures. However, it is absolutely certain that idle funds are rampant, leading to rising prices, rampant speculation, stagnation, and waste, which cannot be concealed. Among the idle funds, some have fled from Hong Kong, some have fled from Macau and Vietnam, and some have fled from Singapore or Sumatra, and there are also some who have fled from Kobe and Osaka. It is natural that wartime funds flee, which can be said to be an innate human instinct and nothing to be surprised about; of course, those fleeing from mainland China are an important part of it. If you ask what percentage of the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of idle funds in Shanghai are Chinese, although it is difficult to estimate, the number must be considerable. The people consider it wealth to have funds, but society does not consider idle funds to be a blessing. Idle funds must be properly digested; how to digest idle funds to be the best way is something that financial experts and economists in all countries have always worried about, but the result has often been unsatisfactory; because the abundance of idle funds is indeed a serious financial and economic problem. Shanghai is too special, and the concessions are nominally international, but they can actually only be equated with a police area; rice is expensive and cloth is expensive, but hoarding is allowed to the point of near-rot, and no action is taken to ban it; rice and cloth are still like this, let alone dealing with idle funds. Therefore, all that can be hoped for is that those who own idle funds will plan their own way. There are two points that should be generally recognized by everyone in Shanghai: (1) The current situation in Shanghai is like an isolated island, which is temporary; and its prosperity depends on the mainland; if the mainland's construction industry flourishes, Shanghai will receive its permanent benefits. (2) Shanghai's luxury has made Shanghai prosperous; in fact, the solid foundation of the market is not in luxury but in prosperity. If these two points are correct, then advocating frugality and encouraging savings in Shanghai, so that idle funds can be fully injected into the mainland and China can engage in construction, is a task that Shanghai people must strive for!

Hong Kong: According to the English-language China Mail published here, Thailand has made new demands on Vietnam. After the Vichy government rejected Thailand's previous three land demands, a Thai representative went to the French embassy yesterday and made new demands orally (19th Reuters dispatch).

Vichy: After Thailand requested France to revise the border between the country and French Vietnam, the French government notified the Thai ambassador to France today that our country cannot consider any request that would overturn the political status quo of Vietnam and involve its territorial integrity, and has decided to defend Vietnam and resist foreign aggression under any circumstances. In addition, our government has previously conducted negotiations with your country to discuss the demarcation of the border along the Mekong River, which has been quite smooth, so we are surprised by your country's additional demands (18th Havas dispatch).

Vichy: According to French radio, French-Japanese negotiations are currently underway. The spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo also issued the same statement. The spokesperson solemnly stated that the French-Japanese negotiations are not affected by Thailand's demands. It is said that the Thai government is making France's cession of Vietnamese land to Thailand a condition for ratifying the Franco-Thai non-aggression treaty (19th Haitong dispatch).

Tokyo: Today, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the French side's remarks that indirectly attributed Thailand's demands to Japan, saying that Japan has absolutely nothing to do with Thailand's request for France to return territory. The negotiations currently being conducted by Japanese and French authorities in Vietnam have nothing to do with the Franco-Thai non-aggression treaty or Thailand's demands on France (19th Reuters dispatch).

### The Central Police Academy held a graduation ceremony yesterday. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally attended the school and presided over the ceremony. The admonition emphasized common sense and life.

Chongqing: The Central Police Academy held a graduation ceremony on the morning of the 19th for the 6th term of the regular course and the 8th term of the criminal training class, as well as the 4th anniversary of its reorganization. The Director and concurrently the President of the school attended the ceremony and presided over it. The general meaning of the admonition: (1) As you graduate, it is at a time when Japanese aircraft are bombing most severely. This opportunity trains you to be vigilant and strive hard. (2) National construction is extremely difficult. The students of our school have heavy responsibilities and should make special efforts. (3) The police's objects are very complex. Without the ability to respond to emergencies, they cannot handle them properly. Therefore, you should always pay attention to common sense. (4) The New Life Movement depends on the police to promote the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. As police officers, you should set an example and vigorously promote them, so as to achieve the effect of the wind blowing over the grass, and so on. After the ceremony, the president briefly inspected the school. The spirits of the officials and students of the school were extremely excited, and the atmosphere in the hall was serious (19th dispatch).

### The Chinese army in Tianchang turned to the offensive

The Chinese army launched several attacks and finally defeated the Japanese soldiers. On the 10th, the Chinese army in Tianchang turned to the offensive and surrounded the Japanese. The Japanese were severely attacked by the Chinese. Currently, troops stationed in the Suzhou-Changzhou area are being transferred to provide assistance (18th dispatch).

### The United States Closely Monitors the Far East Crisis, Studies New Action Plans, Rebuilds a Powerful Navy in the Pacific, and Warns Japan to Maintain the Status Quo

Washington - According to the opinions of informed observers here, although the attention of the general public in the United States is focused on the German-British war, the relationship between the United States and Japan is becoming dangerous. According to reports from diplomatic circles here, after the U.S. State Department received news from East Asia that the new Japanese government is taking advantage of the chaos in Europe and the weakness of France to forcibly seek the Vichy government's permission for 25,000 Japanese troops to enter Vietnam, it is now striving to study new plans for U.S. action in the Far East. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has recently issued several warnings to Japan, urging it to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Therefore, if Japan takes action in Vietnam, it would be a blatant challenge to Hull. Recently, among the particularly important diplomatic events regarding the situation in the Far East, there are four: (1) U.S. Secretary of State Hull is currently holding multiple meetings with British Ambassador to the U.S. Lothian and Australian Minister to the U.S. Casey regarding naval, land, and diplomatic issues in the Far East. The discussions are focused on Australia, which is constantly fearful of Japanese aggression, but remains safe due to the British Navy's protection in the background. However, with Britain's military force now threatened by Germany, Australia's situation has become worse. (2) U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox recently inspected naval bases along the Pacific coast. Upon his return, he stated that some ships in the U.S. fleet should be sent to the West Coast for repairs. The ships' return from the Hawaiian base shows that there are currently no difficulties in the Pacific, and it also shows that the navy in the Pacific is being transformed into a first-class powerful navy to deal with contingencies. (3) Japan has recalled its ambassador to the United States and replaced him with a more "powerful figure" who advocates a "New Order in East Asia," but this proposition has been rejected by the U.S. State Department. (4) Recently, Japanese politicians and political commentators have urged Japan to take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to expand its power and territory in East Asia, which has caused considerable unease here. Some officials in the U.S. State Department are anxiously speculating about U.S.-Japan relations, and are generally indifferent to it. They point out that although relations between the two countries are tense, both are trying to avoid war. However, observers are asking, if Japan disregards Washington's warnings and sends troops into Vietnam, what will the United States do? The official explanation for the Japanese troops entering Vietnam is merely to inquire whether supplies are being transported through Vietnam to the Chinese army, which is not believed. Once these Japanese troops enter, they will stay there permanently, just like the Japanese "guards" entered Manchuria nine years ago. (International News Agency, 19th)

### The United States Will Sell Bombers to Britain; The Second Batch of Warships Will Be Transferred Immediately

Washington - According to sources from government leaders here, the new British-American military negotiations are about to reach a satisfactory conclusion. This negotiation also includes bombers. A government official told a reporter from the International News Agency that the negotiation to supply the United Kingdom with forty four-engine bombers is about to be completed. Although official confirmation is lacking, rumors have spread throughout the aircraft factories. Secretary of State Hull said that there is nothing new about this issue and asked reporters to inquire with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Army, but both departments refused to answer, also saying "You can ask Hull." It is generally believed that this negotiation involves Boeing B-17B aircraft. This aircraft has a speed of 300 miles per hour and a maximum flight altitude of 25,000 feet. This aircraft has now been replaced by the new C-type aircraft, which is equipped with self-sealing fuel tanks and larger cannons. The reporter who reported the news said that the Boeing-type aircraft may be returned by the Department of the Army or the Department of the Navy to the manufacturer, who will then resell them to Britain. Today, officials indicated that President Roosevelt will soon make an announcement regarding this negotiation. (International News Agency, 19th)

New York - Personnel from the American Aviation Chamber of Commerce announced that the number of military aircraft manufactured in the United States and delivered to Britain reaches 500 per month. This production rate is currently accelerating, so that it can reach a peak of 1,000 per month in February or March of next year. According to the general opinion of people in the aviation industry, about 80% or 90% of the military aircraft currently manufactured in the United States are shipped to Britain or Canada. (Reuters, 19th)

Ottawa - Canadian Minister of National Defence Ralston announced last night that 200 outdated tanks ordered by Canada from the United States will be delivered soon. Ralston said that these outdated tanks will be allocated by the Canadian Army Department for training purposes. (United Press, 19th)

### Most of the U.S. Defense Plan Has Been Completed; The National Defense Council Approves Construction Contracts Worth a Total of 6.1 Billion Gold Dollars

Washington - The total value of construction contracts approved by the National Defense Council since June 27 has reached 6.1 billion U.S. dollars. A portion of this amount, totaling 3,086,000,000 U.S. dollars, will be used to build 22 battleships, while the remaining 461,000,000 U.S. dollars will be used to procure naval and army aircraft. It is reported that the National Defense Council may announce the following in its second report on the progress of the national defense program: (1) 500 semi-automatic Garand rifles are currently in continuous production, and it is expected that 1,000 will be produced within a few months. (2) The plan for the expansion program of various rubber factories, worth 80 million U.S. dollars, has been completed. (3) The plan for producing sufficient steel sheets for tanks and warships will also be nearing completion. (4) The plan for procuring 75% of the necessary war materials for rearmament has also been completed.

### During the All-Night Air Raid on London, German Planes Indiscriminately Dropped Powerful Bombs; Many Famous Buildings Were Destroyed; Liverpool and Other Places Were Also Air-Raided

London - German planes again continuously bombed London from last night to this morning. The longest of these air raids started at 7:59 pm last night and did not end until 5:33 am this morning, lasting for nine and a half hours. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the number of casualties in last night's air raid, as far as is currently known, is about 90 dead and 350 seriously injured. Famous buildings destroyed include the Inner Temple Library, the Public Registry, and the courtyard of the British Museum. Many bombs fell near St. Dunstan's Church in the West End, but it was not damaged. While German planes were bombing London, several districts of Masset, and towns in Lancashire were also heavily bombed. Another city in the Northwest, believed to be Liverpool, suffered the worst bombing in history. German planes circled over the city for several hours, dropping a hundred high-explosive and incendiary bombs in residential areas, causing significant damage and many casualties. After the all-night air raid on London, the 103rd alarm was issued after dawn. Due to the new regulations issued by the government, the time of the alarm and its cancellation will no longer be announced from now on. (Reuters, 19th)

London - The German planes, which had repeatedly tried to break into London yesterday but were repelled, took advantage of the darkness last night and this morning. At the cost of sacrificing 42 aircraft, they broke into the London area and scattered their high-explosive and incendiary bombs in the central and other districts of London, like rain. As German planes were engaged in their new work of destruction over London, British anti-aircraft guns also showed their great power, rumbling all night long. Yesterday, the vast sky over London was bombed, and both the British and German sides showed their new methods. All news correspondents are prohibited from announcing the details of the new strategies and are only allowed to state them generally. It can only be said that the new British strategy is a simple method that can shoot down raiders without using anti-aircraft guns, anti-aircraft balloons, and aircraft. As for the German new tactics, they are a new type of bomb. It is difficult to say whether the British new tactics have achieved success, but at least two German planes are said to have been dropped in central London by the new tactics, and according to the Ministry of Aviation, these fallen planes may not have been shot down by anti-aircraft guns. As for the new German bombs, their effect is obviously not as good as the previous ones. As far as the people of London who were attacked are concerned, the psychological value of these German bombs in making people feel terror is actually greater than their destructive power. The German planes broke into London, but this time the effort of the raid resulted in a great price, because 42 German planes were destroyed in aerial combat, and one of them was shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Another air raid occurred this morning, when a German reconnaissance plane attempted to invade London, but failed. This morning, the sky over London was very calm. A German plane loaded with bombs crashed in southeastern London, and the bombs it was carrying exploded together, destroying several houses, including a police station and a labor school. It is believed that many people were buried in the basement. According to today's news, the Inns of Court and its library were damaged in the recent air raid. Also, one building, where it is said that Alterbia performed the play "Twelfth Night" in 1602 for Queen Elizabeth to watch, was also destroyed, and the Round Table, based on which Queen Elizabeth signed the death warrant for Queen Mary of Scotland, was also destroyed at the same time. The City Hall was also damaged by a high-explosive bomb. Also, five houses in a street in northern London were bombed, and several people were killed and injured. A world-famous street in central London was also bombed for the first time. The alarm was lifted at 7:54. (United Press, 19th)

London - It is now known that 48 German planes were shot down in the battle in the skies over England on Wednesday, one of which was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. Two British pilots were previously reported missing. It is now known that they have been safely rescued. Therefore, the British loss was 12 fighter planes, and 9 pilots were safe and sound. Another German bomber, which flew across the coast from the mainland this morning, was hit by machine gun fire and crashed into the sea off the southeast coast. (Reuters, 19th)

London - A joint communiqué from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of National Security stated that the enemy aircraft activity yesterday was mostly limited to the southeast region. Enemy aircraft squadrons flew over the coast of Kent several times, flying towards London and inland along the Thames Estuary. A small number of enemy aircraft sneaked into the skies over London City, and most of the bombs they dropped fell near the Thames Estuary. Most of the houses destroyed were residential, and the casualties were minimal. British aircraft and anti-aircraft guns continuously attacked enemy aircraft all day long. (Reuters, 19th)

### German Air Force Attacks in Batches; The Number of Fighter Planes Increases

London - According to the Reuters aviation reporter, German planes flew to southeastern England again yesterday to attack, trying to sneak into London and other places. Although some bombs fell in the Kent and Thames Estuary areas, London and other places did not suffer major bombings. The number of aircraft in enemy squadrons varied, rarely exceeding 50, and there were more fighter planes than bombers, indicating that the enemy intends to deplete the British Air Force's resistance. Yesterday was the same as the day before, and no major battle occurred, but the enemy's losses were heavier than on the 17th. London had its longest ten-hour air raid the previous night, and yesterday it suffered eight daytime raids, which seems to indicate that the enemy has exhausted its greatest efforts to deal with London. (Reuters, 19th)

London - The eighth alarm yesterday was the 102nd alarm since the start of the war. It was issued at 5:57 pm. The seventh alarm, lasting 28 minutes, sounded at 3:13 pm. London, in the past 24 hours, has experienced the longest and shortest air raids since the start of the war. The air raid on the night of the 17th to 18th lasted the longest, at nine hours and fifty-five minutes, while the air raid yesterday morning lasted the shortest, at only ten minutes. Just after noon yesterday, a large number of enemy aircraft, about 300, flew across the southeast coast of England. Several squadrons of twin-engine German bombers, protected by more than 200 fighter planes, flew over the coast in succession at an altitude of more than 20,000 feet for a quarter of an hour. They were immediately met by British fighter planes. In the afternoon, 15 enemy bombers, surrounded by Messerschmitt fighters, were quickly dispersed by British aircraft off the coast of Kent. British aircraft also saw another squadron of enemy aircraft flying towards the Thames near the Isle of Sheppey and immediately attacked them head-on. The enemy aircraft hurriedly dropped their bombs and fled past Folkestone. Just after 3 pm, about 100 enemy aircraft flew towards the Thames Estuary, followed closely by another 250 enemy bombers and fighter planes, engaging in fierce fighting with British aircraft. British aircraft shot down 29 enemy bombers over Kent and the Thames, causing the enemy formation to break up and eventually be driven back towards France. (Reuters, 19th)

### British Air Force Intercepts Enemy Aircraft, Adopting an Up-and-Down Pincer Attack Tactic

London - According to the Ministry of Aviation, a small squadron of German aircraft reached the skies over London yesterday, but the British Air Force used a new "double-layered pincer attack" tactic to drive them back. The official explanation is that when using this new tactic, the British Air Force patrol squadron attacks German aircraft from the upper layer, forcing them to descend into the fire line of anti-aircraft guns, and then the lower-layer destroyer squadron pursues them and drives them back. Today, at least 300 more German aircraft flew up the Thames in formation, but they were also repelled by this new tactic. It is said that four German aircraft were shot down. It is estimated that more than 2,000 German aircraft attacked London today. Weymouth and all parts of England were also attacked. (International News Agency, 19th)

### Glasgow Industrial Area Attacked by German Aircraft Squadron at Night

Berlin - The German Air Force flew to Glasgow, the second largest city in the British Isles, late on the night of September 17, bombing and hitting several factories and industrial areas. According to a report by military journalist Deng Weizi, the moonlight was dim that night, and thin clouds obscured the sky. The German Air Force flew to the island of Scotland, vaguely seeing Glasgow and the River Clyde, as well as factories on both banks, but no anti-aircraft gun emplacements, proving that the anti-aircraft guns and air defense forces of the British Isles are now concentrated in London. The German Air Force followed the map and flew around the city for ten minutes, dropping bombs, but nothing happened. After a while, the moonlight cleared, and the docks and factories were clearly visible. All the bombs dropped hit the target. Only after the bombs were exhausted did the sound of anti-aircraft guns become audible. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Budapest, Hungary - Hungarian people are very excited about German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome. According to the "Hungarian News," after German Leader Hitler met with Italian Colonial Minister Delucci and Spanish Interior Minister Suna, he sent Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and this visit occurred at the same time as the Italian army's attack on Egypt. Its significance is very clear.

(Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Berlin - News spread here today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has gone to Rome to consult with Italian leaders on what the final task of Spain is in the European war.

It is expected that Germany and Italy are discussing how to stipulate an important timetable for the two countries' military and economic actions. (International News Agency, 19th)

Berlin - Yesterday, when reporters were entertained here, foreign press representatives asked about the purpose of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome. The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that previous meetings between German and Italian politicians often produced concrete results and were often more meaningful than ordinary meetings. We will announce the issues discussed and the results, but we cannot specify them at present. The meeting between the German and Italian foreign ministers in Vienna was weeks ago, and the situation has developed since then, such as the German Air Force's fierce attack on Britain and the Italian army's attack on Egypt. Given the close relationship between the Axis powers, all political issues between the two countries must be discussed with each other, which is nothing new. The re-contact between the two foreign ministers should be able to exchange views frankly on various important issues of the new European order. As for the German Foreign Minister's trip to Rome, it was only recently decided, and it was not stated whether it was related to peace, and the answer was "This is ridiculous." It is reported that the German Foreign Minister took a train to Rome yesterday afternoon and is expected to return to Berlin by the end of the week. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Berlin - Regarding the German Foreign Minister's trip to Rome, the Berlin Evening News commented yesterday that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome is not only related to the current political and military issues, but also related to the urgent issues that will occur soon. The Sturmangriff newspaper stated that the Foreign Minister's trip is particularly important because since the Axis powers are forced to fight, political issues of common interest and the new European order must be discussed at length. The Berlin Börsen-Zeitung commented that the results of the Axis politicians' talks are often pleasing to their friends and feared by their enemies. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

The current outpost of the Italian army is Sidi Barrani, which was previously guarded by only one company of British mechanized troops. The commander-in-chief of the British Middle East forces never intended to resist the Italian army's advance there. The British strategy is a flexible defense, aimed at luring the enemy deep into Libya, like a turtle stretching its head out of its shell, and then suddenly cutting off its head. According to previous news, the Italian army's advance cannot be attacked, but the current situation is more active, because there are roads available from Sidi Barrani. (Reuters, 19th) Cairo, A British communiqué stated that on Tuesday, British aircraft fiercely attacked Italian army positions in Egypt day and night, with considerable success. The enemy is now consolidating positions around Sidi Barrani, and other fronts are quite calm. (Reuters, 19th) Rome, According to an official statement issued here, the Italian Air Force has no intention of bombing Cairo. The British side issued this news in an attempt to incite the Arabs of Egypt to oppose Italy. The Italian aircraft bombed the British gasoline storage depots in the Suez Canal area, and also avoided affecting residents, which is known to the Egyptian residents. Moreover, the air raid alarm in Cairo was issued by order of the British authorities, in order to terrorize the people. In fact, Italian aircraft did not fly over Cairo. According to responsible persons in Rome, the Italian Air Force has received orders not to fly over Cairo under any circumstances.

(United Press, 19th) Random Notes on the European War (10) Compiègne The Tragedy in the Forest On June 21, 1940, French and German representatives signed an armistice agreement in the historically famous Compiègne Forest in northern France. The Compiègne Forest is located about fifty miles northeast of Paris. Louis XVI and Napoleon had both summoned their queens, Marie Antoinette and Marie Louise, there. Five hundred and ten years ago, the French Joan of Arc was captured there by the Duke of Burgundy. Twenty-two years ago, in November 1918, the German representatives also signed the armistice treaty with French Commander-in-Chief General Foch in the same place. This time, Hitler wanted to restage this "drama" in the same place, which was not without deep meaning. The following is the record from the American Time magazine: On Friday afternoon, June 21, under the summer sun, the Compiègne Forest, known as the heart of France, was quiet and silent. German troops were conducting operations on the Paris-Soissons road. At the branch point from the avenue to the forest, German soldiers were stationed. The area where the armistice agreement was to be signed was completely closed off to traffic. On a short road leading to the forest, Hitler's guards and two platoons of German army and one platoon of airmen stood guard on both sides. At 3:50 PM German summer time, a convertible car carrying Hitler stopped at the intersection with a squeal. He jumped out of the car and lightly began to perform the first act of the "drama." Hitler's car stopped in front of the Alsace-Lorraine Memorial, which originally had a sword carved on it, piercing a defeated German eagle. The inscription read: "In memory of the brave French soldiers who defended the nation, maintained justice, and liberated Alsace-Lorraine." Now the memorial was covered with a swastika flag. After Hitler got out of the car, he glanced at the memorial and then lightly moved his feet towards the open space. The open space from the memorial to the signing area was about two hundred yards away. Hitler was wearing a double-breasted gray uniform with the Iron Cross medal hanging on the front pocket of his left chest. Behind him followed six German high-ranking officers: Air Minister General Goering, wearing a green air force uniform, holding the baton of a general in his right hand; Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Keitel, with his cap tilted to one side, looking very handsome; Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Brauchitsch, wearing a gray uniform; Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, wearing a blue sea uniform, with his collar upright and also carrying a baton in his hand; Deputy Chairman of the National Socialist Party Hess, wearing a brown party uniform; Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, wearing a brown diplomatic uniform. At 3:18 PM, when this group walked to the open space, the brand-new flags of Hitler's guards were raised high. Hitler led his entourage to another small stone monument between the already rusty two sets of tracks. This monument was erected to commemorate the place where the German representatives parked between November 8 and 11, 1918. It also had simple words: "German Plenipotentiary." Hitler and his followers boarded dining car 1419D there - the Franco-German armistice treaty was signed in this car. Two minutes later, they got out of the car again and chatted with their staff in the sunlight. The narrow black shadow of the dining car was reflected on the green grass, which felt quite cool. Suddenly, Hitler jumped into the car again, at exactly 3:25 PM. It is reminiscent that twenty-two years ago, on a cold winter Friday morning in November, in a bleak atmosphere, the old and experienced General Foch signed the armistice treaty with the German representatives in the same place and in the same dining car. The conversation between Foch and the German representatives at that time was as follows: Foch: "Gentlemen!" "What do you want?" The chief German representative, Matthias Erzberger, replied: "We are here to accept the armistice conditions." Foch said angrily: "I don't have any conditions." German representative Count Oberndorff: "General, please tell us how we should express ourselves. Our delegation is ready to ask you to propose armistice conditions." Foch: "Are you formally requesting an armistice?" German representative: "Yes." Foch: "Then please sit down, and I will read the Allied conditions to you."

Regarding the incident of the Shanghai Public Concession guards shooting at the Chinese troops stationed in the concession, the Chinese people were all indignant upon hearing this. It is reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent notes to the British and American embassies in China, lodging a strong protest against this matter, demanding that the responsible personnel for this unfortunate incident be punished, and guaranteeing that the same situation will not occur again. At the same time, China declares that it reserves the right to demand compensation for losses. The day before yesterday evening, after the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, yesterday the Public Concession authorities immediately tried to find ways to resolve the unfortunate incident of the Isolated Battalion. The details of the Board of Directors' discussion of this issue are not yet known, but it is reported that the meeting decided to conduct a thorough study of this issue in order to establish permanent peace in the Isolated Battalion. According to an American official of the Public Works Department, the result of the meeting was that the Bureau would do its best to resolve this matter peacefully, and it was said that negotiations between the Public Works Department and the officers of the Isolated Battalion were still ongoing. After the official learned that Regiment Commander Xie had issued a statement acknowledging that three soldiers of the Isolated Battalion had died from injuries, he was deeply afraid that there were still those who would stir up trouble and cause chaos in this case. According to a public announcement released by the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department, "Regarding the dispute in the Isolated Battalion, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department considered it at the regular meeting on the afternoon of the 18th and decided to explore various peaceful methods so that the above dispute can be resolved as early as possible." He Dehui Visits Regiment Commander Xie Yesterday At 4:00 PM yesterday, He Dehui, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, accompanied by the Deputy Commander of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, drove to the Isolated Battalion on Jiaozhou Road to visit Regiment Commander Xie to discuss solutions and investigate the causes and course of the conflict between the two sides on the 14th. They left the camp at 6:00 PM. It is reported that the Isolated Battalion, unarmed, determined that it was difficult to cause trouble and requested that the responsibility for the tragedy be thoroughly investigated in order to ensure permanent security. It is also reported that the Isolated Battalion has photographed the situation of the White Russian Volunteer Corps using water cannons and chemical bombs to attack them on the 14th as ironclad evidence. Investigation of the Circumstances of the Soldiers' Tragic Death Regarding the incident of the White Russian Volunteer Corps shooting and killing soldiers of the Isolated Battalion the day before yesterday, according to the reporter's investigation, it was caused by the repeated troubles of the Isolated Battalion, which aroused public outrage among the nearby residents. Therefore, several young children threw bricks and stones at the White Russian Volunteer Corps who were guarding the post. At this time, the soldiers of the Isolated Battalion who showed their heads on the wall looked quite proud. The White Russian Volunteer Corps believed that they had lost face and forbade them in Chinese. A verbal dispute occurred between the two sides. The White Russian Volunteer Corps actually raised their guns, aimed, and fired two shots continuously, resulting in one soldier of the Isolated Battalion being killed and one injured. The deceased has been ordered by Regiment Commander Xie to have the camp's craftsmen rush to make a coffin and be buried on an auspicious day. One injured soldier of the Isolated Battalion is receiving medical treatment together with several injured after the conflict on the 14th. The Nearby Precautions are Still Very Strict Since the tragedy occurred in the Isolated Battalion on the 14th, the Public Works Department Primary School adjacent to the camp has temporarily suspended classes to avoid danger. The resumption of classes was originally scheduled for yesterday, but was again ordered by the Public Works Department to postpone the start of school, and school affairs have been suspended. The Isolated Battalion is still under strict blockade, and the nearby precautions are still very strict. Yesterday morning, a young man tried to throw a newspaper into the camp and was beaten by the White Russian Volunteer Corps when they saw him. There is no problem with the food supply for the Isolated Battalion, but according to a resident who was trapped in the camp for five days due to the traffic blockade and was only released yesterday, there is currently no salt in the camp, and the soldiers have only been eating white rice for five days. Their health is very worrying. Mann Reports to the Volunteer Corps Commander At about 11:00 AM yesterday, Major Mann, the responsible officer of the White Russian Volunteer Corps stationed in the Isolated Battalion, went to see Colonel Hembel, Commander-in-Chief of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, to report on the situation from the 13th of this month to yesterday morning. Hembel will prepare a report based on the account of Major Mann and submit it to the Public Works Department. As for the Public Works Department, it is extremely silent about the tragedy of the Isolated Battalion being shot and killed the day before yesterday, neither acknowledging nor denying it, only saying "There is no definite information yet." Xie Jinyuan's Second Appeal A public notice to colleagues in the press. In the incident on the 14th, a total of 19 officers and soldiers were poisoned, including two soldiers whose faces and bodies were swollen and unable to eat. It is difficult to predict whether their lives are in danger. There were two bayonet wounds and four brick and stone injuries, as well as one death and one injury yesterday (the 18th). Up to this moment, there has been one death and 26 injuries. Since noon on the 14th, I have never communicated with the outside world. However, external news is that the Public Works Department has repeatedly sent representatives to attempt negotiations, all of which have been rejected by the Isolated Battalion, and that the Isolated Battalion has proposed immediate restoration of freedom, etc. I do not know what the purpose of this kind of news is. Is it that they hope to use one-sided words as propaganda material? It was found that on the afternoon of the 15th at 3:00 PM, Colonel Hembel came and said, "Restore the original state in the camp." Company Commander Wu Lianqian also said, "Everyone restores the original state before the 14th." According to the report of the military officer, there was no request to restore freedom, and nothing was known. Apart from this, there were no negotiations. I do not know whether the above news has other functions or is due to misunderstandings in transmission. I have always opposed the "might makes right" concept of mankind before the Middle Ages. If the concession authorities do not listen to one-sided words and adhere to preconceived ideas, I reiterate my previous request, it would not hurt to send representatives to conduct a preliminary investigation into the causes and consequences of this incident. Now, except for the uninterrupted tap water, the electricity has also been completely cut off since 10:00 AM yesterday (the 18th) because there is a radio in the camp that can listen to outside news. However, citizens, driven by righteous indignation and human sympathy, purchase small amounts of dried vegetables, which are not allowed to be sent in. Those who throw them in from outside the wall are arrested and beaten. I do not know whether we still belong to the human world. Since the 14th, we have been completely isolated from the outside world, and talking in the gaps in the barbed wire on the wall is subject to being shot. We have been subjected to inhuman treatment for three years, and now it is becoming more and more intense. This kind of high-pressure and cruel means is a stain on public justice, international law and order, and human civilization. I believe that the way of heaven is fair, and retribution is inevitable, and there will be a day when they will reap the consequences. I now appeal to the responsible authorities of the Public Works Department. We have no special request. We need "justice." Please consider the consequences of high-pressure methods. I have said everything. I wish you to uphold justice. Xie Jinyuan, September 19, 29th year.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Handwritten Instructions Urge the Four Banks to Discourage Speculative Capital Flows Increase Interest Rates to Make People Willing to Save Shanghai Banks Have Been Ordered to Implement It The Four Banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture Received a Handwritten Instruction from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "Many Compatriots in Various Regions Have a Lot of Surplus Funds Scattered Around, But There is a Lack of Proper Use. As a Result, it Has Become Speculative Capital. In Shanghai Alone, It Is Reported That There Are Tens of Millions of This Kind of Speculative Capital, Most of Which Is Used to Illegally Purchase Foreign Exchange for Private Speculation and Illegal and Harmful Hoarding, Which Is Not Only Useless to Themselves, But Also Harmful to the Country. In Addition to Instructing Us to Vigorously Promote the National Salvation Savings Campaign, We Are Also Ordered to Quickly Promote Small Savings Deposits at High Interest Rates to Universally Absorb Social Speculative Capital and Engage in National Defense Construction, So as to Prevent Funds from Going Astray." It is Reported That the Four Banks, the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, and Various Commercial Banks Have All Complied with the Order to Promote Savings. At the Same Time, in Order to Protect the Interests of Depositors, the Government Authorities Have Collected Deposits in Accordance with the Savings Bank Law and the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks. (1) Savings Deposits: According to Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, Savings Banks Should Have at Least 25% of the Total Amount of Savings Deposits in the Form of Government Bonds and Treasury Bills as Well as Other Assets with Reliable Guarantees, Which Should Be Deposited in a Special Custody Vault Established by the Central Bank as Security for the Repayment of Savings Deposits. (2) Ordinary Deposits: According to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks, 20% of the Total Amount of Deposits Received Should Be Used as Reserve Funds, Which Should Be Transferred to Any of the Four Banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture in the Local Area, and the Receiving Bank Should Provide Appropriate Interest. All Sectors in Chongqing are Concerned About the Concentration Camp Case Reuters, Chongqing, 19th. All sectors of the Chinese community here are very indignant about the shooting of the isolated troops detained in the French Concession of Shanghai. All Chinese newspapers have published Shanghai telegrams about this matter in prominent positions. The United States is Determined to Maintain the Integrity of the Concession Investment in Shanghai Will Not Be Occupied Upholding Justice for Ourselves and Our Friends Regarding the current Shanghai concession issue, the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post published the following editorial yesterday. According to the New York Herald Tribune, both Tokyo and London seem to acknowledge that the withdrawal of British troops from China was the result of Japanese diplomatic pressure. Whether this is true or not, this move has damaged the authority and dignity of the British in the Far East. If a Western country loses face in Asia, then the face of all other Western countries will inevitably be lost. A few months ago, in order to safeguard peace in the Far East, the Japanese side reiterated Tokyo's proposal to request all warring countries to withdraw their troops from China. However, this point does not apply to the American navy in China, as well as the marines stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. In fact, this kind of request from Japan is unreasonable, because it does not include the small number of Italian troops cooperating with the British, American, and French troops stationed in Shanghai to maintain security. Recently, semi-official Japanese circles have faintly revealed the hope that the American troops will withdraw. This is tantamount to Japan admitting that what it urgently needs is not peace in the Far East, but military control of the Shanghai Public Concession. After exposing Japan's intentions, the commentary continued to declare America's position, saying that the true mission of the American troops is to help the British and other peoples maintain the integrity of Shanghai's sovereignty and oppose the Japanese occupation, because America has a large investment here. Now that the British troops have withdrawn, we will share their war responsibilities with the Italian and French troops to prevent the obstruction of the Public Concession and the adjacent French Concession. In short, if we were a submissive people, then leaving this place would be our responsibility to ourselves. However, we are the opposite. For ourselves, for friends in distress, and for President Roosevelt's call for human justice, we should replace the British troops in Shanghai. Special Alert Partially Lifted The special alert adopted by the municipal authorities of this city was partially lifted yesterday. Obstacles on the streets of the Public Concession were removed yesterday morning. At the same time, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps patrols also completely withdrew. The national defense forces returned to their camps at midnight on Wednesday (18th). According to the police authorities of the British and French Concessions yesterday, the special alert situation was very good. However, the police department of the French Concession continued to implement the alert. The barbed wire obstacles on the roads in the concession were not removed yesterday, but the number of police arrests by the search team has been greatly reduced. At the same time, the French defense forces have also withdrawn back to their camps. According to a police officer in the French Concession, the alert in the French Concession will continue to be implemented until the authorities deem it unnecessary. As for the West Shanghai area, Japanese and Italian soldiers and the search team of the police department, and the White Russian team of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, continued to stand guard at important intersections. However, all obstacles from the Public Concession to "bad land" have been removed. The northern part of the central district of the Public Concession, that is, the Hongkou West District defense, after the armored vehicle team and light cavalry team of the Volunteer Corps took over the defense of the district from the 15th of this month, the defense of the district left behind after the withdrawal of the defense from 6:00 PM last night was also taken over by A Company. Lawyer Shi Jiutang Suddenly Shot Yesterday Afternoon Three Uninvited Guests Broke in and Opened Fire The Back of His Head is Shattered and His Life is in Critical Condition A shooting occurred suddenly at 11:57 AM yesterday on Central Road in the Public Concession. The victim was lawyer Shi Jiutang. A bullet entered from the nose and pierced the back of his head. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he fainted and fell to the ground. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled with their weapons. The details of the situation are as follows: Sitting in the Office, Uninvited Guests Arrive Shi Jiutang, with the courtesy name Dakun, is thirty-two years old this year and is from Yin County, Zhejiang. He is tall and thin and practices law. He rents a residence at No. 27, Wuling Village, No. 516, Gordon Road, and has an office in Room 305, 3rd Floor, No. 24, Central Road. At around 11:57 AM yesterday, three uninvited guests suddenly broke into the office. Two were wearing long gowns and one was wearing a suit. At that time, Shi was sitting in the middle of the room processing official business, with a cigarette in his mouth. Unexpectedly, when the three people saw Shi, one of them pulled out a pistol and shot him three times without asking why. Bullet Pierces the Back of the Head and He Immediately Falls to the Ground A bullet hit his face next to his nose, and the bullet pierced the back of his head. Blood splattered everywhere, and Shi was unable to get up and was barely breathing. The clerks and tea servers in the room were shocked and unable to move. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, took up their weapons and fled down the stairs. Afterwards, the staff urgently reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which immediately summoned an ambulance to rush there. Chinese police No. 2409 escorted him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the police station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to search for the perpetrators. However, the perpetrators had already fled. The empty bullet casings on the floor were taken back to the police station for future investigation. Bloodstains Everywhere, the Situation is Terrible After the incident, the reporter went to Shi's office to investigate. Only one Chinese policeman was left on guard by the police station. When asked, the policeman said that all the personnel in the office had been taken to the police station for interrogation. Only bloodstains could be seen on the floor, and the writing desk and chairs were also stained with blood. The stench was difficult to smell, which made people want to retreat. There was also a meerschaum pipe lying across the chair cushion, broken in two. Shi was wearing a dark blue suit, coffee-colored trousers, and yellow leather shoes yesterday. Unwise Friendships and Entering Gambling Dens It is reported that Shi graduated from Chizhi University in the past. Because he was proficient in Italian, he worked in the Italian Concession Police Station in Hankou. He became a member of the Shanghai Lawyers Association in November 24th year of the Republic of China. He previously co-founded an office with lawyer Li Baoyi in Room 302, Xingda Building, Henan Road. He also formed a partnership with German Jewish lawyer O Tianwen at No. 12, Gongguan Road, French Concession, and was also friends with another Jewish lawyer, Gao Weixiaofu. When Gao died in Shanghai, all his property was bequeathed to Shi and Tian in his will. That was in April of this year. Last winter, he moved to the current address on Central Road. In addition to his wife and son, he also had parents who were still alive. His mother was a Christian. Shi was usually careless in making friends and often went to gambling dens in West Shanghai. Skull Shattered, Life in Critical Condition After Shi was injured and sent to the hospital, doctors diagnosed that the back of his skull was shattered and the bullet had not penetrated. Because he was in a coma, he could not be treated until dusk. There was no certainty whether his life could be saved. Japanese Planes in Eastern Zhejiang Bomb Again Yuyao and Zhuji The Shanghai Tongxiang Association in Zhejiang Province continued to receive the following telegrams from Eastern Zhejiang yesterday. (1) At 11:00 AM on the previous day (the 18th), the sound of planes was heard in Guanhaiwei. Four Japanese planes were subsequently discovered over Cixi, and they sneaked into Yuyao and dropped one bomb, destroying more than 20 civilian houses and injuring three people. Afterwards, this batch of Japanese planes passed through Baiguan and the southwest of Shaoxing, passed through Fengqiao, and invaded Zhuji airspace, dropping more than 10 bombs. The losses are unknown. After dropping the bombs, they fled north. Chinese Have Lost Protection The Legal System of the Two Concessions Has Disappeared The Millard's Review Issues a Loyal Warning to the Authorities The Millard's Review published today has an editorial entitled "The Prevalence of Illegality and the Decline of Legal Management in Shanghai," which states: The Public Concession and the French Concession in Shanghai used to pride themselves on being "havens of safety," because they were able to form a clean land of "legal management" in an environment of unstable suburbs. However, those days have passed. Now, only foreigners who enjoy consular jurisdiction still have some safety. If they want to be arrested, they must follow proper legal procedures and guarantee that they can receive a fair trial in their home country's court. Chinese No Longer Have Safety But for the Chinese, especially those who are patriotic and are regarded by the Japanese as enemies of Japan and a certain party, there is no safety at all. In the two concessions, Chinese civilians have been arrested by concession police officers in cooperation with Japanese military police on many occasions. In some cases, those arrested have been handed over to a completely unrecognized jurisdiction, so "legal management" has been overturned by the authorities of the two concessions by order of the Japanese side. Several cases occurred last week in which Chinese actors who sang ballads were arrested by the French police at the request of the Japanese side on the morning of September 14 because they were said to be related to political activities. What happened to them afterwards is unknown, but they were not sent to the French Concession Court. On the same day, five Chinese residents in the Public Concession, including a wealthy securities broker aged 21 and three employees of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, were arrested by the police "in cooperation with the Japanese authorities." The fate of the five people is unknown. Legal Powers are Stipulated in Agreements The legal powers of the Shanghai concession authorities have been clearly stipulated, and Chinese people in the concessions can only be arrested with an arrest warrant issued by the First Special District Court of the Public Concession, the Second Special District Court of the French Concession, or a senior Chinese judicial organ. Those who violate minor offenses must be brought to one of the courts for trial in accordance with proper legal procedures. If found guilty, they must be imprisoned in the prisons of the two concessions. As for criminals who endanger the country, they can be transferred at the request of a senior Chinese judicial organ. Although they can be transferred, they must first be sent to one of the two special district courts, and only after clear evidence of the crime is presented can the transfer be permitted. So-Called Cooperation Has No Legal Basis These legal procedures have been specifically stipulated in the court agreements signed by the Chinese government and the various countries in the two concessions, and these agreements have not yet expired. In the arrest cases that occurred last week, as well as many other arrest cases before, none had arrest warrants issued by the First or Second Special District Courts, and those arrested were never brought to court for trial. These incidents occur only because the Japanese authorities in this city request the arrest of these people, and the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Board of Directors also "cooperate" without regard to legal requirements. Arbitrary Arrests and Extraditions Chinese people who are arrested are first detained in

Zhou Xinfang of the Performing Arts Circle is Out of Danger; Illness is Exhaustion and Damp-Heat-Induced Typhoid Fever; Requires Three Weeks of Recuperation Before Getting Out of Bed
Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner

Regarding the illness of Zhou Xinfang (Qilin Tong), all circles are extremely concerned, but none know the details. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter met with a close relative of his, and learned that Xinfang's illness stemmed from the previous large-scale charity performance, and the condition was quite dangerous. Here is a record of that gentleman's conversation: "Xinfang's illness this time is purely due to the heavy burden of the plays assigned for the previous charity performance. The organization of this large-scale charity performance was initiated and supported by Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lantao, and others. Xinfang was also one of the main initiators. For this reason, Xinfang was very willing to increase the weight of his own plays in order to boost ticket sales. After discussions on all sides, it was agreed that he would perform the entire 'Daming Mansion' at the Grand Stage during the day, with Xinfang playing Lu Junyi in the first part, followed by Gai Jiaotian's 'Zengtou City,' ending with the capture of Shi Wengong. In the evening, at the New Stage, Xinfang would take on the lead role in 'Battle of Changsha,' also a demanding martial arts play. Unexpectedly, after the plays were assigned, Gai Jiaotian objected, saying that he would not perform 'Zengtou City' unless Xinfang played Lu Junyi. Xinfang, upon hearing this, was greatly displeased, saying, 'Why is Boss Zhang so unreasonable? I have to act Lu Junyi for three and a half hours in the first part, which is already very strenuous. If I then perform the opening fight in 'Zengtou City,' how can I endure it? Moreover, there is still a major play in the evening, and the weather is so hot. Wearing heavy armor is already unbearable. Isn't performing with all my might twice a day like throwing away my old life?' Then he thought, 'This charity performance is initiated to save countless refugees in Xiaoshao, and its significance is incomparable to other charity performances. I have sacrificed everything already. Can't I sacrifice for this small matter?' Gritting his teeth, he accepted all of Jiaotian's demands. Little did he know that this promise would sow the seeds of a serious illness. When the day came, Xinfang was not feeling well, but he struggled to complete the performance. After the play, he felt chills and fever. In the evening, he went to the New Stage despite his illness. After sitting down backstage, the fever intensified, and he was sweating profusely. After the 'Battle of Changsha,' he was too exhausted to stand. He went home by car, and his illness fully manifested itself. The next day, his condition worsened. After being diagnosed by a doctor, it was determined to be 'exhaustion and damp-heat-induced typhoid fever.' He is now out of danger, and the chills and fever have subsided. However, he still needs three weeks of recuperation before he can barely get out of bed. As for when he can recover and when he can return to the stage, it is still difficult to determine at this time."

### The "Uh-Man" - A Brief Biography of Charles Boyer
Savvy

Charles Boyer, this man with a quiet personality, actually stores a lot of enthusiasm in his heart. When he acts, his style is always unique, so the publicists under the giant hands of general film merchants cleverly added titles such as "mysterious," "seductive," "uh-man," and so on. He is now a very famous French artist in Hollywood. He was born in a small village in the south of his motherland forty years ago. The kind Mrs. Boyer originally hoped that her son would become a famous doctor in the future, but he stubbornly insisted on going on stage. Mrs. Boyer couldn't resist him, so she had to let him go.

So at the age of nineteen - just after completing his university courses - he began his career as an actor. After becoming famous, he switched to film company acting. Later, he also shot several films in Germany. At that time, MGM Film Company was looking for several suitable talents to dub into German for films - Charles was one of those lucky people. But after his work was completed, he did not continue, but returned to his old home. When he entered Hollywood, the flower of his life bloomed more brilliantly. Everyone in Hollywood was very happy to be close to him, and his position on the screen increased day by day. Among the French male actors working in Hollywood, apart from Hiver, who was very popular seven or eight years ago, it is now Charles's turn.

There, although he can get a large weekly salary, after paying income tax and daily expenses, there is not much left. Once he said: "If I work in another place - of course, excluding Hollywood - I can definitely save more money than now, but I love Hollywood. Hollywood can make me happy. Hollywood can give me many, many life experiences, so I would rather live here and earn less money."

He and Pat Paterson have not been married for long, and Pat is also a film actor, so their private life is very fulfilling. He is very responsible and extremely serious at work. His success today is by no means accidental. He is most afraid of attending gatherings and interviews with reporters. He feels that these two things are what he fears most.

Last year, after he and Irene Dunne completed "Together Again," he once returned to his country to participate in the war. Now he has returned to Hollywood and co-starred with Bette Davis in "All This, and Heaven Too." His past famous works include "The Garden of Allah" with Marlene Dietrich, "Conquest" with Greta Garbo, and "White Cargo" with Hedy Lamarr, and so on. Charles's acting skills can be said to have reached the point of perfection, delicate and clear, so that the audience can go home satisfied.

Dear readers, let's do our own statistics. How many days apart do we watch a movie?

Confucius Film Character Examination (4)
Amano Drawing Qingniao Writing

The wise sage Duanmu Ci, styled Zigong, was from Wei. He was naturally intelligent, excelled at managing finances, and was skilled in rhetoric. He served in various states, rising to the position of minister. He died after Confucius. The Grand Historian Sima Qian recorded Zigong in the Biographies of Money-Makers in the "Historical Records" to highlight his achievements.

Duke Ling was昏庸, more fond of beauty than virtue. His wife, Nanzi, had an affair with a son of Song. Duke Ling also favored Mi Zixia. The palace was filthy and the moral principles were lost. Crown Prince Kuai Kui, indignant, left the country. When Duke Ling died, the minister Kong Kui supported Gongsun Li. Kuai Kui, with the military force of Zhao Yang from the Jin state, and using the treacherous plans of the Lu traitor Yang Huo, returned to the country and seized the throne. In this battle, Zilu and his comrades fought to the death.

New Plays Emerging Endlessly
Shuimo

In order to break the script shortage, the Drama Society invited playwrights from all over the country to write scripts for the fourth long-term performance season. And they have been successively sent from afar. Zhu Duanjun completed a comedy "The Liar," the content of which is extremely satirical. Zuo Lin, a drama expert who studied in England, wrote "Three People and a Horse" in his residence. Xia Yan's "City of Sorrow" has already sent the draft of the two acts from Guilin to Shanghai. This is also a script based on Shanghai. Audiences who have seen his "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" must know his vivid portrayal of Shanghai life. Chen Baichen's "Men and Women in Troubled Times," Hong Shen's "Five Kui Bridge," and Li Jianwu's "The Lying Family" will all be performed in a short period of time. Since writing "Ge Nenniang" for the Shanghai Drama Society, Wei Ruhui has now agreed to write "A Sequel to Water Margin." It is said that he will start writing "A Sequel to Water Margin" after completing "Hero of the Seas." When it is performed in the future, Wu Yonggang may still serve as the director. And Yu Ling's "The Biography of the Heroes of the Ming Dynasty" has been scheduled to be performed on National Day. The "Tears of Flowers," which is currently being prepared for performance, is the only work about the lives of dancers. Golden Star Film Company has listed it as its fourth production. After "Tears of Flowers" may come Shi Huafu's "Professional Women." These days, the Drama Society is dividing into groups to rehearse new plays.

Radio Tidbits
Choucheng

The Shanghai Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center, in order to fund the expenses of the Volunteer Primary and Secondary School in District 41, took advantage of the suspension of broadcasting by various radio stations on September 18th to hold a radio propaganda fundraising conference on six major radio stations, inviting famous artists from all over the city to voluntarily broadcast comic skits, Shanghai opera, Suzhou storytelling, Pinghua storytelling, Ningbo opera, stories, dramas and other programs. At eleven o'clock, I went to the Guohua Radio Station. Xie Letian and Xie Yaotian were singing the opening of Fang Qing Seeing Mother, vividly describing the state of sorrow and joy of the long-separated mother and son. Shortly after, He Yunfang came, wearing a fine floral green-trimmed cheongsam, a white flannel short coat, and her hair shining like a mirror, with bangs in front and two braids hanging down behind her head, smiling kindly. I hadn't seen her for a long time, and she was a little thinner than before. She sang Jia Baoyu Visiting Xiaoxiang Pavilion, singing to the line "Alone to Tongxiang Pavilion," saying that today her elder brother and younger sister are both traveling far away, so her army has come here alone. Later, Wang Boyin came to help her sing the opening of Du Shiniang, and then she sang Palace Complaint, depicting the concubine's resentment towards Emperor Ming, just right. Ling Youxiang told the story of Jin Tai Zhuan, Yang Xiaoqiao and Jin Tai becoming sworn brothers, and extending medicine to treat him, with a loyal and righteous spirit, speaking vividly. Zhang Jianting and Zhang Jianbang first sang the opening of Runyu Society Road, which was sung by someone who donated money, and then sang Youlong Zhuan. The section of Mo Naihe saving the emperor was also quite laborious. Li Zhongkang sang the section of Yang Naiwu's sister Shuying going to prison to visit Little Cabbage, both singing and speaking were excellent. Zhu Yaoliang told the story of the Peng Gong Case, the section of Peng Qincha being captured, the anxious situation of his subordinates, every word was powerful and meticulous. Because he left early, he did not hear what Lu Fengxiang and his son and Shen Huitang and others sang.

### Major Bombing Raids by the British Air Force – German Troops Occupy Ports – Large Fire in the Canut Basin – Heavy Assault on Gun Positions at Cap Gris-Nez

London - The Air Ministry's intelligence reports that the pressure exerted by the British Air Force on the German forces entrenched along the English Channel coast is intensifying. The number of bombers dispatched on Tuesday night was unprecedented, continuing a fierce offensive to thwart the German invasion plans of England. Consequently, the German potential "invasion vanguard," namely the French, Belgian, and Dutch coasts, ships, docks, ports, and gun positions, which have been under attack for two weeks, suffered another terrible assault. Other British bombers flew to the northeastern flank of the enemy's positions, stepping up the destruction of vital railway lines and junctions along Germany's western border. Following the attack on Calais, a fire, approximately a quarter of a mile long, broke out on the western side of the Canut basin. The railway lines on the eastern side of the basin and a corner of another basin were also ablaze. Subsequently, the Canut basin was hit by another wave of bombs, resulting in over sixty explosions. The tidal gate was struck, causing a deafening blast, and bombs also exploded near the gate. Under the bright moonlight, British aircraft precisely identified the large gun positions near Cap Gris-Nez, launching a fierce attack. The bombs landed and exploded within the target area. Dunkirk was also attacked, with buildings next to the docks hit, sending debris flying high. The docks and piers were also repeatedly struck. There was another major attack on Boulogne. A group of British aircraft arriving after midnight bombed with claimed success. Ships were hit and caught fire, the flames visible twenty miles offshore. The attack on Boulogne by the British Air Force appears to be the most intense yet. Shortly after 8 p.m., British aircraft arrived over Boulogne, dropping bombs amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. The anti-aircraft fire flashed, and searchlights swept across the sky. Soon, the French coast was ablaze for miles. At 3 a.m., British aircraft heavily attacked Zeebrugge, hitting dock basins, ports, and five cargo ships. In addition, approximately thirty coasters inside and outside the ports of Ostend and major docks were bombed. A large number of ships gathered northeast of Flushing were all bombed, resulting in continuous explosions and large fires. After a heavy bombing of Antwerp, flames soared from the wharves. Ships and a riverside dock in Schilde were repeatedly hit by large bombs. A British bomber dropped six bombs, hitting ships moored in front of a pier. Hamburg was bombed at dawn, causing fires in the docks. Moreover, German airfields and railways were also heavily bombed. (Reuters, 19th)

### Rumor of a Secret Military Pact Between Greece and Turkey – Turkey Will Be Forced to Intervene If Thrace Is Attacked

Rome - "Il Popolo di Roma" reported this morning, citing a correspondent from Istanbul, that a secret Turkish-Greek treaty stipulates that if the Greek Thrace (east of the Nestos River) is attacked, Turkey will be forced to join the war. Turkish President İsmet is prepared to have Turkey enter the war if Greece or Turkey is attacked without cause.

### England and Spain Conclude Gasoline Agreement

London - The British and Spanish governments have recently reached an agreement regarding the quantity of gasoline imported into Spain. Official circles believe that this agreement is satisfactory to both parties. Yesterday, the British side announced measures to tighten the blockade. The blacklist will contain the names of ships that are not allowed to enjoy facilities or obtain naval permits in British ports. All ships that have violated the blockade regulations and those suspected of doing so will be listed in this blacklist, so that neutral merchants and exporters can choose accordingly.
