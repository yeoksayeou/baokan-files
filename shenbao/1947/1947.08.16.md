Attendees included Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, and Xu Fulin, totaling sixteen individuals. The meeting began with reports on the agenda, including the method of organizing a business delegation to Japan. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Defense Minister Bai Chongxi reported on recent diplomatic and military situations, respectively. The meeting then discussed the following proposals: (1) Adjustment of salaries for civil and military officials and additional payment of price difference subsidies in kind to public education personnel in Beiping and Tianjin. A resolution was passed. (2) Adjustment of salt tax measures. A resolution was passed, approving immediate implementation, while still submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for legislative procedures.

(4) Outline of measures to strictly implement consumption savings. A resolution was passed. (5) Compilation and examination methods for the general budget of provincial and municipal governments for the 37th year. A resolution was passed. (6) Several other financial budget proposals were also passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:45 PM.

[Another Telegram] The adjustment of salaries for civil and military officials has been approved by the ninth State Council meeting and will be implemented from August. The main points of this adjustment are as follows: (1) The original zoning method will be maintained. The original five zones were reduced to four to reduce the disparity in treatment between regions, and each region was re-established based on the price fluctuation index of each region in July, so as to be in line with reality. (2) The base number is increased by 100,000 yuan, and the multiplier remains the same. The base number in the first district is 400,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,800. The base number in the second district is 390,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,600. The base number in the third district is 340,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,300. The base number in the fourth district is 300,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,000. (3) The distribution of essential supplies to public education employees in Nanjing and Shanghai will continue. It was decided to extend the distribution method to Beiping and Tianjin, where there is a shortage of food. Before implementation, the price difference in kind will be distributed from August. The standard for Nanjing in June and July will be used, set at 200,000 yuan per month for each staff member, half for public servants, and 50,000 yuan per month for police officers who already have food and clothing allowances. (4) The treatment of military officers will be adjusted in accordance with the corresponding ranks of civil servants (because their grading is less than that of civil servants below the rank of lieutenant general, the middle level salary of their equivalent rank in civil service will be the standard). (5) The personnel of state-owned enterprises shall be treated in accordance with the Measures for the Treatment of Personnel of State-Owned Enterprises approved by the former Supreme National Defense Council.

[Another Telegram] The contents of the salt tax adjustment plan passed by the State Council are as follows: The salt tax rate is increased to 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), the local gum salt tax rate is increased to 80,000 yuan per dan, the fishing and agricultural salt tax rate is increased to 5,000 yuan per dan, and industrial salt remains tax-free.

### President Zhang Discusses Adjustment Features: Principle of Not Worrying About Scarcity But About Inequality; All Public Officials Treated Equally

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The adjustment of the salaries of civil and military personnel was passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan made the following remarks to a Central News Agency reporter:

The government's adjustment of the treatment of civil and military officials and personnel of state-owned enterprises is based on the principle of not worrying about scarcity but about inequality. On the one hand, it takes into account the difficult lives of civil and military officials, and on the other hand, it considers the heavy burden on the national treasury. After a long period of research, the first feature of this method is that, for the treatment of military personnel, which has always been far inferior to that of civil servants, fair adjustments have been proposed repeatedly for 20 years, but have not been realized. Now, regardless of various difficulties, the treatment of civil and military personnel is finally brought into line.

The second feature of this method is that for the treatment of state-owned enterprise personnel, which has always been far superior to that of civil servants, reductions within the prescribed limits have been proposed repeatedly for several years. As a result, not only has it not been reduced, but it has become more serious and has been increased. Now, regardless of various difficulties, the treatment of state-owned enterprises has been reduced to within the original preferential limit. The official salaries of civil and military officials are different, and their treatment was originally difficult to be consistent. This time, in order to specially increase the treatment of military personnel, the military personnel were classified according to their special, simplified, recommended, and entrusted grades, and compared with the official salaries of the special, simplified, surviving, and entrusted grades of civil weaves. However, civil servants do not have the supply of staple and non-staple foods and family rations, while military personnel do. In order to achieve consistency between civil and military personnel, this staple and non-staple food expenses should be removed from the adjusted treatment of military personnel, and family rations should be canceled. After this adjustment, the actual treatment received by military officers has increased by an average of one time compared with the past. As for soldiers, in addition to the increase in non-staple food expenses to 60,000 yuan per person per month, the pay they should receive has been increased in accordance with the end of the budget. Sergeants have increased to 10,000 times, corporals 12,000 times, and privates 15,000 times. The lower the base number, the greater the increase. After this adjustment, the salary of privates is exactly equal to double the number before the adjustment. In total, due to the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel, the combined salary increase for military officers and soldiers is 230.8 billion yuan per month, which is a very large amount.

### Adjustment Number in August: Universal Increase of 100,000 Per Person

Since the government is determined to achieve the goal of consistent treatment for civil and military personnel, the increase in the burden on the national treasury is extremely large. There is no remaining capacity for the adjustment of the treatment of civil servants in August. In addition, since the treatment of civil and military personnel is consistent, if there is any adjustment in the treatment of civil servants in the future, military personnel will have to make the same adjustment. Therefore, the adjustment in August is even more difficult. However, in view of the suffering of civil servants and the considerable increase in prices in recent months, if this adjustment is not made, civil servants, especially those with lower salaries, will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. After repeated consideration, only the basic number obtained by each person has been adjusted. Each district has increased by 100,000 yuan per month. This number may seem small, but for the current women's military and provincial personnel, this item alone has increased the monthly expenditure of the national treasury by no less than 135.6 billion yuan (82 billion yuan for the central speed provincial level and 53.6 billion yuan for the military).

In addition, two more measures have been taken in connection with this: First, the treatment of civil servants has been divided into five districts according to the level of the cost of living, and the difference is large. This time, it has been changed to four districts, and the new adjustment and compilation have been made according to the cost of living in various places. Those who have been promoted to the fourth district due to the cancellation of the original fifth district, or who have been promoted to the third, second, and first districts from the original fourth, third, and second districts, in addition to the universal increase of 100,000 yuan per person in the base number, the original base number and the salary increase multiplier can also be recursively promoted due to the recursive promotion of the district.

### Embassy of the Union of India: Flag Raising Ceremony Held; Chinese and Foreign Guests Gladly Congratulate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 15th is the day of the rebirth of India. The Embassy of India on Beiping Road was crowded with cars and horses, and guests came one after another, presenting an unprecedented joyful scene. The flag of the Union of India, a red, white, and green tricolor with a spinning wheel in the center, rose slowly and fluttered in the air to the sound of the passionate and devout Indian national anthem, representing the ancient civilization of India, which finally freed itself from two centuries of servitude and gained precious independence. Before 9:00 AM, about 200 of our government leaders and foreign envoys in Beijing came one after another to congratulate and participate in the flag raising ceremony. The ceremony began at 8:00 AM. Ambassador Menon first read Chairman Chiang's eulogy, and then gave a speech, stating that the moment of this flag raising is the most meaningful moment in Indian history, or even in Asian and world history. From today onwards, India has regained its place on the international stage as an independent country. The Ambassador expressed his deep gratitude to those who have expressed sympathy or provided assistance in the arduous process of India's struggle for independence, and especially expressed his gratitude to China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom for their lasting friendship. After the speech, the flag was raised in a salute with all standing and watching. Subsequently, our Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered congratulatory speeches one after another, both of whom recalled the cultural and friendly exchanges between China and India over the past two thousand years, and mentioned Chairman Chiang's appeal to the Indian people when he defended India in February 1942, which expressed his expectations for Indian independence. The two also emphasized that China and India, two great brotherly nations, will join hands and make important contributions to world peace and human happiness. After the chief diplomatic envoy stationed in Beijing, the Brazilian Ambassador You Lan, delivered a congratulatory speech, the guests and hosts happily shared champagne, and the ceremony was completed. Also, Nehru has sent a mine telegram to thank Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang for their congratulations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] "Green represents the flourishing earth, white represents the bright day, red represents countless sacrifices, and the center is a spinning wheel. You remember Mr. Gandhi's spinning flower army, which represents abundance." Mrs. Menon, the Ambassador with a touch of rouge on her forehead and wearing gorgeous and beautiful clothes, explained the meaning of this beautiful flag in an excited tone. "I am so happy today." The diamond jewelry on the left nostril made her smile even brighter. India's independence came from countless sacrifices. After several kidney transplant gentlemen laughed, they talked about Gandhi's billion-dollar character, Nehru's shrewdness and competence, and the blood and sweat of all the Indian people, which overcame all difficulties and determined India's destiny. It was so in the past. It will also depend entirely on this in the future. Mr. Yu Youren twisted his silver beard, "This is also our long-cherished wish." Mr. Wen Yuanning and Mr. Zhang Daofan, etc., all praised the British people's open-mindedness and the Indian people's determination. "This is the most glorious achievement in the world today. There should be no more things that cannot be properly solved." The small lawn on the right side of the office hall of the Indian Embassy was full of people, laughter, and flying wine glasses. This was a joyful morning. Everyone was delighted with the independence that countless sacrifices had brought. China's brotherly nation had gained freedom and new life. Gandhi's spinning wheel represents abundance and will also return to Sakyamuni's Pure Land. But what about China itself? President Zhang Qun said in his welcome speech, expressing his feelings, "We believe that in the world, all actions that originate from aggressive motives, one party gains something, and the other party will lose something. On the contrary, all actions that originate from justice, the giver and the receiver get the same..." After celebrating for the brotherly nation, his "sympathy" is not superfluous.

### Zhang Zhizhong's New Speech: Warning to Yi People; Government Determined to Maintain Integrity of Entire Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 14th] Zhang Zhizhong indirectly warned the Yi people at the ceremony for Ma Liang to be appointed as the Xinjiang Supervisory Envoy, saying: "The central government has handed over all rights to the people of Xinjiang, but it must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty. The government must not abandon this land and all the people of Xinjiang. If anyone wants to destroy this principle and lead Xinjiang on another path, it is absolutely impossible, and it will never be possible. The result will be to push all the people of Xinjiang onto the path of destruction." He stated, "During my year in Xinjiang, the peaceful policy I have implemented shows the central government's true attitude towards Xinjiang, and what all the people of Xinjiang desire today is peaceful construction, not a warlike attitude. The recent organized riots in Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun are an explanation of this. This kind of anti-peace thought must not be the thought of the people of Xinjiang, nor the thought of the Chinese people." According to reports, since the Yi people refused to recognize Mexut as the new provincial chairman on May 28, Yi personnel have been gradually withdrawing from Dihua. On the morning of the 12th, Aximaiti Wang (Deputy Provincial Chairman) returned to Yili by plane, and the unification of Xinjiang has become a serious problem.

"The British Parliament sent a delegation to China during the war, leaving behind extremely pleasant memories.

The friendly relations between China and Britain have naturally been strengthened. This time, the British Parliament has sent another delegation to China after the victory of the joint war, and the results can be expected to be more pleasant and satisfactory. Moreover, China and Britain, especially China, have suffered significant losses due to the war, and both economies are facing difficulties. I believe that this will further promote mutual sympathy, understanding, and cooperation."

### Northeast Commemorates the Second Anniversary of Restoration; Chief of General Staff Chen Inspects Changchun; No Bandit Traces Within 100 Li of Jilin City

[Our Changchun Correspondent, 15th] Chairman Liang Huasheng told our reporter that the future of the Northeast war situation is optimistic. The National Army's deployment is largely in place, and we will launch a counterattack without waiting for the sixth offensive by the Communist bandits. Guerrilla warfare is active in eastern Jilin, with commando teams striking the enemy everywhere, causing panic in the enemy's rear. The Communist bandits suspect even farmers tilling the land are commandos, which shows their fear. Two months ago, bandit traces could be found within 15-25 li of Jilin City, but now there are no Communist bandits within 100 li. The National Army is advancing towards northern and eastern Jilin. Jilin is no longer a fortress we are guarding, but a forward command post.

However, today, two years later, the citizens have suffered greatly from the Communist bandits' rebellion and can only reminisce about the excitement of two years ago. Today, the Youth Corps mobilized to give street speeches, and radio stations broadcast special programs to commemorate the restoration.

When asked about Wedemeyer's mission to the Northeast, he said: "To collect general relevant information. Our government will provide some strong evidence of Soviet aid to the Communist bandits." A reporter asked when the Communist bandits might launch their sixth offensive. He replied: "I judge that after the new rainy season, at the time of the autumn harvest, the Communist bandits may launch a large disturbance for the purpose of seizing grain."

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Training Commander Sun Liren told reporters on the 14th: "Since taking office, newspapers in various places have been reporting news related to me, but much of this news is untrue.

Regarding my impressions, Sun said with a solemn expression: "The social order and social morality in various places are declining. We should deeply consider the difficulties faced by the country and the nation, stay in our posts, and rectify this trend."

### Employers Reject Ultimatum; General Strike Breaks Out in Hong Kong; Authorities Took Strict Precautions Yesterday

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] The Chinese Machine Workers' Union ordered its members to strike immediately tonight. 356 workers on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were the first to obey the order and strike. There has been no movement at the Royal Navy Dockyard as of press time.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] The ultimatum issued by the Chinese Labour Association was rejected by employers at 4 PM today. At 5 PM (the deadline of the ultimatum), the union ordered its workers to strike tomorrow morning. However, this general strike will not be as serious and widespread as previously anticipated. It is understood that traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will not be affected. Public services such as water, trams, electricity, and telephones will continue as normal. Shipyards will be the hardest hit. The Hong Kong government stated this afternoon that the authorities are well-prepared to deal with any actions taken by the Chinese Labour Association and will maintain all conveniences for the general public.

On the one hand, they are preparing to send technical troops to take over various public utilities such as electricity and water, in order to maintain daily supplies.

### Trial Begins for the Zhonghe Bridge Tragedy in Nanjing; Ten Witnesses Interrogated Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Case Gaining Clarity, Trial to Continue Today

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The trial for the case of the drowning death of a Chinese Air Force soldier by American soldiers at Zhonghe Bridge in the capital began this morning at the Lizhi Society by a US military court. It was originally set for both Savini and Adoree to be tried at the same time, but at the request of the defendant's lawyer, Weiss, Adoree was tried first. A total of ten Chinese and foreign witnesses were interrogated in the morning and afternoon. The case has gained some clarity, and the interrogation will continue on the 16th.

No Empty Seats in the Gallery

Today's trial of American soldiers is the first of its kind in the capital since the end of the war. Chinese and foreign people are paying close attention, and many went to attend the hearing, with no empty seats in the gallery. Dong Lin, Director of the Department of Americas of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ni Huiqing, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, Chen Guangchu, Chief Prosecutor of the Capital District Court, and others attended the hearing. At about 8:00 AM, the presiding judge, Colonel Moore, judges Gray and Gan Tai, and others entered the courtroom decorated with the Stars and Stripes one after another. The family members of the victim Ge Fatian, including his mother, Mrs. Wang, his uncle Ge Youji, and the parents of Wang Shouben, Wang Guohua and Mrs. Wang Li, sat in the audience, wiping their tears from time to time and talking to the witnesses about the tragedy. Soon, the defendants Adoree and Savini were escorted in, and the trial officially began at 8:30 AM.

Prosecutor States the Case

After completing the oath and other procedures, the defendant's lawyer, Weiss, requested that Judge Mathis recuse himself and be replaced by another judge, maintaining the number of nine judges. Prosecutor Gan Tai read out the charges, and the lawyer moved to have Adoree tried first. The court temporarily closed to consider the matter and decided to grant the request. Savini withdrew, and Adoree was interrogated first. The prosecutor, Chen, first presented the case, explaining how Adoree intentionally and illegally pushed Wang Shouben and Ge Fatian into the water to drown them. Then, the testimony of the witnesses was heard. The first witness was Captain Delan, the defendant's superior, who answered questions about the arrest of the defendant. The second witness was the head of the US Army Criminal Investigation Division, who reported on the inspection of the incident site. Photographer Tom Mays also testified, reporting on the on-site photography process. Xu Pite explained the detailed drawing of the Zhonghe Bridge. Finally, a pair of experienced navigators explained the speed, depth, and flow of the water at Zhonghe Bridge. When the above five people testified, the prosecutor presented photos and maps, questioning them in great detail. The defendant's lawyer also raised questions, showing great care and attention.

At 11:15 AM, after a five-minute break, Cheng Chaozong, a Chinese military policeman who was familiar with Adoree, was scheduled to testify. Cheng pointed out Adoree as the perpetrator on the spot and answered in detail about the situation of Adoree and others driving into the airfield that night. The prosecutor repeatedly cross-examined him and repeatedly told him to tell the truth. He answered truthfully, replying "What do you do for a living?" and loudly said "I am a military policeman of the Republic of China," leaving a very good impression.

Witnesses Struggle to Cope

The next witness was Tu Chonghai, an Air Force mechanic who witnessed the American soldiers throwing Wang Shouben into the water. He was also almost thrown into the river by the American soldiers at the time, making him one of the most important witnesses in the case. Due to the differences in legal customs between China and foreign countries, coupled with the fact that Tu seemed to have a lower level of education, there was a long debate between the two sides over procedural issues before he was formally questioned. Tu reported in detail the situation of Wang and Ge being thrown into the river at that time. The prosecutor also asked him to point out the location of the incident on a map, which he did on the spot. However, the defendant's lawyer still nitpicked in various ways, making sophistical arguments, making Tu Chonghai, who had limited knowledge and did not understand Western grammar, struggle to cope. The court recessed again at about 12:00 PM.

At about 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Tu Chonghai was interrogated again. The lawyer questioned Tu in great detail about whether he knew Wang Shouben, how he knew that the deceased was Wang, and how he knew that Adoree was the one who pushed Wang into the water. Using a pencil as an example, he repeatedly cross-examined Tu. He also questioned in detail whether Tu witnessed Wang being pushed into the water. Although Tu answered to the best of his knowledge, the lawyer stated that there were discrepancies in Tu's previous and subsequent answers, stating that he could not obtain from Tu's testimony whether Wang was thrown, pushed, or voluntarily jumped into the water. He also expressed doubts about other points. Tu is one of the most important witnesses in the case, so he was questioned for more than an hour.

Testimony of American Soldiers in the Same Car

Next, Hult, an American soldier who traveled with Adoree, was interrogated. Hult testified that Adoree had lifted up a Chinese person sitting on the Zhonghe Bridge and thrown him into the river when he came to the club that night. At that time, only one person got out of the jeep, and he explained that when he lifted the person up, one of the Chinese person's hands was bent behind his back, and the other hand was also twisted. At that time, he did not resist. Another Chinese person then fled. Another American soldier, Parker, also testified that Adoree pushed a Chinese person into the water, but said that he could not remember what they had said to each other at that time.

Finally, Lane, the American military policeman on duty that night, was questioned. He had received a call from Adoree that night. He could tell from the phone that Adoree was drunk. He told the court that before he came to answer the phone, he had spoken to Adoree at the airfield. Adoree was already drunk at that time, walking unsteadily, and had pushed the witness's shoulder with his hand. The questioning ended at 4:15 PM in the afternoon. Due to the lateness of the hour, the trial was adjourned until the morning of the 16th.

Generally speaking, today's trial was satisfactory. The meticulousness of the American legal procedure and the various cross-examinations by the prosecutor and lawyer were admirable. However, when questioning Chinese witnesses, Western customs were forcibly imposed, and the judges lacked a general understanding of Chinese customs, which may affect the progress of the trial and future judgments. This seems to be a regrettable matter.

### Tang Zong Hosts the Press to Tour the Criminal Laboratory

Police Observe the Anniversary of the Establishment of the German Law Firm

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The National Police Agency of the Ministry of Interior was established on August 15th last year, and today marks its first anniversary. Director Tang Zong presented the actual work of the agency as a celebration. He held a reception from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM to invite the judiciary and the press to visit the only criminal laboratory in the country. The equipment of the laboratory was received from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. It is divided into ten groups: physics and chemistry, fingerprint, photography, forensics, technology, forensic instruments, ballistics, supply, police dogs, and police pigeons. There were also on-site demonstrations during the tour. The rarest piece of equipment is the surveillance aircraft. It is said that there are only two such aircraft in the world, one in the United States and one in this laboratory. The balance in the physics and chemistry group has an accuracy of one ten-thousandth, and even the weight of a single hair can be accurately measured. The police dog's performance in searching for criminals, tracking, and rescuing police officers was the most satisfying for the visitors. During the tour, Tang Zong and senior officials of the laboratory accompanied the visitors and explained the work of each group, giving the listeners a thorough understanding.

### Continuous Rain in Northeast; Rivers Flooding Again

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] In various parts of the Northeast, there has been continuous rain in recent days, causing flash floods. The water level of each river has risen sharply. The Taizi River rose more than six meters in one day and night from the 12th to the 13th. The Haijian disaster area, which had already dried up, has once again become a swamp.

### Only Rumors About the Change of System in Qiongyai; Island Residents Eagerly Await a Decision

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 13th] (Delayed) Rumors about the change of system in Hainan Island have been circulating for three months, but the central government has not made a decision. During this reporter's inspection of Hainan Island, I stayed in Haikou for three days. Based on the impressions gained from the tour, I deeply feel that government personnel at all levels are in a wait-and-see state of mind, and the administrative work has almost come to a standstill. Administrative Commissioner Cai Jingjun is responsible for directing the suppression of bandits in Qionghai and is eager to govern well. The people also have the same sense of depression, believing that the island is a major resource of our country and urgently needs the cooperation of the government and the people to build and develop it. They eagerly hope that the central government will make a decision as soon as possible.

[Another Dispatch] The reporter returned from Qiongyai yesterday and met with Director Zhang Fakui of the Executive Committee. I asked him when he would go to Hainan Island and for his opinion on the change of system in Hainan Island. Zhang said: "I know nothing except what I read in the newspapers!" He jokingly told the reporter that if there was an appointment, please send it to the general receiving room first. Zhang was very interested in Taiwan, praising the various aspects of the area, and said that he had a very pleasant trip. He believes that the banditry in Guangdong Province is serious, but also not serious. He advocates nine parts politics and one part military, and that the people's armed forces should be organized and the basic-level cadres should be strengthened. He said that because there are no communists in Guangdong Province, only bandits who rob, loot, and extort, the situation is very different from that in the north.

### Editorial: Looking Forward to the Future of Scholarship in Our Nation

Mr. Yan Jici, Director of the Institute of Physics at the Peiping Research Academy, recently told the press: "Our nation's research into atomic energy has just begun. In Peiping, colleagues at the institute are concentrating all their efforts on this one topic... Researcher Qian Sanqiang discovered a new method of nuclear fission in France, which was highly praised by authorities in physics such as Joliot-Curie. The institute is hesitant to urge him to return, as our research equipment is not as complete as that of European research institutes." Why is it "hesitant" to urge research personnel to return home? This illustrates that academic researchers may lose their research tools and venues once they return to China.

A dispatch from our reporter stationed in Peiping reports the crisis in education in the old capital, saying: "Today, when discussing education, everyone is almost too busy to consider systems, teachers, and equipment. The only remaining daily concern for teachers and students is the problem of survival." In fact, this is not only the case in Peiping, but it has become a common phenomenon throughout the country.

Everyone knows that scholarship is the cornerstone of nation-building. Without scholarship, the country cannot be ranked among the powerful nations. However, the construction of scholarship takes the most time. Without research tools and the long-term efforts of scholars, it is difficult to achieve anything. Countries such as England, America, and the Soviet Union compete not only in military preparations but also in academic research. Therefore, education and academic research in all countries have been progressing every day since the war. And the budgets that countries spend in this area are also extremely large. However, what is the situation of academic research in our country after the war? Just looking at the two news reports above is enough to make people worry.

Compared with countries such as England, America, France, and the Soviet Union, our nation's research institutes are very immature. The Academia Sinica, which is relatively large in scale, has not yet recovered its original vitality due to war and relocation in recent years. As for the research institutes of various universities, their content is mostly empty. Scientific research is originally an accumulation of bit by bit and cannot be expected to succeed overnight, and it cannot be like an industrial and commercial investment, hoping to obtain profits within a certain period of time. Therefore, in today's society, which is eager for quick success and instant benefits, academic research is neglected or despised by the general public. The lives of practitioners are precarious. Like most public educators, they are struggling on the brink of starvation. Their seedlings lack the nourishment of rain and dew and are constantly exposed to the scorching sun of midsummer. It would be a great blessing if they do not wither and die.

The vast majority of academic research workers are professors in universities. It is truly pathetic to say that professors are now about to become beggars; many people have already "changed careers" to make a living. Loyal and pious workers have long been overwhelmed by the seven basic necessities of life. Many people have lost their health due to malnutrition and heavy workload. A well-known scholar who has taught for more than 30 years and is a professor appointed by the ministry could at least "live without worry" abroad, but unfortunately, in today's China, he still has to help his wife with household chores. Even a female worker cannot be hired. A professor who has taught for more than 20 years once arrived late for an academic lecture and stood up to apologize, saying: "My wife gave birth a few days ago, and I have to do everything at home because I am also working as a female worker, so I am late. I am very sorry!" The treatment of senior university professors is equivalent to that of civil officials in the simplified appointment and military officers, but their lives are so difficult. How can they have a peaceful state of mind to talk about scholarship? Some people in society blame professors for not guiding students to study knowledge properly, which is really unfair! In this situation, the works are naturally very mediocre, and even if there are specialized academic papers, few people buy them. Bookshops, considering the "cost," also find it difficult to publish them. Therefore, there are few books with relatively academic weight in today's publishing industry! The Ministry of Education announced that the first prize for academic works and inventions of the Academic Review Committee for the 34th year is 800,000 yuan, the second prize is 400,000 yuan, and the third prize is 200,000 yuan. The first prize cannot buy a set of old suits now, the second prize cannot buy a pair of better leather shoes, and the third prize cannot buy two or five pounds of milk powder. Chinese scholarship is so worthless! For the sake of life, professors have to take time out from studying knowledge to go to the streets to buy vegetables and argue with small merchants and peddlers, or hold their children at home to save expenses. The time for research is completely deprived. In this situation, professors in Beijing and Shanghai may be able to manage, and the situation is better, but professors in the inland provinces are used to it.

It has already been mentioned above that academic research requires a long time, because equipment and talents cannot be achieved in a short time. His work is like "water nourishing stone." Researchers and professors are leaders. They must cultivate themselves while also cultivating many outstanding university students to be successors. But what is the situation of today's university students? To be frank, the level of today's university students and their interest in studying knowledge are both lower than before the war! This cannot be entirely blamed on young people. In fact, there are too few professors leading research, not to mention the lack of tools and the problem of livelihood. Therefore, most young people are full of worries and depression. Being able to flip through textbooks and copy notebooks is considered a hardworking student. However, some people in society who only know a few words, scheming and scheming, or who can remember accounts and run businesses are "high officials and powerful horses" or "rich and well-fed." Institutions rarely use talent as the main criterion for employing people. "Selecting the virtuous and entrusting the capable" is just a plaque hanging in the Examination Yuan. The general social situation is like this. Young people are sensitive, easily influenced, and imitative. They understand today's society. How many people are willing to pay attention to scholarship and be able to "stand out from the crowd" without being eroded by the evil forces of society? This is truly a great hidden worry for the future of scholarship.

The emptiness of academic research institutions is such that scientists working abroad have difficulty working once they return home, and research personnel suffer on the brink of starvation. If this continues, when will we be able to catch up with the scientific research of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union? Thinking about the future of scholarship in our nation really makes people worry and sleepless nights!

Soviet representative Gromyko claimed that the Soviet Union would reject any plan to monitor the Balkan border.

The United Nations has scheduled to convene a conference on September 16, so it is time for the Allied nations to put forward this explosive Balkan question for discussion.

I have fully understood the truth of the entire case and believe that both the police and military police should bear considerable responsibility.

### Action Headquarters Invites the Supervisory Office and District Prosecutor's Office to Thoroughly Investigate Suspected Corruption Cases; Director Huo to Release Truth of Facts Today

[Our Report] After the news of accusations against six senior officials of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) was revealed, the spokesperson of CNRRA told our reporter last night, "CNRRA has formally invited the Supervisory Yuan and the District Prosecutor's Office to send people to thoroughly investigate and clarify the truth." Director Huo Baoshu originally intended to release a written report titled "Truth of Facts" at 6:00 PM yesterday, but due to the urgency of time and lack of preparation, it was postponed to today. Director Huo released a written statement yesterday, the full text of which is as follows: "The work of CNRRA has nothing that cannot be made public. Regarding the handling of money and materials, in addition to the accounting personnel dispatched by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government stationed at the office to handle all accounts, the allocation, transportation, sale, and management of materials are all handled in consultation with UNRRA according to the treaty, and foreign staff participate in the actual work of various departments of this office. Because all business is conducted under the constraints of the treaty and government regulations, I dare to take full responsibility for the affairs of the entire office. After the irresponsible secret reports in the newspapers were published, the senior officials who were falsely accused have requested a thorough investigation from me. The investigation procedure is currently underway, and this office welcomes relevant supervisory agencies to come to the office for investigation to make all facts public. I personally believe that it is not easy to serve the public in a situation of confusion between right and wrong. Especially at the time when CNRRA is about to end, it is extremely difficult to maintain the continued work of loyal and outstanding cadres. I hope that the law and public opinion will provide guarantees and sympathy for public officials who serve loyally. As for irresponsible anonymous accusations, if the facts prove that they are malicious slander, this office has the right to prosecute."

Deputy Director Li Zhuomin told reporters from various newspapers: all accusations against him personally are unfounded. Not long ago, the Control Yuan investigated the "extravagant and wasteful" aspect of his residence and found it to be inaccurate. His residence is indeed very spacious, but it was allocated by the Enemy Property Administration and shared with the former director Jiang Tingfu. In the past, he personally approved that no senior official should borrow any materials transported by UNRRA, and this principle is still being followed. However, he believes that the current accusations are not without cause, so he will thoroughly investigate the clues disclosed by the accusers step by step.

The reporter also met with CNRRA spokesperson Bao Guangzhao yesterday, who said: "The sale of electric fans was handled in conjunction with UNRRA personnel. If there is any wrongdoing, Washington will disclose it first. This matter was investigated by the Supervisory Yuan two weeks ago and found to be inaccurate. The General Affairs Department has more than three cars, but they are official cars for colleagues to use for official business. Li Zhuomin's residence was formerly the official residence of Director Jiang. Director Huo did not move in after taking office. When the directors of various branch offices come to Shanghai, they also stay here, which is no different from a guest house. The two Min boxes originally belonged to the official residence of Wang Ni, so today they are still national property, and it is reasonable to take them back for use. CNRRA has formally invited the Supervisory Office and the District Prosecutor's Office to send people to thoroughly investigate this case today to clarify the truth."

### Inspector Yan Attaches Importance to Secret Reports

[Our Report] The case of corruption secretly reported to the Supervisory Office and the District Prosecutor's Office against CNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and six others has received great attention from all parties since it was published in the newspapers. Yesterday, Inspector Yan told reporters: The Supervisory Office never accepts anonymous secret reports. The informant in this case left a real name and detailed address, so this office attaches great importance to this case and is currently investigating it. If the alleged allegations are true, this office will severely punish them according to the law. The criminal responsibility part should be investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office. He also said: Before the whole case is investigated and clarified, I do not intend to express any opinion.

Chief Prosecutor Huang's Statement

Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office was visited and asked about the secret report of corruption against CNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others. Chief Huang said: "A few days ago, I received a secret report letter, the content of which was similar to that reported in the newspaper. Because it was not signed and no evidence was attached, I did not actively investigate it." The reporter asked: "If the number of electric fans applied for by the China Merchants Bureau and the number allocated by CNRRA are consistent, can this be used as a basis for investigation?" Chief Huang said: "It seems inappropriate to investigate the two agencies based solely on a secret report. However, if there is concrete evidence attached, such as account books, photos, etc., it can be used as a basis for investigation. In short, this office pays close attention to corruption cases. If a responsible person makes an accusation in his own name and attaches evidence, this office is responsible for investigating it. All I can tell you now is this."

### CNRRA Cars Not Running, Rice Allowances Not Issued, Drivers Threaten Work Stoppage

[Our Report] Yesterday, no CNRRA vehicles were seen on the road. It is reported that this was due to the failure to pay wages in full, which led to a joint work stoppage by all drivers. However, a senior CNRRA official said in the evening: "Because the procedures for receiving rice allowances could not be completed for a while, the rice allowances could not be issued at the same time as the wages. The drivers were dissatisfied, so there was an expression of a work stoppage. However, by 4:00 PM, the drivers had returned to the garage, and this dispute is expected to be resolved."

### Merchant Ships of Countries with Reciprocal Treaties Are Prohibited from Coastal Trade in Our Country

The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that merchant ships of countries that have signed reciprocal treaties with our country may continue to enter more than one port in our country after March 31, 1947, to unload passengers and cargo loaded from overseas, and may also transport passengers and cargo overseas, but may not engage in coastal trade.

### Hindering Military Service, Assaulting Bao Secretary

[Our Report] Chen Shuhua, a resident of No. 15, Jia 18, Bao 45, Tilanqiao District, is a recruit of conscription age in active service.

When Bao Secretary Gao Xiang and others went to investigate, Chen falsely claimed to be 28 years old. After investigation, it was found that he was born on June 25, 1923. He was reprimanded for falsely reporting his age, and an argument broke out between the two parties. Gao Xiang was assaulted. Wu Ying, the district chief of Tilanqiao District, reported the above situation to the municipal government. The municipal government, on the grounds that Chen had violated the regulations on hindering military service, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday requesting that the case be summoned for investigation.

The Youngest Captured Bandit Soldier (Our Photo)

### Captured Bandit Soldiers from the Northeast Escorted to Shanghai, to Continue Training in Wuhan Today, Expressing Gratitude for the Government's Generosity

[Our Report] In recent years, the National Army has successively captured many bandit officers and soldiers in the Northeast. The authorities specially established the Northeast Youth Training Corps, under which there are twelve brigades, to provide training, collectively known as youth training students. Among them, 1,800 students from the 4th and 9th brigades, escorted by the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Military Police, arrived in Huludao by Shangyang train, and took the China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Zhou" ship to Shanghai that night. They arrived at Wusongkou the night before, and berthed at Qiujiang Wharf at noon yesterday. Today, they will transfer to the "Jiang Xin" ship and then sail

Forced to Become Bandits, Accounted for the Majority

When the ship berthed, all the students gathered on the deck to watch the surrounding scenery, with expressions of comfort on their faces. According to the person in charge of the two teams, half of them are from the Northeast, and there are also people from other provinces. The sources of their capture include those who surrendered during combat, those who were originally captured by the Communist bandits from the National Army, those who were captured by the National Army but have not yet been confirmed, those who were found in various cities to be spies of the bandit army, those who were originally puppet troops who revolted and were captured by the bandit army to fight, and those who were originally ordinary civilians who were forced to become bandits after being liberated and liquidated by the bandit army because they had no way to make a living. Among them, the latter accounted for the majority. In the 4th brigade, most of them are officers, from second lieutenant to major.

Subjected to Liquidation, Family Property Gone

They have been training in Shenyang for several months. Each person, regardless of rank, is given the same treatment as the National Army, and 3,000 Northeast circulating vouchers, equivalent to 34,500 yuan in national currency, are issued as pocket money each month. After several months of training, they have a genuine understanding of the concept of the country, and their thoughts have changed. After arriving in Hankou, they will continue to be trained. How to supplement and equip them in the future will be the responsibility of the Wuhan Military Camp. According to students Wang Hanwen and Zhu Qingfu, after the September 18 Incident, they were forced to become puppet troops. After the revolt, they opened a bean flour factory at home, which was quite large. After the Eighth Route Army arrived in the Northeast, their family property was liquidated, their family members were harmed by the bandits, and individuals were forced to fight. This time, they were captured. They deeply thank the government for its understanding and generosity. In the future, they are willing to serve in the National Army and return to the Northeast to wipe out the bandits.

### Qiantang Train Engine Failure, All Trains on the Shanghai Line Delayed Yesterday

The Qiantang Express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai line departed from Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 15th. After the train arrived in Zhenjiang, it was discovered that the engine had a malfunction.

### News of Dance Ban Spreads, Employees Feel Great Anxiety, Chairman of the Dance Industry Association Says, Rather Restore Past Taxation Rate

[Our Report] After the authorities announced that they would implement a conditional dance ban from next month, the dance hall industry, musicians, and dance industry employees all plan to hold meetings in the coming days and make suggestions to the authorities. There are currently more than 3,000 dance hall employees in this city. According to a representative of the employees' union: at the beginning of their organization of the union, they originally used the name "Western Restaurant and Cafe Industry Workers' Union". Later, because the Social Bureau solemnly stated that the dance industry would definitely not be banned in the short term, they changed the name to "Dance Hall Industry Workers' Union". Now that they have heard the news of the dance ban, they all feel anxious. They are currently all serving as waiters in the dance halls. If the dance ban is implemented as scheduled in the future, they will only be able to transfer to Western restaurants and cafes. However, most of the business of Western restaurants and cafes currently rely on the patronage of dancers and dance guests. Once the dance ban is implemented, the original waiters and employees will all have problems, and they will be in danger of losing their jobs, so they sincerely hope that the authorities will consider this.

Related Stores Will Be Affected

Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, said that the original intention of the dance ban was to promote thrift, but thousands of dance girls in the city have no other skills. If they become prostitutes and "social butterflies" in the future, it will only create gambling and waste outside the dance halls, and it will not achieve the purpose of thrift. Now that brothels have not been explicitly banned, and dance halls are eliminated first, it seems to be putting the cart before the horse. If the thousands of employees who directly depend on dance halls for their livelihood are calculated based on three family members who need to be supported per person, then tens of thousands of people in the city will have no way to make a living. What's more, the fashion stores, barbershops, shoe stores, entertainment industries, and even rickshaw pullers that are indirectly related to the dance industry will also suffer great impact.

Rather Than Banning, Better to Increase Taxes

The donations and taxes currently paid by dance halls account for an important part of the city's financial revenue. Rather than completely banning them, it is better to change the current tax rate of 25% and restore the previous 40% or 50% to show restrictions, which seems to be more beneficial to the city's financial situation. If it is said that dancing consumes too many materials, but after the dance halls are eliminated, they will be converted into Western restaurants and cafes, etc., and it seems that it may not be possible to save electricity and other things. Therefore, if the authorities want to ban dancing, they should consider all these issues.

The Musicians' Union will also hold a meeting on the 19th to discuss the matter. Many of the current musicians are recent graduates of music colleges. They said that what they have learned is music. If dance halls cannot exist, they can also make a living by playing in other places, because the current treatment is meager, and both foreign and Chinese musicians are deeply tired of playing in dance halls.

### Qingdao Brewery Hosts Press

Qilu Enterprise Company, the largest enterprise organization in North China, including ten major factories such as rubber and flour, the Qingdao Brewery of the company hosted a banquet for the press in this city at Kangle Restaurant last night. More than 60 people, including Cheng Cangbo and Li Zikuan, attended. The company specially sent Director Li Chaohai, Chu Baosan, Yu Zijiu and others to Shanghai to receive them. Qingdao Brewery has been established for 50 years. It was originally operated by Germans. Shanghai's beer also started with Qingdao Beer. It is made purely from Laoshan spring water, so it is clear, fragrant, and intoxicating, and the quality is super special. It will be launched in Shanghai on a large scale from today. Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Wang Xiaolai asked the gentlemen to introduce it solemnly, and it is expected that the business will develop rapidly.

### Selling False Warehouse Receipts, Cotton Cloth Owner Sued on Two Charges

[Our Report] Cotton cloth broker Yin Dingfu opened Baoxiang Cotton Cloth Shop in this city. In early June, Yin could not make up for his failed speculation, so he used Baoxiang's name to forge the delivery orders of Yonghua Factory. On the 12th, 13th, and 14th, he sold a large number of false Longtou fine cloth warehouse receipts, defrauding 13.02 million yuan from Tonghexing Cotton Cloth Shop, 12.72 million yuan from Yongsheng Cotton Cloth Shop, 12.74 million yuan from Yonghua Cotton Cloth Shop, 38.1 million yuan from Baokangshen Grain Shop, 47.12 million yuan from Fuqunxiang Cotton Cloth Shop, and 12.74 million yuan from Tongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Shop.

Zhu refused to pay, and a conflict broke out. Zhu broke Zhang's head and twisted each other into the Huangpu Police Station, which was punished for violating police regulations for adding violence. However, Zhu was still resentful and explained the reason for the arrears. Zhu had previously purchased 4.6 fen of gold at a black market price of 3.4 million yuan from Xiangmao, and reported the money shop's illegal transaction.

Houses have collapsed, and it is roughly estimated that there are tens of thousands of them. Only one-tenth or two of the 4 million people in Xuzhou District are spared from starvation. Groups of them are fleeing the famine, and the tragic situation is alarming. On both sides of the railway in Tongxu District, the beans, sesame, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains that have been submerged by water have all withered and died. Sorghum is also unlikely to be harvested. There are no turnip seeds for near places, and there is nothing to replant. Famine refugees are on the road one after another. If they cannot obtain food locally, they will inevitably flee to Jiangnan.

### Director of Welfare Group Wounded in Office of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan, Accuses Director of General Affairs Department of Exceeding Authority

[Our Dispatch] Xu Shichang, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan, was recently sued by Ms. Liu Dewei, the Director of the Welfare Group of the Relief and Rehabilitation Office, for administrative overreach, accusing Xu of interfering in administration and publicly assaulting Liu in the office. The incident stemmed from the morning before, when 397 refugees from the rear areas gathered inside the office, demanding relief. Due to misunderstandings in the work of the staff, conflicts arose. Afterwards, according to Liu Dewei speaking to the reporter: "My work is absolutely impartial, and relief matters have their own specialties. Now, the Director of the General Affairs Department not only overstepped his authority to interfere but also publicly cursed me as a 'mixed-up bastard,' and then started hitting people. This is really too much bullying." Liu described this behavior as entirely due to "jealousy." Finally, Liu firmly stated: "If the administrative lawsuit yields no results, I will file a legal lawsuit." While speaking, she also presented the injury report to the reporter as evidence.

### Epoch-Making Progress in Police Administration: Using Scientific Methods to Investigate Criminal Evidence, Ultraviolet Light is the Most Powerful

[Our Special Dispatch] Since the police bureau used "ultraviolet light" to determine criminal evidence in the case of the shooting of Yu Shengxiao, the outside world has been very interested in the various scientific methods recently used by the police bureau to solve cases. A reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau and learned that the investigation of criminals and the identification of evidence have completely abandoned torture and are now using various latest scientific methods to conduct inquiries, so that criminals will confess in the face of the power of science and cannot make excuses.

Ultraviolet light is one of the most effective, specifically used to detect various subtle pieces of criminal evidence that are invisible to the naked eye, such as forged documents and seals, counterfeit banknotes, and imitation goods. Because ultraviolet light is completely based on the principle of optical perspective, even cleverly crafted counterfeits or destroyed and unrecognizable originals can be identified under this super-intensity light. For example, if you compare and inspect a popular brand of brandy with the real product under ultraviolet light, the differences in concentration, composition, and liquid form can be immediately distinguished. The three fake seals of the bank that was defrauded of a huge sum of money by counterfeit checks were also detected by ultraviolet light. The differences between them and the original seals were only in one or two knife marks, which could not be seen with the naked eye.

Finding Clues Based on Fingerprints

Fingerprint identification, which is related to ultraviolet light, is one of the most arduous tasks in the police bureau's investigation work. Currently, the fingerprint unit has more than 600,000 pages of ten-finger prints and more than 100,000 single-finger prints, all of which are criminal fingerprints accumulated over the years since the era of the Public Works Department, as well as those left at the scene of incidents that have not yet been solved. For example, in the case of the corpse at Taishan Apartments, which caused a sensation in Shanghai some time ago, and the theft case at He Yingqin's mansion, the clues were found within a few days or even hours through the fingerprints, and the cases were finally solved. Now, all fingerprints are analyzed and categorized according to the latest American classification method and managed by experts. If a case occurs, in order to find out whether the criminal is a first-time offender or a repeat offender, or if it is necessary to compare the fingerprints left at the scene, the files are often repeatedly turned over and compared by type with the fingerprints in the files, which takes the most time.

Stereoscopic Photography and Invisible Photography

Photography is also quite important in the investigation process. After a case occurs, criminals, scenes, documents, and evidence must be photographed and preserved. The police bureau currently has two types of photography: "stereoscopic photography" and "invisible photography," and its equipment is second to none in the Far East. "Stereoscopic photography" is used to photograph various angles other than the front, and "invisible photography" can make the required point of photography particularly clear, while the remaining parts are automatically hidden during photography. This type of photography is often the most powerful aid when interrogating criminals or seeking clues.

Checking Bullet Casings to Identify the Gun Owner

There are currently registered self-defense firearms in Shanghai. All such firearms are recorded by the Firearms Inspection Unit of the Third Division. Because firearms of the same brand have slight differences in their structure, if a shooting incident occurs in the city, based on the recovered bullet, the depth and width of the rifling lines, or the impact marks of the firing pin on the cartridge case, and determining the up, down, left, and right positions of the impact, and then using the most precise calculation method to cross-reference with the rotation of the rifling lines and the position of the firing pin in the original record, the gun owner can be determined immediately.

Hair and Blood Stains Can All Be Examined

In addition, the department also has a forensic laboratory, specializing in the examination of hair, blood stains, corpses, and injuries, in order to match the aforementioned scientific methods and comprehensively identify the appearance, character, and criminal process of the offender.

Investigating crimes using scientific methods is an epoch-making progress in Chinese police administration. The Municipal Police Bureau is planning to enrich this scientific equipment and strive to achieve "no injustice, no letting go," so that criminal behavior can be gradually reduced in the face of the power of science in the future.

### Silent Kuling

White Clouds Encircle Ten Thousand-Ren Mountains [News from the Eleventh] Climbing up to this ten thousand-ren high mountain from the hot and bustling capital, surrounded by white clouds, we cannot smell a trace of political atmosphere, hear half a sound of the city's noise, or see a speck of flying dust, giving us a feeling of "riding the wind and returning."

"Longing to hate the return of spring with no place to be found, I don't know that it turns people to come here," (Bai Letian's poem) is the most appropriate description of the beauty of this place. Here, the reporter only wants to briefly introduce some mountain trivia, which is regarded as revealing the silent face of Lushan:

Mountain People Long for the Chairman's Arrival

Kuling has become the name of a historical and political summer capital. The Lushan training sessions before the war, the Lushan Conference, and even Chairman Chiang's Lushan broadcasts are all major events in China's recent hundred-year history. The residents of Kuling are forever proud of this and forever reminiscing about the grand occasions of those years. After the war, last year, the occasional visits of Chairman Chiang and the weekend visits of the peace envoy Marshall attracted more than 20 reporters from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai to be stationed in Kuling for a long time, trying to send out world-shaking news from this gentle mountain every day. The coming and going of dignitaries and the strong political atmosphere almost made the warm Kuling excessively heated and tense. Although Kuling suffered a major fire disaster this spring, they still yearn for a more heated scene than last year's. The sound of "When will the Chairman come to Lushan?" is endless. However, when July ended, they began to sigh, "I'm afraid the Chairman won't come." The reporter went up the mountain on August 7 and was constantly answering inquiries from acquaintances and strangers asking, "When will the Chairman come?" At the same time, I heard them saying to each other, "I'm afraid there is no hope," "I'm afraid he won't come." The mountain people look forward to the Chairman's visit as if they were looking forward to their loving mother. However, today is already August 11, and the possibility of this hope has been reduced to the lowest possible degree.

Wind Roars and Streams Sing, Talking About the Official Residence

The Chairman's opulent residence quietly stands beside the stream, surrounded by a wall and a large lawn in front of the house. The mountain people pointed and told me that last year they could very proudly see Chairman Chiang and his beautiful wife walking on this lawn. They used extremely vivid adjectives beyond the power of words to describe their intimate feelings about the Chairman and his wife's every move. However, now it is deserted, and except for the sentries standing at the front and back doors, no sound can be heard. The location of the Chairman's official residence is excellent, with the avenue in front, a winding path behind, and a babbling stream passing from the foot of the wall. Waking up in the middle of the night, it is really the wind roaring and the stream singing, with a majestic meaning in the pulse of clear poetry.

Ashes After Burning, Endowing New Life

From a fire in Kuling this spring, we can still see the ruins of broken walls everywhere today. The fire destroyed part of the essence of Kuling, but because it has this political value, it has been revived and recreated. Therefore, the ruins have been given a new life, and the government authorities and merchants themselves have tried to invest a lot of capital to rebuild it. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, which is responsible for receiving guests, has especially tried its best to improve the facilities this year, taking last year as an example. Wu Shihan, Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, and Wang Jiongguang, Executive Director of the Social Service Department, both went up the mountain early to design and plan. The Social Service Department also specially rented a large house, with a pavilion-style apartment building, as well as a dining room, barber shop, bathroom, and library, all of which provide many conveniences for tourists. Last year, the reporters mainly stayed at the Hujinfang Hotel, which was also a large hotel with ninety rooms, but it has been overshadowed a lot this year. The reporters have moved to the Social Apartments of the Social Service Department. Everything in this year's summer capital is more improved than last year.

Nerve Center, Feeling Sensitive

General Marshall once said in Lushan that "Kuling's telecommunications will be second to none in the world." But if General Marshall visits again this year, he may also be amazed. A long-distance phone call, as long as you call for two minutes, the bell will ring, the sound is clear, there are many lines, and there are wired and wireless radios, all kinds of equipment. The speed and seriousness of its work make people admire it. Mail is also delivered quickly, the post office facilities are top-notch, and postal workers often take responsibility for guiding the villagers to send letters. These can be said to be the nerve center of Kuling.

Kuling is already showing a scene of autumn, and summer has disappeared in silence. This is exactly symbolic of the reality of this year's summer capital.

### Director of the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Bureau Discusses the Construction of a New Alpine Meteorological Station: Focusing on the Study of the Sun as a Central Topic

[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 15th] After Director Shi Yanhan of the Meteorological Bureau and Huang Renyu, a technician, inspected the Xingaoshan Meteorological Station and surveyed the old site of the observatory built by the predecessors, he said: "Except for India and Mexico, astronomical observatories are mostly located in the northern temperate zone. If constructed in the subtropical zone, it has the following advantages: (1) Can witness the southern celestial sphere's fixed stars. (2) There is no obstruction on the horizon. (3) There is little dust, and the observation of weather balloons has no flickering defects. (4) The number of observations can be increased by two and a half times compared to the plains." He also emphasized: "The station can take the sun as its central research topic, such as observing sunspots and solar radiation intensity, and at the same time build an Einstein field to study the composition of the sun. Because the station is located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a higher altitude, it can obtain conclusions that are not easily obtained by other astronomical observatories." He is preparing to submit it to the current astronomical annual meeting to be held in September, hoping to use the power of the state to build the current Xingaoshan Meteorological Station.

### A Humorous Scene in Hefei: Xia Yinglin's Official Addiction is Unbearable, Secretly Prints "Director" Business Cards

Cuts and Wraps a Large Batch of Clothing, Expecting to Take Office Immediately, but the Truth is Discovered and He is Detained in the Police Bureau for Interrogation

[Our Dispatch from Hefei] A humorous scene occurred in Hefei today, which spread throughout the bland ancient city. A man named Xia Yinglin, a native of Hefei, 26 years old, bought a large batch of clothing in a cloth shop on the crossroads. After the shop assistant cut and wrapped it, Xia claimed that he was about to take over as the director of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau and took out a business card with the full title. The guard, who was on duty and had not heard of any changes in the directorship, ignored him, but Xia slapped him. The guard was bewildered and lured Xia to the nearby First Branch Bureau and reported it to the Branch Director Lai Ting. Lai Ting saw that Xia was wearing a half-old shirt and shorts, which did not look like a director about to take office, and there was no such news. After searching, dozens of business cards of "Xia Yinglin, Director of the Anhui Provincial Capital Police Bureau" were found on Xia, as well as a letter notifying news reporters that "The handover ceremony of the new and old directors will be held at X o'clock on the morning of August X in the auditorium of the Police Bureau," and "By the order of Chairman Li, I will be in charge of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and I am overwhelmed with trepidation after being appointed." Branch Director Lai then sent Xia to the Criminal Police Team and forwarded him to the General Bureau. When the reporter went to the detention center of the General Bureau to visit this impostor director, a person wearing a vest and underpants stood up on the floor inside the wooden fence and hurriedly put on brand-new yellow leather shoes, as if he had a premonition. He first said, "I am Xia Yinglin, are you a news reporter?" Then he narrated his life experience, saying that he had worked as a typist and clerk, and had recently acted as the director of the Third Branch Bureau of Wuhu. When asked if he was from the police force and what relationship he had with the director of the Wuhu Police Bureau, he replied: "I only graduated from elementary school and don't know Lu at all." As for coming to Hefei, it was because the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government passed a resolution to appoint him as the director of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and the original director Lin Chao was appointed as the county magistrate, so he came to Hefei to print business cards. When the reporter told him that the provincial government had never issued such an order, Xia seemed to suddenly realize something. In his words, he rambled incoherently, and his insanity was very similar to that of a person suffering from a mental illness. It is reported that the Police Bureau is currently investigating his background and will decide what to do with him.

They were escorted to the county on the 12th and interrogated by the Police Bureau that night. Li and Wang confessed to the robbery and murder and admitted that they had tied up six crew members and seven passengers and thrown them into the river and killed them with bamboo poles.

### A Good Story of Pangolins Getting Married: A Male Fish Was Caught in Zhuqiao, and a Female Fish Was Caught in Xincang

Well-Wishers Help Them Tie the Knot

[Haining News] A farmer in Zhuqiao caught a strange fish with a very strange shape.

The marriage of pangolins is a good story.

### Fuzhou Shoushan Stone: Reserves Reach 3 Billion Tons and Can Be Used as Industrial Raw Materials

[Our Dispatch from Fuzhou, 11th] Our country is famous for producing seal stones. They include Guanglv stone from Guangdong Province, Qingtian stone from Zhejiang Province, Changhua's chicken blood stone, and Shoushan stone from Fujian Province. Among them, Shoushan stone has the most brilliant colors and is the crown of seal stones in various provinces. As early as 1848, Shoushan stone was sold to Europe and the United States and was deeply welcomed by Westerners. The chemical composition of Shoushan stone is mica and potassium, aluminum, silicon, and acid salts. According to its aluminum and silicon elements, it is suitable for the manufacture of kiln industry, such as ceramic utensils, refractory bricks and tiles, glass industry, enamel industry, and other refractory materials, or for the steel manufacturing industry, metallurgical industry, alloy industry, gas industry, and mechanical industry. Therefore, seal stones can not only be used for appreciation by literati, but also as raw materials for scientific manufacturing. They are truly very useful minerals.

Shoushan Township and Yueyang Township in Fuzhou both produce Shoushan stone, and the distribution area is vast. The Shoushan stone deposit can be divided into three major areas: Shoushan, Yueyang, Furong, and Emei. The bedrock that constitutes the mountains in the entire area is mostly quartz porphyry, and the seal stone is nurtured in it. The reserves are about 3 billion tons, of which 2 billion tons are above the water level and 1 billion tons are below the water level. The mineral quality is excellent and has the value of mining.

### Students of Beiping Normal College Demanded the Restoration of National Fudan University Yesterday. Education Minister Zhu Jiahua Was Besieged. Hu Shih Arrived and Resolved the Situation.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 15th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, who is in Beiping today, was besieged by students from the Normal College demanding the restoration of Fudan University. He was trapped for an hour and eventually managed to escape through a side door. In the afternoon, more than two hundred students from the Normal College secretly gathered at Peking University. When Zhu Jiahua inspected the science building of Peking University at 4:30 PM, it was too late. Despite Secretary Fang Zhimou's best efforts to lure him away, he was still surrounded by the students. Just as he was about to board his car, the students blocked the car and demanded that he give a speech and provide guarantees regarding the restoration of Fudan University before they would allow him to leave. He remained by the car for more than ten minutes, and the students shouted rude remarks, emphasizing that Zhu's refusal to speak was bureaucratic arrogance. Zhu looked very unhappy and could not break through the encirclement and returned to the university. The students followed and shouted, "We will seek the restoration of Fudan University even if we die!" Although Peking University personnel repeatedly attempted to lure the students into a side room, they were unsuccessful. This continued until the last courtyard, where Minister Zhu took refuge in the physics department office. However, the students were still agitated, and Minister Zhu finally came out and gave a speech to the students, saying, "It is not that I do not want to talk to you, but I feel that this method is not good. To discuss official matters, you should make an appointment in advance. As for the Fudan University issue, I have already made an appointment with President Hao Renfu of the Normal College (Director of the Tianjin Education Bureau). Tomorrow night, I will exchange views with student representatives at the Normal College and then discuss the matter further. We should study it calmly. The Ministry of Education has administrative regulations, and I cannot make decisions on my own." At this point, the students shouted for a final decision. President Hu Shih of Peking University arrived upon hearing the news and stepped forward to resolve the situation. Hu said: As an alumnus of the Normal College (Hu once studied at the former Higher Normal School), I have been concerned about the restoration of Fudan University for a long time, and I have mediated on its behalf. A month ago, I forwarded Minister Zhu's letter to the Normal College. At that time, Minister Zhu expressed sympathy in his letter, which was written in black and white and should be trustworthy. (Both Zhu and Hu, as well as the students, said that the only problem was the procedure; the direction was set, but Minister Zhu could not explicitly say so). At this time, Secretary Fang and all the Peking University personnel mobilized and sought out student representatives to persuade them using the "divide and conquer" method. The students were not satisfied and wanted Zhu and Hu to make a definite guarantee. Hu nodded helplessly, but Zhu refused, leading to another deadlock. Hu took the lead and led Zhu out, but the students closed the door tightly, and Zhu and Hu were quite angry but could not return to the room. After a while, Hu came out again to negotiate with the students. The students demanded that Hu ask the Minister to sign a guarantee that he would go to the Normal College tomorrow night, and then they would leave. Hu angrily said, "It is outrageous for you to make such a request. How can I, as a landlord, do such a rude thing? You should consider it and not lose the sympathy of those who support you. I am scared of this kind of method, let alone Minister Zhu." At this time, the students discovered that Minister Zhu had escaped through a side door under Dr. Hu Shih's "golden cicada sheds its shell" scheme, and they had no choice but to shake hands with Hu Shih and make a guarantee, and then withdrew together. It was already past 5:30 PM.

### Twenty-Nine Transferred Military Officers Assigned to Posts in This City by the Ministry of Education

[Special Dispatch] Previously, the authorities established re-training classes for demobilized military officers in 12 locations including Shanghai and Xi'an by the China Training Corps. After completing their studies, they were assigned to relevant agencies by the Executive Yuan upon approval by the Ministry of National Defense. Among them, 29 graduates of the education personnel training class were assigned to the Education Bureau of this city by the Ministry of Education, 15 were introduced to serve in various national schools by the National Education Department, 9 were placed by the Social Education Department, and 5 were recorded by the Secondary Education Department. However, because the training classes ended at the end of May, and the salary was paid until the end of July, the accommodation problem can still be solved, but the food expenses are barely maintained until now. Moreover, some of those introduced to serve in national schools were rejected by the principals on the grounds that the personnel had already been determined. The batch of transferred military officers went to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday afternoon, requesting that a portion of their wages be paid in advance to maintain their livelihood. Vice Director Li received them at that time, replied: Since they have been assigned to the Education Bureau, the Education Bureau will naturally be responsible and will contact the relevant parties within the day to make a decision. Vice Director Li also instructed the transferred military officers that if they have any disputes with the schools to which they have been assigned, they should not argue verbally but can directly appeal to the Education Bureau or find ways to transfer to other schools. The transferred military officers also stated that when they retired from the military, they mostly engaged in political propaganda work, which is similar in nature to social education work. Many of those who have been assigned to serve in national schools also hope to serve in social education institutions. Vice Director Li promised to consider this.

Furthermore, the Social Education Department stated that the number of classes in various national schools will increase starting in September, and they can be assigned to serve at that time. They also plan to provide subsidies to the transferred military officers in August and are preparing a budget to be submitted to the municipal government for allocation of funds.

### Rubber Industry Lacks Raw Materials: Three Emergency Measures Proposed; Liberalize Quotas and Change Import and Export Trade Regulations; Priority Approval of Licenses for Overseas Remittances

[Our Report] The Rubber Industry Association of the First District, facing a shortage of raw materials and limited import quotas, making production difficult, yesterday hosted members of the local press. Hong Nianzu, Chairman of the Association, and other executive directors, presented reports on the current state of the industry. They stated that since the authorities implemented the import control system, rubber factories in Shanghai have only received quotas for over 2,600 tons of rubber. In the first half of this year, however, 150,000 dan (approximately 10,000 tons) of rubber were imported into our country from Hong Kong. Of this, about 70-80% was transshipped through Shanghai, which has allowed the Shanghai rubber industry to maintain production and supply. Since the implementation of the transshipment ban on July 1st, cargo transport between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been disrupted, and the quota for rubber and rubber products for the third quarter has been reduced by US$500,000. Chemical products and other raw materials are even more difficult to obtain. Without raw materials, factory workers will not be able to continue to survive. Therefore, they have recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, and the Import Control Office and other relevant agencies, proposing three emergency measures: (1) Significantly increase the quota for raw rubber and chemical products. (2) Change import and export trade regulations, allowing factories to directly apply for imports according to actual needs, or have the association handle it jointly. (3) If factories can find overseas remittances for the raw materials they need, issue permits as soon as possible. They also stated that if rubber factories are not allowed to seek their own means of survival, then in three months, we will see a market of dried fish.

Taiwan Rubber Factories Also Lack Raw Materials

[Another Report] At yesterday's reception hosted by the First District Rubber Association, Shen, Director of the Taiwan Rubber Factory of the Resources Committee, also attended. Shen strongly argued the importance of the rubber industry to both national defense and peacetime industry, and appealed to the government to include Taiwan in the allocation of quotas. He then reported on the recent situation of the rubber industry in Taiwan, stating that there are more than 50 rubber factories there, but the machinery and manpower of the Taiwan Rubber Factory account for 60% of the entire Taiwan rubber industry. The factory needs 360 to 400 tons of rubber per month, but currently can only obtain 30 tons per month, less than one-thirteenth of its needs. Given the excellent industrial production conditions in Taiwan, the government should fully support it.

Regarding the issue of rayon allocation prices, they have not yet received any documents from the China Trust Bureau requesting instructions. They were instructed to return to Shanghai to negotiate directly with the China Trust Bureau. It was also stated that the government hopes that the silk weaving industry can export finished products, and use the foreign exchange obtained to import rayon. They were also instructed to contact the Export Promotion Committee for all matters after returning to Shanghai. They also hoped that the representatives would further consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs on how to arrange for the association to import rayon after the opening of private trade with Japan in the future.

Regarding the points presented by the representatives, he agreed to forward them to President Zhang for prompt review and approval. Many of the representatives who went to Nanjing returned to Shanghai last night, and plan to visit Mayor Wu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Director Wu of the China Trust Bureau and others today to petition.

Rayon Transactions Stalled

Two days later 600,000 yuan, the highest spot transaction in the middle was 7 million yuan. Because the short accounts have been fully supplemented, asking prices are gradually showing a decline. The smallest spot transaction was 630,000 yuan, and the closing price was 660,000 yuan. Two days later 700,000 yuan, which was 460,000 to 70,000 yuan higher than the previous day.

### Tea Market Stagnant

Yesterday's tea market: after many consultations on this year's Qimen new black tea, the two sides remained stubborn, and asking prices did not concede, and transactions remained in a mutually exclusive situation. As for other varieties, exporters continued to wait and see, while domestic sales by local and guest merchants were also slow. The market situation was still not lively, and transaction prices still varied depending on the quality of the goods, with little actual change compared to the previous day.

### Balance of Foreign Exchange Deposits in Banks: A Small Number Still Not Cleared

[Our Report] According to Article 8 of the Amended Provisional Regulations for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange: "If there are remaining balances in the existing foreign exchange accounts of each bank, they should be sold to the National Bank at the market price on September 30, 1946." Has each designated bank fully sold all of the remaining balances in foreign exchange accounts? Should the foreign exchange deposits owned by commercial banks also be handled in accordance with the above regulations? The reporter inquired with relevant parties in the bank, and it was stated that if there are any remaining balances in the existing foreign currency deposit accounts of each designated bank, they should be sold to the bank at the market price on September 20, 1946. This regulation was originally notified by the bank to each designated bank for compliance. As of now, most of these foreign currency deposit accounts have been closed. There are still a small number of depositors who are scattered in various places and have lost contact with the original deposit banks, resulting in their inability to close on schedule. The bank is currently urging them to close as soon as possible. As for the foreign exchange positions owned by commercial banks, if they are in the country, they should also be sold to the bank at the market price on September 30, 1946, in accordance with the regulations. If they are abroad, they can be sold to the bank at the current exchange rate.

### Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation Cables Request for Removal of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Controls

The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, in order to request the removal of the control on the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south, to alleviate the plight of Jiangsu merchants, sent a cable to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Textile Adjustment Committee, stating that since the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth transshipment control, the export sales of cotton yarn and cloth industries in the city have stagnated, and production has been reduced. Moreover, according to reliable reports from northern and southern merchants, the South Seas have become the tail end of Japanese cotton cloth dumping, and have infiltrated South China through Hong Kong and Macau. Coastal ports in Jiangsu and Shandong have also seen the smuggling of Japanese goods, which are then transferred to North China. The special control on the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south was originally intended to prevent smuggling abroad and to stabilize prices. Now, because of the opening of trade with Japan, Japanese goods are easily dumped, resulting in strict controls on national goods, which in turn allow Japanese goods to be smuggled into the country. This is neither an expedient solution nor a good plan. There is a need to change course. It is hoped that the facts will be investigated, and that the method of controlling the transshipment of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south will be abolished by explicit order in order to maintain domestic products and save the crisis.

Yarn Prices Do Not Fluctuate Much

Yesterday's cotton yarn market: at the beginning, there was buying interest from guest merchants, and prices were seen to rise.

Therefore, at the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn still fell back to 16.8 million yuan to balance, and 20-count special Double Horse yarn was still 11.5 million yuan. Light Double Horse rose by 100,000 from the previous day, to 10.3 million yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns fluctuated by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth First Rises, Then Falls Back

Yesterday's cotton cloth market: with the off-market Longtou fine cloth closing high at 425,000 yuan the previous day, all goods saw high openings. Tianjin merchants absorbed strongly, and floating longs rushed to cover shorts, and large buyers successively purchased. Longtou fine cloth soared to 450,000 yuan. It was then heard that the Four Banks and Two Bureaus would gradually recover production loans, and because trade with Japan was about to open, all parties were wary. Therefore, Longtou fine cloth finally fell back to 440,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. However, asking prices softened after the close, with sellers at 436,000 yuan. The remaining cloths also first rose and then fell back. As a result, bleached cloth, serge, poplin, blue cloth, and shilin cloth mostly rose to their closing prices. Yuan serge was the most traded on the table.

Also: China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 1,323 pieces. 404 applications were made by manufacturers. 20-count Double Globe was listed at 9.7 million yuan, and 42-count Water Moon at 16.2 million yuan.

Spot Cotton Prices Rise Slightly

### Group Profit-Sharing Savings: China Trust Began Yesterday

Business began yesterday in Nanjing, Shanghai, and various locations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Because the procedures are simple, the deposit period is short, and the dividends are generous, those going to the Bureau and various agent banks to deposit were crowded. In the city, nearly 1 billion yuan was sold on the first day.

### Trade Association Cables for Permission to Export Cottonseed to Japan

The China Import and Export Trade Association recently noted that the Guiding Committee for Trade with Japan had not included cottonseed, cottonseed oil, and cottonseed cake, three major export commodities, in the list of export goods to Japan, believing that the Trade Committee failed to understand the importance of these commodities in pre-war exports to Japan. It detailed the reasons and cabled the Ministry of Economic Affairs for permission to include them in the export list, arguing that cottonseed production this year is abundant, and exports should be promoted to restore exports and maintain the rural economy.

### Mr. Zhang Daofan's Fiftieth Birthday Preface

â€” Jiang Weiqiao

Our country has a five-thousand-year-old culture, forming an ancient nation. However, throughout history, the world's fortunes have had periods of prosperity and decline, and culture has also risen and fallen accordingly. When it is in decline, there must be sages and heroes who rise up to revitalize it, causing the culture to shift its direction and radiate brilliant light. History records this in detail. The Tuan Commentary of the Book of Changes says: "Observe the celestial patterns to understand the changes of time, observe human culture to transform the world." The Four Subjects of Confucius' school also include all ritual and musical systems. This shows the richness and breadth of the meaning of culture. After the founding of the Republic of China, inheriting the decline and corruption of the late Qing Dynasty, coupled with long-term wars that continue to this day, the destruction and damage to culture have reached their extreme. There must be someone with a grand vision, who rises up and recognizes the vastness of culture, to save it. Looking around the country, Mr. Zhang Daofan is the one who can shoulder this important task!

Mr. Zhang was born in Pan County, Guizhou, in the Dingyou year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. His father, Mingqu Gong, taught in the countryside and was known for his integrity. His mother, Wu, was well-versed in etiquette and taught her son righteousness. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's filial piety and brotherly love were innate. Before reaching adulthood, he graduated from the county school and, with ambitions for the world, went to Tianjin to study at Nankai Middle School. Later, he studied in England and France, focusing on art, and integrating Chinese literature and science. He gained fame in England and was elected as a member of the Royal Society. After completing his studies, he returned to China and was immediately appointed. He initially served as the Secretary-General of the Nanjing Municipal Government, and later as the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Education, and Interior Affairs. He also served as the Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province. Having served in both domestic and foreign positions, his political achievements are well-known. He then served as a member of the Central Executive Committee, and after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he was elected as a Standing Committee member in Sichuan. He successively served as the Minister of both the Propaganda and Overseas Departments. In the spring of the thirtieth year, he also took charge of the Cultural Movement Committee. Mr. Zhang said with a sigh: "This is the time for me to put what I have learned into practice." He worked diligently, day and night, tirelessly, with the sole aim of promoting indigenous culture and bridging Western culture. As a result, learned scholars, artists, and writers all responded and sought him out, rising up at the sound of his call. In those four or five years, the cultural movement was like spring sunshine, with a hundred flowers blooming in full splendor, demonstrating a vast and inclusive view. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's vision was sharp, and his understanding of culture differed from ordinary people. In addition to promoting new and old literature and art, he also included drama, novels, and movies, embracing them all. His original plays include "Self-Deception," "Self-Salvation," and "Killing the Enemy to Save the Country," among others. His translations include "Di Si Niang" and "Honeymoon Trip." He also produced the movie "Secret Code," which was based on his personal revolutionary experiences and widely circulated. The magazines he founded include "Literary Vanguard" and "Cultural Vanguard." The series of books he edited include "Modern Literature" and "Modern Drama." Mr. Zhang also excels in both Chinese and Western painting, and his sketches have a unique style. The cultural organizations he initiated and organized include the Chinese Literature and Art Society, the All-China Literary and Art Circles Anti-Japanese Association, the All-China Drama Circles Anti-Japanese Association, the All-China Fine Arts Association, and the All-China Literary and Art Writers Association. This demonstrates the greatness of his measures, the universality of his actions, which have had a special impact on the entire country and even extended to the world. The number of Heaven is five, and the number of Earth is five, and the number of Great Expansion resides in the center of Heaven and Earth. Mr. Zhang has been blessed by Heaven, and at the young age of fifty, his achievements in governance have already been so evident. In the years to come, he will surely enable our country's culture to flourish throughout the world, which can be predicted. Mr. Zhang has made great contributions to the Party and the country, and historians will surely record and praise them. I need not add more. I have only briefly described his dedication to cultural undertakings to inform the people of the country and to celebrate his birthday! This is the preface. (July of the 36th year of the Republic of China)

### Ding Shan's Notes on Poetry

â€” Chen Dingshan

"Shui Long Yin" Correct Meter

Xin Yuan gifted me a "Shui Long Yin" for my fiftieth birthday, and I responded with one. His ending line says, "Leaving the world with emerald ink, dreaming by the pine stream, sipping wine with a spoon." According to the rules of poetry, Xin Jiaxuan's poem ends with, "Who can I ask to call forth, red kerchiefs and green sleeves, to wipe away the tears of a hero?" The word "wipe" should be paused after. Xin Yuan's ending line says, "Planning to howl in Lantian, in the bamboo groves of Pepper Garden, together we will float away by boat." There should be a pause after the word "together." So Xin Yuan is right, and I was wrong. However, according to Su Shi's "Shui Long Yin" poem: "Looking closely, it's not willow catkins, but the tears of parting people." Lu You wrote, "Sighing that only willow catkins come with spring, mixed with hatred, filling the east wind." Bai Shi wrote, "Why does Xie Lang also hate drifting, understanding the moonlit thousands of miles." Both can be read as seven syllables followed by six syllables, just like Jiaxuan's "If someone could call forth red kerchiefs," "Green sleeves wipe away the tears of a hero." It can also be read as seven syllables followed by six syllables. Therefore, Xin Yuan's "Bamboo groves of Pepper Garden" is not yet perfect. I have changed it to "Leaving the world with emerald ink flowing, beautiful lines filling the land south of the Yangtze River," which is in accordance with the rules of poetry. The corrected version is attached to the left. I ask the connoisseurs of music and elegance in the country to correct the meter. If you grant me a response, I am willing to offer a fan painted with lotus flowers as a reward, creating a literary connection.

A heroic spirit born by the lake, flowers grieving, wine dispelling heroic energy. Viewing the scenery in high autumn, distant wild geese in formation, how many lines can be sent? The North Sea's wine cup is put away, the affairs of Dongshan have passed, but the guest play remains. Where is the mournful zither? Under the plum and peach blossoms, carrying courtesans in vain.

The setting sun shines on the pavilion, singing "Yang Guan," the evening glow boundless. Cattails green, alfalfa emerald, looking at the setting sun, how many flying cavalry. Recruiting hermits west of the city, the painting alone remains, the waterside temple deserted, leaving the world with emerald ink flowing, beautiful lines filling the land south of the Yangtze River.

### Sketch of West Lake (National Painting)

### Miscellaneous Notes by the Lakeside

â€” Pei Yin

Morning on the Lake

The dark, gloomy tide has just receded, and we come to the lakeside.

Fog envelops the city, shrouds the trees, and presses tightly on the lake surface. We got on the boat, the boat is so small and exquisite, sensitively swaying.

The boat moved, advancing through the fog. Distant mountains and embankments are all obscured by the fog; all that can be seen is the surrounding lake water, a clear and cool lake water. If I did not know that there were mountains and embankments behind this heavy fog, I would definitely suspect that I was in a boundless sea - if the seawater were also so clear and calm, allowing us to drift in a small boat, wouldn't it be even more lovely?

A humid wind blows from the east, we see a yellowish-white light rising from the eastern horizon, so powerfully, shining... I felt the fog dissipating towards the west, and soon I saw a golden sunlight cast on the lake surface hundreds of yards to the east. Our boat is heading east, and the sunlight is moving closer to us. Immediately, we came out of the heavy fog, and the sunlight shone on our boat. Turning around, we saw that there was still some white fog remaining. However, the fog is gradually dissipating, and I saw the wind and sunlight powerfully dispersing them....

In the sunlight, I saw everyone's young smile.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 372

â€” Ye Jingfeng

"I guess, your Uncle Tong is one of those..." Little Tiger released his playful nature; the motive was to dilute Uncle Tong's fiery impulsiveness.

"I say, Little Tiger!..." Tong Zhao tightened his face, narrowed his eyes, searching for mosquitoes like looking for them near an inkstone, and stared at Little Tiger: "You?... You!... You spare this Uncle Tong!..." He felt unable to cope with Little Tiger and had no choice but to beg for mercy.

"Hehe... Don't blame me, I'm just teasing you... The important thing, Uncle Tong, is that you point out a few detective dogs to me, I want to see what those guys look like as thieves..."

"Oh no, my little master," Tong Zhao shook his head even more violently, "You can't provoke them... If they move, everyone moves, we have nothing to do with it, but the common people will suffer!" This was Tong Zhao's experienced opinion.

"You two should stop teasing each other." Yaoqun waved her hand; "We still have a lot of serious things to do, and it's getting late..."

"That's right," Little Tiger took over the conversation again: "Uncle Tong, you know, Aunt Ji and I haven't eaten well for three days and three nights!..." He meant that they hadn't had a good meal for three days and three nights.

"Ai ya," Tong Zhao clapped his hands and looked at Little Tiger, "It's all because of you, ever since I saw the car stop, my soul hasn't returned to my body!... Okay... Let's do this. Big girl, do you think it's okay?..." He indicated that he had a plan.

"What to do?"... After saying that, Yaoqun sat up; she expected Tong Zhao to have a plan.

"I'll first call our trusted old maid to serve you, you two should first have a hygienic cleaning; take a bath, change clothes; then I'll ask the kitchen to prepare four big and four small dishes, to cleanse the dust and welcome you..., after eating, take a rest, at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, we have a 'special permit' car to send you on your way..., Erdaokou, Qishucha, we have newly added small stations in our old barracks... You, see things and act accordingly, get off the car and change horses, you two will 'enjoy the spring breeze with swift hooves', and you will be sure to arrive at the village early tomorrow morning before daybreak. What do you think?..." Tong Zhao announced his well-thought-out plan.

"No way!" Luoqun shook her head repeatedly; "I think we should do this..." She looked at Tong Zhao, rolling her eyes.

"Okay too." Tong Zhao didn't expect Yaoqun to have other plans, and he was stunned for a moment, as if he had some worries: "No mistake, I'll follow your orders, I'll certainly obey!" These words had a hidden meaning of fear that Yaoqun's actions were unpredictable, and he dared not take responsibility; because he knew that Yaoqun and Little Tiger were bold and dared to do anything.

Hu Bin's Ramblings

### Flying for Justice

â€” Shilang

â€” Dedicated to the New Air Force

The ultimate goal of mankind is to have freedom, peace, and a stable and prosperous life. All "weapons" should exist to ensure "peace."

The "Air Force" is of course no exception. Under its divine wings, the cry it emits should be to fight for justice and pay the price for the happiness and peace of mankind.

Ten years ago, on the "August 14th" Air Force Day, China's new air force flew into the sky over Shanghai in formations and bombed the Japanese "Izumo" warship in turn on the Huangpu River. All the citizens of Shanghai disregarded the danger to their lives and cheered at the sky where battleships, flames, and bullets were flying. This is precisely the call for human justice!

Isn't the image of flesh and blood being split and dripping with blood during the enemy's bombing of the South Railway Station enough to illustrate the brutality of "Sisite"?

During the eight years, isn't the massacre of major cities across the country by enemy planes enough to expose the cruelty and emotions of militarism?

During the bombing of Chongqing and the strafing of enemy planes during the retreat on the Xiang-Gui Road, when life and death were decided in an instant, can you not hate the tyranny of totalitarian countries?

Although the Second World War is over, we are about to face the enemy again and draft a peace treaty. However, there is only one truth. The air force pilots of the whole world, after this war, should be more clear that the air force under the wings of God should fly for justice, fight to combat aggression, and eliminate fascism.

### Mourning Comrade Huang Guangrun

â€” Zheng Liren

â€”â€”In memory of a hero who wore a tunic suit

Guangrun: It has been three whole years since you left this world. In these three long years, I have not forgotten you for a single day, because your death was heroic and great.

I remember very clearly that you often said to me that if your plane was hit by enemy anti-aircraft guns, you would definitely crash down and perish with the enemy. You also said: If your plane was injured in an aerial battle with an enemy plane, you would definitely ram and collide with the enemy plane, even if it meant perishing together. You were so brave and decisive, you were so "seeing death as homecoming."

But my opinion is a little different from yours. I once told you this: If my plane is injured, I must find a way to make a forced landing or, if absolutely necessary, parachute. I will not easily sacrifice my plane and myself, but leave a trace of vitality for the country, and fight and sacrifice for the second or third time. Although our methods are different, our goals are the same. We want to dedicate our lives to our country, we want to fight for the freedom and equality of our motherland.

From the War of Resistance to your sacrifice, we spent seven whole years on the front line. We lived together in Yunnan, inseparable and like brothers, and no one wanted to separate.

After graduation, we broke up. Everyone stepped onto the glorious national revolutionary battlefield and fought more forcefully for the motherland. I was transferred to the Sixth Brigade (Wenjiang), and you were assigned to the Fourth Brigade (Qionglai). From then on, we were separated, and the distance between us was lengthened. However, our hearts are still close together. Half a year later, you were transferred to Wenjiang. Your defense area was Yazi Lin, and my station was near the First General Station. Although we were less than five miles apart, our opportunities to meet were still so rare.

In the early morning of March 14, the 29th year, enemy planes attacked Chengdu in four waves. In that battle, our comrades died or went missing, and I was also unlucky, injured and forced to land on the sandbar in the Jialing River. The enemy also suffered enough. Eight planes were shot down on the spot by us. It was really a fierce battle. However, Guangrun: you were glorious after all, because you shot down one of them.

In the hospital, you saw my diagnosis report, the red and blue lines drawn by the doctors, and you knew my danger. You shed tears many times, and you begged the instructors bitterly to find a special way to save my life.

In the spring of the 30th year in Lanzhou, it should be the most memorable period in your life. There you met a Miss Shen. Pure love is a kind of comfort, encouragement, and help to you.

In the summer of the 33rd year, the War of Resistance entered the most difficult period. The enemy frantically concentrated the most elite main force and made a desperate bet. Our situation in the Central Plains was very unfavorable. Hengyang and Guilin were abandoned one after another, and the enemy approached Guiyang directly, shaking the capital. Your brigade and our brigade received an emergency order to depart separately to attack the enemy's position. You got the good news, forgetting the pain in your body (your toothache had not healed), you must set off. Because I was busy with the attack, I specially asked A Qi to persuade you: "There are many opportunities to attack the enemy! You can set off when your toothache is better." But you didn't listen to her, you resolutely put on your battle robe and happily set off. You led the team, piloting the 40P fighter plane, and flew to Jingmen to attack the enemy's anti-aircraft gun position. Who knew that in this one time, we would be separated from you forever!

Guangrun: You sacrificed gloriously for our motherland! Your death was heroic and great, and you left us many good examples of bravery and decisiveness.

Not long after the victory, I triumphantly returned from the Northwest battlefield, and passed by Jingmen. My A Ying, Yun'er, and Long'er specially brought a bunch of flowers to pay tribute to your loyal soul. From the mouths of the people of Jingmen, I learned that you were abiding by the promise of daily combat, leading three planes to dive into the enemy's position. It was too heroic!

With tears in my eyes, I looked sadly at the sky, Guangrun, you are an immortal hero!

Today, with our deep friendship in the past, I silently pay tribute to you!

36th, August 14th, Air Force Day, at the Taiwan Air Force Command.

American Restrictions on Gasoline

America's oil fields are mainly in Texas and California, and Houston, Texas, is a famous oil city. Where I live is between Houston and Galveston, surrounded by oil ponds and oil rigs, numbering in the thousands. Because the oil supply is abundant, like a surging tide, to avoid explosions, very high pipes are used to guide the gasoline into the air, burning all day long, like thousands of large candles, like King You lighting beacon fires. These American beacon fires are different after all, and can be considered the largest beacon fires in the world. If we were to calculate the losses, it would be hundreds of thousands of gallons per year, but this kind of loss is unavoidable and very worthwhile because American labor is too expensive. If a large amount of oil is exploited, the price of gasoline will inevitably fall further, falling to one or two cents per gallon, which would not only be unprofitable, but even wages would not be able to be paid. American oil merchants, in order to maintain the price of seven cents per gallon, would rather burn the excess gasoline to protect the minimum profit, just like South American coffee merchants, in order to protect the price of coffee, painfully throw millions of tons of coffee into the ocean. There are many types of gasoline in the United States. There are several gasoline pumps at gas stations, indicating the ingredients and prices. The lowest is seven cents per gallon, and the highest is one dime and two cents. You need a certificate to buy oil to prevent hoarding. However, smart Americans have come up with a way to save gasoline. Every four or five car owners form a group, using gasoline in rotation, consuming an average of one-quarter to one-fifth of the quota, and selling the remaining gasoline to people who cannot get gasoline. The American authorities divide car users into several levels, and allocate different amounts of gasoline according to their duties. Therefore, in addition to office work, if you want to enjoy yourself after work and go out for a drive, you don't have enough gasoline available. They save a little every day, and accumulate for a week before they can travel once. Generally speaking, the gasoline allocated by the government to various users is enough for the needs of official business, but there is absolutely no surplus for entertainment. Even the President of the United States will not be allocated enough gasoline, because the President's gasoline consumption has always been statistically accounted for. He cannot get a few more gallons of gasoline, let alone hoard and speculate. A country as rich as the United States, and produces such a large amount of gasoline, and the people use gasoline so sparingly, looking back at China, where some people use gasoline to wash the floor, what should you think?

### The Author of "I Chose Freedom" Kravchenko

â€” Hua

Pulling down the gray straw hat a bit, covering most of his face, and tightening the thick, black sunglasses, he hurriedly looked around. Seeing nothing, the cautious man came out of the Ministry of Justice, with tall police officers protecting him.

Even so, when he took out his pipe from his pocket, his hand was still trembling. News reporters jumped out, wanting to photograph him, he shrank back and told them not to photograph in Russian mixed with English. When the news reporters' cameras came towards him, he covered his mouth with his right hand.

This person was not acting. He was afraid of death.

His name is Viktor Kravchenko. In the Soviet Union, he committed the crime of treason. When the United States and the Soviet Union were fighting together in 1944, he publicly resigned from his position on the Soviet Purchasing Committee, attacked his government, and revealed all the domestic secrets. When asked why, he answered with only one sentence, which was the title of his best-selling book: "I Chose Freedom." For ten years, he gradually showed his dissatisfaction with communism. When he arrived in the United States, he woke up from a dream and resolutely decided to leave.

Last month, he testified before the US Congressional Committee Investigating Un-American Activities, stating all kinds of Soviet conspiracies. Although he was in extreme danger, even his friends did not know where he lived, and could only get some news from the publishing house that printed his book. However, he still spoke eloquently before the committee. He spoke Russian so fast that even the translator could not keep up. Sometimes he would even add a few awkward English sentences. He said:

"Every responsible Soviet representative in the United States is a political or economic spy."

"No one from the Soviet Union comes without a mission to collect confidential materials."

"There was a metallurgical expert in the Soviet Purchasing Committee named Kimoskin, who collected a lot of secret materials about the American aviation industry. The Soviet Union also collected detailed information about the American submarine industry."

"Don't think that the Soviet Union cannot make atomic bombs. Soviet propaganda says that their scientist Dr. Kabichai has been locked up in a concentration camp. This is a smokescreen."

"If something happens to Stalin, Molotov will come to power. The roles may change, but the play will continue."

"Travelers are more dangerous than communists, because the American government cannot prevent them."

Soviet UN representative Gromyko joked about Kravchenko's affairs:

"If a dog licks its belly when it has nothing to do, maybe many people will gather to watch."

The Soviet ambassador said:

"A traitor is a traitor after all."

Kravchenko was already terrified, but now it was even worse. The next day, he went to the Congressional Judiciary Subcommittee and asked to pass a bill to allow him to become an American citizen.

"I haven't been able to sleep for several nights. I have lost my wife, my father, my brother, and my homeland. I can't hold on anymore. I hope you can understand my situation and help me."

Note: Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" has been translated into Chinese by Qin Xuanjun, and published by Shanghai Minzhi Publishing House, and distributed by the Shanghai Branch of Independent Publishing House, and will be published on the 10th of this month.

### In Memory of Zhenzhang

â€” Cai Yiwen

â€”â€” Fifth in a series of introductions of martyred journalists

Every friend has endless longing and heartfelt memories of Zhenzhang, even though five or six years have passed since his martyrdom! !

Zhenzhang's quiet and demure demeanor is as vivid in my mind as if he were right before me. He never seemed angry; even when extremely frustrated, he would only show it with a flushed face and reddened ears. It is said that silent people are often passionate, and he was indeed such a person. I remember when we were both in Hangzhou, he lived on Pinghai Road, and three or five friends would often gather at his home, sharing meals and living together!

When he came to Shanghai, we worked at the same newspaper, seeing each other almost daily, and our friendship deepened. At that time, I had just gotten married and lived with my family on Haining Road. He would often visit me, and we would often play mahjong for amusement. One New Year's Eve, he personally went to a pawnshop on Shanxi Road and bought a set of mahjong tiles for two yuan, inviting two or three colleagues to play until the first day of the Lunar New Year.

Unfortunately, the Morning Post ceased publication, and we parted ways like swallows. I entered the business world, while he was invited by Mr. Mi Jifang of the Xinbao (literally New Report) to be the chief editor of the current affairs section. One year, when the Xinbao published a commemorative issue, he wrote an article titled "Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days," describing his arduous and diligent work at the Xinbao. Unexpectedly, the editor-in-chief, Yao Sufeng, heavily edited the article, changing the title to "One Day" (?). He came to my residence in Hongkou that night, frustrated, and told me about it. I sympathized with him and offered encouragement!

Soon after, Mr. Wang Qixi took charge of the editorial department of the Damei Evening News and invited Zhenzhang to help. At that time, Zhenzhang was feeling depressed and frustrated, so he resolutely accepted the offer and joined the Damei, never expecting that it would lead to his martyrdom!

After the enemy and puppet regime published the "blacklist," Zhenzhang's name was on it. Mr. Qixu secretly went to Hong Kong, while Zhenzhang stayed in Shanghai. The enemy and puppet regime's desire to capture the journalists who remained in Shanghai grew even more urgent. First, there was the murder of Zhu Xinggong and others, followed by daily letters warning him to report to the puppet "Special Operations Headquarters." As a result, Zhenzhang was cautious whenever he went out, but he was still unable to avoid being harmed by the enemy and puppet's henchmen.

On the evening of his assassination, I heard a news vendor shouting on the street, "Damei Evening News headline: Killed!" I hurriedly bought a copy, and the large photograph was indeed of Zhenzhang. Without reading the details, I rushed to Guangci Hospital to inquire about his condition, but the hospital refused to let me see him, saying that his injuries were too severe. I had no choice but to pray for his safety. Unexpectedly, within two days, I heard the news of his deathâ€”how sad!

The funeral was held on "September 13th," the day for disbursing Zhenzhang's military allowance, at the International Funeral Parlor. Apart from Bai Luosi and Gao Dexe from the Damei Evening News, who personally attended the funeral, only Brother Gu Junyuan and I, former colleagues from the Morning Post, were there. His mother, who already suffered from poor mental health, suffered multiple fainting spells due to this great shock. Her tragic state was enough to move even the most heartless person.

Two years after his martyrdom, his mother had him buried in Hongqiao Cemetery, next to the grave of another martyred journalist, Zhang Sixu. A certain woman, his former girlfriend, tirelessly managed and arranged everything, seeing the matter through to the end. This was also a repayment for Zhenzhang's sincerity in treating people during his lifetime. There was also Mr. Lu Pingda, who, despite being a stranger, showed admirable sincerity. He took care of all business matters. I would like to especially commend him.

Like the families of other martyred journalists, his family is very poor and struggling to make ends meet. His mother, deeply traumatized, constantly muttered to herself, facing his portrait day and night. A few days ago, I visited her with Brother Zhou Weixin at her three-story attic apartment in Tingyunli on Lafayette Road. We were immediately overcome with tears and inconsolable grief. All we could do was offer comfort.

Now, Weixin and I intend to contact his friends in Hangzhou and his former colleagues to launch a memorial meeting to discuss all outstanding matters, such as the erection of a tombstone, the support of his family, etc. I believe that the members of the "Call" and "Lion's Roar" societies in Hangzhou, as well as the colleagues from the Shanghai Morning Post, Xinbao, and Damei Evening News, will be happy to generously contribute!

Finally, I provide two contact addresses: (1) Zhou [blank] at the Social Affairs Bureau; (2) Cai Yiwen, Shenbao (literally Shanghai Report).
