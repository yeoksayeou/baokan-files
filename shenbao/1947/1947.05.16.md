### Provisional Legislative Yuan Passes Amendments to Laws Regarding the Election and Recall of Legislators and Supervisors: Temporary Motion to Crack Down on Election Fraud

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] The draft amendments to the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators and Supervisors were passed during the 325th regular session on the morning of the 15th. It can be said that all kinds of constitutional laws and implementing regulations have been passed, except for a portion still pending reconsideration and some details requiring further study. Today's regular session was chaired by President Sun, with over a hundred legislators in attendance. The discussion began with the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, with Liu Keshu and others raising questions about the election methods for occupational representatives, advocating that elections should be conducted by district. Otherwise, they argued, occupational groups in border areas would suffer too much. Deng Hongye reminded occupational representatives not to allow the election to be manipulated by a few monopolistic occupational groups. Ultimately, it was resolved to delete Article 8, paragraph 3, and provide detailed regulations in the appendix to avoid various disputes. Next, the discussion turned to the writing format of ballots, with Cheng Yuanzhen and others believing that the circle-selection method would be convenient. President Sun also agreed with this view, and it was resolved to change the original draft's method of writing names to the circle-selection method. The entire case, consisting of 69 articles, was passed after about an hour of discussion.

Next, the Law on the Election of Supervisors was discussed. According to the Constitution, supervisors are elected by the provincial and municipal councils, Mongolian and Tibetan local councils, and overseas Chinese groups according to the quota stipulated in Article 91 of the Constitution. Their nature is different from that of legislators, and the process is also easier than the former. The entire article was passed after a brief discussion.

Legislator Quota and Electoral District Table Mostly Approved

At this point, the issue of legislator quota allocation and electoral district division, which has been of most concern to all parties, was brought up during the meeting. The following five types were resolved and passed today: (1) Table of legislator quota allocation and electoral district division for Jiangsu and 17 other provinces; (2) Table of legislator quota allocation for Mongolia; (3) Table of legislator quota allocation for Tibet; (4) Table of legislator quota allocation for legislators elected by various ethnic groups in border areas; (5) Table of legislator quota allocation for provinces and municipalities not divided by district. Among them, the legislator quota allocation for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan provinces and Tibet is still to be readjusted. The legislator quota allocation for occupational groups and overseas Chinese nationals is pending submission of tables by the relevant authorities for separate decision, and therefore was not presented.

The total number of legislators for provinces and municipalities is 622, elected from 114 districts. During the discussion, Sun Jiulu raised questions about whether Jintan in Jiangsu should be included in the first or second district. Legislators from Zhejiang and Hunan also raised opinions on the district division of their respective provinces. It was resolved that the district division issues for the aforementioned provinces would be decided after discussion by the legislators from those provinces. All other provinces passed without issue. Jiangsu Province has 63 counties and cities, with a population of (36,469,321) people, and should produce 38 legislators, elected from 7 districts. Among them, only Jintan County's affiliation to the first or second district has not been finalized. The names of the counties and cities belonging to each district are listed below: First District: Zhenjiang, Jurong, Danyang, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, etc., 11 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Zhenjiang. Second District: Wujin, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan (undetermined), etc., 7 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Wujin. Third District: Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, Qingpu, Jiading, Baoshan, Jinshan, Shanghai, Songjiang, Fengxian, Chuansha, Nanhui, Chongming, etc., 14 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Wuxian. Fourth District: Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Taixing, Jingjiang, etc., 6 counties, electing 5 legislators, office located in Nantong. Fifth District: Dongtai, Xinghua, Baoying, Taixian, Yangzhou, Funing, Yancheng, etc., 7 counties, electing 6 legislators, office located in Dongtai. Sixth District: Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Guanyun, Ganyu, Donghai, Shuyang, Lianyungang City, etc., 8 counties and cities, electing 4 legislators, office located in Huaiyin. Seventh District: Xuzhou City, Tongshan, Dangshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Tengxian, Suining, Siyang, Suqian, Peixian, etc., 10 counties and cities, electing 5 legislators, office located in Xuzhou City.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] During the meeting on the morning of the 15th, Jian Guansan made a temporary motion to separately formulate a "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud" to limit the occurrence of election fraud involving bribery. His reason was that with the constitution about to be implemented, various elections would officially begin. This is the harbinger of our implementation of democracy and is of great importance. Rumor has it that among the candidates, there are many fat-bellied merchants with overflowing wealth who are engaging in campaigning with their vast financial resources. The amount of money they have is counted in tons, which cannot be matched by those who are talented but have empty pockets. Jian pointed out that some estimate that the social expenses and entertainment expenses required to participate in the legislator election cannot be done without 30 million yuan. How can ordinary people afford it? In order to prevent the election from being monopolized by fat-bellied merchants in the future, it is necessary to formulate a separate law. Huang Tongchang and others expressed great support for this suggestion and mentioned that in addition to preventing bribery, behaviors that threaten with guns should also be strictly prevented. It was resolved at the meeting that the case would first be referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for study and then to the plenary session for discussion.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses Key to Peace Talks: Whether or Not They Can Be Resumed Depends Entirely on the CCP's Thoughts

[Central News Agency, this city] The newly appointed National Government Committee member Wang Chonghui yesterday issued an opinion on the brewing of the peace movement, saying that whether or not peace talks can be resumed depends entirely on the CCP's decision. The government has always believed that the door to peace has not been closed and hopes that peace can be achieved as soon as possible. The fact that the National Government Committee still reserves seats for the CCP shows that the government is sincere. Achieving peace cannot be achieved by one side's wishful thinking. The CCP must also be sincere in order for it to be realized.

### Legislators Call for Peace

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Legislator Zhou Yizhi and 19 others submitted a temporary emergency motion to the general assembly on the 15th, calling for peace. Due to time constraints, the case was left for discussion at the next general assembly.

### Students from Central University and Other Schools Gather at the Ministry of Education to Petition

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Students from Central University, together with students from the National Conservatory of Music and the Drama Academy, about 2,000 people in total, collectively went to the Ministry of Education to petition at 9 a.m. on the 15th. They held flags and slogans, and wrote on the walls along the way in chalk, mostly saying: "We demand minimum nutrition," "We want to eat our fill," etc. The order along the way was very good. After arriving at the Ministry, student representatives Wang Zhude and eight others met with Vice Minister Tian. The students demanded that the nutrition standard be raised and that the allowance for non-staple food be increased to 103,200 yuan. Vice Minister Tian explained that the public funding system was originally intended to subsidize the poor and the various difficulties that have been maintained by the Ministry of Education. He also said that the treatment has already been readjusted, and the allowance for non-staple food has been increased to 48,000 yuan, which, together with 2.3 dou of rice, will total nearly 100,000 yuan, which is higher than the food allowance for general public education personnel, and advised the students to return to school. The student representatives informed the students, who all expressed dissatisfaction and swarmed to see the Minister. Because of the crowd, the order was immediately chaotic, resulting in the breaking of several office windows. At 10:40, Dean Zhu arrived at the Ministry and immediately spoke to all the students from the crowd using a megaphone, generally saying the same points as Vice Minister Tian. He also said that if students demand such an increase in the allowance for non-staple food, not only would the Minister not agree, but the public would also hardly sympathize. The students did not get what they wanted and went to the Executive Yuan to petition. Vice President Wang Yunwu and Secretary-General Gan Naiguang replied to the students that raising the standard involves the national education funding budget and must be resolved through a meeting. However, they agreed that the allowance for non-staple food for the second half of this month could be advanced according to the new standard. The students stayed at the Yuan until about 5 p.m. before dispersing.

### The Ministry of Education Deeply Hopes That Students Will Not Easily Believe Rumors

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education recently told reporters that there have been many causes for the recent disturbances in various schools, but most of them are due to someone spreading rumors, creating an unstable situation in the education community. Specifically, for example, the Ministry of Education has not made any decisions regarding the recent renaming of Jiaotong University and the merger of the Management College, as well as the rumor in the Shanghai medical community that the pharmacy school will be changed to a five-year system. The students concerned have taken action out of love for their schools, and events such as petitions have occurred. However, the Ministry of Education has conducted thorough research and consulted experts for any decision and will never act rashly. It is deeply hoped that students across the country will not easily believe rumors and will focus on their studies.

Our reporter specially visited Zuo's residence on the evening of the 15th to ask about his feelings about the Ministry of Agriculture. Zuo said: "I value the concept of talent. Anyone who is talented will be invited to come. Technical personnel, whether from within or outside the party, are treated equally.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 15th] Fu Zuoyi told reporters on the evening of the 15th that the Taiyuan battle is part of the overall war situation. The military and political authorities in the area are responding to changes with a calm attitude, and the people are also very calm, believing that they will be able to defend it.

### Situation in Southern Shanxi Improves

National Army Advances Towards Laiyuan in Chahar

[Our Taiyuan Bureau, 14th] The situation in southern Shanxi has improved. Transportation between Anyi and Yuncheng has been restored. Reinforcements of fresh troops are also about to arrive.

### Main Force of Communist Army Gathers in Yimeng Mountain Area: National Army Is Encirclement and Annihilating Them: Ye Jianying Arrives in Shandong to Replace Chen Yi, Confirmed by Sources

[Our Jinan Bureau, 15th] A part of the main force of the Communist army in Shandong, about four columns, has fled from east of Laiwu and Xintai and gathered near Yishui. In order to annihilate their main force, the National Army has been engaged in fierce battles on the periphery of Yishui from the 13th to the 15th. In the areas of Tushikou in Laiwu and near Mingshui, the National Army has focused on clearing up scattered Communist troops in the surrounding areas in recent days.

[Our Xuzhou Bureau, 15th] The National Army in the Yimeng Mountain area has launched a large-scale annihilation battle against the main force of the Communist army for several days. The Communist army's new offensive has been disastrous. The main force of the Communist army in Shandong, with more than 100,000 troops, has had its strength depleted by two-thirds due to repeated attacks by the National Army. As of the 15th, the number of Communist troops killed by tanks alone has reached 4,000. The National Army's rapid forces have now surrounded the two invading Communist armies and are bravely pursuing and annihilating them in the Hongshizhuang and Liujiazhuang areas, 10 kilometers north of Heyang Town, expanding the results of the battle.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The development of the war situation in Shandong has been highly valued here recently. After the Communist army's East China Field Army lost its second base in Laiwu after Linyi, it dispersed to Boshan to collect the remnants and formed two groups of troops, left and right. The right wing of its troops in Boshan was pursued by the National Army taking advantage of the victory, and it was difficult to escape. The left wing of its troops in Yishan launched an all-out attack, also seeking a decisive battle, giving the National Army an excellent opportunity. Looking at the strength of the Communist army, the so-called East China Field Army is relatively strong. If the National Army can seize this fleeting opportunity and annihilate them thoroughly, it will not only bring the war in Shandong to an end, but also shorten the end of the overall suppression of the rebellion.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] It has been confirmed by all parties that the CCP has sent Ye Jianying to Shandong to preside over military and political affairs. After arriving in Shandong, Ye gave a speech to the Communist army's East China Field Army, roughly saying: "I have been assigned to Shandong to handle the aftermath of General Chen (referring to Chen Yi) and to preside over the battle in Shandong in the future."

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] Weixian News: Zhang Deyao and 48 other soldiers of the 3rd Company of the Changnan Independent Battalion of the Communist army, seeing that the Communist army was violating the will of the people and betraying the motherland, took advantage of the Communist army cadres sleeping soundly on the evening of the 7th of this month, revolted together, seized 8 rifles, more than 10 hand grenades, and more than 40 sets of military uniforms, and surrendered to the 8th Army of the National Army.

### The Situation in Jilin Province Eases, While Fierce Battles Rage in Various Parts of Liaodong

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] Yesterday, the National Army in Jilin launched an attack, successfully deceiving and driving back the Communist forces that had invaded the Xin Jilin Railway Station, located ten kilometers north of Jilin City. The Communist forces retreated and gathered at Datun, where the National Army is intensifying its encirclement and annihilation. This group of Communist forces numbers approximately 2,000. This morning, the Communist forces fired over 500 artillery shells at the highlands south of Datun, causing considerable casualties to two platoons of the National Army. A unit of over 600 men from the Communist 17th Division was surrounded in a certain village southeast of Datun and has been completely annihilated. The situation in Jilin has begun to ease.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] In the past twelve hours, the battles north of Jilin and within the Huai'de area have been the most intense. The famous chemical factory in the Xin Jilin area (only a dozen li from Jilin City) was once occupied by the Communist forces but was subsequently driven back. It is generally believed that another battle in Jilin may erupt, but its purpose is only to contain and distract. Fierce battles raged all night yesterday in the suburbs of Huai'de, ultimately resulting in the National Army fighting hard to repel them and capturing over thirty prisoners.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] The fierce battle at Huai'de lasted day and night. Over ten thousand Communist troops launched a fierce attack but failed, suffering heavy casualties. Over five hundred Communist troops once stormed into the city last night but were completely annihilated. Fierce fighting continues in the northern suburbs. However, the Communist forces' morale has been greatly diminished. An investigation of the battle results reveals that the Communist forces suffered over two thousand casualties, with over forty captured alive, along with several machine guns and a hundred rifles.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] The Jiangmifeng Railway Station, east of Jilin City, was once surrounded by over three thousand Communist troops. The battle was very fierce, and the Communist forces suffered heavy casualties. By the morning of the 15th, they had retreated to areas more than five li outside of Jiangmifeng.

[Report from our Panyang Office, 15th] A portion of the Communist forces attacked Gongzhuling. The situation in two locations north of Gongzhuling, Bianjiabao and others, is currently unknown.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 15th] The situation in Jiangmifeng and Yaogang, two strongholds between Jilin and Laoye Ridge, is currently unclear after confused fighting. However, Wula Street, northeast of Laoye Ridge, is being firmly defended by the National Army.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] Communist forces surrounding the outskirts of Nong'an have begun to withdraw, leaving a small number of troops along the line of Xinglongzhen, Shilibao, and Daqingbao. The withdrawal of the Communist forces clearly indicates that they are increasing their forces towards Huai'de.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] A large contingent of Communist cavalry, who had roamed south of Tian Nong'an, has approached Datun (38 li from Changchun) and Taojiatun (80 li from Changchun), two stations approximately ten li apart between Changchun and Gongzhuling. Furthermore, near Huajia Bridge on the Changtao Railway, several hundred Communist cavalrymen were discovered on the 14th, intending to seize an opportunity to sabotage this most difficult engineering project of the Changtao Railway, cutting off the connection between Changchun and Nong'an. The National Army is on high alert.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 15th] A small number of Communist troops were discovered in Dajiagou, north of, on the morning of the 15th, with unclear intentions. Furthermore, over two thousand Communist troops infiltrated Wangjiadian yesterday afternoon, intending to attack Huadian. Over two hundred Communist cavalrymen from Lala Tun, northeast of Nong'an, harassed Caojiachuankou, southeast of Nong'an, on the morning of the 15th.

[Report from our Changchun Office, 14th] Passenger trains on the Changji, Changnong, Changde, and Changshen lines are still running smoothly. A small number of Communist troops were discovered operating in Datun, northeast of Jiutai on the Changji line. The largest number of travelers are coming from the south of Nong'an, and grain prices in Nong'an have plummeted.

[Report from our Shenyang Office, 14th] The Communist forces in the Northeast are making overall aggressive movements. In addition to expanding their invasion in the Jilin-Changchun area, Communist forces near Liaoyuan, Meihekou, Qinhuangdao, and Pulandian have launched containment attacks one after another in the past thirty-six hours. The National Army has launched counterattacks separately and is closely monitoring the overall intentions of the Communist forces. Communist forces in Jinzhou advanced towards Pulandian on the morning of the 14th. The National Army immediately counterattacked, and a fierce battle is currently underway.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] Battles in the Liaodong area have erupted, and fierce fighting is ongoing in various locations as of the 14th.

Many privately hidden firearms left behind by the Japanese have been seized. Currently, the security forces in Taiwan Province consist of two brigades, one independent regiment, and one military police regiment, and the strength is sufficient. There will definitely be no problems with the future of security.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Provincial Political Construction Association and five other groups issued a statement regarding future administrative policies in Taiwan Province, putting forward four points of hope: (1) Regarding the fact that certain officials considered unsatisfactory by some Taiwanese compatriots still hold important positions, objections are raised. (2) Regarding the monopoly and trade systems, it is hoped that they will be completely abolished, and freedom of speech will be respected. (3) The government's promise should be fulfilled, and local autonomy should be implemented as soon as possible. (4) It is hoped that the central government officials, elders, and brothers across the country will remember that the six million Taiwanese compatriots all belong to the descendants of the Yellow Emperor and their magnificent, loyal national spirit of the past three hundred years, and that they will be properly comforted based on this.

Then, Huang Chaoqin, the Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, delivered a welcome speech, saying that Wei was an enlightened statesman and praising his achievements in diplomacy. Wei then gave a brief three-minute broadcast, briefly stating: In the future, he will make the greatest effort to work together with everyone to build a new Taiwan. The Taiwan Provincial Government will officially be established at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning, and the first Provincial Government meeting will be held at 10:00 AM.

Wei Daoming Receives Reporters and Announces Measures to Govern Taiwan

[Another Telegram] Wei Daoming held his first press conference in Taiwan at 3:00 PM today, announcing that the focus of all future measures would be on maintaining stability. He stated: "Whether it is the promotion of democratic politics or economic development, it must be achieved in a state of stability and security. What we need should be orderly democracy, and democracy does not mean chaos or tyranny. In the future, in promoting provincial administration, we will respect public opinion, and everything will be based on the law as a standard for both the government and the people to abide by. The central government attaches great importance to the economy of Taiwan Province and will do its best to support the province and seek development. At the same time, we will also promote a policy of economic freedom under the principle of not harming economic stability, so that the people and the government can jointly shoulder the important task of prospering Taiwan."

### Kiyoshi Chiyono's Testimony Involves the Anti-Communist Agreement, Stating That Zhang Qun Opposed the Specialization of North China

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 15th] According to Kiyoshi Chiyono, a former translator at the Japanese Embassy in China who testified in the Far East Military Tribunal today as a witness for Tojo and the other twenty-four war criminals, Zhang Qun, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in 1936 and is now the President of the Executive Yuan, told Kawagoe Shigeru, the Japanese Ambassador to China at the time, that he greatly approved of China and Japan signing an anti-communist agreement, but requested that the conclusion of this agreement not harm China's sovereignty. During the meeting between Zhang and Kawagoe, he expressed agreement with Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, Kiyoshi stated that Zhang insisted that it be based on the principle of reciprocity and could not recognize Japan's administrative specialization in North China.

### Details of the Meeting Between Wang Jingwei and Hiranuma, etc.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Shimizu, a translator for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, testified at the Far East Military Tribunal today, describing the discussions between Wang Jingwei and Japanese leaders Prime Minister Hiranuma and Army Minister Itagaki in 1939. He stated that on June 10, Wang met with Hiranuma and proposed the establishment of a new government, with himself as the leader, and told Hiranuma that there were three ways for Japan to resolve the war against China: (1) Not to negotiate with the National Government, but to contact "wise men in the opposition"; (2) To negotiate directly with the National Government; (3) To contact people from all sides who hope for peace between China and Japan, regardless of whether they are employed by the National Government or belong to which party. Shimizu further quoted Wang as saying that he could not publicly express his position, but would assist "behind the scenes." Wang also suggested that he was willing to mediate between the National Government and Japan, but "if the third method is adopted, then I am willing to personally promote the peace movement and become the central figure of the peace movement." Hiranuma immediately encouraged Wang, but said: "This is a Chinese problem." Itagaki agreed with Wang's formation of a government and discussed the form of the flag, imitating the Chinese national flag, but the flag must bear the words "Peace and Anti-Communism." Wang also met with Konoe and discussed Wang's regime re-advocating the Three Principles of the People. Konoe and other Japanese leaders assured Wang that Japan had no intention of monopolizing China's economy. The court adjourned early today to study twenty-four documents submitted by the prosecution opposing the defendants, which contained the speeches of Wang and other puppets. Reliable sources said that if these documents are rejected, the defendants will likely begin to defend themselves regarding their relationship with the Soviet Union tomorrow.

### Work Related to the Three Gorges Hydropower Project Temporarily Suspended Due to Budget Cuts and Suspension of Funding Due to Tightened National Expenditure Budget

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Since the Resource Commission was ordered to carry out the on-site surveys and related work for the Three Gorges Hydropower Project in accordance with Savage's recommendations, it has been two years.

The Commission is currently notifying all parties to comply and proceed with the end, and is drafting a report on the information obtained, so that there will be something to learn from when the follow-up work is continued in the future.

Editorial

### Hopes for the Government of Taiwan Province

The establishment of the Taiwan Provincial Government is officially set for today. Chairman Wei Daoming already flew to Taiwan yesterday. Various organizations, groups, and schools in Taipei have decided to hold a commemorative meeting today to celebrate the establishment of the new provincial government and to welcome Chairman Wei Daoming's arrival. Since the "February 28th Incident," the Taiwanese political situation and its current state have been matters of great concern for the Chinese people. Now that there is a renewal of personnel in Taiwan and a change in public opinion, we naturally have boundless hopes for the new Taiwanese political landscape and the measures of the new Taiwan Provincial Government, and we place these hopes on Chairman Wei and the people of Taiwan.

Although Taiwan is an island isolated overseas, its relationship with the motherland dates back thousands of years. Its people and culture share the same origin as the motherland, and its national economy is integrated with that of the motherland. In the past, Zheng Chenggong's expulsion of the Dutch, Tang Jingsong and Qiu Fengjia's resistance against Japan, and the half-century struggle for restoration by patriots after Taiwan's fall, all represent epic events that could move heaven and earth, causing even ghosts and spirits to weep. This time, with the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Taiwan, wiping away the shame of the Sino-Japanese War and returning Taiwanese compatriots to the embrace of the motherland, people's hearts were excited, and the whole country rejoiced. Who knew that within a year, due to the economy not returning to normal and the reorganization of the military not being reasonable enough, the "February 28th Incident" was brewing, and a spark started a prairie fire, which was a misfortune for Taiwan and a misfortune for the motherland. The aftermath of the incident was quickly spread both at home and abroad. Although the reports were inevitably exaggerated, the factors that caused the incident were numerous. While the system and personnel cannot be entirely blamed, it is clear that the system and personnel were not suitable for the current situation and needed to be changed and adjusted. For the past two months, the central government has handled the situation with caution. In addition to sending Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi to inspect and comfort the people, the government also decided to abolish the administrative governor system based on Bai's report and recommendations, establish the Taiwan Provincial Government according to the current provincial government organization law, and appoint Wei Daoming, a civilian official, as chairman. At the same time, drawing reference from the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, deputy positions were established for the chairman and various offices, broadly recruiting local talent to jointly participate in the government, in order to bridge the gap between the government and the people. This major reform is not only a prelude to refreshing Taiwan's politics but also sets a precedent for civilians to lead provincial affairs. Therefore, since the announcement of the political reform and personnel adjustment, it has given great excitement to people both at home and abroad, and Taiwanese compatriots have welcomed the central government's wise measures with joy. We have always been extremely concerned about the political situation and current state of Taiwan. Today, with the establishment of the new provincial government and a fresh start, we would like to offer some opinions on the political situation of Taiwan and the reform of the current state.

First, Taiwan has the foundation for local autonomy, and local autonomy should be realized as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang expressed on March 10th that local autonomy in Taiwan Province could be completed ahead of schedule. It is hoped that after the establishment of the new provincial government, an important task should be the preparation for local autonomy, the guidance of universal suffrage, and the eventual election of local officials. Based on the experience of the "February 28th Incident," most Taiwanese compatriots, except for a very small number with biased attitudes who were incited by the Japanese or the communists to say "drive out the mainlanders" and "down with the half-mainlanders," still understand the big picture, and there is no shortage of discerning people among the populace. In the past, the estrangement between Taiwanese compatriots and the government, which led to incidents, was due to the lack of political opportunities for Taiwanese compatriots. With the establishment of the new government, many talented people from the province will participate in the provincial government. If local autonomy begins and local talents are guided to serve the local area, it would be very much in line with the spirit of democratic politics and would allow local politics to develop upward.

Second, economic reform is an important plan for Taiwan Province today. Before Chairman Wei left Shanghai for Taiwan, he said, "Regarding the economy, there are no plans to reform the currency system for the time being. However, given the special local economic environment, whether to fully allow free trade after the abolition of the monopoly system or to impose slight restrictions under the principle of economic stability must be decided after on-the-ground investigation." This shows that Wei has a cautious attitude toward local economic reform and will handle it after inspecting and listening to the opinions of the people upon his arrival. According to our research, Taiwan's monopoly system, whether in terms of methods or technology, hinders the development of trade to some extent. It is hoped that the first step in economic reform will be the gradual abolition of the monopoly system and the promotion of conditional free trade, so that goods can flow freely between the mainland and Taiwan, with exports exchanged for imports. This will not only invigorate the national economy but also develop the province's industry and commerce, thereby solving some of the unemployment panic, which will be beneficial to social stability.

Third, solicit public opinion and establish a democratic spirit. Since the "February 28th Incident," the relationship between the government and the people has never been fully integrated. Now that the new government has been established, in order to win the hearts of the people, it should solicit public opinion, seek out the people's hidden suffering, and use it as a guide for policy implementation. It is hoped that the people arrested by the Chief Executive's Office after the incident will be treated leniently; it is hoped that some newspapers that have been suspended will be allowed to resume publication freely, to awaken the Taiwanese people. Furthermore, some radical people and retired soldiers who participated in the "February 28th Incident" are now fleeing and hiding in the deep mountains, and the national army is preparing to search for them. The deep mountains of Taiwan are inhabited by the indigenous people, and if the fugitives hide among the indigenous tribes, it will inevitably lead to endless trouble in the future. It is hoped that the new government and the garrison authorities will take a lenient approach and use methods of appeasement to give them a path to self-renewal. Otherwise, if it drags on for a long time, it will inevitably affect social stability. As for the issue of the future for retired soldiers, the former Chief Executive's Office held discriminatory attitudes. It is hoped that in the future, they will be guided into the right path through education and livelihood. If the provincial government can do this, it is believed that the gap between officials and the people can be eliminated, and any ideological contradictions can be resolved.

Fourth, the importance of education is also greatly related to Taiwan in the future. In the past half-century, Taiwanese compatriots have been immersed in the poison of divisive education by the Japanese, and their understanding of the motherland is not deep enough. Since the recovery, the difference in language between Taiwanese compatriots and mainlanders has caused some misunderstandings. It is hoped that in the future, the provincial government will make special efforts in primary and secondary school education and in the education of the national language, literature, and history. It is especially hoped that talents from all quarters will be recruited to come to Taiwan to promote this, in order to change the general Taiwanese perception of the motherland. This is a fundamental solution.

In conclusion, the reform of Taiwan's politics and the construction of new policies involve countless details and are certainly not limited to these. However, for now, we must strive for self-improvement and seek nothing else. We hope, with the attitude of "examining ourselves," that the new Taiwan Provincial Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wei, will use a new spirit and a new style to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, pacify and appease the people, promote autonomy, and establish democracy, so as to comfort the Taiwanese compatriots' longing for the motherland and their sincerity.

Taixing

Zhang Pengju, the communist fake county magistrate of Taixing, and Lu Wenyuan, the director of the Finance and Economics Bureau, were previously captured by the national army and escorted to a certain unit in Huangqiao. It is now learned that the unit, in response to repeated requests from the masses, executed Zhang Pengju and Lu Wenyuan by shooting on the outskirts of Huangqiao on the 11th.

Kunshan

Over a thousand villagers from Xin Town, Hanpo Village, and others in this county, due to the unfavorable weather and the rotting of seedlings and a lack of resources for replanting, were panicking. On the afternoon of the 15th, led by the village chiefs, they came to the city to petition the county government for relief. Representatives were sent to state the situation, and Secretary Sun, Section Chief Lu of the Social Affairs Department, and Police Chief Tang did their best to encourage them. The villagers firmly demanded concrete measures for relief, and no decision could be made for the moment. Later, the county government agreed to find a way to provide relief immediately, and they dispersed around 5 p.m. However, when there were many people and it was noisy, the security team soldiers fired several shots into the air to maintain order, causing a temporary disturbance, which was quickly calmed down.

Jiading

At around 8 p.m. on the 13th, 25 prisoners escaped from the local court's detention center in this county. After the authorities discovered this, they took guns and chased after them, killing robber Chen Ah-san on the spot and capturing Bao Xuegen and Jun Tai. The rest escaped over the city walls.

Haining

A passenger bus traveling from Hangzhou to Haining broke down on the 13th along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway.

### Senate Passes US Foreign Relief Bill with Overwhelming Majority, House Amendment Fails

[United Press International, Washington, 14th] The Senate today approved President Truman's original bill of 350 million US dollars for relief to China and Europe by a vote of 79 to 4. The House of Representatives decided to cut this relief fund to 200 million US dollars, which was rejected by the Senate. The Senate bill also stipulates that relief food and medicine must be labeled with the words "Donated by the United States." This bill has now been sent to the Senate and House conference committee for review to adjust the differences between the two houses. The bill does not list the names of the recipient countries, but according to Secretary of State Marshall, most of it will be used to relieve China, Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste, with only 15 million US dollars reserved for emergency relief elsewhere.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The Senate continued to discuss a bill on US relief to China, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste in the amount of 350 million US dollars after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. After a vigorous appeal by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, it was immediately passed by a vote of 79 to 4. Vandenberg said: "The Senate's approval of this bill is necessary to prevent famine in war-stricken countries and to save the moral, political, and social impact after the war." An amendment to reduce the relief funds to 200 million US dollars was also rejected after Vandenberg strongly opposed it. Since the House of Representatives has already passed a bill reducing the relief funds to 200 million US dollars, the Senate and House conference committee will be responsible for reconciling the differences between the bills passed by the two houses. Congressional sources expect the relief funds to eventually amount to 300 million yuan.

### US Government to Submit New Aid Plan to South Korea to Congress

[United Press International, Washington, 14th] Although the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea, the US government is still accelerating its plan to provide economic aid to South Korea, requesting Congress to approve the use of 200 million US dollars. According to authoritative sources, the government will submit this plan to Congress "at the earliest" possible time. According to official sources, the US aid plan in the US-occupied area of Korea is flexible, so that it can be adapted to the same measures taken by the Soviet Union if unification is achieved in South and North Korea.

### British Side Eagerly Hopes for the Realization of Korean Unification

They fear that further delays may lead to the irreconcilable nature of communism in North Korea and capitalism in South Korea, because before Korea achieves complete independence, Britain is also one of the four powers responsible for joint trusteeship.

### Hodge Predicts Success for US-Soviet Resumption of Negotiations

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 15th] Lieutenant General Hodge issued the following statement on the convening of the US-Soviet Joint Committee: "I have just received instructions from the US government to prepare for the US-Soviet Joint Committee on May 20. The sound development of Korea depends on the sincere cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. I am as pleased as the Korean people about the reopening of the Joint Committee, and I am willing to do my best to ensure that the Joint Committee achieves success and indirectly contributes to Asia, regardless of any difficulties. Finally, I hope that the Korean people will work together for the future of Asia."

### Mountbatten Recalled to Country, British Cabinet Forms Special Committee to Draft Procedures for Indian Round Table Conference, Nehru Proposes Partition Ideas

[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has been recalled to the country to discuss with the government how to return power to the Indian people. Mountbatten is scheduled to return to New Delhi before June 2.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Regarding the fact that Indian Governor Mountbatten will convene leaders of various Indian political parties in Simla to hold a round table conference, the British Cabinet held a meeting to discuss it and immediately decided to form a special committee composed of Prime Minister Attlee, Secretary of Commerce Cripps, Minister of Defense Alexander, and Lord Listowel, Minister of Indian Affairs, to be responsible for drafting a plan regarding the procedures for the round table conference. The purpose of this round table conference is to determine the conditions for Britain's withdrawal from India. According to Indian sources here, the real reason for the postponement of the round table conference is that the British government received a letter from Nehru a few days ago and needs to study it. The domestic side said: "If the plan proposed by the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, to establish an independent Islamic state is accepted, then Hindustan will refuse to help it defend itself when Pakistan is attacked." The Congress Party is willing to give the Muslim League a considerable degree of independence, but still hopes to maintain the unity of India. According to well-informed sources, Lord Ismay, Mountbatten's chief of staff, may bring back a solution based on this letter when he returns to India soon.

### Wallace Writes Extensively About New World Reconstruction Plan

[Reuters, New York, 14th] Former US Vice President Wallace wrote in his edited "New Republic Magazine," suggesting that a world reconstruction plan be established based on US resources and managed by United Nations agencies. His plan aims to maintain world peace and maintain the stability of the US economy, with international banks raising funds and UN agencies responsible for implementation. Wallace said: "The time has come to try to solve the world's needs from a humanitarian standpoint. It is estimated that the capital needed for the world's postwar reconstruction in the next ten years will reach 150 billion US dollars. The United States accounts for nearly 40% of the world's production capacity and is the only country that can invest abroad, so it should provide other countries with most of their required imports. To restore the pre-war living standards of Europe and Asia, the United States needs to export 5 billion US dollars of materials annually for five consecutive years, and raising the living standards of Eastern Europe to be equal to those of Western Europe also requires a similar amount. Raising the living standards of 1 billion people in Asia to be equal to those of Western Europe requires exporting more than approximately 100 billion US dollars of US materials within ten years." Wallace believes that food negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union are a necessary condition for the success of this plan.

There is only one point on which the two sides disagree. If the United Nations investigation proves that the two races cannot live together peacefully, then I agree to divide the holy land into two, with separate Arab and Jewish states.

He pointed out that the Americas, the Soviet Union, and Britain are such regional organizations, and the United States of Europe must be the fourth regional organization, because these four are the pillars of world peace. He believes that the German problem must be solved first to prevent German thought from turning to rebellion and revenge. He advocates that Britain and France must work together in a friendly manner to bring Germany back into the embrace of Europe, and Britain and France must also make Italy do so. As for the political and natural boundaries of the United States of Europe, Churchill said, "We do not intend to exclude countries whose territories are outside Europe." Churchill finally denied that the establishment of the United States of Europe was a conspiracy against the Soviet Union.

Han, still holding a one or two-year-old infant, remained unflinching while listening to the sentence, but requested two points from the court: (1) Because of her appendicitis and dental disease, and the child's foot disease, could she request medical treatment? (2) Could the court allow her to write a poem to present to Madame Chiang Kai-shek? Both were granted. Han immediately wrote the poem in court, writing it in Japanese. The general meaning was that she had lived in China for twenty years and had been a "nanny for Chinese refugees" during the war. She expressed her dissatisfaction with the current sentence, that her two-year-old child was with her in prison, and that her six beloved children were still in the Northeast with no news of them. She requested Madame Chiang Kai-shek's compassion, etc. After writing, she was escorted back to the women's prison by the bailiff. (The attached picture shows Han writing the poem in court, taken by the China News Agency.)

When someone carrying a large amount of money passes by, seven or eight of them swarm around him to exchange money. The carrier, seeking convenience, is often happy to exchange. After the exchange, they scatter in a hurry. By the time the victim realizes he has been cheated, it is too late to catch them. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted the case for fraud. The defendants all pleaded guilty at the District Court yesterday. Sentencing is set for the 19th.

Letter to the Editor

Having recently read the report in your newspaper on May 15 regarding the resolution of the dispute between our industry representatives and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau over business locations, it does not correspond to the facts. Wang Zhaohuai, Director of the Police Department of the Bureau, invited representatives from Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou to Shanghai to mediate as a third party. As of now, negotiations are still underway. The statement that a complete resolution has been reached is not true, and our industry has not ceased operations to date. We respectfully request a correction. Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Transportation Industry Association

### Lawyer Accused; Files Counterclaim; Demands Compensation for Damage to Reputation of 600 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lawyer Wang Yigong was accused of defamation by Li Yin'nan, owner of the Huashangtai Customs Brokerage. Wang filed a counterclaim. The case was heard in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff, Huashangtai, accused Fang Wencong of encroaching on housing at 16 Shanyuan Lane, Tianjin Road. Fang hired lawyer Wang Yigong to defend him. As a result, Fang Wencong was found not guilty by the District Court. Because Li Yin'nan believed that Wang made defamatory remarks against the plaintiff in court, he sued Wang for defamation. Wang's counterclaim stated that "the elements of defamation must include the intention to damage another person's reputation. If the lawyer is threatened with defamation simply for performing his duties, this trend will destroy the integrity of the legal profession." It also stated: "The plaintiff's actions have actually violated Article 169 of the Criminal Law regarding false accusations. We respectfully request the honorable court to pronounce the defendant not guilty and order the counterclaim defendant to compensate for damages to his reputation in the amount of 600 million yuan, and to publish the judgment in three major daily evening newspapers for three days to compensate for the loss."

### Subsidy for Shanghai's Power Equipment: Large-Scale Power Plant Under Preparation, Executive Yuan Replies to the Senate

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Senate recently received a reply from the Executive Yuan regarding its proposal to remedy Shanghai's power equipment situation, stating in brief: "Regarding the request to order the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee to plan a large-scale power plant, the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau Preparatory Office was originally established with the aim of remedying the power needs of the Shanghai area. It has now surveyed and designated Longhua Mouth in Shanghai as the new base for power generation and is carrying out preparatory work. It has also sent personnel to Japan to negotiate the dismantling and relocation of 53,000 kW of power generation equipment. Once the machinery arrives, it will be actively installed. Regarding increasing the power generation equipment of Shanghai's various power plants, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, together with the local competent authorities, has been supervising and assisting in actively repairing the existing equipment of various plants and purchasing new machinery. As for subsidizing the various Chinese-owned power plants, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has successively approved loans. Regarding the request to allocate a portion of the electrical machinery taken from Japanese reparations to Shanghai's Chinese-owned power plants, the initial electrical machinery from Japanese reparations has already been fully allocated. Of these, a 53,000 kW unit is planned to be allocated to the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau for installation. In the future, the bureau can distribute a large portion of its power to Shanghai's various electrical companies and plans to sell a portion of its shares to other privately-owned power plants. As for returning the power generation machinery of the Shanghai Chinese-owned Electric Company that was dismantled and relocated from the Boshan Coal Mine by the enemy, the Resources Committee has agreed to dismantle and return it. As for the machinery installed in Beiping, negotiations are currently underway."

### Senators Jin Zhenyu and Jiang Jianbai Invite Various Sectors to Solicit Opinions for Submission to the Political Council for Government Adoption

[Our Newspaper's Report] Senators Jin Zhenyu and Jiang Jianbai, elected by the citizens of this city, organized an invitation for 4 pm yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant for municipal senators, district chiefs, and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, in order to collect their opinions, so that the suggestions might be conveyed to the government in the upcoming session of the Political Council that will be convened in Beijing on the 20th of this month. Around one hundred people attended the meeting, including Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department Xie Renzhao, senators, district chiefs, and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies.

After the remarks made by Jin and Jiang, Speaker Pan was nominated to share his opinions: "It is important that the two senators, Jin and Jiang, solicit opinions before the meeting. I hope that everyone speaks freely. Personally, I have three requests for the two to bring to the government:

(1) According to general estimates, the tax revenue contributed by Shanghai to the government accounts for more than 40% of the national total. However, the government subsidizes the expenses of various provinces and cities, but Shanghai is unique in receiving no subsidies. Government authorities and the general public believe that Shanghai does not need subsidies, but in fact, the cost of municipal construction in Shanghai is enormous, especially since the damage during the enemy's occupation was very severe and reconstruction is difficult. Relying solely on regular income will definitely be insufficient to cope with the situation. For example, the accumulation of garbage is increasing day by day, which is of utmost importance to the health and appearance of the city. The cost of this cleaning is especially something that the government must help with. The government wants Shanghai to become the largest metropolis and develop industry and commerce, but if it does not allocate funds, it will not only be impossible to build, but it will also make it impossible to maintain the existing facilities. Therefore, I hope that the government can send personnel here to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and at the same time subsidize funds.

Consider Policy Implementation Beforehand

(2) Recently, social order in Shanghai has been chaotic. To stabilize it, attention must be paid to all aspects. In the future, I hope that the central government will pay attention to whether the decisions of many competent ministries and commissions are sufficient to affect or increase the manufacturing of destabilizing factors. Government decisions must be implemented in order of urgency and priority, otherwise the central government's decrees will not be implemented, and local areas will first create disturbances, causing local officials and administrative agencies to suffer losses in money, time, and manpower. Therefore, I hope that the senators will ask the government whether it has made careful consideration before implementing policies. As for things that disturb the people, they should be done less.

The Status of Direct Control Should Be Established Quickly

(3) The status of Shanghai and other directly-controlled municipalities has not been determined. Now that local autonomous organizations are gradually being established, the government has not yet promulgated regulations for direct-controlled municipalities. Therefore, the central government must be asked to establish the status of direct-controlled municipalities, and the opinions of the people's will agencies in the directly-controlled municipalities should be solicited when the Legislative Yuan formulates laws and regulations."

Senator Tao Baichuan then contributed his opinions based on his past experience as a senator, saying: "The Political Council is a line of unity. It has been quite smooth in the past, but now there are some shortcomings. Therefore, it must still be a real line of unity. However, in order to achieve this goal, two major doors must be passed, namely (1) the door of unification, with unification as a condition for unity, which should be brought to the attention of the whole country, and (2) the door of democracy, because democracy is also a necessary door for unity."

Then Xie Renliu, Tong Xingbai, Shao Bingsheng, and others spoke successively, providing opinions on the constitution, local autonomy laws and regulations, and other aspects.

(2) Transfer Procedures

He Da asks: My younger brother was originally enrolled in School A, but because he found that School A had not yet been registered, he transferred to School B. After one semester, School A's registration was approved, so he transferred back to School A. Now, when he asks School B for a transfer certificate, he is told: "The transfer certificate when this student transferred to our school was submitted to the Department of Education, but because the previous school was not registered, it has been returned, so our school has no student status and cannot issue a certificate." Now my younger brother is auditing classes at School A. May I ask your column how to handle this?

[Editor's Reply] According to regulations, the student status of students in unregistered schools should be recognized after the school is registered. It is hoped that you will immediately take the registration certificate of School A and request School B to issue a transfer certificate.

### Yingshi University Students in Hangzhou Travel to Beijing in Batches, Plan to Assemble in Beijing to Petition the Ministry of Education, Minister Zhu Summoned Ten Representatives of Yingshi University Arriving in Beijing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The ten representatives of Yingshi University who came to Beijing were summoned by Minister Lai Jiahua on the 15th, and Vice Minister Hang Liwu also returned to Beijing from Hangzhou.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Director Zhou Hongjing of the Ministry of Education returned to Beijing from Hangzhou on the 15th. Our reporter specially interviewed him about the Yingshi University issue. According to him: (1) The Ministry of Education is in contact to select and appoint suitable talent for the position of president. (2) The issue of restoring the Medical College of Yingshi University will have to wait until the various facilities are possibly suitable in the future before it can be restored. (3) The students' greatest demand now is to relocate the school. This matter is related to the resolutions of the Educational Rehabilitation Conference and the constitutional principle of balanced regional development of education. The Ministry of Education can hardly violate this and accept the students' demands.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Central News Agency reports: Yingshi University students in Hangzhou are traveling to Beijing in batches, declaring that they will strive for the relocation of the school and three other demands. There are now less than one hundred people left in Hangzhou. Most of them left Hangzhou in classes yesterday and are scheduled to assemble in Beijing within three days to collectively petition the Ministry of Education.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Yingshi University student petition representatives arrived in Beijing, the reporter immediately asked a certain educator about the issue of Yingshi University's relocation. According to him: "Whether or not Yingshi University should be relocated, the Ministry of Education does not seem to need to make a rigid decision at this time. It can be submitted to the National Education Conference to be held this fall, or it can be proposed for discussion at a future Higher Education Conference. Should Yingshi University be relocated? Should the university network be changed? A careful decision should be made at that time. This is the procedure that should be followed in a democratic government. Since the Yingshi University students have already received higher education, guiding them according to the situation will probably not lead to any objections."

### The Ministry of Education Orders Various Universities in Beiping to Handle General Examinations Themselves

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Students from various universities in Beiping are brewing opposition to the graduation general examination. Graduates from the Faculty of Arts and Law of Peking University have already signed their names, and there are also signing campaigns against the movement at Tsinghua and Yenching Universities. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has issued an order to Beiping, instructing each school to handle it at its own discretion. Peking University may only have one type of exam this year.

### A Wave of Class Boycotts in Various Schools in the City

[Our Newspaper Report] Students at the private Shanghai University of Shanghai, in order to demand that the school cancel the GPA system and strive for free access to and from the school, previously had a strike. Later, the school agreed to consider the GPA system and gave a deadline for a reply, so classes were resumed. In recent months, the students have repeatedly urged the school, but the school has not given a concrete reply. Therefore, the student union convened a meeting the night before last, and with the agreement of the majority of people, it was resolved to strike again yesterday. They demanded that the school quickly abolish the GPA system. According to the representative of the student union, the students' determination to demand that the school abolish the unreasonable GPA system is very firm, and they hope that the school will not delay any longer.

Responding to the Shanghai Strike, Classes Should Be Boycotted

Students from the Second Institute of the School of Commerce of the school held a meeting at 6 p.m. last night, where they agreed to respond to the students and the student union in opposing the GPA system. Starting last night, they also began to strike. However, according to the acting president of the school, Lin Zhuoran, the school has been implementing the GPA system for more than 20 years, and it has been discussed by the faculty council many times. The purpose is to improve the level of students so that they can cultivate outstanding talents for the country and society. Article 42 of the newly promulgated school regulations by the Ministry of Education stipulates that in order to improve the level of students, each school may formulate implementation methods. Accordingly, the school is currently hiring three professors to be responsible for drafting new methods to replace the GPA system. Before the new method is formulated, it is not appropriate to change the GPA system. He also claimed that among the thirteen church universities in China today, all schools except St. John's University use the GPA system. The school authorities are currently persuading the students to resume classes.

[Another Report] Another group of students from the school withdrew from the student union and opposed the strike.

The Medical College Is Still on Strike

[Our Newspaper Report] Students from the National Shanghai Medical College at Fenglin Bridge in this city had made the following six demands to the Ministry of Education, but they were not approved: (1) Increase national education funding; (2) Increase the number of publicly funded students; (3) Increase public funding in proportion to prices; (4) Increase the salaries of faculty and staff; (5) Improve teaching facilities; (6) Change the Department of Pharmacy to the College of Pharmacy. They have been on strike since 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. And yesterday afternoon at 5 pm they hosted reporters, reporting the importance of scholarships and education, opposing the Ministry of Education's regulations to change the Pharmacy Department to a five-year system, demanding an increase in the status of pharmaceutical education, and bitterly complaining that the six representatives sent to Beijing to petition were not approved. The school authorities held an emergency meeting at 10 am yesterday, and decided to persuade the students to resume classes first, and then argue with the Ministry of Education on the basis of reason. The students did not agree and will continue to strike today

The Sino-French Pharmacy Department Is on Strike

The Pharmacy Department of the Sino-French University on Luban Road in this city has been on strike for four days since the delegation went to Beijing to petition, requesting to be changed to a College of Pharmacy and to raise the level of pharmaceutical education. There has been no satisfactory result or real answer so far, and the students' emotions are extremely agitated. It is now resolved to start a strike starting today.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The Ping Railway College, in order to demand the recovery of the school buildings occupied by the Air Force Repair Factory, had a fight with the guards of the factory today. The reason is that the students of the college are demanding to change the Railway College to Ping Chiao Tung University and to recover the occupied school buildings by a set date in response to Shanghai Chiao Tung University. The students have been on strike since the 13th, and classes have not yet resumed. Student representatives went to the Ping Xingyuan for a petition this morning, and the Xingyuan authorities agreed to order the aircraft factory to move out within a week. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 a.m. this morning, when the Railway College students were meeting to discuss the issue of protecting the school, a student named Du was suddenly scolded by a mechanic passing by the factory. The student scolded back and was tied up and humiliated, but was soon released. After the student returned to school and explained the situation, the majority of the students gathered and went to the factory to question. The mechanic and more than 50 guards saw that the number of people coming was large, so they came out with iron bars and beat more than 10 students. The students thought that the situation had deteriorated, so they gathered more than 300 people and went to Xingyuan for a petition, requesting that the murderer be punished. Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao received them, and after inquiring about the details, he gave three answers: (1) Order the aircraft factory to move out completely tonight; (2) Send someone to investigate whether anyone in the aircraft factory has committed the crime of beating people, and punish them severely according to law, and order the responsible person to apologize and compensate; (3) Immediately remove the guards and have the military police supervise the relocation. The students were satisfied, so they returned to school.

Nos. 183, 199, 94, 231, 154, Jia Jin, 35, 153, and 104 entered the market for Yongsha and rebounded, with Yongsha reaching 5870 yuan. Nos. 117, 131, and 163 took profits at high prices, and Nos. 75 and 99 also appeared for Yongsha, once falling below 5800 yuan. Nos. 152, 142, 153, 94, 117, 154, and 112 all entered the market, and Nos. 224 and 4 also appeared for Yongsha. Rongfeng was bid up by No. 97 to the daily limit, raising Yongsha to 6010 yuan.

Meiya, Yongsha, Xinhe, Xinguang, Xinya, Cement, Yonggong, Datong, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Jingfu, Match, Liana, Jinglun, Xinhua, and Business all successively hit the daily limit. Yongsha was bought by Nos. 143, 89, 129, 177, 94, 54, 76, 16, and 154, etc., with the grey market price bid up to over 6400 yuan. Nos. 152, 156, and 110 sold off, falling back to around 6350 yuan.

More than 300 shareholders attended, representing over 354 million shares, officially opening the meeting. Chairman Fu Liangjun reported on the full amount of the capital increase, and Supervisor Zhang verified that the funds were accurate. There were rumors in the market that the company would continue to give away shares. According to Director Wang, this may be realized within the year.

### Resumption of Procurement of Export Goods, Principles Already Decided

Currently, domestic prices are high, affecting production costs. The prices of export goods have also risen due to increased costs, and the export business is almost at a complete standstill. In order to maintain the export industry and alleviate the current difficulties, the government has decided to restore the procurement policy. According to a reporter from the United Credit Bureau, after thorough research by relevant agencies such as the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank, the following principles have been decided: (1) There is a market abroad; (2) Merchants are unable to ship goods on their own. Only export goods that meet the above principles will be procured. The procurement will be handled by the China Trust Bureau. The procurement price will be calculated according to reasonable market prices. After the principles were decided, implementation measures have been drafted. People in the export industry are very encouraged by this measure of the government and hope to avoid various malpractices during procurement.

### Market Sales Slack, Japonica and Indica Rice Both Fall Back, Flour Market Idle, Continuing Downstream

Yesterday, a total of more than 4,900 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Store sales were sluggish, and market sales were idle. Japonica rice in the North and South markets both fell by 10,000 yuan, and Indica rice also fell by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Baiyuan fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and inferior Yinyuan followed the decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Flour was idle and continued downstream due to the arrival of goods in Changzhou and Wuxi, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran factories continued to supply, sentiment was weak, and prices gradually declined, falling sharply by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Soybean cake trading was acceptable. The early market opened with tight conditions, and the close turned slightly weak, resulting in a 1,000 yuan increase. Local oil factories competed to purchase soybeans, and owners turned firm, soaring by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market's digestion was active but not strong, rising first and then falling back, rising by 10,000 yuan. There were rumors that the producing areas were banning the export of raw peanuts, and sentiment was excited, soaring by 120,000 yuan. Sesame remained sluggish, hovering in a tired state. Local and foreign routes for mung beans were very few, and it was feared that it would be difficult to flourish. Red beans remained in the doldrums, continuing to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Market Price Drops Sharply, White Sugar Market Price Drops Sharply

Yesterday's sugar market softened and saw a general decline because Taiwan Sugar Company's 15th phase was still allocated in the same way as the previous phase, with 24 crude white and three-and-a-half car white sugar, and an additional allocation of 20 medium granulated white sugar at 320,000 yuan and Taiwan red sugar at 300,000 yuan.

### 7,000 Tons of Rice Stored, Grain Department of the Executive Yuan to Collect

According to the Executive Yuan: the Grain Department's main warehouse exchanged 7,000 tons of rice with the Executive Yuan last month. The 7,000 tons of rice were allocated by the Field Grain Department's Hankou branch on behalf of the Executive Yuan, and then allocated by the Executive Yuan to the department's Shanghai main warehouse on behalf of the Grain Department to avoid transportation back and forth. However, the Grain Department warehouse has not yet collected the rice from the Executive Yuan. It is said that the Executive Yuan has sent a letter requesting the Grain Department to collect it.

### Knitwear Manufacturers Request Textile Construction to Allocate Yarn

Since the textile construction allocated yarn, the 600+ members of the knitwear industry in the Fourth District were allocated by the industry association after applying to the textile construction, based on each member's actual needs. Later, the textile construction changed the method, ordering each manufacturer to apply separately. After filling out the forms in December of last year, the association compiled and forwarded them to the textile construction. It has been half a year, and although some have been approved, more than 200 units have either been investigated without approval or denial, or have not been investigated at all. Recently, the textile construction decided to stop allocating yarn to new factories. The more than 200 knitwear manufacturers who have not received an allocation are afraid of being designated as new factories and not receiving allocation. After days of meetings, they decided to urge the textile construction to make a decision on the previously submitted forms and request an equal allocation.

### Yarn Market Initially Active, Then Tired

Yesterday's yarn market opened with brisk purchases by manufacturers and guest firms, and prices were bid up. 42-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to 12.6 million yuan, and 20-count Shuangma was also seen at 6.65 million yuan. However, because the textile construction company's allocated prices were raised the day before, the allocation quota increased. Yesterday, many futures positions were rolled over, causing liquidity to tighten. And general speculative accounts closed out at high prices, so prices fell back. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix and 20-count Shuangma were on par with the previous day, while other coarser counts had mixed gains and losses.

### Official Prices Increase, Cotton Cloth Mostly Trading Higher

Yesterday's cotton cloth market: Because the textile construction increased the prices of 25 kinds of cloth for sale, Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Jinyin poplin were both at 270,000 yuan, and trading in the market was quite smooth. It was heard that the rules for exporting yarn and cloth were announced, and the restrictions on transportation and sales in the Central China region were relatively relaxed, so guest firms took action to purchase, and people in the industry worked hard to raise prices. As a final result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose to 273,100 yuan, up 5,000 yuan from the previous day. Other brands of fine cloth also rose across the board, from 6,000-7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The prices of bleached cloth, dyed cloth, dyed twill, and blue cloth Shilin cloth all rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan.

### Flannel Sales Prices Rise

Among woollen fabrics, flannel is the most complex, and the smoothness of sales depends largely on the weather. In recent years, fine wool flannel has been more popular and active than coarse wool flannel, but because imported goods cannot be shipped, they rely only on Hong Kong to bring them, and scarce goods are expensive, creating a good opportunity for Shanghai-woven factory goods. Because of the lack of circulation of goods in the market, the sales prices of factory goods have mostly soared, almost on par with American goods. Buyers and sellers, in view of the high prices of summer goods such as Paris valitin, regard flannel as relatively cheap, and most of them expect the market to continue to improve, so they often hoard goods. Yesterday, flannel was selling at 250,000 yuan per yard, and the profits of general woollen fabric factories can be described as unprecedented.

Huaxin Woollen Fabric Special Price

Huaxin Woollen Fabric Company has abundant inventory and has scheduled a special sale for two weeks starting on the 16th, with discounts ranging from 30% to 20%, which is good news in the current general price increase.

### Silk Weaving Joint Venture Production Volume Falls Short of Target

[Report from this newspaper] The production target for the first three months of the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company was originally set at 84,000 bolts of various kinds of silk, but now that two months have passed, the total production volume has reached 40,000 bolts, falling short of the target. According to a person in charge of the company: The purpose of the company's products is for export, so the quality must be top-notch to meet the needs of foreign people. Therefore, the equipment, looms, door widths, and patterns of the textiles are often adjusted and changed from time to time. As a result, the first two months of operation were no different than being in the testing period, and after this, the production situation can be brought into the normal track.

### Tired Wind Spreads in the Tea Market

For red and green tea exclusively for export, overseas still telegraphed Shanghai tea merchants yesterday, slightly inquiring, but the prices offered were extremely low. It was heard that last year's old tea had shrunk to around 13 pence to 17 pence, and there was still a market, but at this price, the export situation would have to suffer heavy losses, so trading continued to be sluggish and sentiment was depressed. According to the current situation, the tired wind in the foreign tea market may gradually spread. For various domestic sales varieties, the supply and demand are equal, and there are very few differences compared to before. It is learned that crude black tea has regained favor with guest firms in various places, and if the selling price can suit their appetite, they may soon return to the market and engage in absorption.

### Export Promotion Executive Committee Passes Many Important Cases

Proposed Establishment of a South China Import and Export Management Committee

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at Zhongtian Bank yesterday morning at 10:00 AM.

(4) A decision has been made on the issue of imported raw materials for processing, and it will be submitted to the Import Management Committee for review.

### China Farmers Bank Decides on This Year's Agricultural Loan Plan, Focusing on Loans for Basic Needs of the People

[Report from this newspaper] According to the China Farmers Bank, the general outline of the bank's agricultural loan plan for this year is as follows: (1) Externally, focus on providing loans for agricultural products, such as silk and tea loans. The purpose is to increase exports and earn foreign exchange.

Regarding silk loans, it is known that there are 120 billion yuan in spring cocoon loans, including loans for cocoon collection, cooperative cocoon drying, dry cocoon mortgages, and silk reeling costs. In addition, there are 10 billion yuan dedicated to lending to silkworm breeding and seed production.

Regarding tea loans, the planned amount is between 70-80 billion yuan, including tea farmers' production, processing, negotiation, and mortgage loans.

(2) Internally, focus on providing loans for basic needs of the people (A) In terms of clothing, it is planned to provide 80 billion yuan in cotton production loans. Loans for processing and transportation will be provided when cotton is harvested in the autumn. On the one hand, the equipment of the joint general's cotton ginning factories will be used as much as possible to establish cotton ginning factories in different regions.

(B) In terms of food, there are several hundred billion yuan in loans for increased grain production. The main target of the loan is rice, followed by wheat. In addition, both clothing and food loans will be mainly in kind, such as issuing soybean cake chemical fertilizers. (3) Other general agricultural loans such as agricultural production, rural sideline businesses, agricultural product transportation and sales, morning water conservancy, and agricultural promotion (including high-quality morning tools and livestock breeds) will still be held as before.

### The Four Joint Headquarters End Production Loans, Loans Not Released Before the End of April Will Be Cancelled

The temporary production professional loans issued by the Four Joint Headquarters last year have reached the end stage. It is learned that all those that have not been contracted and used by the end of April, and those that have been contracted but not used, the Four Joint Headquarters has decided to cancel the original case in order to facilitate the end, and no further loans will be made. However, in order to take into account the facts, manufacturers can apply to the Four Joint Headquarters separately according to the general loan method.

### Bituminous Coal Market Price Continues to Fall

The white coal market is still calm, and the market price has changed little. Bituminous coal, Jiangxi Poyang County coal and Fengcheng coal, continue to arrive. As the coal allocated by the factory has been assigned, the demand is very small, which makes people feel weak, and the market price is getting lower and lower. The price of Kaiping No. 2 fines has retreated to 800,000 yuan, but there is still no buyer. Poyang coal has fallen from 950,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan in recent days, and there is no way to sell it in large quantities for a while.

### Musk is Scarce and Prices Rise

The price of musk is rising because there are few arrivals. The reason is that the selling price in Shanghai is too low, and there is a lack of hunters in the production area. The selling price in Shanghai is equal to the labor price in the production area. In addition, transportation costs and other costs are added, and the cost is increased, and there is a risk of losing money. At this time of year, it is a necessary item for cooling medicines, so the demand has increased greatly, so the selling price has been increased to attract shipments from the production area.

### Pig Bristles Plummet

[Report from this newspaper] The pig bristle market is in a slump. Shanghai bristles have fallen to 1.7 yuan per pound, Hankou bristles to 3.4 yuan, and Chongqing bristles to 2.17 yuan. The current market price of pig bristles is showing a sharp decline.

Timber Market

The fir market is not active because it is heard that the cost of production is between 1,700 yuan. The foreign pine market is slightly firm.

### Mica is Allowed to be Imported

[Report from this newspaper] It is said that the Tariff Management Committee has recently approved the import of mica to be reclassified as the last item in Appendix III (A) as a supplementary material.

### Cracking Down on Buying and Selling Silver Dollars

People selling silver dollars on the streets are active again. The police station recently ordered the Huangpu and Laoza divisions to crack down severely. Anyone found to have violated the law will have their silver dollars confiscated and transferred to the local prosecutor's office for legal action.

### Holders Are Unwilling to Sell, Rayon Spirals Upward, Mill Silk Asking Prices High, Silk Goods Sales Slow

Rayon still saw higher prices in yesterday's market. Gaoshan Youguang No. 120 opened at 6.8 million yuan and spiraled upward, with the noon close at 7.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was even better, and holders were firm in not selling, so the asking price was 200,000 yuan higher than in the morning. As a result, it was 800,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Only four or five boxes were traded throughout the day, absorbed by actual sales accounts. The asking prices for other brands of Youguang also increased across the board. No. 75 half-light was asking 25 million yuan, but there were no transactions.

The mill silk market saw quite a few transactions yesterday. Each file traded 30-40 bales, with A-grade priced at 19.7 million yuan and C-grade priced at 9.3 million yuan, both 300,000-500,000 yuan higher than the asking prices on the previous day. Dries were relatively sluggish, and the asking prices remained at the original plate of the previous day.

Silk goods sales were sluggish, and trading in the market was also quite calm. Asking prices for quilt covers remained unchanged. Gezifeng silk was first traded at 29,500 yuan, and later at 100-200 yuan. Recently, it was heard that mill silk prices were high, and the asking price was still 29,500 yuan, and the rest of the goods had not changed much.

Allocation of Rayon is Being Requested

[Report from this newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's rayon has been suspended for a long time, which is of great concern to the silk weaving industry. According to a person in charge of the bureau, the bureau is currently requesting the Executive Yuan to instruct on the allocation of rayon, so that it can be followed. He said: There is actually no shortage of rayon in the market. It is estimated that the stocks of each factory will not be completely depleted. Although the asking price in the market is high, the actual transactions are very limited.

### India Bans Silk Weaving Imports, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Ordered a Detailed Investigation

[Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the details of the news that India will temporarily ban the import of foreign silk weaving products from the end of June this year. According to the reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is said that it has ordered our country's ambassador to India to investigate the details nearby. If it is true, the necessary negotiations will be made. It is also heard that the United States will also take the same measures.

### Yingkou Soybeans Shipped to Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship returned to Shanghai from Yingkou yesterday, carrying more than 4,000 pieces of soybean cake and 7,500 bags of soybeans, which were purchased by the China Grain Company.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Should the Medical Practitioner Law Be Amended?

— Hua Xinren

On April 6th, this publication featured an article by Mr. Butcher, titled "An Unfair Cry Against the Medical Practitioner Law." This article was a "cry of injustice" directed at my piece, "From the Recertification of Medical Practitioners to the Medical Practitioner Law," published on February 28th. After reading this grand discourse, filled with the air of a scholar-official, it leaves behind a ferocious and frightening face. However, I am not fond of arguing, but I never reject well-intentioned criticism, and I must resist unreasonable slander.

Firstly, I must state that I truly admire Mr. Butcher's attention to medical administration issues. However, it is regrettable that he has distorted the meaning of my original article. I hope Mr. Butcher can calm down, read it again, and review the old to learn the new, as there is great hope in that.

For example, I believe that Article 3, Section 3 of the Medical Practitioner Law is a major obstacle to scientific medicine and clearly provides convenience for non-scientific medicine. If this continues, it will lead to the rise of non-scientific medicine as a specialized profession. However, Mr. Butcher has distorted the original meaning. He believes that our complaint is to seek the same qualifications as traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. He considers himself an orthodox figure, labeling others, as he says, "Those who consider themselves Western doctors and have practiced Western medicine for more than five years with outstanding reputations should also be qualified to pass the examination." This is an unreasonable inference. Similarly, it further proves that Mr. Butcher is eager for emotional disputes. We know that the study of traditional Chinese medicine is mysterious and impractical, and the level of practicing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners varies greatly, with all sorts of contradictions. For example, ancient prescriptions and modern prescriptions clash, and fantasy and experience coexist. Should we give this kind of medicine a way to extend its life? Why should we point out a path for it when it barely has time to perish on its own? Isn't this a direct humiliation and discrimination against scientific medicine? As Mr. Butcher said, taking Taiwan as an example, "Taiwan stopped registering traditional Chinese medicine ten years before the Republic and worked hard to cultivate scientific medicine." But why should we work hard to cultivate non-scientific medicine? Taking our Medical Practitioner Law as an example, registering as a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner only requires five years of practice and a good reputation to pass. Isn't this a violation of progressive scientific laws? Looking at Taiwan and thinking about ourselves, can Mr. Butcher say that this is a "somewhat gratifying" thing?

Mr. Butcher believes that the current Medical Practitioner Law is "a major stain on Chinese legislation." Precisely because it is a major stain, we must consider "how our descendants will resent and mock us in thousands or hundreds of years." We, as "ancestors of the 20th century," have discovered the "stain" and should correct it in a timely manner. We must not let this stain remain in history for our descendants to mock and resent. This important factor has been distorted by Mr. Butcher, who insists that we "who consider ourselves Western doctors" want to fight for the same qualifications as traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. This is truly a major stain on Mr. Butcher's morality and a regrettable aspect of his "cry of injustice."

I advise Mr. Butcher not to merely admire the Meiji Restoration in Japan (see paragraph 4 of his article) and willingly debase himself to "shiver with fear." This is useless for facts and truth. We should think about why the Meiji Restoration succeeded and why we still have remnants of feudalism. The reason why our medical community has such enlightened figures like Mr. Butcher is that they respect the legal standing of non-scientific businesses. We cannot simply attribute this to "legislative stains" because there are many "praiseworthy" and progressive people in our group leading scientific medicine who are driving in reverse. What else can be said when the regulations are kowtowed to in the initial draft stage? In addition to blaming the inequality between scientific and non-scientific medicine on "Chinese legislation," Mr. Butcher also specifically emphasized that the reason for the "failure of our country's health undertakings" lies with the "founding elders of the Party-state." Don't you see that in the sixth paragraph of his grand discourse, he clearly wrote: "It is commendable that the health authorities can barely maintain the standards of scientific doctors. It is too much to hope that they can argue on the basis of reason and persuade the founding elders of the Party-state to immediately follow the Meiji Restoration in Japan and embark on the path of scientific nation-building." According to Mr. Butcher's opinion, it seems that the founding elders of the Party-state do not want scientific nation-building and are unwilling to follow the Meiji Restoration in Japan, hoping that China will remain in the unscientific era of the 18th century. I think this is not only insulting the "meritorious founding elders of the Party-state" who "overthrew the Qing Dynasty," but also indirectly trying to provoke the feelings of the people against the elders, making the people disloyal to the country. Mr. Butcher is truly guilty of a great crime! Mr. Butcher further emphasized: "...It is the weak who perfunctorily do what they can and have no power to resist the power of those elders." This self-confessed, counterproductive, and unwise argument inadvertently harmed our hard-working and meritorious Health Administration, which leads and maintains the standards of scientific doctors, because, according to Mr. Butcher, the Health Administration's difficulty is that it cannot persuade the founding elders of the Party-state and cannot resist the power of the founding elders of the Party-state, and there are no other internal or external difficulties. On the contrary, if it can persuade the founding elders of the Party-state, then it will not "only be able to do a little bit perfunctorily." However, we, the common people, want to ask the founding elders of the Party-state, why don't you want your country to be restored and why do you hinder the work of scientific nation-building?

Finally, Mr. Butcher advocates completely overturning the Medical Practitioner Law. I really dare not go along with this radical liberal thought because can a country become a country without laws? However, we have reason to request amendments to inappropriate laws to bring them back on track. This procedure is correct. Fortunately, justice is in the hearts of the people, and the hearts of the people are the court. Observers will see the right and wrong. Therefore, I have no interest in arguing when it is unavoidable. Finally, I advise Mr. Butcher not to use the old and immortal posture to call a deer a horse and insult the original meaning of "those who consider themselves Western doctors..." I advise you to put down the butcher knife, otherwise you will still be butchered.

### The Problem of Imparting Medical Common Sense (Part 2)

— Fan Shouyuan

Now, let's further discuss what kind of topics are suitable for popular writing that imparts medical knowledge, and what kind of writing is suitable for the public's taste and easy for the public to digest. There are no strict boundaries that can be drawn. However, broadly speaking, it can be divided into two parts: one is the aspect of selecting topics, and the other is the issue of writing techniques.

First, let's talk about the aspect of selecting topics: Since the goal of imparting medical common sense is the general public outside the medical field, then the topics chosen must be medical knowledge topics that the general public needs, and daily knowledge is essential. For example, the meaning of medicine itself and the value of medical treatment itself are all things that the general public should understand. How to choose a doctor when sick, how to handle things after the illness (of course, being handled), and how to recuperate after recovery are all common sense that the general public cannot lack. As for the rules of hygiene in daily life and how to avoid the arrival of diseases, that is, the so-called "prevention before it happens," the medical term is "prevention." All kinds of knowledge similar to this are within the scope of common sense that the public needs, and they are also excellent topics for us to write articles that impart medical knowledge!

As for the treatment part of medicine, especially the surgical part of medical treatment, the less the better! That is to say, when it comes to treatment, it can only be limited to the treatment plan or the principle of treatment; because most of the knowledge about treatment belongs to the scope of the doctor himself, and surgical procedures are even more the doctor's business. There is absolutely no need to take them as topics to promote to the public when imparting medical knowledge! If you indiscriminately publicize and impart such treatment methods, or even surgical procedures in diagnosis and treatment, that are not needed by the public, then the general public may have accidents and cause troubles due to temporary carelessness. Isn't this loving someone enough to harm them? Even recently, some medical and pharmaceutical question-and-answer sections in newspapers try their best to introduce medicines, or even attract patients. These are not very appropriate methods. Publicly attracting patients in medical and pharmaceutical answers seems to hinder the personality and morality of doctors. Answering medical and pharmaceutical questions and introducing medicines at every turn, telling patients to buy medicines and take them randomly themselves, is even more of an extraordinarily risky move. If something goes wrong and causes endless disasters, can friends who provide medical and pharmaceutical answers shirk the responsibility? Therefore, I think that medical and pharmaceutical question-and-answer sessions can only answer difficult problems in medical and pharmaceutical science on the principle of imparting medical common sense, and should not arbitrarily teach treatment methods, let alone introduce medicines indiscriminately!

Let's talk about the techniques of writing medical knowledge articles. The importance of selecting topics for writing popular articles that impart medical knowledge has been mentioned above, but the writing techniques outside the topics are equally important. Although the topics of writing for popular propaganda to the public are topics that suit the public's taste and are excellent topics needed by the public, if the writer's writing techniques are not careful and do not pay attention, the words written will be either too specialized or too mechanical, but cannot be popular and universal, and it is still difficult to achieve the purpose of imparting medical knowledge and achieving the effect of promoting medical knowledge. Because although the topic is popularized, if the writing has not been popularized, it still cannot be understood by the public. If it cannot be understood, how can it be expected to benefit and expect to obtain the benefits of writing articles that impart medical knowledge? It's like cooking side dishes. Although the essence of side dishes is materials that nourish the body, if they are not cooked properly and cooked too bland or too salty, they will lose their taste; if they are not cooked enough and are not cooked thoroughly, they will not be easily digested when eaten in the stomach. Writing medical knowledge articles is also the same. Although the topic is appropriate and popular, if the writing is not explained clearly and lacks care, it is still not easy for the general reader to understand. If it cannot be understood, how can it be expected to benefit and expect to obtain the benefits of writing articles that impart medical knowledge? Therefore, when we write this kind of medical knowledge article, we should try our best to cater to the public and not consider being simple and popular as inelegant; when encountering specialized terms, we may as well spend more words to explain them in detail, so that they can be popularized and simplified before stopping. It is not too much or too lengthy to spend dozens of words to explain and describe a non-popular specialized term; because we are imparting knowledge to the public and promoting medical knowledge to the public, not writing eight-legged essays or parallel prose.

It is said that to write medical knowledge articles for popular propaganda, not only should the topics be in line with the needs of the public, but also the descriptions and explanations of the writing should be popular and common for the public to understand. But in reality, it is not much easier than writing specialized academic articles. To be more precise: to truly write popular articles with topics that are palatable to the public and writing that is clear, simple, lively, and energetic, it may be more laborious and troublesome than writing general specialized medical articles.

However, to truly write popular articles for the purpose of imparting medical knowledge, it still depends on each person's writing skills and each person's natural talent, and the writing style varies according to the different skills and talents of each person. Or to put it more clearly: each person has his own way of writing medical knowledge articles; what is called the way of imparting medical common sense here is just a general or broad statement of the principles.

### Research on the Mixture of Calcium Gluconate and Vitamin C and its Effect on the Living Body

— Wu Guocheng

I recently read Mr. Shen Songnian's article "Calcium Gluconate" in the tenth issue of this publication, and saw the editor's remarks, as to whether calcium gluconate and vitamin C will undergo chemical changes when mixed in a syringe, and cannot be determined. Now I will make a popular and brief description of the results of my actual experiments and their chemical relationship:

Anyone with basic organic chemistry knowledge knows that gluconic acid and vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) are both extremely weak organic acids, and calcium is a weakly alkaline substance. When these three substances are put into a liquid together, if there is enough or too much calcium, it should be the calcium salts of both. If the amount of calcium is insufficient, the type of calcium salt to be formed should be determined by the binding force of the two acids and calcium. However, whether the salt formed is effective in the living body depends on the condition of the salt formed; if the salt formed is water-soluble and ionized, it will be effective in the living body. On the contrary, if the calcium salt formed is insoluble, or although soluble, it is a kind of chemically so-called intramolecular compound, it is still ineffective or its effect is minimal and cannot be used. Because intramolecular compounds do not generate calcium ions in water, do not participate in ordinary chemical changes, and lose the properties of calcium, the prerequisite is to determine whether it is an intramolecular compound. Now I have tested the two calcium salts separately and mixed them with oxalic acid, and both produced calcium oxalate precipitate, which is enough to prove that they are not intramolecular compounds. Therefore, no matter what kind of calcium salt it is, it is effective in the living body.

As for the statement that vitamin C can dissolve calcium in the living body, it seems to lack scientific basis, because Mr. Song Guobin believes that acid trade has the ability to dissolve calcium, that is, vitamin C must make the blood acidic in the body to have this effect, but the blood of the human body is weakly alkaline, chemically PH. 7.35. (PH. 7 is neutral, above 7 is alkaline, below 7 is acidic). On the other hand, vitamin C for injection is adjusted to a solution of about PH. 6.8 (the ordinary liquid is 5% vitamin C). This kind of vitamin C liquid with extremely weak acidity, even if used to 10,000 international units, only contains 0.5 grams of vitamin C. It is fundamentally impossible to shake the blood into acidity with this trace amount and extremely weak acidity. What's more, the living body still has the function of controlling and regulating. If the blood becomes acidic, it will immediately become acidemia (acidic blood disease). Therefore, vitamin C can never dissolve calcium in the living body.

Whether gluconate calcium or calcium and gluconic acid can destroy vitamin C should be a matter of concern. If it can, then mixing these two substances is still unreasonable. I used these three (gluconic acid, calcium gluconate, and calcium hydroxide) and mixed them separately into vitamin C, and placed them for two hours. I used 2.6 Dichlorphenol-indolphenol to test vitamin C and proved that it was not destroyed at all.

Regarding the statement that "the calcium in the body of patients with fibrous tuberculosis has reached saturation," it does not seem to be as Mr. Shen Songnian said that it must become gypsum to be considered saturated, because the human body needs a certain amount of calcium. Reaching this required amount is called saturation. If there is too much calcium, it must be excreted by the urinary organs, but there are exceptions in special circumstances, such as the need for oversaturated calcium in patients with tuberculosis and oversaturation in patients with bone calcification. As for elderly people with arteriosclerosis or bone calcification, the calcium in their bodies seems to have reached saturation, and there is no need to use calcium preparations again. If there is no such disease, then the need for calcium should be a reasonable requirement. However, even patients with tuberculosis who have arteriosclerosis or bone calcification should use it appropriately when their lesions need to be supplemented with calcium, just as Mr. Shen said, "do not stop eating for fear of choking."

I dare to question Mr. Song and Mr. Shen in the spirit of mutual discussion of academics, what do you think?

### A Brief Discussion of Rabies (Continued)

— Chen Jindou

After a latent period of varying or short duration, the disease begins, with symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, insomnia, irritability, and tremors in the limbs. If the bite is on the head or face, there are often continuous sneezes. This stage lasts approximately three to four days and is called the melancholic stage (MelancholischeStadium). During this time, the lymph nodes around the bite wound swell, causing burning pain.

Next, convulsions and mental confusion occur, saliva secretion increases, and the respiratory tract and swallowing muscles of the pharynx often spasm, leading to irregular breathing and difficulty swallowing. The patient is extremely thirsty but cannot drink a drop of water. The patient pants and thirsts, experiencing great pain. The hydrophobia phenomenon mentioned earlier, where seeing water or thinking about drinking causes spasms, appears at this time. Therefore, this stage is called the hydrophobia stage (Hyorophobie Stadium).

Later, mental excitement gradually develops, even progressing to madness. The reflex function of the sensory organs becomes hyperactive. Despite extreme thirst, saliva secretion becomes even more profuse, the pulse becomes weak and irregular, and the body temperature rises even higher, possibly exceeding forty-three degrees Celsius. This stage is called the maniacal stage (Maniakalsche Stadium). In reality, the hydrophobia and maniacal stages are not easily distinguished. These two stages merge and occur together for two to three days to four to five days.

When the maniacal stage occurs, death is not far off. However, before death, there is a paralytic stage (Paralytische Stadium). At this time, convulsions and tremors may cease, and the patient may be able to eat and drink, seemingly showing signs of improvement. In fact, this indicates that they will soon be sleeping in the afterlife. By then, they are suffering from both hunger and thirst, exhausted all over, and their heart is failing, so their life cannot be prolonged.

The above staging is artificial. The symptoms of the disease do not necessarily follow such clear-cut stages. At least, there may be some overlap, but the difference should not be too great. However, in the case of so-called "quiet rabies" (Stille Wut), the onset is with paralysis, making the disease even more aggressive, leading to death in two to three days.

Once someone unfortunately contracts rabies, trying to save their life with internal medication is like thinking that a hernia (commonly known as a bowel prolapse) can be cured by internal medication alone. Both are incorrect and hopeless ideas. Once rabies develops, the patient is bound to die. Applying strong disinfectant drugs to the wound area as early as possible, or using cauterization or excision methods, cannot be reliably believed to completely eliminate the virus. It only possibly prolongs the latent period. Even amputating the affected limb is not a completely reliable treatment. Therefore, in addition to taking such emergency measures on the wound area, the most important step is to observe whether the attacking animal is indeed rabid. If it is proven to be a rabid animal, or if the attacking animal cannot be found, then the person who was bitten must quickly undergo Pasteur's rabies vaccination therapy to save their life. How to administer the vaccine is not described in detail due to space limitations.

If a dog attacks and bites, do not, in a moment of anger, kill it to vent your rage. This is not to say you should show a great national spirit of repaying evil with good. Unless it can be proven that the attacking dog is indeed rabid, it should be captured and closely monitored to see if it shows signs of rabies. If it continues to live normally within two weeks, then the person who was bitten can rest assured that they will not be infected with rabies and does not need to be vaccinated. It has been discovered that a very small number of people develop extremely serious and fatal paralysis after receiving the rabies vaccine. This paralysis is not a reaction to the vaccine, but rather a personal allergy to rabbit brain spinal cord (the raw material for the rabies vaccine is rabbit brain spinal cord). However, this precaution is not enough to dissuade people who have been bitten by a rabid animal and infected with rabies from being vaccinated for prevention. I reiterate that people who have been bitten by a rabid animal should, to protect their lives, quickly get vaccinated without hesitation, and the sooner, the better!

Recognizing rabies is also very important. The following describes the general condition of a rabid dog. The first sign of rabies is a change in temperament. A dog that was once tame and gentle becomes irritable, sinister, fearful, timid, tries to hide, avoids food, moves slowly, and barks hoarsely. But it may also become unusually affectionate, extremely adorable, unwilling to leave its owner, and fond of licking hands and feet. After a day or two, it becomes more restless, wandering back and forth, agitated and unable to stay calm, but still able to obey commands and not yet biting or attacking. As it progresses, it becomes less tame, bares its teeth and growls, threateningly barking, as if self-defensively intimidating, but upon closer inspection, there is no target to intimidate, but rather a vain and aimless irritability. Sometimes its eyes are red, and it runs around wildly, chasing poultry and livestock. If it is kept indoors, it becomes agitated, making scratching and tearing gestures, or turning over its nest and gnawing on furniture, and it likes to gnaw on soil, wood chips, and other things, and it is also prone to biting people. If it is a free-ranging dog, it will wander far from home, adventuring aimlessly. It does not intentionally go out to cause trouble, but in fact, it is still cowardly and avoids people from afar, daring not approach, with tight jaws, unable to close its mouth, drooling and sticking out its tongue, and its tail tucked between its legs. But when faced with opposition or obstacles, it will bite ruthlessly. Rabid dogs also show signs of hydrophobia, cannot eat or drink, and gradually become emaciated and haggard. As it approaches death, it will still wander erratically, groping its way back home, eventually becoming paralyzed, lying quietly, and dying. During the course of rabies, the dog sometimes seems to have a bone stuck in its throat, showing an unusually uncomfortable expression, which will indeed make you unable to bear to watch, and you will want to help it get rid of its trouble sympathetically. However, you must not be so kind, not only will you not help the dog, but you will also harm your own life!

Prevention is better than cure. This principle applies to all diseases. Not only should medical professionals bear the responsibility of promoting this, but everyone should understand this principle. Special care should be taken to prevent rabies.

Rabies can occur in any season, and there is always a risk of misfortune. It is more common in humans in spring and summer, because the weather is warm, and people of all ages are unwilling to stay indoors and like to take walks outdoors or stroll through the streets. Especially during the Qingming Festival and spring vacation, many people go to the countryside to enjoy the scenery and play in the fragrant grass, which increases the chance of contact with wild rabid dogs. Therefore, I hope you will all be cautious in preventing it and not suffer from it and return disappointed.

As for public prevention methods, the focus should be on dogs. If rabid dogs, the root cause of the disease, are eliminated, then human cases can certainly be reduced or even eradicated. I propose several points for discussion.

First, capture stray dogs: All dogs without owners are poorly fed, have unclean fur, wander the streets, raise their hair and defecate, which is both unsightly and unhygienic. Even if there is no risk of rabies, they should be captured and banned. The police station should have dog-catching vehicles on the road to carry out this task, which is indeed a wise measure.

Second, impose heavy taxes on dog ownership: Dogs can guard the door at night, so it is appropriate to raise and utilize them, but there is a risk of rabies, so it is not appropriate to encourage raising them.

Third, use muzzles: Dog owners often neglect this. After wearing a muzzle, even if you do not guard against it going mad, it cannot inflict the disaster of biting, which is easy to do. I deeply hope that dog owners will advocate for this.

Fourth, preventive vaccination can not only prevent the dog itself from getting sick, but also completely eliminate the cause of human illness. I hope that the health authorities will pay attention to this.

Spring and Autumn

### These Days

— Zhao Qingge

These days, under the dual pressure of material and spiritual burdens, I have fallen ill!

While ill, I take no medicine, do not dine, do not go out, and see no guests. I persevere, working as if I were well, cruelly deceiving myself.

Poverty I can endure; poor health I can remedy; but the collapse of my emotions is what I suffer from!

My poor mood is certainly due to poverty and illness, but it is also influenced by many objective stimuli. For example: you don't want to do something, but others force you to do it; you clearly haven't committed any wrongdoing, but others insist on blaming you for committing a wrongdoing; the path you're walking is straight, but others scold you for walking it crookedly; you want to be content, but others won't let you be content; you were originally content, but others insist that you're not; you want to live for yourself, but others want you to live for them; you've worked as a dressmaker for others everywhere, but others still think it's not enough... All of this is enough to drive you crazy, to leave you feeling lost and bewildered!

During this time, I have doubted the entire universe. I have cursed that its laws of creation and destruction do not follow a standard of good and evil, therefore, truth cannot be found, and righteousness cannot be established! I have also hated the entire human race. I feel that people are too selfish, too scheming, and too lacking in lofty sentiments and integrity! So I have been angry, and I have wanted to reverse this tragic situation, but my strength is too weak, and I can only grieve!

Finally, after racking my brains, I have managed to find a way of life in this chaotic world that allows me to feel at ease. I am trying to gradually transcend myself. I use absolute stillness and silence to calm my heart and soul. I am working hard to cultivate a religious spirit. It is in this way that I am beginning to pass my days...

As usual, I can't get up until ten o'clock at the earliest, which helps to shorten the hours of daylight that I loathe.

Once I've finished washing, I go into my study, which is about the size of four sleeping mats. The first thing I do is light a stick of incense on my desk. I don't worship the Buddha or chant scriptures, I just sit quietly at my desk, trying to see myself through the curling blue smoke. When I discover that I still have blood, flesh, thoughts, emotions, a heart, and a soul, I smile! Because I am glad that everything about me is still alive, after yesterday's false death--falling asleep is a false death--and that nothing about me has been lost. Perhaps this is what is meant by "from nothing something comes, and to nothing it returns"!

I stare blankly as the blue smoke turns into clouds, turns into mist, and then I open the window, letting a gust of clear wind blow away the clouds, blow away the mist, and turn it back into air. I breathe it in, and then breathe it out, and then emptiness and loneliness descend upon me, and I collect myself!

I solemnly pick up my pen, and I faithfully cover sheet after sheet of blank paper with my blood; my flesh; my thoughts; my emotions; my heart; my soul! I express everything about myself in such a pure and genuine way, not for any other reason, not to gain people's understanding; not for any reward after a sale; but only to prove to myself that I still know cold and warmth, that I can still distinguish right from wrong, that I still know shame and evil, and that I can still love and hate!

And so two-thirds of the day flies by under my pen. Twilight obscures my light, and blurs my eyes, so I put down my pen and move several pots of fresh flowers to the third-floor veranda to prepare them for absorbing the dew at night. Then I walk to the courtyard to admire the goldfish in the tank. I envy those little red and black animals that swim leisurely and tirelessly in the green oil. They are so free, peaceful, carefree, and happy! They never care about the world outside the tank. They regard the world outside the tank as hell, so they would rather die of old age in their small universe than take a single step outside the tank. They disdain associating with humans--whom they regard as demons--outside the tank. Therefore, I am ashamed to approach them too closely. I respect their kite!

It's time for me to go for a walk. I walk to the end of Shanyin Road, strolling under a row of nameless trees, silently stepping on the fallen leaves, counting my own footprints. Occasionally, I also look up at the vast sky. My heart sometimes races with the clouds, and my soul winks at the stars! If there is a moon, I will find a clean spot to sit down, or lie down, and let the moonlight embrace me, and I will kiss the moonlight with all my passion, all my love.

The night sends me back to the small building, back to the study, back to that chair that is like the mouth of a tiger.

I pick up my pen again, continuing to write the "unfinished" words. The cigarette butts have already piled up into a jagged little mountain. There are no more voices of people or things around, so I brew a covered bowl of the hottest clear tea, and perhaps even pour a glass of wine--Yellow Dragon, or Green Bean Burn--drinking it slowly, to wash away and clarify the fatigue and dust of the day. At the same time, I use ivory tiles to "pass the checkpoints"; "slay the generals"; "seize the treasures"; "divine the hexagrams"; to help me dispel the day's troubles; vent the day's emotions; although I will never be able to "pass" all the "checkpoints"; slay a demon "general"; obtain half a golden "treasure"; or divine anything but the lowest "hexagram."

When the tea and wine are gone, I open a collection of Tang and Song poems and prose to read, wanting to learn how the ancients wrote about their blood, flesh, thoughts, emotions, heart, and soul. As a result, from Du Fu's poems, Li Qingzhao's lyrics, Du Guangting's "The Story of the Curly-Bearded Guest" and Le Shi's "The Song of Lasting Regret," I only see genuine, pure, and honest "truth"; beautiful and noble "beauty"; and virtuous and profound virtue! However, I cannot "learn" it, even though I have the ambition.

After a long time, I need to rest. Like usual, after washing, I go into the bedroom, lie down, close my eyes, stop the waves of thought, and just quietly listen to the night, and whisper silently to the night, until the god of dreams pulls me into another illusory realm!

### Rainy Night

— Lao Kai

Blackness. The chirping of insects on the lawn seems to be singing a funeral song for spring, or perhaps they are annoyed by spring's departure.

The streetlights, with their drowsy eyes, stare at those few French parasol trees, green to the point of blackness, apparently deeply lamenting the trees' already vanished age of virginity.

Everywhere exudes the mood of early summer, especially on this rainy night.

I sit alone at my desk, sometimes looking out the window, sometimes sinking my thoughts into the sound of raindrops soaking and dripping. The rooster crows for the first time, and still there is not a trace of sleepiness.

From the blue haze of the cigarette, I suddenly think of the violin. Not long ago, could I not hear the sad lament of the violin coming from next door?

However, this music lover, yesterday, already supported by his instrument, walked towards the distance. For the loss of him and that mournful sound, I feel as disoriented and disappointed as if I lost a lover.

Next to my hand, lying lonely, is Dostoevsky's novel. I open it, letting the ghastly lamplight shine on the miserable faces and tragic encounters of those insulted and injured. In between this, tears actually secretly seep out of the corners of my eyes. I am thinking that our reality is not at all different from theirs.

I stand up, pacing with heavy steps, the floor under my feet emitting a thudding sound. The pain of creation corrodes me. The damp night air assails me. But I, on the contrary, do not feel alone, and neither do I, as a result of the dreariness, step into the mournful fog.

I have quite beautiful fantasies--draping myself in a poet's cloak, I move towards that boundless newly arisen prairie; or, with a mud-smeared walking stick, I advance in the stark desert without a trace of human smoke. At that time, even if the wind and sand hit my whole body so I bled, or sharp rocks broke my toes, I would also stubbornly smile, I would also slash open the cosmos' entanglement?, breathing in the ancient English air.

The roosters' crows gradually increase in number. In the distance, the rumbling sounds of single-wheeled carts and laborers' songs shatter the deathly silence all around.

I know: this is the moment when the waning night will end. Hastily, I turn my prolonged, deep gaze towards outside--

The corner of the sky in the east splits open a streak of silver. Dawn is slowly dragging its red cart as it rolls from atop that streak of silver.

I know: the waning night is quickly dying, hastily I press down on my heart's jumping and listen intently, and I carefully distinguish:

What is dawn's footstep, what is the weary sigh of the rain on the leaves.

### Mr. Wang Yachen's Solo Exhibition

— Xu Zhongnian

Location: Guohua Yuan, Nanjing West Road, at the intersection with Chengdu Road:

Time: May 15th to 21st.

I would like to give Brother Yachen a nickname: "Wang Goldfish"! In fact, this nickname was established more than ten years ago, and today it is just a matter of revisiting an old topic. Why? When it comes to painting, everyone has their own specialty: Beihong's horses, Daqian's lotuses, Shiqi's peacocks, Shanshou's tigers, Baoshi and Junbi's landscapes, Shaoang's cicadas, Chuntai's chrysanthemums... and Yachen's fish. Painting is like writing, each has its own personality. A painter is like a writer, he must have his own unique style; so that a viewer, or a reader, can guess who the author is just by looking at the work, without looking at the signature. Having personality does not necessarily mean that the work has value; however, there is absolutely no reason for a work without personality to have value. Yachen's paintings, the fish Yachen paints, especially the goldfish Yachen paints, mixed in with the works of others, even though I suffer from nearsightedness, I can distinguish them, probably eight or nine times out of ten.

In the past, Zhao Songxue painted horses, crawling on the ground imitating the horse's posture. I don't know if Yachen had a special extra-large goldfish tank custom-made? Maybe he asked Mrs. Junli to act as a goldfish, and he painted her from the side. In short, our son-in-law from Wuxi, when he goes to Wuxi every summer vacation to be a "prince consort", must admire hundreds of tanks of goldfish, captivated and enlightened in his mind, and then apply it to his brush and ink.

"You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish?" I am not Wang Yachen, but I know the joy of Wang Yachen painting fish! First, seeing things evokes emotions, he paints fish on paper, and paints Junli in his heart; second, his personality is gentle and elegant, quite like a fish--good heavens, I'm referring to goldfish, not crocodiles! I instruct people to stand facing Yachen, observing him painting goldfish: when he is immersed in his work, his eyebrows, eyelashes, and nose all move; --just like Alexandre Dumas writing a novel, laughing heartily when he gets to the good parts (since he has to "hold his belly", of course, he temporarily puts down his pen), and crying loudly when he gets to the sad parts.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Yachen closed his doors to guests, working hard on his paintings and admiring goldfish. Of course. The scope of his paintings is not limited to goldfish, he paints all kinds of flowers, birds, and feathers. He has also worked hard in calligraphy. This exhibition, if I remember correctly, is the first one since the victory, and also the first one after many years of seclusion: nurturing his spirit and accumulating his strength, it is bound to be quite remarkable.

If the reader, miss or mister, after reading my "fishy article," is not moved and does not go to see the fish painted by Yachen, especially the goldfish, and other things: then, I will regret that she or he has missed a rare opportunity for artistic enjoyment!

### A Group of Chicks

— Wang Yachen

### Thomas More

— Meng Long

The founder of the English Renaissance, the author of the novel "Utopia", Thomas Moore (1475-1535), was a man of great talent and high moral character. He offended King Henry VIII and was sentenced to death. When he went to the chopping block, he remained calm and composed, and smiled at the executioner, saying: "This beard has committed no crime, isn't it a pity to cut it off with me?" After saying that, he lifted his beautiful beard with his hand, and stretched his neck to be beheaded.

### Door

— Sha Lei

In my consciousness, there often appears a door. Its metal body emits light, giving people a heavy feeling like a metal object. All around that door, clouds of mist are rising, sometimes seeming very close, sometimes seeming very far away.

In my moments of joy or loneliness, that door often seems to be swiftly pushed in front of me by a cart, and then immediately disappears.

What kind of omen and secret is this? Is the inside of the door a narrow prison cell or a vast space unfolding? Will a devil's hand reach out from that side, or will endless treasures flow out?

I cannot guess at all. I curiously gaze at it with the eyes of my consciousness. I long to know its contents, but I have never tried to touch or open it.

In my afternoon nap today, I unconsciously walked into a palace. On that side, all kinds of strange faces emitted the sounds of various different musical instruments, and from those transparent living pillars, flames sometimes spurted out, and sometimes clear springs rippled. I felt that this overly vast and deep place was filled with a terrifying atmosphere; when I shouted loudly, I don't know how I was already standing outside the door.

That door is the old friend I meet morning and evening. It is still so brilliant and solemn, steaming with heat, as if saying:

"Ah, child, you are only worthy of gazing at me from afar."

I could not bear that mockery. With all the anger of my life, I fiercely pushed it open. In a crash of earth-shattering sounds, I woke up.

At this moment, I have returned to the human world, sitting in living reality. I have tried several times to reconstruct the image of that door in my consciousness, but it is impossible. What appears is only a white expanse of fog, mixed with a ring of intense light, seeming to be a most primitive landscape belonging to the era of nebulas.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Oh...! This is the third 'Oh'. Speaking frankly, at this moment, Hejian really doesn't know what to say that would be appropriate. He can't even think of something inappropriate to say; it's because this young lady only cares about speaking her own mind, and after speaking, she slams the door shut, leaving no room for others to interrupt.

"But I think... my time is limited," this tone was tinged with impatience; it was like writing an article, using the words "but" to open the next paragraph. "And I don't know when my brother will come again, perhaps he won't come at all; so..." At this point, she revealed a row of white, even teeth, adding two shallow, dimpled smiles, giggling, "so I think I should just talk to you directly...!" Without even looking at Hejian's reaction, not welcoming him, since Hejian had entered, a light shone, flooding the room.

"Isn't this...?" Hejian watched her walk into the room, thinking, "If she wanted to talk directly, she should have said so earlier, wouldn't that have been the end of it? Why bother with so much fuss?"

"Very well, please sit down, Miss." Hejian did not casually close the door. In Hejian's mind, of course, there was no concept of "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," and there was no need to keep the conversation a secret. As for why he left the door open, perhaps he hoped that this Miss Mo would finish speaking in a few words and quickly leave, saving him the trouble of opening and closing the door?

"I think it would be better to close the door, is that okay?" Although she asked, she didn't care about authority or anything else, walked over and slammed the door shut with a "bang"; turning around, she boldly picked a small sofa by the window and sat down comfortably. As soon as she sat down, she looked up:

"I want to ask you a question, Mr. Gu..."

"Oh...!" Hejian hadn't even had time to sit down, "Please, enlighten me..." Hejian really had no choice but to hope she would "enlighten" him quickly and leave quickly.

"Enlighten? ...How polite...! I'll ask you a small thing first! I presume you have a handgun here? Any kind, as long as it's a handgun." The question was asked so abruptly, but her expression was so light and nonchalant.

Hearing this question, Hejian was naturally startled; he really didn't understand what her motive or intention was in asking this question; as for any reason, he couldn't explain it at all.

"A handgun?... "

"That's right... Let me be clearer; I want to use a handgun to test something."

When a person is extremely embarrassed, they may sometimes be provoked into a stubborn streak, and the triggering of this stubborn streak sometimes requires the other party to provoke it, and sometimes it can erupt automatically. Moreover, Hejian was neither weak nor incompetent. The reason he was embarrassed at this time was simply because he was in a bad mood at the time, and he was caught off guard by this young lady, and her appearance was so peculiar. At the same time, Hejian's problem was that he always maintained his consistent "gentlemanly" demeanor, preferring to suffer some grievances himself rather than be rude to others, especially a woman, and even more so a young woman like Yaoqun at the beginning. But the suppressed stubborn streak was limited.

### "Internship" of Jiaotong University Students

— Leike

The students of Jiaotong University recently petitioned, among whom the fourth-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department once privately assembled a locomotive in the garage and added twenty-seven sleeping cars, preparing to take all the students to Beijing. According to the newspaper report the next day, these senior students, after several test runs, finally started the train again in the middle of the sound of the whistle after half an hour. "The train started from slow to fast, very naturally and smoothly. The driving skills exceeded expectations." The writer does not want to enumerate the rights and wrongs of this petition, but in this chaotic phenomenon, seeing that university students can drive trains by themselves, and the skills are quite good, finally feels that these mechanical students have not failed the education given to them by the school, and the practical education of Jiaotong University in this aspect can also be regarded as impressive.

In the evening paper, this matter was described in more detail. It is said that the students of Wang Sili were sitting in the locomotive because "they had no driving experience, so they felt quite difficult when they started driving." Some doubts had to be solved by asking the workers in the station, and although they got their faces and hands covered with coal dust, "it was still not smooth." From this, it can be seen that these students usually have no opportunity for practical driving, and if there had not been this petition, perhaps they would never have any opportunity. We do not know whether these students specialize in this subject, but if they do, then their lack of practice is a pity.

However, after the workers at the station refused to explain, and after overcoming the extreme difficulties, the train was finally started by them. The value of this internship has far surpassed the lectures in their textbooks and classrooms. (If they are specializing in this subject.) The usefulness of internships is also fully demonstrated here.

In any case, the activities of Jiaotong University students at the North Station this time, except for a little internal dispute at the end, the allocation of work and the command of actions all showed an efficiency rarely seen in past student activities. From this, it can be seen that the scientific education they received on weekdays was not in vain. In the eyes of the general public, this can be regarded as a gratifying phenomenon in misfortune.

However, what all this shows is only a kind of technique. Technique is important, but more important is the direction of manipulating technique. We are very happy to see the achievements that the students have obtained from education, but we also sincerely hope that they can make good use of this valuable achievement.

### Memories of Taiyuan

— Ke Ren

The merchants from the north, their felt hats covered with a layer of yellow sand, the country bumpkins who slipped down from the Taihang Mountains in the east, and the rough men who came from the fertile fields of southern Shanxi, covered in wheat and cotton fragrance, when they first walked out of the noisy Taiyuan Railway Station and looked up at the solemn and majestic city towers, they couldn't help but exclaim in unison: "This is a big city."

But near the city gate, there was a swarm of open-air noodle stalls, and heads and steaming mist surged on the rows of benches; even more were the Jin-Han department store stalls that had pulled up cloth awnings; and traveling merchants and hawkers who shuttled back and forth with shoulder poles, as well as craftsmen who made and sold things by hand; these were not unfamiliar to those people; and this big city was immediately loved by the people of Shanxi.

I remember a serene summer night when I walked slowly along the wide and flat Xin Nanmen Street towards the heart of the city; I was surprised by the early closing of the city's shops; besides a few sparse street lamps, I was greeted only by street food vendors lighting sesame oil lamps; some selling eight-treasure porridge and sweet wine eggs; some frying meat cakes; and some selling oil tea and tangyuan. Focusing on those flickering, intimate, scattered lights, I was once again immersed in the long-lost time in my mountain village home.

In spring, it is the season of wind and sand in Taiyuan City; trees are sparse, and it is difficult to find any pleasing green on the dry land; looking out from the city walls? Besides the mountains, there are still distant mountains. But on clear days, flocks of swallows from the south twittered and chirped as they flew through the blue mist spewed out by the chimneys and flew towards the horizon; I thought: The south of the Yangtze River must already be full of singing orioles and growing grass.

Unexpectedly, six years later, I have come to the south of the Yangtze River, but Taiyuan has fallen into a state of alarming plants and trees; thinking of the wind and rain in Tuancheng, no wonder I am worried.

### Human Power and Horsepower

— Cheng

The size of machines is calculated in horsepower. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, one horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute. What one human power can do is only one-tenth of that. Therefore, one horsepower is equal to ten human powers. This has been established as a rule, and not only ordinary people and university students believe that what is said above is accurate, but also engineers generally believe it to be true. However, Dr. Stemanzi calculated that one human power is only equal to 33 watts, and for some work, such as shoveling dirt, one human power is only equal to 15 watts. According to Kent's Mechanical Handbook, Rankin once actually tested in Scotland that a person walking up and down the stairs empty-handed for eight hours cost a total of 2,059,200 foot-pounds. Other activities such as pumping water, lifting objects, hammering nails, and pushing small carts are all different, averaging 35 watts per human power. Recently, Professor Wu Erde of Yuning University in the United States conducted various tests in China, such as carrying water, carrying weights, carrying bricks, and pumping water, averaging 31 watts per human power. Based on the above actual measurements, one horsepower must be equal to at least twenty human powers, and the saying of ten people to one horse is self-defeating.

### Bankrupts of Conscience

— Bu Shu

The professors' association of Central University recently issued a declaration, bitterly criticizing the current social and cultural crisis, in which there is a very painful passage:

"The current unreasonable and unfair situations force honest and law-abiding talents, if they are unwilling to drift with the tide, to suffer from insufficient food and clothing, mental anxiety, diseases without medical treatment, and even death. This is the destruction and reverse elimination of national talents."

The social atmosphere is becoming increasingly abnormal. If this continues, people will eventually mistakenly believe that the abnormal is normal. Habits change people, and they are irresistible. All moral precepts are insufficient to resist habits. For example, if a county magistrate who takes office empty-handed does not have a dozen loads of luggage to show off after leaving office, what kind of person will his relatives and friends think of him? — It's not that he is extravagant and clean; it's just that he must be an idiot. Considering the current treatment of county government personnel, isn't the authorities encouraging everyone to find ways to open up financial resources themselves? When a certain county magistrate in Zhejiang Province took office a few years ago, he wrote a couplet himself:

"Bringing a heart of sincerity;

Not taking a single blade of grass away."

This sincere heart is admirable, but honest officials are not easy to be. The execution expenses for a county magistrate to entertain visiting superiors have already exceeded the income of the incumbent staff by many times; and according to the precepts of feudal society, "when one person achieves enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." A certain county magistrate must take care of his relatives and friends besides his own life, so after he stepped down and took away three boatloads of luggage, the local gentry jointly sued him, and some busybodies even added two lines to his "famous couplet":

"Bringing a heart of sincerity — intending to plunder;

Not taking a single blade of grass away — what's the use?"

This story is now circulating in various parts of Zhejiang, and if someone writes a sequel to "In-Office Legal Admonitions" in the future, they will probably not forget this story. There must be many people in China who sincerely want to be good officials, perhaps they did have great ambitions at the beginning — "Bringing a heart of sincerity, not taking a single blade of grass away", but as time goes on, "habits are the most eloquent", they eventually have to surrender to "corruption".

Balzac said it well:

"Our heart is a treasure, if you empty it all at once, you will go bankrupt."

In such a social climate, how many people can maintain their integrity as consistently as they protect their treasury? And how many people, under the influence of customs, suddenly become bankrupts of conscience!?

### Ji Xiaolan's Humor

— Yi Feng

Ji Xiaolan of the Qing Dynasty was humorous by nature. In official and unofficial history, there are many anecdotes about his jokes. For example, the poem "Once worshiped the Prime Minister's mansion as a godmother, today the godfather's surname is Liang again, the new Minister of the Ministry of Officials has a glorious family, the old Zhongtang has a desolate pool pavilion. If you are interested, you should pity the concubine, how can I have no face only for you, I personally hold one hundred and eight Manichees, and I still bring the fragrance of milky flowers when I explore it." was written by Ji to satirize a certain Tanhua who was known as a "disciple of three surnames".

Ji not only satirized in poetry like this, but also had a genius for pairing, and his words were as wonderful as pearls when he picked them up at will. For example, Lu Ershan visited Ji one day and said, "I just watered my horse at the Four Eyes Well, what is the antithesis for the Four Eyes Well?" He replied, "Just take your Excellency as the antithesis, how about it?" Lu couldn't help but laugh. Another example is, "During the Qianlong period, the Ministry of Works caught fire, and someone came up with the antithesis: 'The Ministry of Water has a fire, and Minister of Works Jin is building on a large scale.' Ji Wenda happened to enter the temple, and a certain secretary, who was very burly and proud of being a southerner with the appearance of a northerner, grinned and said, "A southerner with the appearance of a northerner, what kind of thing is the Secretary of the Ministry?" His humor was often like this.

The most humorous thing is that he once presided over a certain imperial examination, and the proctor on the left and right announced that the new champion Liu Yushu had come to pay his respects. After asking to see him, he first asked where he lived. Liu replied with "Hibiscus Nunnery". When Ji heard this, he suddenly laughed so hard that he couldn't straighten up, and then he retreated inside, unable to come out for a long time. He ordered Liu to return to his mansion temporarily, and Liu was uneasy and did not know why. He saw him again the next day and asked him the reason. Only then did he know that he had made a couplet that day: "Liu Yushu lives in Hibiscus Nunnery, Pan Jinlian makes a big fuss in the Grape Arbor." Borrowing the chapter title of Jin Ping Mei as the second line, it was seamless, and the antithesis was absolutely perfect, so he praised himself deeply, and sent the guest away halfway, making his disciples unable to understand.

There is also an anecdote that is also very funny. According to Qiao Dui Lu, "Colleagues were holding a spring wine party, and someone asked for an antithesis for 'Taiji produces two Yi, which produce four images'. Ji Xiaolan happened to arrive, and the colleagues said, "You are only allowed to enter after the antithesis is finished." The Duke said, "A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold. I am very hungry and have no time to compete with you." The guests all retreated."

In addition, the widely circulated story of "Old Xianzhu" is even more popular, and many people know it. This Duke's humorous genius is truly beyond the reach of those who ask for humor nowadays.

### Remembering Master Taixu

— Feng Zikai

Master Taixu and I are from the same small town, both from Chongde County, Zhejiang. But we met very late, for the first time in Chang'an Temple in Chongqing between 1943 and 1944. As soon as I saw him, I felt very close to him, because although he left his hometown when he was young, he spoke a pure Chongde dialect, and talking to him was very satisfying. Every time I entered the city, I would definitely go to Chang'an Temple to visit him. At that time, I often felt that Master Taixu before I met him and Master Taixu after I met him were completely different.

Before I met him, I was very surprised by the rumors I heard from others. Some people said he was a social monk, some said he was a bureaucratic monk, and some said he was a show-off monk. I didn't believe it, so I went to visit him in person. As soon as I saw him, it proved that the rumors outside were all misunderstandings. He was a true monk of orthodox faith, compassion, and vigorous diligence. I am not saying this casually. Orthodox faith means that he has a very correct understanding and belief in Buddhism. Compassion means that there is absolutely no trace of greed, anger, or delusion in his attitude. Vigorous diligence means that he has great enthusiasm for the cause of spreading Buddhism. A true monk means that in addition to orthodox faith, compassion, and vigorous diligence, he also strictly abides by the monastic precepts for decades as one day, and has the qualifications of a Bhikkhu. Every time I visited him, when I walked out of Chang'an Temple and went downhill, I sighed and admired him endlessly. I wondered, "How could Chongde produce such a person?"

The misunderstanding of him from the outside world was really caused by his vigorous diligence in the world. He cared about all undertakings that were beneficial to Buddhism, temples, and monks; he did not avoid difficulties or fear troubles, and he would do his best to plan, maintain, or initiate them. Anything that has a relationship with society is always bound to cause criticism, discussion, or rumors. Master Taixu's misunderstanding by some people was all caused by his enthusiasm for discussing the Dharma. But he never cared about these misunderstandings and remained vigorously diligent until his death.

My last meeting with Master Taixu in Chongqing was a few days before the restoration in the Zizhulin vegetarian restaurant. That day, I invited seven or eight friends who were lay Buddhists to have a farewell gathering in Chongqing. What I cannot forget is that I almost made him break the rule of abstinence from alcohol. The wine glasses and teacups in Zizhulin were the same. The wine pot was also a teapot. Everyone at the table drank alcohol, and one or two of the monks also drank alcohol. I didn't know whether Master Taixu drank alcohol or not, so I toasted him a cup to see if he would decline like Master Hongsan. Perhaps he was talking enthusiastically with the person next to him at the time and did not pay attention to my toast, and did not decline. I was surprised: "Master Taixu does not abstain from alcohol!" Then I offered the wine, Master Taixu picked up the cup, took a small sip, and quickly spat it out, and suddenly said, "It turns out it's wine, I thought it was tea." The whole table burst into laughter. I was very sorry, and I had the sin of tricking this old master. If it had been Master Yinguang, I would have been greatly scolded. But Master Taixu did not punish me. Master Taixu is no longer among people, and this regret still exists in my heart. I can only say that he was reborn in the Western Paradise. (May 9, 1940, in Hangzhou)
