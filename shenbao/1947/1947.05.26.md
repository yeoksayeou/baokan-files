### Communist Army Outside Changchun Moves Southward: Fierce Fighting in Siping and Meihekou; Defense Works in Shenyang to be Completed Within a Week

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] Small bands of Communist troops continue to disrupt the outskirts of Changchun. Yesterday at midnight, over 300 Communist soldiers trespassed upon Tangyingzi, five li north of Shichengzi. They were defeated by the defending troops around 3:00 AM on the 25th.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 25th] The Communist forces originally planning to attack Changchun have bypassed its periphery and moved southward to attack important cities along the Changchun-Shenyang Railway. When Nationalist troops flew over Siping in the past few days, a large force of Communist troops was spotted moving towards the city area within twenty li west of Siping. It is widely rumored here that the Communist forces attacked Siping at dusk on the 24th, engaging in fierce battles with the Nationalist army. Military officials here have neither confirmed nor denied this, stating only that it is confirmed the main force of the Communist army has moved southward. Except for a small number of Communist troops still present in Dalingzhen, thirty li west of Changchun, and Fanjiatun, twenty li to the south, there are no Communist troops in other areas around Changchun.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 25th] The citizens of Changchun have spent the quietest two nights in a week amid a state of emergency and have enjoyed comfortable sleep. With the continuous arrival of Nationalist transport planes at the new airport and the completion of city defense arrangements, the anxiety of the 600,000 residents threatened by the Communist army's siege has gradually eased, and order within the city has returned to normal.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jilin, 25th] As the Communist army suffers successive defeats here, the situation within the city continues to improve. The continuous airlift of supplies by the Nationalist air force has boosted public morale, and the work of comforting the troops is being carried out enthusiastically.

[Another Dispatch] The Communist forces harassing the area between Yitong and Shuangyang have been somewhat weakened by the defending troops' counterattacks, but their ambition remains undiminished. They appear to be continuing their intrusion southeastward. The Nationalist army has rushed to encircle and suppress them in separate directions.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] A portion of the Communist army that captured Shuangyang, southeast of Changchun, on the afternoon of the 23rd, captured the Yantongshan Railway Station on the Shenyang-Jilin Line on the morning of the 25th. Their movements are unclear. Fierce fighting is raging in the Meihekou and Hailong areas.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The crisis in Siping has become more stable due to the power of the air force and the counterattacks of reinforcements. The Communist army appears to be retreating.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] A railway bridge on the China Changchun Railway, south of Siping, has been destroyed by the Communist army. The old Siping, west of Siping, has been occupied by the Communist army.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] Approximately five divisions, totaling over 30,000 Communist troops, have invaded southward along the China Changchun Railway. According to military sources here, fierce fighting broke out near Siping last night, although the details of the battle are still unknown. It is only known that the Hāfú Railway Station (on the Siping Line) on the Pingmei Railway and the Guojiaodian Railway Station (north of Siping) on the China Changchun Railway have been captured by the Communist army.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The battles in Siping and Meihekou are particularly fierce today, the 25th, in Northeast China. In Meihekou, the Communist army is fiercely attacking Meihekou with a large force of five divisions and three brigades. The Nationalist army is thinly stretched, and the situation is precarious.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Panling, 25th] The situation in Dongfeng, Xifeng, and Xi'an along the Pingmei Railway has become more stable. However, Kangping on the China Changchun Railway has fallen again, and Faku is under renewed threat. North of Siping, the Nationalist troops in Guojiaodian and Lishu have shifted their positions.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] Starting from the 25th, the military and police in Shenyang are mobilizing the public to build city defense works, such as digging trenches in the suburbs, which are scheduled to be completed within a week to aid in defense.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The Communist army in southern Liaoning is attempting to contain the Nationalist army by sending two groups of approximately 2,000 soldiers each out of Pulandian and Piziwo to harass the area. On the 25th, they reached the northeast of Wafangdian, and the Nationalist army is currently pursuing and attacking them.

### Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Other Schools Decide to Resume Classes Today; Hu Shih Convenes Meeting with Student Representatives

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Peiping, 25th] Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and other schools have decided to "suspend the suspension" starting on the 26th. Hu Shih again convened a meeting with representatives from the North China Student Union and Peking University's departments last night to persuade them to resume classes on the 26th. Mr. Hu stated that student movements are a natural reaction of youth to dissatisfaction with reality and cannot be directly attributed to the instigation of the Communist Party. However, political and economic problems cannot be resolved through strikes. Furthermore, strikes should not be used to respond to repeated incidents inside and outside the school, as this will lead to endless unrest. In times of turmoil, calmness is especially needed, and rumors should not be easily believed. Mr. Hu also stated that the Peiping authorities have not interfered in this student movement, but everyone hopes that students will no longer incite strikes, especially among middle school students, as they are not yet adults and cannot be held responsible for any events. Moreover, the Communist army is very close to Peiping, and local authorities cannot ignore this.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Tianjin, 25th] The striking students of Nankai University continued to divide into more than ten teams at 6:00 PM on the 25th, going to factories and schools in Tianjin to promote the "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Famine" movement and performing plays such as "Triumph" and "Million-Dollar Banknote" on campus.

### Xu Bingchang Offers a Word to Students Against the Civil War

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Kaifeng, 25th] Xu Bingchang, a renowned historian in China, is currently lecturing here. In light of the student unrest in various places, he has published an article titled "A Word to Students Against the Civil War," which is heartfelt and worthy of deep consideration. The article states: "The few words I want to say today are not addressed to the very few students who believe that the government is corrupt beyond redemption and must be overthrown, but to the majority of young people who are extremely frustrated because they cannot think of a solution and are therefore in danger of being easily exploited. Recently, student movements across the country have almost all shouted the clear slogans of 'Oppose the Civil War,' 'Want Peace,' and 'Oppose Famine.' These slogans themselves are irreproachable, but since the war that has continued from last year's talks and fights to today's exclusive fighting without talks, one could say, from one perspective, that neither side was sincere from the beginning of the talks. However, from another perspective, one could also say that both sides were sincere. What they both lack are not these, but because of two other major obstacles, their negotiations are not easily successful." The article goes on to point out that the first major obstacle is mutual suspicion and distrust, and the second major obstacle is that the military men on both sides—or perhaps also many of the literati—all believe that they are very confident in their ability to win. "Since they do not trust each other and all believe that they have a way to win, it is really too difficult to hope that they will not fight." The article concludes: "One of these two major obstacles has now been almost completely eliminated. It is by no means an improper thing for the people of the whole country to rise up today to oppose civil strife and demand peace, but it must be noted that a war cannot be started by one side alone, nor can it be stopped by one side alone. As the saying goes, it takes two hands to clap, which is what this means. Now, if we want to use the power of the people to stop civil strife, we need to act simultaneously with the students and the people in the so-called 'Liberated Areas,' forcing the government on one hand and the Chinese Communist Party on the other to stop fighting at the same time, and wait quietly for a negotiated solution. Only then will there be hope of success. Otherwise, simply opposing the civil war in name is actually participating in and aiding one side of the civil war, increasing the attitude of the civil war, and one's self has already become a party to the civil war. How can one oppose others?" This point is very important, and I hope that the majority of students today will think deeply about it.

[Another Dispatch] Students from the agricultural and engineering colleges of Henan University initiated a movement to resume classes. On the 24th, they were actually blocked by some students from the university headquarters. However, the students requesting resumption of classes are still resolutely striving and appealing to protect the school's reputation and their studies, and they have stated that they will not stop until they achieve the goal of resuming classes and protecting the school.

### Missing Students from National Central University Are Unconfirmed

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the previous reports of the missing students Li Leding and Zhu Peiyu from National Central University and Jiang Wentong, a student from the affiliated high school of Zhejiang University, the military law office of the Capital Garrison Headquarters sent special personnel to National Central University to investigate the truth of the case. The person in charge of the school's guidance office replied that there were no such individuals as Li Leding and Zhu Peiyu, and all students have now returned to school. Shi Xundao and Dong Xinbao from the school's student self-government association stated that when the ranks were in disarray on the 20th, a classmate (whose name is unknown) pulled Jiang Wentong away from the group, and he may now be staying with relatives and friends in Nanjing.

### National Economic Commission to Hold First Meeting Today

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] The National Economic Commission is scheduled to hold its first meeting since its establishment at 3:00 PM on the 26th.

### Minister of Communications Answers Oral Interpellations

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Oral interpellations on communications were presented on the morning of the 25th by nine people, including Li Peiguo, Zhang Dinghua, Cai Zhisheng, and Duan Zhuo. The focus of their interpellations was on plane crashes, railway disruptions, the need to quickly build the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, and the difficulty of purchasing train tickets, as well as the poor order on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Zhang Dinghua also raised the necessity of quickly building the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, and at the same time, the Ministry of Communications should not use this as propaganda to say how good the work is, when in reality only one-tenth of the Duyun-Guiyang section has been built, and the construction funds are only 12 billion. Although the road maintenance fees for highways have been increased, the bridges and roadbeds continue to deteriorate. Li Peiguo expressed dissatisfaction that the Peiping-Gubeikou Railway, the most important railway in the north, has not yet been repaired. He believes that the poor transportation is the reason why the Communist army surrounded Rehe and why the war was lost, and the responsibility lies with the failure to "open" the Peiping-Gubeikou Railway. Secondly, the road police's oppression of the common people and failure to cooperate with them is particularly abhorrent. Mr. Li believes that the road is like something built by corrupt officials. Cai Zhisheng stated that the traffic on the Peiping-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railways is not flexible or coordinated. Sometimes there is one train a day, and sometimes there are four trains a day, and the joint transportation between the Peiping-Hankou and Longhai Railways is not cooperative. The distance between the two railways is far, and passengers transferring from the Longhai Railway to the Peiping-Hankou Railway must walk three li, which is unreasonable. At the same time, there are too many drawbacks on the Peiping-Longhai Railway, and the cost of loading and unloading goods is too high, which is an open secret known to almost everyone. Duan Zhuo said that the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway has not yet been completed, with a budget of 20 billion. How can it be enough when prices rise every day? He also believes that attention should be paid to transportation in the Northwest, and one should not dig a well only when thirsty. Gu Gengye pointed out that not many railways have been taken over in the Northeast, but there are two or three management organizations, and the chairman of the China Changchun Railway also serves as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications and the director of the Ministry's Highway Administration, holding several important positions at the same time. How can things be done well? Mr. Gu solemnly stated that if this continues, the rights regained by the China Changchun Railway will be abandoned again. Li Qia and Lu Xiguang both stated that the Baoji-Tianshui Railway should be built, and Mr. Lu also said that Minister Yu can go and see it in person. Others also raised issues such as the poor order on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Subsequently, four written inquiries were submitted. Minister Yu answered them at 10:30 AM, stating that the Ministry had handled all takeover matters in accordance with the law. As for some people's belief that railway construction is biased towards the Southeast, it is actually because materials are more convenient to transport along the river, while the opposite is true in the Southwest and Northwest. The congestion on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is due to too many passengers, and there are no good solutions other than raising prices and adding trains, but prices cannot be raised at present. Illegal tickets will be corrected, and the Jiangnan Railway should be repaired ahead of schedule. Regarding the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it is currently difficult to proceed due to the inconvenience of material transportation. The section near Hengyang on the Xiang-Gui Railway has been completed, and the rest is being rushed to build. After the takeover of the Taiwan Railway, it is managed by the Taiwan Governor's Office.

### Ninth Meeting of the People's Political Council: Zhu Jiahua Reports on Education

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] The ninth meeting of the People's Political Council was held at 9:30 AM on the 25th. 197 council members attended, chaired by Wu Yifang. In addition to reading the minutes of the seventh and eighth meetings, oral interpellations and answers were conducted on the transportation report. After the recess, Minister Zhu Jiahua gave a report on education. Council members submitted 43 written inquiries, which were read out one by one. Due to the lack of time, only six oral inquiries were made until 1:00 PM in the afternoon. It was decided that the general meeting would continue with oral interpellations on the morning of the 26th. The chairman then announced the adjournment.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua attended the ninth general meeting of the People's Political Council on the morning of the 25th and gave a report on education. Mr. Zhu first gave a brief account of the work of educational restoration, stating that educational restoration was carried out based on the principles set at the National Educational Post-War Restoration Conference held in Chongqing in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic. It is now largely complete, and schools at all levels have already started classes. Most of the schools that were suspended during the War of Resistance have been restored. The takeover and adjustment of schools in the recovered areas have also come to an end. The rational distribution of schools has also been partially achieved. Mr. Zhu then explained the important issues in education at present: Regarding educational funding, Mr. Zhu stated that in the 35th year of the Republic, the expenditure on education and culture in the national budget, in addition to 60 billion for restoration expenses, accounted for 2.06 percent, totaling 47.989499 million. This year it is 4.079 percent, totaling 382.1808 million. The approximate number of provinces, counties and cities is the second largest in its total expenditure. Since the change in the financial revenue and expenditure system last year, local educational funding has become more difficult. The insufficiency of educational funding, whether at the central or local level, is indeed a fact, but considering the actual state of the country's finances, the burden is already considered small. Nevertheless, the government gives special consideration to reasonable requests for additional educational funding; although the country's finances are extremely difficult, educational funding is still increasing. We should naturally make every effort to gradually increase educational funding so that it can meet actual needs. If we want to reach the standards stipulated in the Constitution, we still need to wait for the implementation of constitutional government.

Regarding the treatment of teachers and staff, Mr. Zhu first expressed his deep respect and unease for the difficult lives of those engaged in education, and said that the treatment of educational personnel at all levels must be improved as soon as possible. The Ministry is working hard to continue to find ways to improve it. For example, the treatment of university professors is the same as that of public education personnel, although there is also a subsidy for academic research (the maximum amount was originally 50,000 yuan, which was first adjusted to 150,000 yuan in April of this year, and then adjusted to 210,000 yuan). Although the salary of professors is not subject to the restrictions of official appointment like that of public education personnel, and is determined by the school based on academic status and seniority, the maximum salary of university professors has not exceeded 600 yuan, even for those who have taught for one or two decades. It seems that the limit can be appropriately increased within the limits stipulated in the official rank salary table. Similarly, the treatment of those serving in primary and secondary schools should also be appropriately adjusted so that they can be content in poverty and jointly maintain this century-old plan for education. Regarding student public expenses, Mr. Zhu stated that the public expense system was originally a temporary expedient measure taken during the War of Resistance to take into account the economic difficulties of students who had retreated to the rear and whose family economic connections had been cut off. It should have been abolished after the victory, but the government still maintains it, considering that students' families may still have economic difficulties. The significance of giving public expenses is nothing more than to help the poor and reward those who are studious and have excellent grades. Universal public expense treatment is not proportional in any country in the world. Currently, in the budget, the number of public expense students in secondary schools and above under the Ministry's jurisdiction is 130,000, the number of public expense students in construction personnel training classes is 35,600, and the number of public expense students for helping out-of-school youth is 27,000, for a total of 192,600. The treatment of public expense students is that each person receives 2.3 dou of rice per month, which is issued according to the market price in the city where the school is located, and the non-staple food expenses are calculated based on one-seventh of the basic amount of the living allowance for public education personnel. For example, the non-staple food expenses for public expense students in the Beijing-Shanghai area have recently been adjusted from 24,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan, and will continue to be adjusted every three months in accordance with the principle of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel. According to the original budget, the expenditure on public expenses accounted for 15.7 percent of the total education budget, totaling 52.3848 million yuan. The payment of public expenses has always been made one month in advance, and there have been no problems of non-payment. The government's hard work is such that the burden of entering university today is the lightest, while the burden of entering primary and secondary schools is heavier. The government does not consider changing this public expense system, which is generally fair, until the general social and economic environment has improved.

Regarding teaching equipment, Mr. Zhu stated that the equipment in our country's schools and academic institutions was originally very simple, and suffered great losses during the War of Resistance. It has also been difficult to replenish after the war. After years of effort, the teaching equipment has been gradually replenished and reluctantly applied. For example, the lack of textbooks and books has been continuously discussed with the publishing industry to determine methods, which has greatly printed and supplied the original Western books. Although the provisions of the International Copyright Convention cannot be arbitrarily reprinted, there have also been several times of ordering and raising funds from abroad and distributing them to thousands of schools. Practical equipment has also been purchased as much as possible, and the number is increasing day by day. The Ministry has recently drafted opinions on enriching teaching equipment and emergency measures for funding plans, including foreign exchange, and is determined to continuously increase the equipment of various schools and academic institutions in the near future. At the same time, efforts will be made to increase and repair school buildings and other facilities. The government attaches great importance to this, and it is expected that it will be implemented item by item soon.

Mr. Zhu continued to explain the Ministry of Education's central work at the current stage, such as the promotion of national education, the strengthening of vocational education, and the acceleration of normal education, and said that education cannot be biased or abandoned. In our country, where most people are illiterate, how to enable most people to have access to education is the most urgent problem to be solved. In higher education, there are already 193 public and private colleges and universities, including independent colleges and universities, with approximately 120,000 students. Compared with before the war, the number of schools has increased by 80 percent, and the number of students has doubled. In terms of national conditions, this is also barely enough to meet the needs. Unless the conditions are met and the equipment is real, the Ministry will not easily increase schools or change the school system for the time being. Education cannot stagnate, and it is not appropriate to be conservative and stick to old ways. We must strive to move forward with the times. All of the Ministry's reforms to the school system and important educational measures are made after consulting with experts at various educational sector meetings, meticulously studying and making plans, and then implementing them, being cautious in everything.

Finally, Mr. Zhu mentioned student unrest, saying that while the reasons are certainly different, the lack of funding, incomplete equipment, general social unrest, and the influence of external politics are all contributing factors from the school's perspective. It is all the Communist elements lurking in the schools who are attempting to disrupt the schools as a means of expanding the disruption of society, in order to achieve their goal of overthrowing the foundation of the country. Therefore, they are scheming and instigating, using every means to instigate an incident in every school as a topic to launch a trend, and they should come up with a general topic to stimulate people's hearts and create a comprehensive student unrest. The endless facts that have emerged today have proven this beyond any doubt. Mr. Zhu appealed to the people of society, saying that we must not allow people with political motives to disrupt schools, and those who conspire and instigate must leave the schools. We must never allow the lawless actions of a few to hinder the studies of the vast majority of pure youth, and to harm the educational undertaking that is related to the national lifeline and the safety of the country. The school is a sacred place for learning, and we must do everything possible to stimulate the spirit of research and improve the atmosphere of reading. In addition to actively requesting the government and consulting with various schools to solve the difficult problems of the schools as soon as possible, the Ministry plans to convene the fourth National Education Conference this year to jointly review, promote, and innovate.

### Shao Congen's Condition Worsens

President Zhang and others visit

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Shao Congen, a 77-year-old council member, suddenly suffered from cerebral congestion while attending a banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 24th due to hard work from attending meetings for days in a row. He was sent to the Central Hospital that night around 10:00 PM, where he was treated by the famous doctor Qi Shounan. Although his condition is no longer the most serious, he is still not out of danger. Wu Dingchang, Wang Yiwu and others visited the hospital after hearing the news. When the reporter visited this morning, Jiang Yong also happened to be visiting the sick. According to him, Shao was sitting between Madam Chiang and Jiang Yong at the banquet last night, and those sitting opposite him noticed that Shao's lips turned white. Before long, Shao gradually felt unwell and sat next to Jiang, leaning closer and closer. This lasted for about half an hour, and around 9:30 PM he finally collapsed. According to Shao's beloved daughter, Ci Yun, who was serving him at the side, "My father's blood pressure was as high as 210 degrees last night, but it has now been reduced to 160 degrees, and his pulse has also been reduced from 88 beats to 64 beats." She also said, "Although my father is old, he cares about national affairs and is never behind others. After returning from the meeting yesterday morning, many friends came to the residence to discuss national affairs, and my father also gave generous speeches and did not take a nap in the afternoon. He could have not attended the meeting in the afternoon, but because the military report was important, he still reluctantly attended. This cerebral congestion can be said to be entirely caused by hard work." Shao is 77 years old this year, a native of Qingshen, Sichuan. He participated in the Xinhai Revolution and served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Sichuan Province and the Principal of the Gentlemen's Political and Legal School. Since the first People's Political Council, he has participated in the People's Political Council as a non-partisan and non-faction member up to now, and has also participated in the Political Consultative Conference. This time, he came from Chengdu from afar. Shao's wife is 62 years old and has two daughters and four sons. The eldest daughter married Lan Ruisheng, and the second daughter, Ci Yun, works at the Bank of Sichuan and came to the meeting with him. The eldest and second sons are studying at Sichuan University, and the third and fourth sons are studying at Yintang Middle School.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Shao Congen's condition worsened again in the afternoon of the 25th. His pulse increased from 66 beats to 75 beats, and his blood pressure also increased from 160 degrees to 180 degrees. According to the doctor, if there is no bleeding on the 25th, there will be no danger after the 26th. Also, those who went to the hospital to visit on the 25th included President Zhang and his wife, Lei Zhen, Kong Geng, Qian Xinzhi, and Liu Dongyan.

### The Entire Beining Line is Cleared; Peiping-Shenyang Traffic Resumes

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Peiping, 25th] The Peiping-Nanjing Line was opened to traffic on the 25th, and Nationalist reinforcements have arrived. The Communist forces attacking Beidaihe and Nandasi retreated to both sides of the railway last night. After the Railway Bureau carried out emergency repairs overnight, traffic resumed on the morning of the 25th, and two Peiping-Shenyang passenger trains also departed on the 25th. However, the threat has not been eliminated, and the Nationalist army will continue to clear the area.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The cutting off of the Peiping-Shenyang Railway by the Communist army has had a significant impact. After the Nationalist army recovered Changli, it joined forces with the Nationalist army in the Yuguan area to counterattack. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Communist forces in Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, and from Liushouying to the north of Changli were driven to the Shimentun mountainous area on the morning of the 24th, completing the clearing of the entire line. Repairs are currently being made to the damaged sections, and the Peiping-Shenyang traffic is scheduled to resume on the 26th. Starting on the 25th, the price of Shenyang Red Tobacco has already fallen.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The Peiping-Shenyang train has already departed from Shenyang on the 25th, which is a source of great joy to people here.

### Zuo Shunsheng's Speech in Shanghai: Now is a Good Time to Improve Agriculture; Stability in Rural Areas is Necessary for Peace

[Central News Agency, This City] Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, arrived in Shanghai by night train on the 24th to inspect the department's various units in Shanghai. Reporters visited him at his private residence in Difeng Lane. The following is a summary of his remarks:

I have only been in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for ten days, but I have already encountered many practical problems that have attracted my great attention. The purpose of my return to Shanghai this time is because there are several important institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Shanghai, such as the Aquatic Products Company, the Fish Market, the Silk Company, the Economic Farm, the Pest and Disease Medicine and Machinery Manufacturing Experimental Factory, etc. I want to meet the main responsible persons of these institutions to see what they are doing in their business, so as to learn more about the actual situation. If there are problems to be solved, I also want to find some appropriate solutions.

My feelings over these ten days, although I feel very anxious about the decline of the countryside today, the low purchasing power of farmers, and the seriousness of the current food problem, from the perspective of Chinese agriculture itself, there are still many optimistic points:

(1) China is, after all, a fundamentally agricultural country, and the nature of farmers is particularly excellent. There is no doubt that they are uniquely blessed.

(2) Generally speaking, friends engaged in agricultural improvement have an exceptionally strong research spirit. If the government can give them more opportunities, they will definitely be able to achieve good results.

(3) International friends who are enthusiastic about improving Chinese agriculture, especially in the United States, I feel that their sincere spirit is really admirable. In the past ten days, I have met several American experts in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and improved agricultural implements. The impression they gave me was very good. I believe that they are all outstanding people with the lofty goal of promoting Sino-US agricultural technology cooperation, and they will definitely make great contributions to China's agriculture in the future.

I believe that China is currently at the best time to improve Chinese agriculture. As long as I am in office, I will never let go of such an opportunity easily. However, a key condition is the peace and reunification of China. China must achieve stability in rural areas in order to have true peace, and only with stability in rural areas can there be a true foundation for peace. In the Han Dynasty, there was a virtuous official who was able to get some of the people who were prone to rebellion to "sell their swords and buy oxen, sell their knives and buy calves." I would like to take these two sentences as a blessing for China's future!

### Random Notes from the People's Political Council

— Our Reporters Yu Zhenji, Zhang Ming

Today is a regular Sunday holiday, but the conference continues. Especially today there is a timely education report, so the number of attendees is no less than the meetings on political, financial, and economic reports.

The Ministry of Education undoubtedly worried about a huge storm regarding this policy address and questioning. Therefore, it first made a lot of activities before the report, greeting all parties. Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Hang were running around at the meeting place.

Minister of Communications Yu Dawei's answers to the questions were very soft. Those listening in the back only knew that he was indeed answering each question, even the written ones.

This morning, the weather in the capital was neither sunny nor rainy, a bit depressing. There were no big guns fired at the meeting place, and it was not too lively, only the buzzing sound from the audience.

At the end of the meeting, the chairman proposed that due to the urgency of time, there were still fifteen councilors' oral inquiries. Could they be changed to written inquiries for Minister Zhu to answer, so as to speed up the meeting? However, Huang Yuren fired a shot, saying, "Educational issues are of concern to everyone and cannot be perfunctorily dealt with like this. We must ask Minister Zhu to answer calmly at the next meeting." Then Pan Qiying responded, so everyone agreed to pass it. Finally, this shot was fired.

Wu Wangji hurriedly wrote a family letter in the meeting place during the break.

Most of the oral questions about transportation were about the Northeast Railway, and most of the written ones were about the Guangdong-Hankou Railway.

Whether written or oral, most of the education questions had a tone of teaching or scolding. For example, Yang Buping's written question started with "Please show your conscience, can you say that you have done a good job in education?" Next, he asked several times about the professorial student movement and so on, "Do you know? Do you know?" Some people felt that Minister Zhu couldn't take it anymore.

Luo Heng held on to the spirit of fighting to the end in the case of He Dekui. In the education inquiry, she mentioned again that He Dekui was a traitor who promoted enslaved education. Why are his elementary school textbooks still in use? Why not handle it?

Zhang Dinghua said that the Guiyang airport was cancelled, and it was not easy to buy bus tickets, which really made it so that we can neither fly nor walk out. Isn't this a traffic blockade?

Duan Zhuo told a story to describe the slow pace of the train. He said: "There was a ticket inspector who checked an old man who was holding a half-price ticket. He asked, why is your ticket half-price? The old man said, I was still a child when I got on the train." The whole place roared with laughter.

(The following are random notes from the general assembly on the 24th)

According to Zuo's statistics, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which has been in existence for less than seven years, has changed six ministers. The first one, Chen Jitang, served for more than a year. The second one, Shen Honglie, served for more than two years. The third one, Sheng Shicai, served for less than a year. The fourth one served for less than a month. The fifth one, Zhou Yichun, served for more than a year. The sixth one, Zuo himself, has been in office for exactly nine days today.

Someone told Zuo Shunsheng that none of the 4 million pit props for the Kailuan Coal Mine are Chinese goods. Zuo said that if I advocate empty talk, I can say, "How important is afforestation!" Another thing is that the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute has only 1 billion yuan a year. Zuo believes that if it is funded with the budget of a military division,

Wang Zhongsheng questioned Shi Zun, first pointing out that Minister Zuo was a councilor who became an official, and he still has the same demeanor as he did back then. Zuo said as soon as he took the stage, "I have been a councilor for nine years and I know the psychology of the councilors. No one listens to his report." It is true that he wants to write a book about it.

Minister Zuo was very afraid that people would say that he was using private individuals from the Youth Party, so he repeatedly said that he paid attention to talents, regardless of factions, whether they are from the Youth Party or non-party members, and that he would decide based on their talents, which won him a lot of applause.

Many councilors mentioned the issue of surplus military officers, asking what the authorities would do with these national heroes who had made great achievements in hundreds of battles. After eight years of the War of Resistance, they had become "road generals" and were wandering the streets.

Chen Gengya, a journalist, appealed for his colleagues who died during the War of Resistance. He asked why the government only gave 30,000 yuan in compensation to the Jin Huating and Zhu Xingong of Shenbao, Zhang Xiaotong, and Zhang Sixu. What is that enough for?

Yu Dawei's report on transportation took a total of 27 minutes, the shortest of all the reports, but the place names mentioned included north, south, east, west, sea, land, and air. It was truly the shortest time and the largest space.

Minister Yu said that the printing cost of a stamp is 35 yuan, and adding the shipping cost, it costs 55 yuan. With some other costs added, a 100-yuan stamp can only be considered a break-even point, and a 50-yuan stamp is still losing money.

### Communist Defectors in Central Shandong Emerge One After Another; National Army Completes Encirclement; Communist Forces Northeast of Hongze Lake Cleared

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] After the main force of the Communist forces in Central Shandong was encircled and annihilated by the National Army, the strength of the Communist forces suffered a loss of a quarter, which led to demoralization. In recent days, they have fled and scattered, and the number of those who surrendered to the National Army has also increased day by day. The National Army has seized this rare opportunity and is gradually completing the encirclement of the remnants of the Communist forces in the triangle area of Boshan, Laiwu, and Yishui. The time for the complete annihilation of the remaining main force of the Communist forces is imminent.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] According to the lowest estimate, the Communist forces have suffered more than 40,000 casualties in this decisive battle in Central Shandong, among which the 2nd, 3rd, and 8th columns suffered heavier losses.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] On the 24th, the National Army's clearing corps in Western Shandong surrounded more than 1,000 Communist forces from the Yellow River Detachment in Hujiaying, southwest of Yuncheng, annihilating more than 300, capturing more than 20, and seizing 8 light machine guns and more than 40 rifles.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 25th] Yesterday, the troops of the Huaihai Pacification District cleared the area along the coast of Hongze Lake, and encountered 3,000 Communist troops from the 81st and 77th Regiments in Zhao Village and Gaojia Ferry. After a fierce battle for six hours, the Communist troops were almost completely wiped out. From then on, the Communist forces northeast of Hongze Lake can be said to have been largely cleared.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th] The Communist forces advancing south from Anyang have not yet launched a full-scale battle with the National Army advancing north. Both sides seem to be seeking a favorable situation. On the evening of the 24th, there was still a battle for Guangsha Paper Mill and its surrounding areas outside Anyang. The Communist forces were defeated again. The city is receiving a steady supply of food, and order is becoming more stable.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 25th] The Communist forces under Wei Fenglou in Linquan have moved to the surrounding villages, coercing the people to search for food and weapons, and are in contact with the remnants of Liu Bocheng's forces lurking in Yuan Shuizhai. A part of them has fled to Erlangong Village and Miao Village in Fuyang, and they are eagerly awaiting reinforcements to attack.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 4th] The Communist forces besieging Xiangning have increased to more than 20,000. On the 23rd, the National Army concentrated its forces in the south of the county seat and the high ground in the Wenquan area south of the city to resist firmly. The fierce battle lasted all night. On the 24th, the battle became even more intense. More than 2,000 Communist forces advancing from Hejin to Jixian had reached the area 20 li south of the city on the 23rd and continued to attack.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th] On the 22nd, the National Army in Xiangning voluntarily withdrew from the Jijiayuan north of the city and the large blockhouse on the north mountain to the Wenquan Shihe area. This area is the Nanshan of Xiangning, which is necessary for defending the county seat.

### The United States is Watching the Situation in the Far East; Economic Aid to China Can Be Realized; The Position on the Peace Treaty with Japan Will Be Further Clarified

[United Press, Washington, 25th] According to authoritative sources today, the current situation in the Far East has received greater attention from senior officials than it did several months ago. Secretary of State Marshall and his senior advisors have noted three events in Asia in the past week: the Japanese peace treaty, economic aid to the Central Government of China, and US-Soviet talks on the unification of Korea. Attention is now refocused on the China loan issue. Marshall said that since his return from Moscow, he has given much thought to the matter and is now studying ways to win the approval of Congress and the public for economic assistance to the Chinese government. Chinese officials here believe there is a good chance that part of the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank can be used before the end of June, and that the deadline can be extended. Marshall's statement also indicates that he is considering an approach that places more emphasis on direct foreign aid authorized by Congress, as is currently being given to Greece and Turkey. He believes that President Chiang has made some progress in moving the Chinese government toward liberalization, and that future developments may warrant economic assistance from the United States to the Chinese government. Some officials here believe that if the Chinese government authorities can submit a satisfactory plan for the use of the funds, there is still an opportunity to obtain some funds from the Export-Import Bank. Some observers are convinced that if the political situation in China improves, the United States may allocate part of the loan and implement a large-scale economic assistance program managed by the United States in China after reviewing its plans.

Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, well-informed sources hope that the United States will clarify its position on the Japanese peace treaty in the coming weeks and begin to explore procedural opinions from various countries. Political and economic experts have been studying for months the type of peace that the United States needs to conclude with Japan and will soon be completed. Although the United States has not yet determined the date and location of the peace conference, it is generally believed that the United States will suggest holding a Japanese peace treaty conference in Washington or San Francisco this fall. Some people in the military advocate holding it in Tokyo. As for which countries should participate in the drafting of the treaty, some Americans strongly advocate that the eleven-nation Far East Commission handle it, but some officials believe that the organization is too large to complete the work in a reasonable period of time, so they advocate that a smaller group draft the treaty. The United States will strongly oppose any proposal to have any one of the four or five major powers draft the treaty, as the United States believes that countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines have done more and longer in the war against Japan than some of the five major powers.

### Three Communist Party Members in the Philippines Arrested by the Police for Violating the Law

Two Employees of Xinhua Bookstore Still in Custody

Today, the Philippine police arrested three Communist Party members for violating the law, but their names have not yet been announced. The two Immigration Bureau inspectors were attacked by several overseas Chinese while searching for a rogue foreigner (rumored to be a Communist Party member). It is believed that these overseas Chinese are comrades of the searched person. Both inspectors were injured. Immigration Bureau Director Fabri said in a statement this afternoon that there was no legitimate reason for the overseas Chinese to riot and that the Immigration Bureau would do its best to ensure that they receive the punishment they deserve. It is also learned that two employees of the Communist-run Xinhua Bookstore were arrested several weeks ago and are still in custody.

### Price Controls Implemented in Taiyuan; Announcement Stipulates That Soldiers Eat First-Class Food; Citizens With More Than Six Months of Grain Reserves Will Not Be Issued Purchase Certificates

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 25th] Commodity prices in Taiyuan are fluctuating greatly, especially the prices of grain and flour, which are twice as high as those in Shanghai. Director Yan decided that effective today, he would implement the economic control measures decided by representatives of merchants and citizens, and convened representatives of grain, flour, cloth, coal, salt, and oil merchants, as well as relevant people's representatives, to study reasonable and effective ways to stabilize prices. On the evening of the 24th, the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government specially convened senior personnel from subordinate and economic departments, as well as those responsible for the grain merchants' joint association and the rice yarn industry association, to discuss the matter. Yan proposed that all banks, shops, and money shops should be quickly ordered to tighten loans immediately and lend them to grain and flour merchants to purchase and store grain and flour. Merchants who go to other counties to purchase grain should be assisted by the administration and protected by the army. All were resolved. On the 25th, an announcement was made on the method of controlling food grains, implementing simplified living. Soldiers eat first-class food, those who participate in self-defense and public servants eat second-class food, and the rest eat third-class food. First-class food is half rice and half wheat, second-class food is rice and wheat for two days, fine grains for eight days, and coarse grains for twenty days. Third-class food is wheat flour for one day a month, fine grains for four days, and coarse grains for twenty-five days. Second and third class food have one extra day of coarse grains in June. The purchase procedures and quotas will be announced separately. Citizens report their own grain reserves. Those who exceed six months will not be issued purchase certificates for the time being. Merchants store grain and sell it to grain merchants at the original price. If they conceal it and are found out, both the buyer and the seller will be punished by half of the transaction price. Grain transported from other counties to the province will not be punished. The purchase of raw materials for production will be regulated separately. There are also preliminary plans to restrict luxury consumption, control restaurants and theaters, provide relief to unemployed people, and alleviate the living difficulties of public servants and students. On the 25th, commodity prices in Taiyuan fell, and rice and wheat fell by 100,000 yuan per shi.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 25th] The city's rice market has resumed normal operations, and rice merchants are selling at the limited prices, which is a good situation. Today, the Zhenjiang County Government was ordered to form a Pingluo Committee together with the security authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, and local gentry to supervise the township leaders to investigate the total number of poor households within three days and decide to start selling at reduced prices on June 1.

### Letter to the Editor

We have read in your newspaper of May 10 an item concerning the Anqing County Bank's forced purchase of surplus military grain, which is inconsistent with the facts. The grain purchased by our bank was the county's share of grain from land taxes collected by the County Land Grain Office. In December of last year, the county government, in conjunction with the County Council, submitted a request to Director Pu of the Finance Department for approval to sell it due to the need for funds at the end of the year. The county's share of land grain was 2,500 shi, priced at 25,000 yuan per shi. Subsequently, the county government convened a meeting of local officials and gentry to decide to sell it to our bank at an increased price of 28,000 yuan. After the transaction, it was still stored in the warehouses of the various townships and baoli. Later, due to the urgent need to sell it off, our bank's board of directors invited local officials and gentry to hold a joint meeting in April of this year, as well as a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, and the purchasers negotiated and determined the purchase price separately according to the current rice price in the port at that time. After the negotiation was completed, the local rice price suddenly soared. A small number of local elements took advantage of the public's anxiety and incited the public, saying that the rice stored in our bank was reserved by the government for the spring famine and should be sold at a low price. The masses did not understand the truth, which led to the May 9th riot. The case is now being thoroughly investigated by various higher-level agencies, and the truth will soon be revealed. The details reported by your newspaper are presumed to be based on inaccurate rumors. We are now sending this letter of correction, hoping that you will publish it to clarify the matter. Sincerely, Huaining County Bank.

Correction: Yesterday, our newspaper carried a telegram from Wuxi regarding a prisoner escape. This was a mistake; the telegram was from Jiangyin. We hereby correct it.

### Yu Hongjun's Financial Report (Continued from yesterday's front page)

(3) Strengthening Financial Administration

In recent years, financial administration has continued to follow a consistent policy, namely, to utilize financial power to support production, establish a financial system, strengthen financial operations, and regulate the financial market. Although various measures have not fully achieved the expected results due to environmental limitations, the following are important measures that can be specifically reported on in the past year:

(1) Launching Production Enterprise Loans: After the victory, in view of the urgent need for rehabilitation and construction, we immediately urged the Four Joint Offices to provide substantial loans to various production enterprises. Regarding agricultural loans, last year was divided into two types: emergency agricultural loans and ordinary agricultural loans. The original plan was to lend a total of 30 billion yuan, but it was increased several times to meet actual needs. In the past year, it has been reported that emergency agricultural loans have been approved for a total of 6,000 , and we are constantly considering the actual situation and ordering the state to communicate, salt, grain, trade and other loans, as well as more than 5.1 million US dollars. From January to April of the 36th year, industrial loans approved amounted to more than 10,000 billion. In addition, more than 200 commercial bank funds in Northeast circulation notes are suitable for production purposes. The Central Bank previously led Shanghai banking firms and formed an industrial and commercial loan syndicate to handle loans for small and medium-sized factories and export trade, and the Central Bank undertook rediscounting, re-mortgaging, and re-pledging. Recently, the bank has established a Discount Committee to formulate discount rules and handle discounts for commercial banks and firms. This measure will be first implemented in Shanghai and then推广全国. This measure will enable general funds to be invested in production enterprises and help the recovery of the national economy. Subsequently, in order to coordinate and assist production enterprises, we consulted with the Four Joint Offices to formulate the "General Rules for Handling Production Enterprise Loans in Various Places", which was implemented nationwide. It was designated to be carried out in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou and other regions, led by local national banks and local banks and commercial firms to promote and handle. It will be particularly helpful in improving the current economic situation. The government has recently, in order to relieve the pressure of high interest rates on agricultural and industrial production as much as possible, stipulated in the Emergency Economic Plan to strengthen financial regulatory measures, and clearly stipulated the targets of loans for various types of banks.

(2) Establishing a Financial System: After the victory, the Ministry of Finance, based on the actual financial situation and referring to the banking systems of various countries, drafted a complete set of banking laws and regulations, including the Central Bank Law, the Regulations for the Three State-Owned Banks and Two Bureaus, the Banking Law, the Savings Bank Law, and the Provincial Bank Regulations. Drafts of nine laws and regulations were sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, and they will soon be formulated and promulgated. In addition, improvements have also been made to trust and insurance businesses. In the future, various types of financial institutions will have a more complete system and will be coordinated and utilized to achieve the task of using financial power to support production and construction.

(3) Managing Banking Operations, with equal emphasis on pre-event guidance and post-event correction. Regarding the use of bank funds, in recent years, we have continued to follow a consistent policy and, in accordance with the suggestions made by your council in the past, guided them to invest in production and construction enterprises in order to increase production of materials and stabilize prices. The credit business of national banks, in addition to being supervised by the Four Joint Offices at any time in accordance with regulations, is also required to prepare tables and reports on a regular basis for review. In the case of provincial and county banks, the Central Bank and the financial departments of each province supervise and inspect them separately, and the ministry reviews and processes them. As for the actual operating conditions of commercial bank funds, the head office in Beijing and Shanghai directly dispatched personnel to inspect their business. After returning to the capital last year, the ministry conducted a general survey in the two places, and more than 200 firms were inspected. The Central Bank was authorized to inspect the other firms separately. The ministry rigorously reviewed the inspection reports, and those with abnormal business operations and those whose use of funds exceeded the correct track were corrected and dealt with separately, without any leniency. In order to understand the financial situation in various places after the rehabilitation and to review the performance of the Central Bank and the provincial financial departments in inspecting and supervising various banks, the ministry implemented a system of circuit auditing and dispatched personnel to Guangzhou and Hankou to investigate and supervise. After the Emergency Economic Plan was announced, the ministry strengthened the inspection of banks in order to cooperate and rectify them. Restrictions have also been placed on the resumption of business by banks and money shops and the establishment of branches. Recently, seventeen areas, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, have been designated to restrict the resumption of business by firms and the establishment of branches, strengthening control. It is believed that financial business will gradually be brought back into order thereafter. (To be continued)

Before the opening, we know that the Municipal Council held seven days of municipal policy symposiums in various districts, and Speaker Pan also visited various districts for nine consecutive days to find out where the real public opinion lies. In today's turbulent society, we cannot help but pay special attention to the convening of this Municipal Council, and with full enthusiasm, we hope that this council will fulfill its responsibilities, speak more on behalf of the citizens, and first make good decisions on the stability that the city's citizens seek day and night, and then move on to plan municipal construction and the revival of Shanghai.

Shanghai is the largest city in our country, ranking first among all provinces and cities in the country in terms of industry and commerce and culture and education. It is also the focus of attention at home and abroad. Any administrative measure is enough to affect the whole country. The municipal authorities will never neglect the importance of their position. The Municipal Council, which represents the will of the people, has the responsibility to convey the people's sentiments and lay the foundation for civil governance. In this high-pitched tide of democracy, the direction of public opinion in China's first city is something we will see in the achievements of this Municipal Council.

In the past half month, student movements have been turbulent, rising and falling, leading a few who have ulterior motives to use pure young people to further incite strikes and market boycotts to expand social unrest. People's minds are restless, and there is almost no possibility of living and working in peace and contentment. Therefore, today's political measures, whether for the national economy or the people's livelihood, and whether for the central government or the local government, everything must put stability first. Before and after the convening of the National Political Council, voices of peace came from all directions. The Political Council is also discussing various proposed peace plans, hoping to achieve stability through peace. In fact, in our opinion, stability must come first before peace can be achieved. What the citizens of Shanghai now yearn for most urgently is social stability, and the maintenance of order is the responsibility that citizens and the government should share. It should be known that only in a stable situation can the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration be expected to improve with each passing day. At the same time, it is believed that only in a stable environment can the citizens live and work in peace and contentment and restore the vitality that was wounded during the War of Resistance. The Shanghai Municipal Councilors are all directly elected by the citizens through voting. They not only come from the people but should also be the people who can most intimately understand the hardships of the people's livelihood. Their meeting should not be similar to the idle class's empty talk, nor can they simply blame the government and negatively criticize it as doing their best. We expect that the Municipal Council will be able to represent the citizens in expressing the pain in the hearts of the people to all parties in the government and the public, and in accordance with the wishes of the citizens, open up a way out for today's turbulent situation in Shanghai, lead this Shanghai, which is startled several times a night, onto the path of peace and stability, and then achieve the purpose of recovery and prosperity, and set a good example for all provinces and cities in the country.

It is heard that as of yesterday, the Municipal Council has received more than ninety proposals submitted by the councilors. The councilors' enthusiasm for making proposals for municipal administration and serving the citizens can be seen. However, if we are to make proposals at this time and in this place, there should be a distinction between priorities. As mentioned above, the people's hearts throughout the country today are all yearning for the realization of domestic peace and stability. The citizens of Shanghai are particularly eager for social stability. The councilors' proposals should determine a key point. Rather than talking loftily and putting forward many unrealistic problems, wasting precious time on meaningless debates, it is better to target reality, seek solutions, and point out the direction for the citizens of Shanghai and the government to work together. In the call for peace throughout the country, it is possible to effectively restore stability in Shanghai first, so that everyone can live and work in peace and contentment. Its significance is different from the ordinary, and its task is even more extraordinary. Here, we cannot but call again, "Stability First!"

The distress of the overall situation and the dangers of the environment, although they make every citizen feel troubled, the citizens' demands and wishes are indeed very simple, as long as they can live and work in peace and contentment. But how can we do it so that the people are not disappointed? In fact, there is no magic. It is only necessary for the government to like what the people like and hate what the people hate! What is most feared is that the government authorities are muddle-headed and perfunctory, without any sense of right and wrong, not distinguishing between black and white, only caring about the present and not planning for the future. The result of perfunctory compromise will inevitably lead to collapse and disintegration. Just take the citizens' desire for living in peace as an example. In the current environment, wars and flames of war are spreading throughout the country, and student movements and rice movements are rampant everywhere. Coupled with the soaring prices and the heavy burden of life, the conspiracy of the ambitious squeezes the people so much that they cannot even breathe. How can the citizens live in peace? Therefore, to enable the people to live in peace, the first step is to stabilize society. The National Government has promulgated "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" in the past, and the Mayor of Shanghai has also promulgated four implementation measures for maintaining law and order. Various public organizations in Shanghai have also sent telegrams to support them, advocating that they be implemented effectively. However, social stability relies entirely on the government to maintain it. In the end, it feels like it is reliable but not reliable. This time, the Municipal Council must represent the people to stand up and speak out for social stability. On the one hand, it will express the people's inner distress, and on the other hand, it will clearly declare the people's desire for stability, curb the conspiracies of all ambitious people, and at the same time, make the government not give them any gaps to take advantage of. If the councilors can take this opportunity to represent the will of the people and discuss a concrete method to stabilize society, so that the people can live in peace, it will be more valuable than passing dozens or hundreds of proposals.

As for working in peace and contentment, this is easier to achieve after society is stable. However, we must tell the councilors and the municipal authorities that today's Shanghai, although outwardly draped in a garment of prosperity, in reality, it has cast a dark shadow of economic depression and the people's misery. Especially in the remote suburbs or slums, it is simply possible to see that Shanghai actually contains two worlds. One is a "den of consumption" that is outwardly prosperous but actually excessively extravagant; the other is a dark hell where people do not have enough to eat, not enough to wear, no roof over their heads, not an inch of land under their feet, not knowing what will happen in the morning, and lives are like ants! Let's not talk about how to truly prosper Shanghai's industry and commerce, but at least in a passive aspect, the government should do its utmost to avoid all measures that may hinder or destroy the development of industry and commerce, so that every citizen can work in peace and contentment and freely develop their careers. Among the councilors, many are representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors. Whether for their own interests or for the interests of the industrial and commercial sectors they represent, they should speak as much as possible in the Municipal Council, list the various obstacles and constraints that industry and commerce are currently encountering, and demand that the municipal authorities remove them one by one.

In short, the issues discussed by this Municipal Council should focus on stabilizing society and relieving the hardships of the people's livelihood. Other non-urgent matters can be left to be discussed at length in the future. If this Municipal Council can make good decisions on stabilizing society, it will not only be the happiness of the citizens of Shanghai, but also its influence can be spread throughout the country. We sincerely pray that this Municipal Council can achieve something in this regard.

### US Emphasizes Middle East Oil Region, Determined to Prevent Soviet Influence From Penetrating, Connolly's Visit to Iran and Turkey Is of Great Importance

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Our Washington correspondent, Lun Jin, reports: The visit of Admiral Connolly, Commander of the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet, to Iran and Turkey indicates that President Truman's anti-communist doctrine is backed by military power. This trip by Connolly will obtain valuable information for the development of a new U.S. global strategic policy to protect the interests of the Middle East, which are of utmost importance to the United States. Official sources expect that military design experts will formulate a new U.S. military strategy based on the information obtained by Connolly, with Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East oil region regarded as the lifeline of the United States. This does not mean that Britain has withdrawn from these regions or that the United States has taken over the responsibility for the region. British and American officials in Washington continue to deny this statement, but the aforementioned U.S. policy does have the following implications: (1) The United States has accepted the gradually developing responsibility in Greece and Turkey, equivalent to a military alliance in European terms, and will never abandon this responsibility during the period when the Soviet Union is pursuing what is considered an expansionist policy in the region. (2) The United States will never allow the Middle East oil region to fall within the Soviet sphere of influence, as the U.S. fleet relies on the supply of Middle East oil in any wartime operations. (3) The U.S. State Department and the Army Department recognize the Dardanelles Strait as the key to any threat that the United States would not hesitate to resist with force. According to officials familiar with the strategy of the British and American command, the United States does not replace Britain's responsibility in the Middle East, as the United States itself also has significant responsibility in the area. Although the goals of the two countries sometimes coincide, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from engaging in expansionist threats in this most sensitive and troubled region in the world, the two major powers of Britain and the United States must maintain military cooperation to be prepared.

### Palestine Investigation Committee Holds First Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations Special General Assembly's Fact-Finding Committee on Palestine is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 26th. It will be opened by Lai, Secretary-General of the United Nations Agency. The agenda has three items: (1) election of the chairman; (2) discussion of the work plan; and (3) the route of the committee's trip to the Middle East in mid-June. Regarding this point, it will involve the question of whether the committee should visit refugee camps. Arab countries in the United Nations Special General Assembly expressed the hope that a distinction should be made between the Palestine issue and the refugee issue, while Zionism believes that the issue is closely related.

### Illegal Jewish Refugees Being Deported to Cyprus

### Smuts' Remarks

[Reuters, Cape Town, 24th] South African Prime Minister Smuts received a representative from the American "Time Magazine" on his 77th birthday today and gave a speech, believing that although relations between the powers are tense today, they will not lead to war. He expressed distrust of the "One World" theory created by Wallace of the United States. He believes that the world should be maintained by the strong power of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, because if only the United States and the Soviet Union are in frequent contact, then these two "nouveau riche" powers will inevitably have conflicts from time to time. He also believes that the end of World War II has left the world in an unstable peace. The withdrawal of European forces from Asia has further increased the instability of Asia. India seems to have reached the edge of long-term turmoil, and defeated Japan has been completely suppressed. But Asia is now in the hands of Asians, who are taking responsibility themselves.

### British-French Conference Resolves to Improve West African Transportation

[Agence France-Presse, Dakar, French West Africa, 24th] The British-French Transportation Conference closed here today.

### British-Polish Negotiations to Begin, Revising the Treaty of Mutual Assistance Through Diplomatic Channels

[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Sunday Times" stated that Britain and Poland will soon begin negotiations to revise the Treaty of Mutual Assistance between the two countries, signed on August 25, 1939, to suit the current situation. The original treaty stipulated that if one of the signatory countries was attacked by a European country, the other signatory country would provide assistance. The original treaty was valid for five years, and if one party did not explicitly abolish it within six months after five years, it would continue to be in effect. Recently, when British Foreign Secretary Bevan met with Polish Foreign Minister Sheeran at Warsaw, he suggested that negotiations on amendments be started through normal diplomatic channels to suit the current environment. However, it is still doubtful whether this negotiation can be held before the completion of the amendment negotiation of the British-Soviet alliance treaty.

### Indo-Dutch Negotiations: Dutch Side Denies Breakdown

[Reuter, Batavia, 24th] The Dutch side issued a public statement tonight denying that the return of the Dutch delegation indicated a breakdown in negotiations with Indonesia. The Dutch statement also stated that "the negotiations held today with the Indonesian side discussed the current situation and the procedures to be adopted in the near future to implement the Linggadjati Agreement. The Dutch delegation's return to the Netherlands is to report to the Dutch government on the suggestions and proposed amendments made by the Indonesian side to the Dutch proposals. They will return to the Dutch East Indies in three weeks, at which time the effectiveness of the Linggadjati Agreement will certainly become apparent." Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir also stated, "I am not pessimistic about the situation. We are now planning to handle the implementation of the entire Linggadjati Agreement. I fully believe that the situation will become clear after the Dutch cabinet receives the report from Prime Minister Beel's inspection of the Dutch East Indies and makes a decision." Beel and Dutch Overseas Colonial Minister Jonkman have already returned to the Netherlands from Indonesia.

### Albanian Ships Fire Five Shells at Greek Forces Off North Coast of Corfu; Albania Claims Greek Planes Violated Airspace

[Universal News, Athens, 25th] According to an announcement by the Greek Ministry of Public Order: Two Albanian warships and Greek coastal military fortresses exchanged fire on the 22nd off the north coast of Corfu. According to the Ministry of Public Order: The warships opened fire at 10:30 AM and retreated into Albanian territorial waters after a brief exchange of fire.

### Japanese Prime Minister Begins Cabinet Formation; Determined to Implement Established Policy; Visits Three Party Leaders to Request Cooperation

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting this afternoon, where Prime Minister Katayama explained his cabinet formation policy, emphasizing that the established policy of the party is to use every possible means to form a national unity government.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Prime Minister Katayama met with a group of reporters for the first time at 7:15 PM on the 24th and immediately issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: (1) Establish a democratic parliament; (2) Abandon bureaucratic feudal politics and build a peaceful and prosperous country; (3) Stabilize the lives of the people; (4) Implement spiritual revolution to establish a tranquil and harmonious government; (5) Cabinet formation will be based on the established policy of the four-party coalition cabinet and move forward vigorously. Katayama also broadcast to the entire nation at 9:00 PM on the same day, saying, "I was unanimously elected as Prime Minister by both houses of the Diet on the 23rd, and today the investiture ceremony has been held. This is due to the support and trust of the people. General MacArthur also gave me encouragement full of goodwill today, which is definitely not just for me alone, but is an encouragement to the Japanese nation and the entire people. Currently, our country is still facing an economic and national crisis that cannot be ignored. I bear the heavy responsibility of forming a cabinet, and I feel even more deeply that the responsibility of the largest party is great. I will make sincere efforts to overcome the crisis, and I hope that everyone will understand my enthusiasm and give me support."

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Social Democratic Party is working feverishly to form a coalition cabinet as soon as possible. Katayama Tetsu visited the leaders of various parties today, and met with Uehara Etsujiro, representing former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, and Ashida Hitoshi, leader of the Democratic Party. Uehara and Ashida agreed to clarify the positions of the two parties tomorrow. Katayama Tetsu also visited Miki Takeo, secretary-general of the National Cooperative Party, who assured that the National Cooperative Party would fully support the Social Democratic Party.

### Awaiting Yoshida to Express His Attitude

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Political observers here unanimously believe that since Katayama has obtained MacArthur's support and the investiture ceremony has been held, Katayama's cabinet will not fail. However, Yoshida's avoidance of meeting seems to indicate that he has not changed his determination to retreat to the opposition party. Although the Socialist Party is working hard to organize a four-party coalition cabinet, it is only a matter of personnel and will eventually fail. The previously planned 5-5-5-1 cabinet ratio may be changed to a 6-6-1 ratio, and the remaining three cabinet members will be selected from non-partisan members of the House of Representatives. In this way, not only can the problem of the Socialist Party's left wing joining the cabinet be solved, but also the internal factional problems of the Democratic Party can be expected to be eliminated. In short, everything still depends on Yoshida's formal expression of his final attitude after returning to Tokyo on the 26th before a decision can be made.

### British Empire to Discuss Two Policies Towards Japan

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] Informed sources here recently stated that the United Kingdom and its dominions may hold a meeting in Canberra, the capital of Australia, before the end of August to discuss a common policy on the peace treaty with Japan. The Australian government has requested Prime Minister Attlee to convene this meeting, but the Prime Minister will not announce his decision for the next few days.

### Mexico Considering Resuming Trade with Japan

[Associated Press, Mexico City, 24th] Official economists claimed today that although Mexico has announced that it is studying the resumption of trade with Japan, it will take a long time to reach pre-war figures, and at that time, trade with Japan was less than 2% of Mexico's total imports and exports. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a notification from the United Kingdom last week that it could resume direct communication with Japanese commercial firms, it had considered reopening the possibility of commercial relations between Mexico and Japan, but this kind of communication was limited to inquiring about and answering market conditions, and could not conclude transactions. In the ten years before the war, Mexico's exports to Japan were almost entirely cotton, zinc, and refined lead ingots. The figures varied greatly, at US$1.46 million in 1934, US$36.8 million in 1936, US$7 million in 1938, and dropping to US$1.86 million in 1939. Exports were mainly silk, rayon, and paper products, including large quantities of cheap goods such as fountain pens, ironware, light bulbs, gambling equipment, toys, and rubber products. The figures gradually increased, with only US$600,000 imported in 1934, US$1.4 million in 1936, US$1.7 million in 1938, and US$1.5 million in 1939. In 1940 and 1941, import and export figures more than doubled, but this increase was due to transshipment to European countries.

### Australian Rocket Experiments Kept Secret

[Reuter, Sydney, 24th] The Australian authorities have taken strict precautionary measures to prevent any leakage of information about the rocket experiments being conducted in the Emu Field area. The Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of Justice has recently hired 21 additional detectives, bringing the total number of investigators to 100, led by Colonel Lloyd, who has just returned from Japan, to be responsible for prevention. All scientists participating in the experiments will be given strict protection, and British scientists have been given special bodyguards to prevent suspicious people from contacting them.

### Wreckage of Missing Philippine Plane Found in Mountains

[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] President Roxas of the Philippines' special plane "Lilian Marlene", carrying several important Philippine officials, suddenly went missing. After a week, the mystery has apparently been solved tonight. According to Major Grassett, who is in charge of searching for the missing plane, five planes dispatched in search reported that they had found the wreckage of the recently missing plane on a peak about thirteen miles west of the summit of Mount Ragang in central Mindanao. The numbers of the President's special plane were clearly visible. The plane crashed into the mountain peak at an altitude of about 5,300 feet and was burned. One wing was broken and fell on a mountain peak 200 feet below. There were no signs of survivors nearby.

### U.S. Advisor to Korea Arrives in China; Syngman Rhee Denies Secret Agreement with U.S.

[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Panfield, Deputy Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department, arrived here at the end of last month to serve as an advisor to the Joint Commission. Yesterday, he suddenly flew to Nanjing, his mission unknown. State Department officials here said that Panfield will return here on Wednesday.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 24th] Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee recently issued a statement to the press, flatly denying that he had any secret agreement with the U.S. State Department.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 25th] Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee met with the press today and expressed his agreement that Korean political leaders should work with the US-Soviet Joint Commission to promote the establishment of a provisional government. He said: "I am not against the commission, nor am I against others discussing with the commission, but I am not eager to participate, because I do not understand the form of trusteeship and I believe that the US and the Soviet Union have conflicting definitions of democracy." Rhee expressed indifference to the resumption of negotiations by the commission. He said: "The commission's attempt to make Korea independent has failed once, and the Korean people have no reason to rely on the commission." U.S. military commander in South Korea, General Hodge, criticized Rhee's remarks, saying that Rhee seemed to be gradually understanding the situation.

### U.S. and Soviet Union Reach Agreement on News Reporting Methods

U.S. Representative to US-Soviet Commission Announces

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] U.S. representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Mr. Brown, announced today that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on the issue of publicly releasing information about the meetings of the Joint Commission, that is, although the progress of the meetings can be released, it will not be done in the form of official communiqués.

### Soviet Member of World Federation of Trade Unions Accuses U.S. Authorities in Korea

[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Soviet member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Tarasov, declared today that when members of the Executive Committee recently visited South Korea, the U.S. occupying forces made every effort to hinder their investigation. On one occasion, two Korean workers who wanted to welcome the Executive Committee were beaten. Afterwards, according to Brigadier General Brown of the U.S. Army, this was common in Korea and not surprising. In addition to myself, the members of the Executive Committee who visited Korea also included representatives from the United States, Britain, and France. The U.S. side suggested adding military translators and two U.S. military officers, but the Executive Committee refused for obvious reasons. This trip left a painful impression. There were no Korean trade union members at the airport except for U.S. military officers. On the way into the city, a team of Koreans, numbering 30, were met, waving flags in welcome. But the driver accelerated, and the team chased after them in the dust. Although the French member intended to stop the car, he was stopped by a U.S. military officer sitting next to him. According to Korean sources, it was not easy for them to learn from the U.S. side the time of the Executive Committee's arrival. All industries in South Korea are in the hands of the Americans, and they are operating in cooperation with the Japanese.

### Japanese Imagination of a Peace Treaty: Plan to Prevent Transfer of Important Islands to Other Countries; Not Allowing Allied Governments to Interfere in Japanese Internal Affairs

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has completed a 194-page report discussing "Basic Issues of Japanese Economic Recovery," "Classification of Reparations Issues," "Living Standards and the Japanese Economy," and even "Hypothetical Peace Treaty," which represents Japan's hopes and goals for the peace conference. The Central News Agency reporter has exclusively learned that the Japanese government's hypothetical peace treaty, which is only for the reference of Japanese officials, is mostly modeled on the peace treaty with Italy.

It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocates that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan should join the United Nations as soon as possible. Japan is willing to return the leased territories in Northeast China and Kwantung to China, and return South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union, but it is still prepared to contend for the smaller islands closer to mainland Japan. They will try to prevent the transfer of sovereignty over certain islands, such as the Ryukyu Islands and certain Japanese mandated territories, to other countries. If Japan is allowed to join the United Nations, they would like to place these islands under UN trusteeship, with Japan as the trustee.

They believe that the Allied countries will withdraw their troops except for retaining some smaller constabulary units. They believe that there is a great difference between the current "occupation forces" and the "garrison forces" after the signing of the peace treaty, as the latter will support non-military supervisory agencies to monitor Japan's implementation of the peace treaty. They expect this supervisory agency to be located in important areas, with branches stationed in Hokkaido and Kyushu. They expect that the nationwide occupation, with current Allied personnel stationed throughout Japan, will not continue.

If an international court sentences Japanese war criminals to death, Japan hopes that the Allied countries will entrust it with the final execution of these individuals. For the thousands of war criminals with lesser charges, the country also hopes to try them if the terms of the peace treaty allow.

The ideal peace treaty with Japan, as considered by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is one where Japan's sovereignty is unrestricted, Allied countries are not allowed to interfere in Japanese internal affairs, and economic restrictions will be specifically stipulated in the peace treaty documents. Wartime industries will of course not be allowed to exist, and industries and enterprises that can be converted to military use will also be restricted. It is assumed that the peace treaty with Japan will also stipulate figures for other sectors of the Japanese economy. However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that Japan's various economic needs require an annual steel production of 10 million tons, a textile industry with 5 million spindles, and an export industry worth 3.4 billion yen based on 1941 prices in order to survive.

The extent to which the terms of the US draft peace treaty with Japan are close to the draft hypothetical peace treaty self-determined by Japan is the most concerning issue for the eleven countries harmed by the Japanese militarists. And they all want to obtain guarantees that various conditions and environments that can enable Japan to restore its imperial ideology will not develop.

### French Premier Issues Order Requisitioning Coal and Electricity Industries; Government and Unions Face Test

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] French Prime Minister Ramadier signed an order today authorizing the government to requisition the employees and equipment of the national gas and electricity companies. This measure, decided by the Cabinet today, will be published in tomorrow's "Official Gazette." The French gas and electricity workers, because the government authorities refused to approve a 25% wage increase, decided to strike for 24 hours on the 28th of this month, stopping the supply of gas and reducing the national electricity supply to a minimum. For this reason, the French Cabinet held a meeting today and decided to take the above measures to cope with the situation. In addition, it is reported that strikes and demonstrations have occurred repeatedly in various provinces today, but they are not large-scale. Two or three hundred thousand railway workers in Lyon marched in procession today, to the city government to demand improved food supply. Four hundred construction workers in Versailles were dismissed by the capitalists for carrying out a "slowdown" in order to demand higher wages. Workers at the Normandy Bus Company also went on strike to demand better treatment.

[Reuter, Paris, 25th] The French gas and electricity workers' work slowdown and the government's announcement of the takeover of the national gas and electricity plants and their workers is the biggest test of strength between the government authorities and the unions since the liberation of France. The notice of the takeover of the gas and electricity workers will be posted in public places throughout the country today. The plan on how to deal with possible riots and ensure the supply of gas and electricity was decided last night by the Cabinet in consultation with the General Staff and French industrial leaders. Although the authorities denied that the French Army had been ordered to remain in camp and not go out to deal with the labor unrest, it is generally believed that similar precautionary measures have indeed been taken. The gas and electricity labor unrest seems to be an isolated labor unrest caused by the failure to demand a 23% wage increase, but observers believe that this labor unrest is a prelude to a comprehensive labor unrest that will suffocate the French economy.

Determined to Prevent Labor Unrest

The gas and electricity union has stipulated Wednesday as the first day of complete work stoppage, which is also the last day for a satisfactory answer to the demand for improved working conditions nationwide, and also the day for the national Federation of Trade Unions to decide whether to accept the government's decision on Thursday not to consider a general wage increase before December 1. The government today is clearly facing the threat of a general strike. The fundamental problem is not in adjusting the labor unrest to the demands of a unit, but in the power of the government. Under the union's open challenge, whether it can maintain the government's position is still unusually firm so far. Minister of Industrial Production Lacoste said last night, "In the next few days, the country will see the government's determination to govern the country." The French government has previously stated unequivocally that in order to save the collapse of the French franc and make the price of French goods able to compete with international commodities, no wage increases will be allowed before December this year. The Cabinet believes that workers who do not accept this policy are openly rebelling against the government authorities. Labor unrest has been brewing in all major industries across the country in the past few months, and after the Communist Party withdrew from the coalition cabinet three weeks ago, the labor unrest reached a boiling point.

Unpredictable Consequences of Accepting the Challenge

This gas and electricity labor unrest is a test of strength between the union and the government. Now that the government has accepted the workers' challenge, if the result cannot grasp the situation, it will have a significant impact on the French political situation. In the case of this gas and electricity labor unrest alone, Prime Minister Ramadier has the support of the cabinet members of the Social Radical and Popular Republican parties, but on a broader level, Ramadier is not only facing the opposition of the Communist Party, but also facing the opposition of a part of the Socialist Party, because there are still differences of opinion within the Socialist Party on the attitude to be taken towards the union. In addition to political struggles, the general public, who do not care about politics, is also dissatisfied with the government due to the difficulties of daily life. For example, the lack of bread and meat, the increase in living expenses, and the constraints of the bureaucratic system on the people are all enough to drive the people into an environment of universal disappointment and naturally tend to seek another "savior."

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Scheduled to Visit Germany

[Reuter, Essen, Germany, 24th] Officials of the North German Coal Control Board announced tonight that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will come to the British zone of Germany next month for a fact-finding inspection. Bevin also plans to address a German public assembly in the Ruhr area. British Minister for German Occupied Territories Lord Pakenham met today with German miners' leaders, coal mine managers, and British coal officials at the North German Coal Control Board. Lord Pakenham said at the meeting that the whole world is watching the increase in coal production in the Ruhr, which is most helpful to Germany's recovery of its reputation in the world. Coal production in the Ruhr has now dropped sharply to 200,000 tons per day.

### U.S. Recruiting Workers to Build Airport in Northern Region

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 25th] U.S. World Airways plans to use commercial airplanes this year to transport 2,500 construction workers from Seattle to Fairbanks, Alaska. These workers, contracted by several Seattle companies with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are recruited from all over the United States and plan to engage in large-scale airport facility construction near Fairbanks.

### Soviet Union Exploiting Uranium Mines in Germany

[Associated Press, Prague, 24th] According to news from the Aue district of German territory occupied by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is stepping up mining in the northern corner of the famous Joachimsthal mining area. The intensified mining of uranium ore sand, which is atomic material, almost means that new discoveries have been made. Czech scientist Madam Curie first discovered uranium ore sand there and refined radium ingots. According to reports, the mine is exclusively mined by Soviet miners, and the exact location and excavation situation of the mine are kept strictly secret. The Joachimsthal mine in Czech territory was mined by Germany during the war and was taken over by the Czech government after liberation. In 1937, the production volume was 158,000 tons of raw ore sand. At present, due to insufficient equipment, the production volume has decreased. The Czech government said that the ore sand produced is exclusively for the manufacture of uranium and medical ingots, and the Czech side is not conducting atomic energy research.

### U.S. Discovers Large Uranium Deposits

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The Senate said: The United States has discovered very large uranium deposits, necessary for the manufacture of atomic bombs, in the Colorado River Basin. The Atomic Energy Commission also said that after this discovery, the United States may no longer need to rely on external supplies.

### Imminent British Labour Party Congress: Internal Conflicts Intensify, Sides Launch Ideological War

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The British Labour Party is about to hold a congress in Margate, and because it will intensify the conflict between supporters and opponents of the Labour government's general foreign policy, the attention of political figures is focused on this conference. Observers say that the two sides have already launched a kind of ideological war in the past few weeks. "Rebel" Labour MP leader Crossman has distributed a pamphlet entitled "Keep Left," while the other side has issued a pamphlet entitled "Cards on the Table." The latter pamphlet, without the approval of the Labour Party Executive Committee and as a formal statement, is likely to cause fierce debate. In addition, the terms of office of some members of the Labour Party Executive Committee have expired and need to be re-elected. This point is also worth noting. Lord President of the Council Morrison, Minister of Fuel and Power Shinwell, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Crossman are all on the list of candidates. According to other sources, a cabinet reshuffle may be imminent, and Prime Minister Attlee will provide accurate information to Parliament on this matter.

### British Lord President of the Council Asks Labour Party to Respect Itself

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Lord President of the Council Morrison warned the Labour Party today to guard against excessive selfishness. He stated briefly that excessive self-interest is detrimental to us. The Conservative Party's recently published Industrial Charter has made a great contribution to British socialism. It can be seen that the various principles of socialism have gradually been accepted by public opinion.

### Opening of the Municipal Council Congress; Speaker Submits Four Proposals; Requesting the Return of Dalian and Macau; Citizens Write to the Council Opposing Rent Increases

[Report from this Newspaper] The third general meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council will be held this morning. The opening ceremony will be held from 9:00 to 10:00, and the preparatory meeting will be held from 10:00 to 12:00, and lots will be drawn to determine the seats of the councilors. Responsible persons from various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, as well as local party, government, and military leaders, will be invited to attend.

The secretariat of the council continued to receive five proposals yesterday, but because the council had already completed the sorting of proposals the day before yesterday, the proposals received yesterday will be treated as temporary motions and submitted to the general meeting for discussion. Among the proposals received yesterday, three councilors, Chen Peide, Zhang Zhihan, and Zhao Junhao, suggested seven measures for the municipal government to deal with rising rice prices, the general idea of which is: (1) Establish a number of public rice stores in each district according to the proportion of the population to avoid crowds of rice buyers in one place, making it difficult to purchase rice. (2) Various groups and organizations jointly purchase rice collectively. (3) Please encourage rice merchants to order from overseas. (4) Encourage farmers to grow grains and rice. (5) Before the establishment of public rice stores, the chairman of the district people's congress, Huang Cheng, and the district office will handle the rationing according to the population ratio. (6) Rice weevils seek private gain and disrupt society, and should be severely punished. (7) The Xiao Kuaile case should be requested by this council to the judicial authorities for a fair and thorough investigation.

In addition, three councilors, Zhang Zhihan, Feng Youzhen, and Zhao Junmeng, requested a reiteration of the resolution of the second general meeting of the first session of this council to extend the lease rights of residents allocated to public housing for religious personnel. Councilor Zhuang Ping requested the municipal government to ban vendors from extracting a 30% commission on one yuan bets.

The proposals submitted by the municipal government had not yet reached the council as of last night. There are currently only four proposals submitted by the speaker, but it is understood that the speaker still has many proposals from this inspection of various districts, which will be sent to the general meeting for discussion once they are sorted out. The currently submitted proposals from the speaker are recorded below: (1) To approve the case of the resolution No. 9 of the council's proposal regarding the handling of academic advancement funds, and request a review and reply. Reason: According to the Shanghai Municipal Government's Shanghai Hui Yi (36) Zi No. 12303 official letter, the second general meeting of this council sent the resolution No. 9 of the council's proposal, requesting that the 7.2 billion yuan for academic advancement fees for teachers and social education personnel in municipal primary and secondary schools be included in the 20% education expenditure item in the city's total annual budget, and that those who have already collected from students should be refunded. The Education Bureau immediately transferred the order and reported: "It has been found that the academic advancement fees for teachers and staff in municipal schools and social education institutions at all levels were originally budgeted at 7.2 billion yuan. Later, when the budget for this year was recompiled, the total amount of the bureau's expenditure budget was only 45.8 billion yuan. The allocation of operating expenses and the most needed temporary expenses to the affiliated institutions is already insufficient. If the 7.2 billion yuan for advancement fees is included again, the original business will not be able to be maintained. After repeated consideration, the schools in rural areas that have not yet collected advancement fees were first budgeted at 1.8 billion yuan, and the remaining 5.4 billion yuan that has not been included has been separately budgeted and submitted for special allocation. As for the schools that have already collected advancement fees from students, they have repeatedly reported that they have already been distributed to teachers and staff and must wait for your government's approval. After the additional budget is issued by the bureau, it can be refunded." In addition to including the 1.8 billion yuan for advancement fees in the general budget, a letter was sent to request review and reply, etc., requesting a public decision. (2) To approve the Zhejiang Provincial Council's Zhejiang Er Yi Lin Zi No. 1909 substitute telegram, requesting the central government to use rapid and effective methods to recover Dalian from the Soviet Union, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion. (3) To approve the Tianjin Provisional Council's telegram requesting the government to earnestly negotiate with Portugal to recover Macau, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion. (4) To approve the telegram requesting a re-determination of the National Assembly representatives for municipalities directly under the central government, changing to one person per district, and allocating one woman among the ten, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Municipal Council received a joint letter from citizens Fan Dan, Fang Dong, Qi _, and Jia Zhu yesterday, opposing the city's real estate association, using the excuse that the current standard for housing rent is set too low and demanding a new adjustment. They expressed their indignation at the association's recent tea party to entertain councilors, hoping to use the power of the general meeting to achieve their profiteering conspiracy and monopolize public opinion. They requested that the council pay attention to the fact that the majority of Shanghai citizens live in rented houses, and that all measures should be based on the opinions of the majority of citizens, and should never conform to the greed of a small number of capitalists. They also hoped that the council would launch a city-wide mutual aid association for third-party tenants to connect with each other and prevent large landlords or sub-landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent.

### Last Day of Speaker's Inspection; Rice Rationing Techniques Urgently Need to be Agreed Upon; Hope to Allocate Vacant Land to Build More Schools

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of Municipal Council Speaker Pan's visit to various districts. Those accompanying him were still Secretary-General Xiang, and representatives from the Public Works and Health Bureaus. In the morning, they went to the Lao Zha and Huangpu districts, and in the afternoon, they went to the Xincheng and Jing'an districts. Councilors, district chiefs, and chairmen of district representative conferences were all concentrated in the district offices to greet them, and provided many opinions on the current situation of municipal administration and society. Excerpts are as follows:

(1) Food rice is the most important and urgent issue in Shanghai at present. The government's monthly allocation of affordable rice is only enough for one-third of the needs of citizens, so the target of affordable rice can only be limited to the extremely poor. However, the technical issue of how to investigate and how to ration the extremely poor, it is hoped that the Social Bureau will convene all district chiefs in the shortest possible time to jointly study a whole set of methods and procedures, with the principle of average, simple, and fast.

District Bao Institutions - Insufficient Funds

(2) District Bao institutions are the grassroots organizations of the country, and the government and the people should attach great importance to them. At present, the Shanghai District Bao offices do not have fixed houses. District offices mostly rent private houses and temples, or borrow one or two rooms in police stations. The Bao office only sets up a desk in the private house of the Bao chief, and the monthly office expenses are not enough to pay for water and electricity, let alone implement administrative district orders. It is hoped that the government and the people can cooperate earnestly to correct this kind of upside-down pagoda formation. (3) People are very interested in dedicating schools to celebrate birthdays. Each district has raised considerable funds. Lao Zha district has decided to raise 2 billion yuan to build school buildings. It is hoped that the municipal government can allocate vacant land to build school buildings.

Lane Roads - Hope for Repairs

(4) The roads in the city's lanes are severely damaged. It is hoped that the government can cooperate with the people to repair them, and that the practice of urinating and defecating everywhere, dumping garbage, and building flat houses along the lanes to block the streets can be effectively banned. (5) Chengdu North Road, Shanhai Pass Road, and Xinchang Road are all severely damaged and need to be repaired. (6) The Zhangjiabang in Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road is a stinky water pond, which is extremely harmful to the health of citizens. It is hoped that the government can cooperate with the people to fill it. (7) There is no municipal hospital in Jing'an Temple District. It is hoped that there will be a health clinic.

### Newly Manufactured Tricycles - Please Issue Licenses from the Municipal Government

Unemployed Rickshaw Pullers Petition the Council

Since the municipal government restricted the operation of tricycles, more than 1,320 newly manufactured vehicles by various car dealers in the city have been abandoned for a long time. The Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers who are waiting for the licenses for these vehicles to make a living also hope that the vehicles can be licensed for rent, so they organized a petition group and sent representatives to petition the council yesterday, requesting the continued issuance of business licenses. The following three reasons were presented: (1) The municipal government does not consider continuing to issue tricycle licenses due to traffic congestion in the central district, but it should be considered whether other areas besides the central district are also congested, and whether there is still a great need for transportation. (2) It is unreasonable to refuse to adopt compromise measures to relieve unemployed poor people simply because of traffic congestion in one corner of the central district. (3) Please find a way out of no way, and issue licenses that do not allow driving in the central district, that is, the area "east to the Bund, south to Jinling Road, west to Tibet Road, and north to Suzhou Creek" may be designated as a prohibited area.

### Large Batch of Traitor Assets Awaiting Sale

A large batch of medicines, foreign wines, soaps, cigarettes, medical cotton, gauze, and other materials seized and kept in custody by the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office will be publicly auctioned. The details of the materials are as follows: More than 1,340 pieces of Pan Ni's rubber plasters, morphine injections, surgical instruments, alcohol, gauze, cotton, etc., from the three provinces and two fluorescent lamps. Eight bundles of Liang Ni Hongzhi's Lian Shi paper. Two boxes of Yu Ni Aizhen's foreign wine. Twelve _ of Lu Ni Yingshang's wine. 150 boxes of Qian Ni Da_'s medicines, five boxes of Xiangmao soap, two boxes of whiskey, and one box of Xiaopaotai cigarettes. Thirteen boxes of Chen Ni Xingcun's soap, more than 1,400 injections of glucose, and 16 bottles of _'s Neng. Three boxes of Zheng Ni Liangbin's glass bricks and 53 coils of large and small purple steel wire. More than 700 pieces of Zhu Ni Dunlin's _ shirts and military blankets. And 50 boxes of Yu Ni Shao_'s cigars. It is said that some of this batch of treasures are currently unavailable in various markets.

### No Price Increase Decided for Passenger and Freight Transport on Two Railways

Ministry of Communications Monthly Subsidy of 5.4 Billion

The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration previously requested the Ministry of Communications to forward a request to the Executive Yuan to adjust fares because revenue and expenditure could not be balanced and business could not be promoted. Recently, due to the _ meeting's _ passing of public utilities, it was decided to adopt a subsidy policy, so it has been instructed that passenger and freight fares should be maintained at the original price and not increased. It is now learned that, in order to balance revenue and expenditure on the two railways and promote business, the Ministry of Communications has recently decided to subsidize the two railways by 5.4 billion yuan per month, which will be officially implemented from this month.

### Two Railway Bureaus Begin Replacing Railway Tracks on the Nanxiang-Kunshan Section

The repeated derailments of trains on the two railways were mainly caused by sleepers and _ _. In order to ensure the safety of train operation, the bureau specially requested the Ministry of Communications to issue 30 kilometers of 90-pound _ tracks. The upper _ arrived happily. In addition to reserving 8 kilometers for replacing the main crossovers of the stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, the remaining 22 kilometers began to be selectively replaced with old tracks in the Nanxiang-Kunshan area yesterday. It is expected that all of them will be replaced by the end of June. It is learned that the bureau has ordered a large batch of new steel rails from the United States, which will be shipped soon, and all the steel rails on the entire line of the two railways can be completely replaced.

### Jin Chao Case Continues to be Heard Today

Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren _ Will Be Summoned to Court

The District Court is scheduled to continue hearing the Jin Chao case at 2:00 p.m. today. The defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, who have been released on bail, will be summoned to court at that time. The courtroom, which has been silent for a long time, will be full of spectators again today.

### Chen Bozhuang Invites Transporters to Discuss the Issue of Freight Business Offices on the Two Railways

The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration previously discussed the issue of freight business offices with representatives of transportation industry associations in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Because the Railway Administration was unable to fully accept the four principles it proposed, there was no result. It is learned that yesterday, Chen Bozhuang, director of the two railway bureaus, sent staff to invite Li Mulian, chairman of the Shanghai Transportation Industry Association, to the bureau for discussion, earnestly expressing his willingness to resolve this issue with a frank attitude, and submitted written opinions, stipulating two new methods. However, the Shanghai transporters believe that this matter must be discussed with their counterparts in Nanjing and Hangzhou before they can reply.

### Inter-Student Fight Occurs at Jiaotong University

According to information from the Xujiahui Police Station yesterday, Jiaotong University students held a meeting at 9:00 p.m. last night. Due to a conflict of opinions between students who opposed the strike and students who insisted on the strike, an inter-student fight occurred. Some people on both sides were injured. Among them, Qin Mingsao, Hua Zemin, and Zhang Hanwei were more seriously injured. The students notified the Xujiahui Police Station by telegram. At that time, a patrolling policeman passed by and heard fighting and arguing in the school, so he entered to maintain order and sent the injured students to the hospital for treatment.

### Theatre Ceiling Collapses, Injuring Many Guests; Radio Broadcasts of Strange Advertisements and "Wonderful Articles" Become Prophecies

[Report from this Newspaper] The Guotai Yue Opera Theatre at 451 Tibet Road staged the new play "It's My Fault" starring Bi Dangui and Xu Yulan last night. The audience was quite crowded, and it was full before the show even started. Unexpectedly, at 10:35 p.m., when the play was about to end in the third act, the ceiling on the west side collapsed due to continuous heavy rain, poor construction, and the unbearable vibration of electric fans. Fortunately, before the collapse, there was a huge sound, followed by the scattering of ash and sand, so the audience on the west side was able to dodge in time, avoiding a major disaster. Only 17 men and women were injured, which was a great fortune in misfortune. After the incident, the Baike Road Military Police and the Xincheng Police Station sent a large number of personnel to the scene to suppress the situation and quickly sent the injured to the China-US, Hongren, and Renji hospitals. The injured included Wang Suqin, 32 years old, Qian Meimei, 9 years old, Ding Lu's, 32 years old, Ding Li's, 32 years old, Xu Wang's, 32 years old, Jin Boliang, 17 years old, Xu Didi, 1 year old, Fang Xia Cuiyuan, 30 years old, Zhang Cai's, 42 years old, Gao Guoping, 3 years old, Fang Chengde, 41 years old, Chen Wu's, 36 years old, Lu Ying, 19 years old, Shen Xiang's, 51 years old, Shen Xinlian, 15 years old, Hua Wenying, 24 years old, and Fang Zhang's, 36 years old, etc. All were discharged from the hospital that night after being bandaged by the various hospitals. At the moment of the collapse, the audience was extremely chaotic due to the rush to escape. Most of the female guests forgot their coats and bags, and some of them lost valuable ornaments and cash, so there were still many female guests standing outside the theatre late at night, negotiating compensation with the theatre. During the chaos, some unscrupulous people rushed into the field to "loot while the fire was burning," and two people were arrested by the police. However, most of the recovered coats and bags are now stored in the theatre's accounting room and will be handed over to the police station for handling. In addition, the advertisement published by the theatre in various newspapers yesterday had the words "Crowded audience, few seats, poor facilities, it's my fault," which unexpectedly became a prophecy. At the same time, in order to make the play "It's My Fault" appeal to the audience, the evening show was rebroadcast to the city by Tiefeng Electric, so the earliest to receive the news when the incident occurred were the radio listeners.

### Increasing Production to Save the Crisis; The Re-establishment of the National Products Manufacturers Association; Passing the Constitution and Electing Directors and Supervisors

[Report from this Newspaper] The re-establishment general meeting of the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association was held at the Jingu Hotel at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 units of manufacturer representatives attended. After the formalities, the chairman of the presidium, Wang Xiaolai, said in his speech that the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association was established in 1930, with the purpose of promoting national products and consolidating the national foundation. In recent years, the association's affairs have made considerable progress. During the Anti-Japanese War, manufacturers held the heart of saving the country with national products, assisted the Anti-Japanese War, and made a lot of contributions.

From the victory to today, under the severe economic crisis situation, oppressed by high prices, high interest rates, high donations and taxes, and high wages, all manufacturers are in danger. To save ourselves and the country, we must promote national products and increase production to save the crisis. The future tasks of the association are to handle the production and sales cooperation of national products, investigate and count statistics, handle the export of products and the import of necessary raw materials, and establish a national product joint service center, etc. We will strive tirelessly according to the needs of the national economy to assist the industrialization of the country. Subsequently, Ge Futian reported on the preparations, and representatives from the Social Bureau, Zou Jinkui, Zhou Lianze, representative from the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Guanqing, representative from Mayor Wu, delivered speeches successively. Then, the constitution was passed, and Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Ge Futian, Pan Shihao, Jin Runxiang and other 25 people were elected as directors, and Hu Xiyuan and other 5 people were elected as alternate directors. Xu Xiaochu, Rong Hongyuan and other 7 people were elected as supervisors. Shi Zhifu and other three people were elected as alternate supervisors. Finally, the photo session was completed, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 p.m.

### Labor-Capital Disputes at Two Rubber Factories

The wages of workers in the Xinsheng Rubber Factory on Fanhuangdu Road have never been stipulated with a base salary. The workers requested to improve this, and there was no result in the discussion with the factory. In addition, the Zhaoning Road Dafu Rubber Factory owed the workers a differential of March and April, and wages for March, April, and May. After both parties negotiated on their own, the wages have now been paid, but the differential and the wages for the first period of May have not been paid. At present, the workers of the two factories are requesting the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to mediate through the Rubber Industry Union of the Third District.

### Reasons for the Suspension of Three Newspapers; The Iron Newspaper's Report is Inaccurate

According to the Iron Newspaper of this city yesterday, the suspension of Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers "was approved by Chairman Chiang for execution." The spokesperson of the Preparatory Headquarters yesterday issued a solemn statement stating: "The headquarters' order to suspend Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers this time was because the newspapers successively published news that harmed military affairs, and remarks and news that attempted to subvert the government and disrupt public order. This city is a martial law area, and in order to leave _ social order and protect the lives and property of the people, we had to suspend their publication. The Iron Newspaper's _ that it was approved by Chairman Gao for execution, etc., is completely inaccurate. In addition to giving the newspaper an appropriate punishment, we hereby solemnly declare to correct the hearing."

### 市工務局長播講 上海的修路難 主要在錢其次努力最後還得市民愛護

[This Newspaper Report] This newspaper, yesterday at the Gospel Radio Station (broadcast by the United Broadcasting Station on its behalf), held the eighth special weekly broadcast, inviting the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, to broadcast on "The Difficulty of Road Repair in Shanghai." Here is a record of his speech: Those who go out on the road often quote the phrase "The road to Shu is as difficult as ascending to the blue sky." In my opinion, the difficulty of road repair in Shanghai is truly worthy of being described as "more difficult than ascending to the blue sky." This difficulty is multifaceted and not simple. It is like an illness that requires internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and all other departments. It is a combination of all diseases and cannot be cured with a simple prescription or relying solely on "bloody courage."

Shanghai has a total of five or six hundred "roads," with a total length of nine hundred kilometers, which is equivalent to going from Shanghai to Nanjing, from Nanjing to Hangzhou, and then back to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The total length of this triangle, in terms of area, is that Shanghai's roads have a total of seven and a half million square meters, which is more than 11,000 municipal acres. These roads were not planned in one period, nor were they designed with the same goal.

New Needs, Various Difficulties

Now we feel that the road system is not rational enough, the road width is not wide enough, and the road structure is not strong enough. The congestion of the central district's roads and the unevenness of many secondary roads are the consequences of the sudden increase in traffic volume and the sudden increase in load. To enhance the road's ability to absorb traffic, we must improve the road system, add new routes, and widen roads to meet the needs of traffic volume. However, every time we plan to widen a road, there are more than a dozen agencies to consult and report to, and the general owners and residents can also express many different opinions because of their own interests. As for strengthening the road structure and renovating it, it is not a simple matter. One can imagine how much money it will take to renovate. So I say that meeting new needs has various difficulties.

Soaring Prices of Road Construction Materials

First, let's talk about the difficulties of labor and materials. The Public Works Bureau regularly employs more than 5,000 long-term workers, but less than 2,000 of them can actually go on the road to repair roads. Because of the meager salary, the efficiency of these workers will not be very high. We can only seek some remedies in terms of material and spirit to overcome this difficulty. In terms of materials, the prices of asphalt, tar, cement, gravel, and yellow sand have soared to an alarming extent. The most difficult thing to deal with is the speed of the increase, which makes our budget unable to keep up. With such fluctuating prices, contractors are discouraged and dare not undertake projects. There is often a risk of material shortages. Without materials, how can road repair work proceed? Our solution to the material difficulty is to try our best to ensure the long-term stability of material supply, so that both the merchants supplying materials and our Public Works Bureau can reduce unexpected losses. Our efforts in this area have made considerable progress. Road construction is technical and requires specialized equipment and tools. When we took over after the victory, there were 52 road rollers, but they were all old and broken. There were three asphalt plants, but only one was barely usable. Now two large plants have been repaired, and several stone crushers have also been repaired before they can be used. However, when it is not easy to settle foreign exchange, we should increase the number of road construction machines, but we have been unable to do so.

Priority in Repairing

In addition, there is a difficulty in terms of social awareness. Our order of priority in repairing roads is to first repair the roads on the streetcar and bus routes in the city, while also paying attention to the arterial roads in the suburbs that connect to important towns in all four directions from the central district. Some people think that it is unequal that we only repair roads for cars, which is a misunderstanding. Some people are dissatisfied when they see that the roads they often pass have not been repaired. There are too many roads in Shanghai, and they are in too bad a condition. Even if we are given sufficient money, we still need sufficient time to repair them.

There is an even greater difficulty, which is that a small number of citizens do not cherish the roads. For example, littering fruit peels and nutshells on the road, and even sugarcane residue, is harmful to the maintenance of the road. Also, pouring water from washing clothes and emptying chamber pots on the road, as well as the water from vegetable stalls and faucets, universally soaks the road surface, which can increase the speed of road damage. Moreover, the siltation of ditches causes water to accumulate on the road on rainy days, which is also a reason for road damage. This kind of acquired difficulty is also something that our Public Works Bureau cannot overcome. It requires the understanding and cooperation of the citizens.

In short, to solve the difficulty of road repair in Shanghai, first, we need money, second, we need our efforts, and third, we need the understanding and love of the citizens."

### Liang Hongzhi Hidden Valuable Books Seized Tens of Thousands of Volumes Confiscated and Reported to the Executive Yuan

When the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office recently conducted a general investigation of Liang Hongzhi's property, it received a tip that the traitor was still hiding a large number of antiques, stationery, and books. It sent personnel to investigate the address and found tens of thousands of volumes of valuable books, which were of great value.

### Newly Established Stores Allowed to Open First with Receipt Certificate for License Application

The Finance Bureau previously stipulated that anyone engaged in business should apply to the business license tax collection agency for investigation, registration, determination of the tax amount, collection of taxes, and issuance of a business license before the business starts, and then be allowed to open. Therefore, newly established stores, even after applying for a license, could not open before receiving the license, and the capital was held up for a long time, resulting in significant losses. It is now learned that: in order to facilitate merchants, the Finance Bureau has specially stipulated that those who apply for a business license for a newly established store may be given a receipt certificate by the tax collection agency after the application has been submitted, allowing them to open first, and then issue the license after the tax is assessed and paid. However, the validity period of the certificate is limited to one month.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

(1) Debt Dispute

Zhou Tianjian asks: A lends his savings over the years to his friend B to lend out, with a monthly interest of one dime (i.e. 10%). B then lends it to C at a high interest rate, and C issues a loan agreement, but the interest rate is not stated on the agreement, and D stamps it as a guarantor. Now C is suffering heavy losses in business. B has repeatedly urged him to repay the loan, but to no avail. He asks (1) Can he demand payment from the guarantor? (2) If D ignores him, can he use the goods in his store as compensation? (3) If D is unwilling, what procedures should he follow to obtain payment?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) D is in the position of a guarantor and should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the debt. If the principal debtor C cannot repay the debt, he can request D to repay it on his behalf. (2) Buying items from D is another matter. If he uses the loan agreement he guaranteed as compensation, it cannot be done legally unless D himself agrees. (3) B should request C to pay off the loan. If C cannot repay the loan, D should repay it on his behalf.

(2) Absolute Sale and Redemption

He Kezhen asks: In 1944, I bought a house with a plot of land from A through a friend's introduction. At that time, A (selling his ancestral property absolutely) had a written agreement. The broker B and his clansmen signed and sealed the agreement on the spot. In 1945, A passed away. The following year, A's wife sent a letter stating that part of the property sold by her husband belonged to her personal property and she now intends to redeem it, and sent a photo of the property division contract, which was signed and sealed by the broker B and his clansmen A, etc. Please ask (1) Is this kind of sale illegal under the law? (2) Is the flower signature signed by A himself for the absolute sale of his ancestral property still valid? (because A has passed away) (3) Since the broker B and A's clansmen testified on the contract of division between A and his wife, why did they testify again when A sold the property? From a legal point of view, is the behavior of B and his clansmen legal?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If the house and land belong to A personally, the sale is of course legal. (2) The signature of A on the absolute sale contract is of course valid under the law. (3) The broker and A's clansmen have signed and sealed the absolute sale contract, and they should bear the responsibility of proving it under the law.

### Provincial Science Investigation Team Left for Orchid Island Yesterday A Group of More Than Sixty People Carried More Than Sixty Tons of Instruments

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The "Science Investigation Team" organized by the National Taiwan University and the Provincial Marine Research Institute, Tuberculosis Research Institute, Geological Survey, Meteorological Bureau, Museum and other academic institutions, a group of more than sixty people, led by Dr. Ma Tingying, Director of the Marine Research Institute and Director of the Department of Geology of National Taiwan University, and Professor Chen Lijie, Director of the affiliated hospital of National Taiwan University, carrying a total of more than sixty tons of instruments, left Taipei for Keelung this morning, taking a special ship via Taitung Fire Island to Orchid Island (formerly known as Red Head Island), which is rich in raw materials for lung medicine but has no patients with lung disease, to conduct surveys of marine meteorology, animals and plants, anthropology, and medicine. The island is shaped like a pill, located in the southeast of He Wan Island, and its south is the Philippine Islands, about fifty nautical miles from Taitung. The island has an area of only forty-eight square kilometers, all of which are mountainous areas, formed by submarine volcanic eruptions in the third century. There are many streams and springs on the island, and the temperature is lower than Manila, but slightly higher than Hengchun. The products include the rare lung medicine raw material "Red Head Orchid." There are only more than 2,000 indigenous Ami people living on the island. Before the Pacific War, Dr. Hasegawa and others of the Japanese Medical Science Department went to the island one after another to conduct physical examinations of the residents and test the residents' reactions to tuberculin, all of which were "negative." The results of this test were highly valued by the medical community and regarded as a sacred place for treating lung diseases, because lung patients have "positive" reactions when they undergo the same test. The island is also located in the Kuroshio Current area of the Pacific Ocean, where there are many aquatic products and fish, which are regarded as the "virgin land" of the ocean by production scientists. At the same time, the bird is the first place where typhoons pass, and its position in meteorological observation is also extremely important. Last year, a typhoon caused a major disaster in Taiwan, and some people believed that it was caused by the interruption of meteorological observation work on the island.

### School News Across the Country: Chaoyang Incident Under Legal Investigation by the Law and Liaoning Provinces, Soochow University Announces Temporary Holiday, Explosion in the Professor's Office at Dongda University

Amidst the waves of politically charged student movements, school news from across the country is attracting widespread attention. A summary is provided below:

Kaifeng

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] Most students from the six major universities in Henan Province feel that they have been boycotting classes for three weeks, deeply regretting the neglect of their studies. They believe that since representatives have already been sent to Beijing to petition, classes should resume as soon as possible. Therefore, a "anti-boycott" movement is brewing, demanding that professors resume teaching as soon as possible, with the strongest advocacy coming from the Agricultural and Engineering colleges. In addition, the private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology has completed its three-day strike and will resume classes on the 26th.

Shenyang

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] An explosion suddenly occurred in the Economics Professor's office on the fourth floor of Hanqing Building, Northeast University, at 9:25 this morning. The room was empty at the time, and only the furniture suffered minor damage. According to the investigation results, the explosive was confirmed to be a slow-burning bomb. It is noted that the school experienced arson and explosion incidents on the 14th and 19th of this month, but fortunately, there was no damage. The Garrison Headquarters is currently conducting a strict investigation.

Changsha

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 24th] Hu Shuhua, President of Hunan University, personally participated in the student parade some time ago to maintain order, as attempts to dissuade the students were ineffective. Although no accident occurred, he telegraphed the Ministry of Education, taking the blame and resigning, and requested punishment because the event violated government regulations.

Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The National Women's Normal College in Jiulongpo went on strike today, using the "May 20th Age" blood incident as an excuse. Their slogans are "Against civil war, against hunger." The organizers are still Wang Huanrong and others, who were the main figures in the "anti-violence" movement this spring. After the student movement was launched, Wang and others went to the Shatou District to instigate, but without effect. They then convened a student meeting at the Women's Normal College last night and decided to strike for three days from the 24th to the 26th to promote the movement. At the same time, they resolved to designate "June 2nd" as "Anti-Civil War Day," with a one-day strike. Today, after implementing the strike, Wang and others sent representatives to Chongqing University and other schools to request a response.

Tianjin

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 25th] The Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin resumed classes yesterday. Students from Nankai and Beiyang Universities have also scheduled to resume classes tomorrow.

Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The incident of students being beaten for resuming classes at Chaoyang College has been quelled. The students who caused the incident are currently being summoned and interrogated by the Beiping District Court Procuratorate according to the law.

Kunming

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 24th] More than 700 government-funded students from Yunnan Provincial Kunming Normal School, Kunming Women's Normal School, Kunming Institute of Technology, Kunming Commercial School, Kunming Agricultural School, and Kunming Vocational Nursing School went to the Department of Education this morning to petition, demanding: (1) Adjustment of provincial school government funding to be the same as national schools; (2) Increase in teachers' salaries; (3) Shorten the service period and guarantee employment issues; (4) Increase the national education budget to ____ percent of the total budget. Li Yongqing, Chief Secretary of the Department of Education, responded, promising to submit the students' demands to the Provincial Government and forward them to the Ministry of Education for instructions. The petitioning students considered this response insufficiently concrete and decided to march and continue their strike.

Hangzhou

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th] According to reports: After the administration of Soochow University announced a temporary holiday, many students who could return home left the school one after another, leaving only a few students behind.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 25th] Zhejiang University students have been on strike for a long time to demand an increase in food subsidies. The school believes that the neglect of studies is inappropriate. Therefore, classes are resuming today. However, the students still want to continue the strike.

Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Thirty-three principals of public and private secondary schools in Nanjing, including Wang HuiSan, Wang Shumin, Wang Chaobei, Wang Zongmin, and Zhu Shanglin, recently jointly published a statement to the public, stating in brief: A small number of students, using democracy and freedom as their slogans, must understand that democracy and freedom each have their true meaning. Disturbances and chaos are by no means the essence of democracy and freedom. It is imperative to distinguish between right and wrong, stabilize order, and allow students' studies to continue progressing as soon as possible. We, as teachers, bear the responsibility of guiding young people and should do our utmost to strive forward. We dare to ask the public to assist us in guiding young people onto the right track and leading society to stability.

### Zhejiang University Alumni Encourage Students to Resume Classes and Avoid Political Struggles

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th] Fifty-seven alumni of Zhejiang University jointly published a letter to their fellow students yesterday, stating in brief: We are deeply concerned about the petitions and strikes of Zhejiang University students in the past few days. We believe that the motives of the majority of students are pure. At the same time, we believe that the government, under the overall difficult situation, should carefully consider the importance of the various demands of the students, weigh the urgency, and gradually resolve them reasonably. Post-war China needs peace and stability and even more so, the ability to endure hardship and be diligent. If actions are too hasty, affecting social order and increasing the difficulties for the government and the school, then it would run counter to the students' original intentions of loving the country and the school. Especially in the early stages of implementing democratic politics, it is necessary to have good manners to serve as a model for people from all walks of life and be praised by social discourse. We cannot bear to see this situation of easily sacrificing coursework and studies continue to develop. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the students will resume classes as soon as possible. As for political issues, we hope that the students will put forward constructive suggestions based on reality and academic perspectives so that Zhejiang University can avoid being used as a venue for political struggles.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Five representatives from the Jiaotong University May 20th Tragedy Relief Association, including Qian Shuwen, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday, verbally requesting the release of arrested students from various schools. Mayor Wu initially stated that he did not recognize the relief association. However, if the schools resume classes on Monday, reasonable demands from the students could be considered, and a satisfactory solution could be reached. He instructed them to submit a list of the arrested students from each school to the government and to discuss it after classes resume tomorrow (Monday). The representatives left around 1:00 PM. The five students and another student visited Mayor Wu again at 6:00 PM in the afternoon, reporting that more than 20 members of the Jiaotong University propaganda team had been arrested in front of the Peace Statue on the Bund and requesting their release. Mayor Wu replied: He has ordered the police department to notify the parents of the middle school students who were arrested yesterday for propaganda activities and have them take them home for supervision before classes resume, so they can attend classes as usual. The arrested university students may also be released if they did not incite strikes, work stoppages, or market closures or violate the emergency measures previously issued by the municipal government. As for the eleven students from the Shanghai Law College who were arrested the day before, they will be handled in a separate case, as they have been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office, and administrative agencies may not interfere. The visiting students expressed dissatisfaction with Mayor Wu's response and demanded the release of all arrested students, which would guarantee the resumption of classes on Monday. However, Mayor Wu wanted the schools to resume classes first and then discuss the issue of releasing the students. The negotiations had not yielded results by 7:30 PM and were adjourned.

### The Student Movement is Gradually Clearing Up Schools are Resuming Classes in Order

[Report from Central News Agency] The student movement in this city, after a week of developments, had a symbolic "calm after the storm" yesterday. After the resumption-of-classes movement gained the support of a large number of sensible students, stabilizing forces are actively unfolding. The majority of striking schools began preparations for resuming classes yesterday. In addition, some middle schools and girls' schools that had voluntarily suspended classes in the chaotic situation a few days ago have also decided to resume classes starting today as the student movement gradually clears up. After holding a faculty meeting yesterday, Jiaotong University professors jointly issued a statement, urging students to follow the school's announcement and resume classes starting today. A large number of students from Soochow University and Datong University also returned to school voluntarily yesterday and began reviewing their lessons. The section chiefs of the Shanghai Medical College have scheduled a meeting today to launch a signature campaign to resume classes. As for the middle schools, all will resume classes today. Therefore, it is expected that starting today, except for a small number of schools that may remain stubborn, the rest of the schools are expected to resume classes entirely.

### Table Tennis League The China National Goods Team Defeats the Island Team

In the four matches of the Second Shanghai Table Tennis League the night before last, the Fourth Division of Dongchang and the Second Division of Yingjian forfeited to the Fourth Textile and the White Team due to rain, which was detrimental to the spirit of sportsmanship. In another match, the Fourth Division of Qingdao National Goods competed against the Postal Service at the Postal Service's sports hall. The strengths of both sides were equal, and the competition was intense. The Qingdao team mistakenly arranged its list, with strong players Wang Xiuguang and Xu Huachang in the rear. Even if they won, it would be useless, as they had already formed a trailing situation. As a result, the China National Goods team relied on the efforts of newcomer Zhang Yuefu in the last group to defeat their opponent Zhu Honggao by three to one, and the entire team defeated the Qingdao team by four to three. Two more matches will continue starting at 8:00 PM tonight.

### Considering Shanghai's Sports

— Wu Bangwei

Shanghai, in the past, was the center of national sports, and in the future, it will still be in a leading position in national sports. Because Shanghai has many rare and excellent conditions, such as the concentration of talent, abundant funds, convenient venues, developed schools, and especially a large number of citizens who truly love sports, the future of Shanghai's sports is infinitely bright. It might not be considered meddling to say a few words for the sake of Shanghai's sports!

Talent is always welcome. Shanghai's sports talent, whether physical education teachers who take sports as a profession or enthusiastic people who promote sports as amateurs, have all made efforts for Shanghai's sports in the past. Many of them are famous throughout the country. Now it seems that some of them are tired. We hope that they can make a comeback, continue to lead everything, strengthen our strength, and jointly develop the cause. New talents are also expected to concentrate in Shanghai, and they must be continuously cultivated from physical education teacher training institutions. Calculated by schools, assuming an average of two people per primary school and an average of three people per secondary school or above, we need at least two thousand specially trained physical education teachers. Calculated by general public sports organizations, we need thousands more sports instructors. This cannot but hope for the efforts of the Municipal College of Physical Education. Although the economic situation cannot be said to be very wealthy, the ticket revenue from various sports competitions is still considerable. If there is a good system and a long-term plan, it will be more than enough to run regular businesses. With this surplus, we can enrich venues and build facilities year by year. Within ten years, we can develop Shanghai's social sports to an ideal state. At the same time, the government should be able to include national sports funding in the budget in accordance with the law and enrich school sports in line with social needs, which will be even more effective.

The physical education venues and equipment seem to be a bit poor at present. In the public sector, the Nanshi Sports Field has a basic scale, but the sports field in the central area of the city has not yet been recovered and has been damaged. Although the gymnasium and swimming pool have played their maximum effect, they are still far from meeting the needs of three or four million citizens. In terms of public organizations, the various activities of the Municipal Sports Association are all held by renting venues, and the number of other sports organizations with sports venues and equipment is also very small. We believe that the Municipal Sports Field should have a plan for construction by year and by district, so that citizens can have suitable places to exercise within five li. The municipal government can promulgate a method to allow public sports organizations to claim public land or rent private land to build sports fields to supplement the lack of public sports fields. Hamburg, Germany, has sixty-one large and small municipal sports fields and fifteen private sports fields. Shanghai has a larger population than Hamburg, so we may as well lower the standards.

Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold. Although school sports are said to be developed, most schools still do not have sports fields. This is a serious problem. We believe that schools with large sports fields should be strictly urged to make full use of them, and they should be encouraged to share them with nearby schools that lack sports fields. Many schools that use lane houses as school buildings must find a way to make it possible for young children to have the opportunity to exercise their bodies. Physical training is impossible to implement effectively after secondary school age. As for the content of teaching materials for school sports, it is also necessary to study and improve them. Fortunately, physical education teachers in middle and primary schools have a fairly sound organization for their own further education and responsibility. The education authorities should find ways to provide assistance and guidance through this organization, provide excellent teaching materials, and discuss implementation methods, so that school sports can enter a normal track.

The enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens for sports is really admirable. This phenomenon is unique not only in China, but also rare abroad. However, no one can answer how many sports organizations there are in Shanghai and how many members there are in total, which shows that the strength of the organization is not strong enough. If the sports activities of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of citizens do not have a sound organization and legal management, it is easy to cause malpractices – this malpractice is gradually growing and exposed. The Municipal Sports Association should be the head of all public sports in the city. We cannot but hope that the Sports Association will deal with this relevant issue. The constituent members of the Sports Association should be sports organizations – large ones such as sports associations that include a variety of sports, and small ones such as a simple team – each organization has its fixed members (or team members). The central activity of the Sports Association is to hold various competitions, and its real achievement should be the annual increase in the number of members (organizations and individuals) and the annual expansion of the scope of sports. Shanghai's social sports have already developed very well, so well that there needs to be a sound organization to manage them with common norms.

In short: talent, funding, venues and equipment are the basic conditions for sports. Schools and society are the two sides of sports development, and each is closely related and inseparable. If one part stagnates, the overall situation will be constrained. If the steps are slightly uneven, it will inevitably be chaotic. The one who bears the responsibility of leading the overall situation is the educational administrative organ in charge of sports administration. For the sake of Shanghai's sports, the education authorities must come up with a way and put in effort to guide and supervise this sacred cause. Shanghai was the center of national sports in the past, and it will still be in a leading position in national sports in the future.

### Mayor's Residence Held a Meeting Yesterday Decided to Establish a People's Food Allocation Committee The First Preparatory Exchange of Views Will Be Held Today

[Reported by this newspaper] Rice prices have soared recently, and people are panicking. The common people feel unable to make a living. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food attaches great importance to this and made a special trip to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., an important meeting was held at Mayor Wu's private residence. Minister Gu, Vice Minister Pang, President Zhang, Mayor Wu, Director Wu, etc. attended, and the meeting did not end until 5 p.m. During the meeting, a detailed review of the people's food problem in this city was conducted. In addition to actively dredging sources and strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation, it was also decided that the Shanghai Food General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, the Central Trust Bureau, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other five institutions should form the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee. All matters related to the people's food problem in this city will be handled by the committee in a unified manner. The distribution of rice to schools and factories, which is currently the responsibility of the Social Affairs Bureau, will also be transferred to the committee. The Allocation Committee is expected to be established within this week, and a meeting will be held this morning to exchange views for active preparation.

Today, Distribution of Rice to Factories Begins

[Another report] The distribution of rice to factories in this city has been reviewed and completed in part, and distribution can begin today. As for the distribution of rice to school staff and students, the Education Bureau has not yet submitted the roster to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau will distribute the rice at any time after receiving and approving it. The central government has agreed to allocate 200,000 dan of rice and 500,000 bags of flour per month to schools, factories, and poor households throughout the city, and can increase the allocation at any time as needed.

Rice Prices Expected to Fall

Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: The fluctuations in the rice market in recent days are mainly due to the impact of wind and rain, which has led to a shortage of goods arriving from various places. Holders are unwilling to sell, and prices are freely quoted. When the weather clears, more goods will gradually arrive from various places. At the same time, the distribution of rice to factories and schools can be implemented within this week, and more than one million people in this city can receive this rice. Moreover, the wheat in the suburbs of this city has been harvested abundantly, so rice prices are expected to fall.

### With the Textile and Construction Industries Purchasing as Much as Possible, There is a Gradual Turnaround in Pudong Cotton Farmers are Encouraged and Hope for a Good Harvest This Year

[Reported by this newspaper] According to people in the Pudong cotton industry, Pudong counties have always regarded cotton as a major agricultural product. In the prosperous period before the war, the annual output was millions of dan, which was supplied to the Shanghai market as raw materials for the yarn industry. During the period of the occupation, it was subject to enemy and puppet control and was purchased at a reduced price, which was severely damaged. Cotton farmers lost money and were forced to change to planting grain, so many cotton fields were converted into rice fields. However, the soil in Pudong is suitable for cotton cultivation, and planting cotton yields more than planting rice. Therefore, after the victory, most cotton farmers automatically resumed planting cotton and increased cotton production. However, at the beginning of the resumption of production, last year's cheap foreign cotton dumping caused Pudong cotton production to suffer from falling prices again. Cotton farmers asked for sale at cotton prices that did not count the cost, but they still lacked buyers. Fortunately, recently, the China Textile and Construction Corporation has repeatedly sent people to Zhoupu and other places to purchase as much as possible, so the cotton price has slightly kept up with the local product comparison price. After this encouragement, cotton farmers are more enthusiastic about sowing than in previous years. New cotton is widely planted in various regions, so it is estimated that this year's output is expected to be a good harvest. It is reported that the Textile and Construction Corporation strictly identifies the grade and evaluates the price of purchased goods, and eliminates the bad habits of adulteration in the past. Cotton farmers and cotton merchants are also happy to accept this, and have automatically hired workers to select and improve the accumulated ills in order to restore the cotton production in Pudong.

### Central Trust Bureau Plans Passenger Insurance

The Minimum Amount is 20 Million

In addition to actively promoting life insurance and property insurance, the Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau has recently been preparing to establish passenger insurance. Passengers traveling by airplanes, ships, trains, long-distance buses, and other means of transportation can request insurance from the bureau to avoid accidental risks. The minimum insurance amount is 20 million yuan in national currency, and the premium is 20,000 yuan. Once a passenger is insured, if they encounter dangers or casualties during the journey, their family members can receive compensation from the bureau. The bureau believes that the scope of this type of insurance is very wide, covering the whole country, and cannot be handled by insurance companies with weak capital. Therefore, it plans to jointly organize a large group with insurance companies from all over the country to operate. If there is any surplus insurance amount, it can also adopt a reciprocal method to share it with the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries. However, this type of "passenger insurance" is absolutely different in nature from "property insurance," so it must be handled separately from property insurance.

### Shanghai Salt Affairs Glimpses Production, Transportation, Sales, Seizure, and Hoarding

[Reported by this newspaper] Yang Longhu, director of the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, recently met with a reporter from this newspaper and gave a brief account of the office's business situation as follows. He said: The office's regular business is nothing more than production, transportation, sales, and seizure, with the additional business of hoarding.

In terms of salt production, the main one is the salt produced in Yuanpu Chang. The Chang is formed by the merger of three salt Changs. It produces four to five thousand dan in the off-season and eighty to ninety thousand zu in the peak season. Currently, because the quality of the salt produced in the Chang is not good, the cost is high, the output is small, and the brine is weak, production has been restricted.

In terms of salt transportation, it is divided into two types: one is commercial transportation and commercial sales, and the other is official transportation and commercial sales. In the total amount of 100,000 dan of salt transported on average each month in this area, Yuanpu Chang accounts for 20,000 dan, the North China Salt Industry Company accounts for 20,000 dan, and the remaining 60,000 zu are transported from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and other places. Commercial transportation accounts for 80% of the total amount of 100,000 zu.

In terms of salt sales, a purely free trade system is adopted. Therefore, the price of edible salt transported and sold by salt merchants is not controlled. However, the salt transported by the government has an official warehouse price, which is currently 60,000 yuan per zu including tax. The current price of commercially transported salt is about 75,000 yuan per dan. The total amount of salt sold from July to December last year reached 880,000 dan. The total amount from January to April this year reached 514,000 dan. The average monthly sales of salt has exceeded the quota of 100,000 dan.

In terms of salt seizure, the fact that the average monthly sales amount exceeds the quota is sufficient to prove that although smuggled salt still exists, the amount is not much. Statistics from July to December last year show that a total of 9,200 dan of smuggled salt were seized. From January to April this year, a total of 2,800 dan of smuggled salt were seized.

The additional business of salt hoarding is the "Changping Salt" transported by the government, which is hoarded in official warehouses. When the market price of salt fluctuates and supply and demand are unbalanced, it is sold at a fair price to regulate surpluses and deficits. For example, last year, because salt production in Zhejiang was not abundant, "Changping Salt" was purchased from Taiwan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places to make up for the shortage. In addition, the office also handles salt loan affairs for salt merchants who transport salt through this area to the areas along the Yangtze River.

### Cigarette Market Weakness

Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was still strong. The initial price of Great Britain cigarettes was 7.3 million yuan, and there were occasional transactions. Then, it rose slightly, and there were quite a few resales in the middle, and the quoted price returned to the market. The closing price at noon was 7.3 million yuan, up 30,000 yuan. The market conditions for other Chinese-branded cigarettes were also quite strong. Later, it was heard that a lot of return goods of Old Knife brand cigarettes came from Hankou, and there was already secret dumping in the market, so it was difficult to expect the cigarette market to improve for a while.

### Soap and Candle Raw Materials Sell Well

Yesterday, the prices of soap and candle raw materials rose due to purchases from various parties. Monthly brand caustic soda stepped firmly to 7.3 million yuan, and American goods also followed up to 7.1 million yuan, both up 150,000 yuan from the previous day. N rosin rose by 20,000 yuan, and the price per can was 600,000 yuan. White wax also rose by 100,000 yuan, and the price per Sima dan was 1.3 million yuan. Styrene rose by 200,000 yuan, and the price per market dan was 3.2 million yuan.

### Domestic Prices Continue to Fall Difficulties in Tung Oil and Bristles Exports The Expansion of the Black Market Exchange Rate Difference Promotes Tung Oil Smuggling

[Reported by this newspaper] According to people in the export industry: At present, the export of tung oil and bristles has obviously fallen into a slump. And domestic prices continue to fall. In terms of the tung oil market price in this city, each zu (110 pounds) is equivalent to 500,000 yuan in national currency. However, the US market price recently reported 25 cents per pound, which is equivalent to only 330,000 yuan per dan at the local market price. It can be seen that the price difference is too large, and merchants are really unable to promote foreign sales. Even the foreign sales business of tung oil from China Vegetable Oil Factory has been suspended for as long as two months. In terms of bristles, the market price in Shanghai is equivalent to 4 million yuan in national currency per old dan (equivalent to 133.33 pounds), while the foreign market price is only equivalent to 3 million yuan in national currency per old dan. The price difference is also large.

He further pointed out: Recently, the difference between the black market foreign exchange and the official price foreign exchange has been increasing, which invisibly makes the difference between the domestic and foreign market prices of the export materials increase. And it also creates tung oil smuggling as the only profitable way. It is said that most of the smuggled tung oil comes from Hongjiang, Chenzhou, and other places in western Hunan. The output of this area is quite abundant, and most of the products take an early route bypassing Guilin, and then transported to Guangzhou via the Xijiang River, and then smuggled to Hong Kong. It is said that the cost when arriving in Guangzhou is more than 400,000 yuan per dan. Although it is still traded at a price of 25 cents per pound in Hong Kong, due to the black market foreign exchange settlement, each dan can still make a profit. It is estimated that the smuggled tung oil to Hong Kong is at least more than 1,000 tons per month.

### The Exchange Rate of the Taiwan Dollar Will be Adjusted at Any Time in the Future

The Taiwan Provincial Government will make reasonable adjustments to the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar at any time in the future.

In addition, since the Taipei Post Office opened foreign exchange remittances outside the province, it stipulated that the remittance limit per person was 1 million Taiwan dollars. It is said that this restriction has now been lifted. There is no limit to the total amount of remittances per day, but the maximum amount per ticket cannot exceed 1 million Taiwan dollars. The remittance fee is 5%, and telegraphic transfers are subject to additional telegram fees of about 100 yuan.

### On the Rationing System

— Hong Zhangli

The root cause of the current price problem is complex, but the imperfection of material control is also an important reason. As the saying goes, "It is not scarcity that is to be feared, but uneven distribution." People in both the government and the public have learned from the lessons of prices and realized that strengthening control is urgently needed at present. The rationing system is a very important part of the entire control, and a thorough implementation is naturally a good way to curb prices.

In order for the rationing system to produce the expected effect, it must have the following conditions. First, in order to control consumption, the set quantity must be lower than the usual demand, but it must be close to the actual demand. Second, it must not only be quantitative, but also periodic. Third, it must not only be periodic, but also of uniform quality; otherwise, if the rationing is small in quantity, poor in quality, and often delayed, the people will not be able to survive, and the black market will not be eliminated. Secondly, the rationed materials must have an official price to replace the competitive price under the free economy, and to require the official price to be reasonable, the pricing standard must be close to the production cost, plus a reasonable profit; it should be quite stable, and cannot be changed in the morning and evening. Otherwise, the official price will become a mere formality, and the mission of control will be difficult to complete.

According to the rationing methods, advanced countries have four well-established methods: (1) the prohibition system, which prohibits the free manufacture or consumption of goods; (2) the restriction system, which restricts the quantity of consumption; (3) the license system, which requires prior permission from the governing office; (4) the coupon book distribution system, which is the quantitative distribution system. In terms of its effectiveness, first, the implementation of the family rationing system can remedy the materials in which the demand exceeds the supply. Because the implementation of this system naturally restricts consumption, and can concentrate resources in the production sector, in order to increase production. Second, it can avoid the drawbacks of material bias and profit monopoly. Because all economic functions such as production and transportation are subject to national supervision or operation, it is naturally difficult for merchants to hoard and monopolize and obtain huge profits. Third, it can eliminate speculation. Because if the rationing system can be fully implemented for daily necessities, the main target of obtaining huge profits disappears, and speculators will naturally find it difficult to apply their skills. Fourth, it can stabilize people's lives. Fifth, it can eliminate economic competition. Since prices are set and material supply and demand are restricted, the economic losses caused by competition can naturally be avoided. However, the listed advantages are assumed to be a perfect implementation of this system. In our country, there are no accurate survey statistics of population and products, which can be used as a basis for production and consumption, which are all in vague impressions. The rich and powerful arbitrarily enjoy, and most poor people starve and have no food, which is a well-known fact. Because the rationing of daily necessities is limited to a part and the amount of rationing is small, most of the general people's needs are obtained from the black market, and the advantages of rationing cannot be brought into play.

In view of the current situation, to seek a way to correct it, in addition to implementing the above-mentioned conditions that must be met, there must also be a comprehensive plan and thorough methods. It is necessary to achieve consistency from top to bottom, and the rich and powerful cannot buy more, and the poor and powerless can still get it. And start from adjusting the rationing mechanism, strengthening personnel management, and promoting the rationing coupon system. Everything is based on the principle of fairness and reason. In this way, although the income is small, it is equal, and although it is poor, it is safe. Not only is price stability hopeful, but also the current turbulent situation will also calm down.

### Coal Production and Consumption District Coordination with the Current Situation

[Reported by this newspaper] Relevant parties are considering taking necessary measures to prepare for the event that the supply of coal from North China is cut off, so that Central China can be self-sufficient. The current coordination between production areas and consumption areas is as follows: Coal mines in Qinhuangdao and Northeast China supply various parts of North China outside of Tianjin and Beijing. Coal from Keelung supplies Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. A portion of the coal from Qinhuangdao and Keelung is transshipped through Qingdao to supply power plants and other public utilities in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area.

The main difficulty in the north is the busy military transport and the lack of wagons. At the same time, the Communist army often cuts off the traffic lines between the coal mines and the ports, so the southward transport of coal often fails to reach the expected amount. However, there are two good phenomena: one is that the Keelung coal mine has gradually recovered after the 228 Incident; the other is that the output of the Huainan coal mine has increased sharply after development. If it can be increased to more than 100,000 tons per month, the Central China region can be self-sufficient and does not have to rely on the north.

### Soybean Exports Temporarily Suspended Except for Italy

The Central Trust Bureau is contacting various countries in need of soybean exports. Of the 13,200 tons needed by Italy, half were shipped out earlier this month, and the remaining 6,600 tons are limited to be shipped out by the end of this month. The needs of other countries such as Switzerland and the Czech Republic are suspended until the measures for oils and raw materials are announced.

### Northeast Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai Will be Distributed to Various Oil Mills

In order to suppress the current rising trend of edible oil, the municipal government is trying to dredge oil sources and has reached an agreement with the China Grain Company. When the company purchases soybeans from the Northeast and transports them to Shanghai, a part of them needs to be supplied to this city. The company currently has 750 tons of soybeans, which have arrived here a few days ago and will be reasonably distributed to various oil mills by the municipal government.

### The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office Continues to Discuss the Issue of Japanese Compensation Factories

[Reported by this newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office held a meeting the day before yesterday, attended by representatives of private factories, to continue discussing the matter of undertaking Japanese compensation factories. The eight preparatory representatives of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce have all been elected the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Tian Hexiang, the representative of the Shanghai General Association of Industry and Commerce can be produced within next week, but the list of representatives of the local branches will still take time to produce. The Ministry of Economic Affairs originally hoped that the joint factory organization work could be completed within this month, but judging from the current situation, it will inevitably be postponed. The funds required to undertake the project were estimated two months ago to be 100 billion yuan in national currency per factory, totaling 400 billion yuan for the four factories; today, with the soaring prices of everything, it has already exceeded this number. The representatives of the private factories now insist that before building the factory, they must send representatives to Japan to inspect the compensation machines planned to be moved back to determine their value and performance.

### The United States Notifies that a Machine Tool Exhibition Will Be Held Regularly

[Reported by this newspaper] The US Consulate General in Shanghai recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that the US Machine Tool Manufacturers Association will hold an unprecedented machine tool exhibition in Chicago from September 17 to 26 this year. All the progress of American industry during the war will be fully demonstrated. The location of the exhibition is Dodge Chicago, which covers an area of 44,000 square meters. This factory was established during the war and specializes in manufacturing aircraft engines. It is one of the largest aircraft factories in the United States. More than 250 types of machines are planned to be exhibited, and each type is further divided into several types, with special machines for large-scale production as the main body. After the opening of the exhibition, it is hoped that representatives from all walks of life in our country will visit.

### Xu-Yan Section: From Being Riddled with Holes and Full of Twists and Turns to Embracing New Life

— Yanzhou, 14th Instant Telegram — Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

In the face of the widespread fighting in central Shandong, the opening of the Xu-Yan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is a matter of national concern from any perspective. The main task of this reporter's northern trip was to see the general progress of the repair work on this section of the railway.

Speaking of the repair of this section, we must first understand the means the Communist army used against this section of the railway in the past. After the victory, the first shot fired by the Communist army was to destroy the railway.

Repair Work Repeatedly Unfolded Three Times

In a time of financial hardship, the government never forgot the work of restoration. With a heavy heart, in November of the 34th year [1945], it began repairing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, starting from Liguo Station and working north. By December, it had reached Hanzhuang Station. At this time, the Communist army panicked, believing that the repair of the railway was more dangerous to them than having a gun pointed at their chest. In less than three days, they destroyed it again. After negotiations by the Americans, the Communist army admitted their mistake, and the repair team began a second repair effort from Liguo Station. By January of the 35th year [1946], just a few days before the Nationalists and Communists agreed to establish a government and the Nationalist government issued a ceasefire order, the railway had been repaired to Lincheng. However, the Communist army stubbornly refused to allow the tracks to be joined, and after failed negotiations, the railway bureau staff returned to Xuzhou to await orders. The ceasefire order did not stop the Communist army's military ambitions. A written document instead fueled the flames of war in various areas, and the Xuzhou-Lincheng railway, which had just been repaired for a few months, was subjected to a third destruction by the Communist army in May.

The government exercised restraint for the sake of the country and sought a peaceful resolution, negotiating with the Communist side. On July 20, the railway bureau began a third repair effort. This time, it took five months to repair to Lincheng, and the 31-kilometer-long Lin-Zao branch line was also repaired and opened to traffic. For about a month, train after train transported several tons of black coal. The good times did not last long. Just as the residents along the railway were beginning to feel a bit of vitality, in January of this year, the Communist army again captured Zaozhuang with a strong force. Although the Lin-Xu line was spared a fourth destruction thanks to the 97th Army's defense of Lincheng, the Lin-Zao branch line was left with only broken and missing roadbeds, and it remains shattered to this day.

Repair Difficulties: Like Laying a New Road

The traitor's atrocities forced the government to use force as a backup for peaceful unification. In recent months, the situation in Shandong Province has gradually become clearer, and the opening of the Xuzhou-Jinan line has made the opening of the Xuzhou-Yan section a major issue for the transportation authorities.

The reporter met with Zhu Xianbin (Chief of the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau), who is in charge of the repair work, in Xuzhou. In Tengxian, I also met Lu Songkang (Engineer of the Railway Bureau), who is also a team leader. Despite their busy work, both of them told the reporter everything about the repairs.

Because the damage was so severe, they both agreed that the repair work was tantamount to laying a new road. This section of the road (referring to Lincheng to Yanzhou), excluding the stations, is 96 kilometers long and has 61 railway bridges, totaling 143 spans, with the longest bridge being 260 meters long.

When work began, there was no certainty about the availability of civilian workers along the way, so in addition to the 490 veteran workers, 5,000 people were first hired in Xuzhou. Later, when they arrived in Tengxian, the Tengxian County Government allocated 2,000 people, and the Zou County Government also recruited more than 3,000 people to join the work. At the busiest time, there were more than 12,000 people working every day. Now, the number is gradually being reduced. In addition to the veteran workers, there are still more than 1,000 basic workers and more than 1,000 temporary workers.

Equipment Needed: Jointly Planned by the Ministry and the Railway Bureau

In terms of equipment, preparations began after the takeover and reached more than 80% of the required amount. The equipment that has arrived in Yanzhou is no longer a problem. According to statistics, the total equipment needed is: (1) Rails: 19,076; (2) Fishplates: 38,152; (3) Fishplate Bolts: 76,304; (4) Sleepers: 174,312 (including 31,242 for bridges); (5) Spikes: 572,280; (6) Switches: 31 sets.

Rails and sleepers are allocated by the Ministry of Transportation, and the rest are arranged by the Railway Bureau. The fishplates (i.e., joint bars) are more difficult because the rails issued by the Ministry are not of consistent sizes and styles. The fishplates must be matched to the size of the rails, so a portion of the rails is received and a portion of the fishplates is manufactured. One-fifth of the rails were collected by offering a price because after the Communist army's destruction, most of them were hidden in areas within 20 kilometers. Offering a small price like this caused the people to bring them when they saw them, which could be considered a win-win situation.

Must Return to the Station to Rest Before Dark

The first difficulty currently felt in the work is the instability of public security. Therefore, the workers must return to the large station to rest before dark. They depart at 5:00 in the morning, and the round trip takes 8 hours (the speed of the train cannot exceed 10 kilometers per hour on the newly repaired railway), so the actual working time is only 7-8 hours. The second is that the railway has just been repaired and there are very few tracks, but there is a lot of military transport, which sometimes hinders the movement of materials. Other headaches in the repair work include the urgency of time and the variety and age of the equipment. However, all the workers, in such an environment, braving wind, sand, and scorching sun, ultimately demonstrated the following achievements: (1) They transported 500,000 cubic meters of soil and laid the roadbed long ago; (2) The efficiency of daily work reached a maximum of 2.55 kilometers; (3) So far, only a gap of more than ten kilometers from Zou County to Yanzhou South remains, and it can be opened to traffic before the military's deadline of the 20th of this month, which was brought forward by ten days.

The military brought forward the deadline by ten days, but also took into account the difficulties of the Railway Bureau, and separately transferred a part of the × Battalion and × Battalion of the × Regiment of the Railway Engineering Corps to depart from Yanzhou and repair southward. It also transferred the × Battalion and × Battalion of the same regiment to be responsible for guarding the Railway Bureau's repair team, so that they could work with peace of mind, extend working hours, and increase work efficiency. On the 12th, the reporter accompanied Lieutenant General Chen Shaoping, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th District Railway Military Transportation Command, on a special train of the Railway Bureau to inspect the work sites of the above two units. Those traveling with him included Railway Bureau Team Leader Zhu Xianbin, Deputy Team Leader Lu Songkang, Engineer Shi Zhuodai, and others, totaling thirteen people. They first arrived at Liangxiadian. After getting off the train, the first thing that caught the eye was two large material trains of the Railway Bureau, fully loaded with sleepers and rails. Further ahead was a pile of workers pushing, knocking, hammering, hitting, measuring, and shouting... The reporter was attracted by this painting written with "strength." I immediately ran over, stepping step by step on the newly laid sleepers, feeling a lot of energy.

Repair Steps: Starting from Preliminary Work

Regarding the repair work steps: The first step is to lay the sleepers on the built roadbed. The sleepers are loaded onto trucks from the material train, transported to the work site, and then laid manually, with a distance of about 75 centimeters between each sleeper. The next step is for the engineering car loaded with rails to be pushed to the rail-laying section with the effort of several people. With one person emitting a singing sound of "Hmm... Ya... Ha...", many skilled workers quickly pulled a 480-pound rail from the car to the front. When it was about to leave the car and fall to the ground, another person specialized in tapping the end of the rail with an iron bar. This was the most tense and interesting part. More than a dozen people let go at the same time, and the rail fell onto the sleeper, precisely connecting with the rail behind it. When you hear their singing at its most vigorous, that means they have laid another rail in a short time of only two or three minutes. After laying two rails, the engineering car immediately rolled onto the newly laid rails and continued their work, while the workers nailing the tracks behind caught up. Before nailing the tracks, they first had to measure whether the two tracks were parallel. After standardization, they nailed part of the spikes, then attached the fishplates, and then added the spikes. After that came the maintenance work of correcting, leveling, and filling with stones.

Once the Train Passes, I'll Also Have a Way

The reporter found a hired worker and asked him, "Is it hard?" He said, "Don't ask me, old man. Even if the government doesn't give me money, I still have to do it! Once the train passes, I'll also have a way!" Then he told the reporter how the Communist army had gathered thousands of people two years ago, and with a single order, they all started to throw sections of rails into the river and burn the sleepers one by one... Watching him do it. "But today, it's still been repaired in our hands!" This was his last and highest sentence.

Our group continued north, passing several railway bridges. Although there were sleepers on the bridge, there was a deep abyss below, and the reporter was too cowardly to move forward. Later, three battalion commanders wearing glasses... Zhao, Qiu, and Yu... took turns helping the reporter across. Then we got into the car, went to Zou County for lunch, and after lunch, we arrived at the Railway Engineering Corps' repair work site: Yangjiaxiang.

The Communist Army Demolished the Road, Never Thinking of Coming Back

This place is 7 kilometers from Yanzhou. Because Yanzhou held firm and did not fall, the extent of the damage was not very severe on the surface. The general situation is like this: within 3 kilometers south of Yanzhou, the tracks are intact; in the area from 3 kilometers to 11 kilometers, the rails were dug up but not moved away, the sleepers were all missing, and the roadbed was not completely damaged. However, the Communist army's demolition work has always been well-researched. Although the destruction of this section of the road was not thorough due to environmental limitations, they did not relax in the past. They dug an inclined surface intermittently on both sides of the roadbed. In this way, even if it is repaired, problems will often occur due to the uneven compactness of the roadbed soil. You know, he destroyed the threads of the screws on the fishplates at the joints or blew up the nails at both ends of the rails. According to the usual method, you must use a lot of force to squeeze out the threads from the nail head to the nail body, or even cut off the nail body to remove it for use. According to the second method, although the rails are there, they are equivalent to waste. Doing this is almost the same as thorough destruction. Commander Chen smiled and said, "We also demolished the railway during the War of Resistance, but we never destroyed it as thoroughly as they did!" The reporter interjected: "We wanted to come back and use it again when we demolished it back then, but they demolished the road and never thought of coming back!"

Battalion Commander Ni Zhongli is also the captain of the regiment's repair team, and he is in charge of the repair work here. The reporter had a good chat with him. He told the reporter about the many difficulties in working here. Although the destruction here is light, the degree of trouble in repairing it is almost the same as in the leveled places. First, the rails must be removed. Removing one rail takes at least half an hour. Then, the remaining gravel on the roadbed must be cleared away before the sleepers can be laid, the tracks can be laid... and so on. In addition, there are many inconveniences in the transportation of materials. The sleepers used here are received and transported from the Railway Bureau's repair team in Liangxiadian. Of the eleven trucks, only five are in good working order. On average, each truck can transport 100 sleepers per day. In addition, there are 200 oxcarts, which come back every three days, and each cart can load 10 sleepers. All in all, a maximum of more than 1,000 Shenmu sleepers are transported per day. However, according to the planned plan, 1.5 kilometers must be repaired and 150 rails laid here every day. Each rail is matched with 14 sleepers, requiring a total of 2,100 sleepers. In addition, there are four bridges that need 8,000 sleepers to make the bridge foundations. Although there are so many difficulties, Battalion Commander Ni is still very optimistic. He is thinking of other ways to strengthen transportation work, so as to achieve the expected goal and complete the repair and open the railway to traffic before the 20th.

This repair unit has worked on the Lin-Zao branch line in the past, and later repaired to Xin'anzhen on the Longhai Line. This time, it was transferred here to work. According to Battalion Commander Ni, it may be transferred to the Longhai Line for repairs again in the near future. The reporter has agreed that if work starts, please notify me to visit.

The weather was very hot, and sweat poured out like pulp. The reporter picked up the big gourd in the bucket, scooped up water, and drank it several times. At this time, those who came with me, except Battalion Commander Ni, had all returned to Liangxiadian. Because the reporter was going to Yanzhou, he walked north with Battalion Commander Ni, walking on the undamaged tracks. He even found that green grass was growing, which was enough to imagine the long-term neglect over the past two years. The railway had also tasted the loneliness! The setting sun was in the mountains, and the crows returned in droves. Although it brought a desolate atmosphere, the voices of people, the sound of iron, the sound of cars, the noise... all merged into one, injecting blood into this road and violently breaking through this long-term loneliness.

### Refugee Students of Northeast University

— Changchun, 15th Instant Airmail — Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

During a time when rice was as expensive as pearls and firewood as cinnamon in the Northeast, many young students from the Communist-controlled areas north of the Songhua River successively escaped from the cracks of war. After they escaped, they received a relief fund of 2,000 yuan per person from the Jilin Provincial Government, but after that, no one cared about them. The national universities in Shenyang refused to admit them, and the Youth Education and Employment Assistance Committee had no way to help. They became refugees, sometimes going to the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan to ask for assistance, but now the gate of the Executive Yuan has also been closed. They have felt that there is no way to appeal and the road ahead is bleak, so they have wandered to Changchun to try their luck.

One House, Two Meals of Porridge

The Youth League lent them a house and provided them with two meals of sorghum porridge every day, relying on the City Government to mobilize donations from all sectors of society. Although this is a pitiful opportunity to survive, after they have experienced the most tragic wandering life, they feel that surviving is also a way out. So far, the number of refugee university students concentrated in Changchun has reached 880, including 97 female students. They are all students from colleges and universities above the specialty level during the puppet Manchukuo era. They come from seventy-one different schools. Some studied in Japan, such as students from Waseda University, Tokyo Hosei University, Tokyo Meiji University, Tokyo Nihon University, Niigata Medical University, Sendai Higher Industrial School, and Hiroshima Women's College, which was destroyed by the atomic bomb, totaling thirty-two units. In terms of school units, schools in Japan account for one-half. However, the number of people studying at puppet Manchukuo schools accounts for two-thirds, including Fengtian Institute of Technology, Xinjing Hosei University, Lushun Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Economics, Harbin Agricultural University, Jiamusi Medical University, and Jilin Normal University, totaling thirty-seven schools. Among the 880 people, a few students are not students who escaped from the north of the Songhua River, and there are also eight students from the puppet Peking University and two students from the puppet North China College of Law and Politics. The number of refugees is not fixed, and refugee students continue to report. They have established a United Association of Refugee and Out-of-School University Students to unite and concentrate their efforts to seek survival together.

Ten Grains of Rice, One Drop of Blood

They come from the war zone and have been tested by a difficult life. It can be said that they live in a pitiful state of hunger and cold. Four hundred and twenty-five people live in a three-story building, living a painful and serious life. At night, they roll on the ground with their clothes on, and very few have a blanket or quilt, and the female students are the same. No one complains about not getting a warm dream. They get up at 6:00 in the morning, raise the flag, and then run to the park. They eat two meals of porridge a day, and they don't even have boiled water to drink. They drink cold water and also drink the germs of disease. Some students have fallen ill under these living conditions. They warn themselves with the painful experience of life. When there is only porridge to eat, they write the warning phrase "When you have rice to eat, don't forget when there is no rice" on the wall of the restaurant. "Ten grains of rice, one drop of blood," what an accurate calculation this is!

Some students have temporarily found jobs to make a living, such as elementary school teachers, civil servants, and newspaper publishers. They can only find jobs that sell their labor cheaply. They use the rewards they receive as public funds for the pseudo-refugee and out-of-school university student federation.

Thinking of School, Thinking of Books

The students' only requirement is to enter school and have books to read. This is indeed a very legitimate requirement. The education authorities have not been able to come up with a suitable solution. A commissioner of the Youth Education and Employment Assistance Committee took away their roster, but there has been no news since then. They are unwilling to wait and waste their studies, so they have decided to set up a tutoring class themselves, which will be planned by the federation formed by the students and will be realized in the near future. The tutoring period is four months, and the required funding is estimated to be about 200 million circulation coupons. Where does this huge amount of funding come from? They have decided to use the method of fundraising, asking all sectors of Changchun City to show great sympathy to help them. It is difficult to say what the effect will be, but their appeal can indeed get deep sympathy. They said, "We will invite teachers ourselves, find houses ourselves, and the students will attend classes on the floor. We are determined to do it." They asked for support from the press. In their deep and melancholy eyes, they contained tears and sincerely expressed their eager aspirations, hoping to grab the reporter to cross the river, just like grabbing a straw. In sympathy and shame, I told the reorganized new government that not giving them food to eat and not giving them books to read is a shame for the government, and the government should be responsible.

### Hoping for Jiao Tong University to Set Up Branch Test Centers

Editor:

Summer vacation is coming, and which of us high school graduates is not hoping to enter an ideal university with a passionate heart to seek further study? But in fact, we have many difficulties.

Jiao Tong University in Shanghai is one of the most famous science and engineering universities in our country, and it is also our ideal university. We all hope to be able to participate in the entrance examination. However, it is said that Shanghai Jiao Tong University will still follow the past practice and only have one test center in Shanghai for this summer's admissions. However, traveling from the north to Shanghai is indeed not easy given the current traffic conditions. Raising this travel expense is simply impossible for us poor students.

Furthermore, the Pingjin area has always been known as a "cultural city," and the number of middle schools is indeed quite large. In addition, there are probably several times more middle schools in Hebei and the Northeast than in Shanghai. Therefore, in theory, Jiao Tong University should set up a test center in Peiping (or Tianjin) so that the tens of thousands of high school graduates in North China can all have the opportunity to take the "Jiao Tong University" entrance examination, because the establishment of universities by the country is for the sake of young people throughout the country, not just for a certain region or other wealthy classes. Tsinghua, Peking University, and Nankai, which are famous in the country for their liberal arts, literature, law, and business, are preparing to set up nine test centers this year, which is for this reason. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Jiao Tong University can change its past practice and set up a test center in Peiping (or Tianjin), which will greatly benefit our large group of students!

### Rent Paid in Rice is Unbearable

Editor:

I originally lived on Chongqing South Road. In May of last year, I was forced to move by a second landlord using his power. In a hurry to find a house, I rented a flat in the Longhua District, with the rent calculated as one dan of rice per month (rice was more than 50,000 yuan last May). At that time, I did not sign a lease contract or have any housing tickets. Later, the landlord asked for rice every month, so I bought rice and paid it. Sometimes, he asked for cash, which was converted according to the market price of rice. There was no problem last year when the price of rice was stable, but this year it has fluctuated severely and has now skyrocketed to the 300,000 yuan mark. I am a factory worker with limited income, and under these circumstances, I have the pain of unbearable burden. Therefore, I especially send a letter, begging to borrow a corner of your newspaper to expose it and urge the Longhua District Office to uphold justice and instruct on how to resolve the following points: (1) In the Longhua District, rent is often calculated in rice, which seems unreasonable. However, canceling and changing to calculate rent is impossible because the accumulation of problems is too great. Can the District Office set a rice price for rent, taking care of the tenants as a principle, which is cheaper than the official price and announced for implementation? (2) If the landlord does not agree to the rice price for rent, then the calculation should be based on the official rice price (i.e., household rice) announced by the authorities. (3) It is absolutely not allowed to convert the rent at the black market price of rice, so that the tenants have room to breathe. After the above points are discussed and decided, they should be announced and implemented. (A citizen of Longhua District)

### Don't Forget to Bring Your ID Card When Traveling

Yesterday, I had something to do and went to Luodian via Dachang. As soon as I had arrived, military police boarded the bus to inspect the car and check each person's ID card. I forgot to bring my ID card. Fortunately, the military police forgave me and only told me to pay attention next time. It was the same when I stayed at a hotel in Suzhou last time. I am especially informing all readers not to forget to bring their national ID cards when traveling to other cities or suburbs, so as to save trouble. (Cai Miaosheng)

This is specially conveyed.

### Early Summer in West Lake

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 20th Instant Dispatch

Spring has waned, and willow catkins drift from the willows surrounding West Lake, settling on every yacht. The flowers of the tung trees flutter and whirl, dyeing the Lakeside Park a snowy white. This year's spring rains seem scarce, and in the blink of an eye, the weather has unleashed heatwaves. The sun is no longer beloved, and the trees on Su Causeway and Bai Causeway grow a deeper green. During the day, the vast lake surface glitters with patches of golden scales. In the evening, people stroll leisurely along the lakeside, reluctant to leave even late at night. This is already early summer weather, ripened to an unbearable degree. Checking the thermometer, it has reached the 90-degree mark. Perhaps this year's summer will be a bitterly hot season.

Ceaseless Waves Should Transform into the Main Force of Construction

Due to the scarcity of spring rains, the wheat harvest in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area is quite good, but the soybean harvest is poor, as is the early rice. Silkworms, due to the allocation of Yunnan breeds and insufficient temperature, mostly died. Urgent attempts to remedy the situation will probably not yield ideal results. As this hot summer approaches, let us think about the kind-hearted farmers who, braving the intense heat, working tirelessly despite the turbulent national situation, remain loyal to their duties. In this peaceful scenic city, many others have stirred up waves. Following the rice craze, there have been student movements at Yīng Dà, Zhè Dà, and Zhī Dà, as well as some sporadic labor strikes. These numerous phenomena symbolize the storms of the era and the yearning for progressive construction. As John Leighton Stuart said, "China has been destroying itself year after year for decades. Now, what we need is a revolution of construction." The prerequisite for construction is stability, and the prerequisite for stability is to seek ways to solve problems.

Summer has arrived. Let us hope that these many waves will transform into the main force of construction. Look at those millions of farmers; they are still diligently and conventionally toiling. They need new waves to irrigate, they need new construction. We can no longer allow the city to be disconnected from the countryside, nor can we allow a deep chasm to exist between them.

West Lake in Summer Begins to Stir in the Dusk

Although the weather is gradually getting hotter, Paradise also senses a phenomenon of unease. However, many people still come to Hangzhou to play, and the hotels still hang "Full" signs. Only the sampan business is much quieter during the day, but in the evening, business is more lively. The Lakeside Tea House in Sixth Park and the Tea House at Peaceful Lake in Autumn Moon are so crowded. Tea at the tea house at the Crane Release Pavilion sells for as much as two thousand yuan a cup, because many people go there to cool off. The Youth Center is planning to screen outdoor movies. The Night Garden is about to open again. West Lake in summer begins to stir in the dusk and slowly quiets down only in the deep of night.

Do Not Forbid Cold Drinks Late, Be Careful Not to Repeat the Absurdity of Last Year

In this early summer season, Indian Ambassador Menon visited Hangzhou, and Bai Chongxi from the Ministry of Agriculture also lingered for five or six days. The Nepalese delegation to China also visited Hangzhou. The Hangzhou Municipal Government is also celebrating its 20th anniversary, erecting a pavilion in Sixth Park on the Lakeside to express remembrance of the past municipal administrators. We hope that the municipal administrators will not only pay attention to the scenic areas but also benefit all the citizens of Hangzhou. Although the lakeside and the main roads are relatively clean, in many small streets and alleys in residential areas, foul odors waft out as summer arrives, making people sick when they smell them. Furthermore, medical and health conditions are still not progressive enough. Ordinary households still drink "sky water." The power of Hangzhou gods and the prosperity of many unexamined traditional Chinese medicine practitioners prove that new medical and health practices are not widespread enough. With the arrival of summer, many seasonal diseases will proliferate. This spring, there was little rainfall, so many pathogens may be lurking. Our country often locks the stable after the horse is stolen. Disease prevention is mostly a case of digging a well when thirsty. Now, we must appeal to the health authorities to quickly carry out various propaganda campaigns to prevent epidemics. At the same time, starting today, begin administering vaccinations, starting today, establish quarantine stations, and ensure that information about epidemics is absolutely accurate, so that the source of epidemics can be extinguished. Cold drinks must also be instructed and checked in advance, and we must not repeat the absurdity of last year, when cold drinks were banned only at the end of the summer, resulting in a joke.

The Beautiful Scenery of Inner West Lake, Giant Lotus Pads Extend Out of the Lake

In the past few days, the lotus flowers of Inner West Lake have already sprouted, and giant lotus pads, not yet very large, have extended out of the lake surface. West Lake is beautiful in all seasons, so the beauty of summer should take the lotus flower as the main embellishment. After a little while, water caltrop will also grow in the outer and inner lakes. When the boatman rows through the water caltrop vines, pulling on one will provide a string of water caltrop for you to chew. In the early morning before the sun rises, you can take a sampan to Inner Lake, or to Yue Wang Temple, or to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, or to Liu Zhuang, to enjoy the fragrant lotus flowers, which is quite meaningful. When your small boat enters the lotus thickets, a wave of intoxicating fragrance will intoxicate you, making you forget the world of constant struggle.

Some people say that Hangzhou summers are quite hot. Yes, Hangzhou is indeed quite hot, but if you can stay for a short time on Xiaoying Islet, or in Lingfeng Temple, or in Longjing Temple, or in Yanxia Cave, it is quite cool. Let me tell you, Dr. Hu Shih once lived next to Yanxia Cave for a summer.

Spring and Autumn

### Reverie - Dedicated to my most respected friend JS

— Yang Yifu

That former love, once etched sorrowful light traces in the depths of my soul, sparkling brilliantly. I will never forget those dreamlike bygone days... whispered words in the morning at Zhaofeng Garden, leisurely strolls on Shanzhong Road at dusk, listening to Reverie at the Tàdá Hotel late at night, the Christmas Eve dance under candlelight, prayers before the statue of the Holy Mother in church, farewell kisses in the misty night... These cloudlike past events; these shadowy figures in my dreams, tightly entwine my soul, allowing me to quietly yearn in contemplation; to quietly feel melancholy in remembrance; to silently shed tears in reminiscence. I don't remember how many times I have subconsciously told myself: "Forget it! We live for today, not for the past." However, who can forget sorrow as easily as forgetting joy?

At dusk, the streets were unusually desolate, and I slowly strolled home from school alone. The inconsiderate east wind gently blew, and a gust after gust blew on the loose hair on my shoulders, suddenly making me feel a pang of inexplicable melancholy, a sense of causeless light sorrow... Who says this isn't "being deeply troubled by unfeeling things"? The twilight gradually deepened, and all the scenes blurred into the smoky haze of the evening.

Returning home, after putting down my books, I discovered a note pressed under the glass on my desk. The familiar handwriting clearly showed that it was written by my uncle: "How is your work going? Are you feeling better? How about having dinner with you tonight? Forgive me for keeping the location a secret for now. Miss, I hope to see your smile tonight. You know I hate seeing you with your eyebrows furrowed. See you at seven sharp." After I finished reading, I couldn't help but laugh.

My uncle is truly my only confidant. He understands me the most. When I am at my most pained, he not only gives me a lot of comfort but also tries his best to make me happy. However, he has failed. I feel sorry for him. I know I have let down his good intentions. But I cannot deny that he is indeed lovable. When you are with him, he can allow you absolute freedom. You can say whatever you want, and you can do whatever you want, as long as you feel happy, he seems to be even happier. I like him because his personality is somewhat similar to mine. He is not selfish. He does not take his own happiness as happiness but takes the happiness of others as happiness.

I happily pushed open the small window. In the twilight, a pale crescent moon was already hanging on the treetops.

I walked to the dressing table, applied a thin layer of powder, dabbed on some light lipstick, and then hurriedly opened the wardrobe. I was considering which dress I should wear. My gaze first fell on that evening dress with a light blue background and scattered rose flowers. I don't know how long I haven't worn it. I couldn't help but take it out, looked at it, and then quietly hung it back up. No, I don't want to wear it because it reminds me of Hua Hua. This evening dress was his favorite. I took down that silver-gray one, thinking, wouldn't it be better to wear something plain?

My uncle arrived, and I hurriedly got into the car. In the car, I couldn't help but ask him: "Where are you planning to take me?"

He smiled: "You'll know in a little while."

The car's speed was quite fast, and the streetlights constantly sped backward. Finally, the car stopped. I got out of the car, and all I saw before me was a bright light. I looked up and saw the dazzling neon lights flashing the four red characters "Tàdá Hotel." I was stunned: "Uncle, why come here...?"

"Why?" As he said this, he took my hand and walked step by step up the stone steps: "Isn't it good to listen to music?"

At this moment, I really didn't know what to do, but I had already unconsciously been pulled in by him. I followed him to the round table by the long window and sat down. My uncle was busy ordering dishes. Although I sat quietly, my thoughts surged like the evening tide. This familiar yet unfamiliar hall was still so brightly lit. This band of musicians, whom I seemed to have met before, was still playing heart-stirring music. There was a time when Hua Hua and I listened to music here almost every night; however, now, I didn't even want to calculate how many days it had been since I had been here. Although I had hoped that one day I would be able to come here again, drink a cup of hot coffee, or drink a cup of sweet wine, listen to a piece of music, and savor the bitter past, I never had the courage. However, tonight, now, I was already sitting here, and I couldn't help but feel excited and agitated inside.

Suddenly, a burst of clear, flowing bells echoed from the music stage. This familiar and lingering melody told me that it was "Reverie" (Souvenir). These sounds of strings penetrated into the depths of my soul, almost freezing my blood. At this time, the shadow of Hua Hua floated into my mind again. Although I tried my best to suppress my emotions, I knew that my eyes were wet.

"Yifu, what's wrong? Don't you like this place?" I think he must have caught a glimpse of the tears in the corners of my eyes.

"No, I don't mean that," I avoided his gaze, staring at the music stage in the distance, and slowly said, "This is Hua Hua's favorite song."

My uncle didn't say anything. He was silent for a moment before whispering to me, "Silly child, still so infatuated?"

I turned around and said, "I don't know, maybe what cannot be forgotten can never be forgotten," and whispered, "Now I know that forgetting something is much more difficult than remembering something."

Dinner began. He raised the glass of purple-red wine and touched my glass, saying, "A toast to your health and happiness."

"Thank you." I also raised the glass of wine and drank it all in one gulp.

While eating fish, I couldn't help but ask him, "Is there really no news about Hua Hua at all? Is he just missing forever, never coming back?"

He lit a cigarette, "I hope you still think that way, it's better," he exhaled a thick cloud of smoke, "if you still love him."

"Yes, I love him," I couldn't suppress my emotions and said excitedly, "I love him, although now I have realized that love is just beautiful pain, because the price of love is paid with love."

The lights gradually dimmed, and the music changed from melodious and poignant to cheerful and bright. In the dim light, I vaguely saw my uncle staring at me, his gentle gaze seemed to be telling me that he sympathized with me.

At this time, I believed that my feelings were even more difficult than his. A wave of irrepressible sadness welled up in my heart. I hated myself for why I had ruined the harmonious atmosphere of this dinner again.

At this moment, we both fell silent again. The waiter brought the desserts and coffee. I took a sip of the sweet and bitter coffee: "Uncle, I really don't know how to thank you," I looked at him affectionately and said, "For so many days, you have been like my beacon, illuminating my dark path. You are also like my clear spring, relieving my parched life. You give me work, so that I can forget a lot of pain in the busyness, so that I can entrust my love and passion to the crowd, making me live more meaningfully and more valuable. I remember you once said: Life is about giving, not taking. From now on, I must become stronger..."

He smiled and held my slender hands, saying, "I know you are a good child. This world is not as bad as you think. There is still happiness and joy. May you always be the master of your own life and find your happiness back. My sympathy may be superfluous."

"No, if there is still a little beauty in this world, this little bit of beauty may be warm friendship."

He smiled and nodded, and I also smiled and said to him, "Are you willing for me to always be one of your many friends?"

He shifted his gaze to the window and smiled, "Please don't forget that I don't like seeing friends with furrowed eyebrows." I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

The lights dimmed and lit up again, and the music was playing Farewell Waltz, a waltz full of parting feelings. In this sad and soul-stirring music, we walked out of the Tàdá Hotel.

The night was already late, and it was midnight when my uncle took me home. The night was noisy and people were quiet. I quietly leaned by the window, the Milky Way was faintly visible, and a crescent moon was already hanging in the sky. The leisurely evening breeze blew on the loose hair on my shoulders, one gust after another. It was extremely quiet. Suddenly, it seemed that bursts of clear string music drifted from the evening breeze, constantly echoing in my ears—wasn't that the lingering "Reverie"? I couldn't help but close my eyes tightly and silently offer my most sincere evening prayer, wishing that tonight's evening breeze could carry my blessings to the West tens of thousands of miles away.

### Lotus

— Qian Juntao

### Balzac

— Yang Shi

When Balzac was young, he liked to say to one of his sisters: "Do you know what? Your brother will be the greatest writer in the world." When his mother heard this, she immediately rebuked him: "Child, it's best not to use those words that you don't quite understand indiscriminately."

### The grass on the grave is green

— Lan Ge

On the grave, the grass is green

Quietly covering the ditch

Spreading into the green field

The year before last, some grave diggers came

Their strong arms wielding iron

Digging a pit

Putting a coffin in

Then heavily covering it with a layer of soil

Turning the green grass over

Deeply buried underground

Close to the white coffin

Last year, in the tender yellow of April

The green grass sprouted again

Bursting out from underground

Reporting a message:

'I have been resting for a year

Life underground is very quiet

Although the coffin has rotted

But I am even fatter'

From the vast fields

The shepherd boy came

The scarecrow came

The drunkard came

The women came

Their feet ruthlessly trampled on

The sharp knives coarsely and coldly cut

The livestock lowered their heads

Patiently gnawing

But no one noticed

The ground covered with green grass

In the autumn, in the quiet fields

The withered grass drooped its head

The naughty children came

Setting a wildfire on the grave

The withered grass scorched black

The grave became even more desolate

This year, the third year…

The scorched black

Grave, the grass is green again

Quietly covering the ditch

Spreading into the green field

But still no one notices

The ground covered with green grass

### May

— Han Xiu

Colorful May, full of romance,

Laden red cherries, laden fragrant kisses,

Backside two blooming two roses,

A green plum, a maiden’s heart.

Changeable May, full of suffering,

Grains of white rice, strings of tears,

Drops of yellow oil, bodies of sweat,

A cry of price increase, a cry ,

A rainy day, a poor man’s face.

### Spinning Girl

— You

Carrying the destiny endowed by God,

Carrying the sorrow endowed by life:

The spinning girl accompanies the spinning wheel alone.

She begins to gaze at the stretching cotton,

Memories of youth…

Brilliant dreams are drawn into the spindle.

Working hard to warm people,

Yet on herself;

Hang tattered clothes and tear stains.

Sorrow tightly locks her brows,

Wiping away a tear, forever;

Rocking... rocking.

Like a devoted shepherdess guarding her flock,

She…

Just as always, accompanies the spinning wheel alone.

### Nocturne

— Tang Kuangying

My Lost Love

When I was young, I fell in love with the bend in the river in front of my door. When I was young, I fell in love with the lamp while reading late at night. Now, as I gradually enter middle age, the river and the lamp, although they only teach me to recall them briefly, are still clearly visible. However, after crossing thousands of mountains and rivers, my heart that loves humanity and loves nature has been eroded by storms and giant waves, and its brilliance has faded.

Now, I know how to fall in love with myself.

"Ten thousand people are like the sea, one body is hidden"!

I am willing to be at the depths of the sea, watching the bubbles floating on the surface wriggle. I only relive these tidal past events, and the years flow like water.

I seem to have begun to lose love with everything with the temperament of a middle-aged person.

Banner Shadow

A sudden gust of wind, my heart banner fluttered and became chaotic again.

Is it the heart moving? Is it the banner moving? The east wind is silent. I, this traveler from afar, am pushed into the depths of emotion by the dusk of tonight.

Relighting the lonely lamp of my heart, to the depths of my heart banner, I repent and hate myself a thousand times: I want to make myself a lonely lamp in the sea of people, illuminating the homebound voyages in the darkness, coming and going among people.

I remember that sentence in the Buddhist scriptures: "For example, a bright lamp can extinguish all darkness. If it is with darkness, it is not called a lamp."

Folding the heart banner, I want to hold on to this faint light in the wind and rain.

Wild Rooster

On my pillow, listening to the crowing of the wild rooster in the desolate village, I suddenly remembered that I was a guest thousands of miles away.

Nothing makes people more sober than the dead of night. On the pillow, I pushed the past events of a dozen years ago to the front, and then moved myself a dozen years later to the bedside. In the dozens of years in between, I was just a prisoner of God; He only gave me a machine to digest bread, but I suffered decades of persecution by mankind and was a prisoner of the soul for decades.

Everyone has groped in the darkness at their clearest time, and everyone has forgotten the crowing of the rooster at dawn. The crowing of the rooster is wearing away the lives and vitality of more people.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 518

— Ye Jingfeng

Shouyi: "Ha, you are still talking like a child. Please flip through history. Over the millennia, which few invaded countries or races, in tens or hundreds of years, did not assimilate the invaders but instead ruled over them? The Javanese tribe that invaded India before the Common Era had long since fallen into the 'untouchable' class of the Indian country. The Normans who captured the British Isles took pride in being stained with the blood of the locals. Do you know that when Kublai Khan fought to several countries in Europe along the Mediterranean Sea, he left part of his troops in those defeated countries, and they were later assimilated by the people. If you don't believe it, now in these countries, especially Hungary, there are still many descendants of my country from the Yuan Dynasty who still retain many customs of my country, but their blood and race have long been digested by the local people..."

"So, you think it doesn't matter to be a subjugated slave, and after a few decades or hundreds of years, you can assimilate the invading country and turn it into a victor?" He Jian sees that Shouyi's theory contains excessive transcendence, and it seems that even subjugation doesn't matter, so he asks so impolitely; the sentences inevitably contain some degree of high irony.

Shouyi: "You misunderstand me somewhat excessively. I do not approve of the passive self-destruction, but I do not approve of deliberately preparing for aggression and wanting to destroy other people's countries. A nation can never be wiped out, unless this nation is small and degenerate to the point where it should be eliminated by nature... So this should be separated into two sides to say; The first side, aggression is useless; because the possessive nature of aggression only lasts for a few years, a few decades, and at most three or four hundred years, this possessive nature of aggression will be eliminated by the active or passive resistance, or survival resistance of the invaded. This also fits the law of survival of the fittest; because military aggression; or other types of aggressors, are not necessarily superior races, and those who are invaded are not necessarily inferior races. The formation of aggression only lies in the fact that one has the preparation and training of aggressive tools, and one does not take this into account...

... However, it is a matter of course for a nation to be strong and survive: to strive for strength is only to take a global perspective as the scope, to set an example for itself, and to do everything possible to maintain and promote the pure culture and true culture that are not extinct in the world. In this way, those barbaric nations who have put on the coats of material civilization, but are actually beasts who harm their own kind, can be slowly influenced and instilled with some true culture. So, striving for strength is not preparing for aggression, nor is it preparing to resist aggression.

"In order to strive for strength and survival, one should follow the times. The times have now embarked on the path of science, so we should also concentrate the talents and resources of the whole country to study science, not only following behind others, but also taking a step forward and walking ahead. However, the goal of studying science is to seek happiness for mankind; it should not be like those selfish and self-interested military groups, like robbers and bandits, secretly studying scientific weapons, and then forcibly and domineeringly robbing mankind and destroying culture..."

### White Dove

— Jiang Dun

I admire that blue sky, even more I admire the white dove flock.

It reminds me of the fluttering corner of a blue garment. You, the child of the seaside, are as beautiful and pure as a white dove! Like a youthful dream, your eyes are as deep as the sea, filled with the vitality of youth, brimming with the radiance of wisdom, and also revealing a hint of sorrow... Beneath your elegant nose, there is a smiling mouth like a budding flower. The wavy hair draped over your shoulders further sculpts your beautiful face! Thinking of you makes me think of the white dove symbolizing happiness and peace, the poetic goddess draped in a veil of clouds—

In the hearts of all who are newly in love, everyone is a beautiful white dove, and his and her hearts are a blue sky. In their pulses, one can distinctly hear a sublime and sacred melody like "Ave Maria." Although the world is ugly, and although people have their sins, first love is as pure as a white dove.

Blue sky, a blue sky without mist, a sunlit blue sky, like our hearts, setting off our white dove of love even more beautifully.

In a dark life, we should admire that blue sky, admire that flock of white doves...

Because only love can make our lives stronger, more radiant, and more beautiful!

### Random Notes on Poetry

— Keng Qiang

Poetry is the alarm bell of the times. It is not limited by time and space, and constantly sounds, awakening the dregs of society and the laggards of the times.

### Idle Talk from a Lonely Anchorage

— Wang Cong

"Fickleness" is the behavior of petty people.

Some so-called gentlemen, who mutually praise each other under the banner of the Peking School, criticize the "Shanghai School" as shameless. In fact, what the "Shanghai School" values is "A word spoken is an arrow that cannot be recalled," it is the righteousness of the Jianghu.

Therefore, there is nothing wrong with "Shanghai." A rascal who points at his own nose and says, "I am a rascal" is at least frank and straightforward.

What is most frightening are those gentlemen who hide daggers and claim to be saviors.

S likes to eat braised duck.

I jokingly said, "I will nail a nail to your nose. Then hang the braised duck on it. When you have nothing to do, you can lick it with your tongue. This can be used as a novel decoration. (This is no different from wearing earrings.) And you can often taste what you like to eat."

This remark of mine aroused T's fallacy. He said:

"There was a strange man who was born with two completely different eyes, one was a human eye, and the other was a dog eye.

Whenever the strange man eats, he will immediately be aroused with two completely different feelings. When the human eye sees feces, it produces a feeling of disgust, while the dog eye, when it sees feces, sees it as if it were the most delicious delicacy on the table."

I think if there really were such a strange person, his mouth would be the most painful and contradictory. Should he obey the human eye? Or should he follow the dog eye?

If, to be more realistic, in this year of rice as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, a person born with dog eyes is more "blessed."

Free Talk

### Too Much and Not Enough

— Hua Run

A recent issue of the pictorial Life mentioned that the American family system is increasingly collapsing, posing a serious threat to Western civilization. The reason is that the divorce rate in the United States has reached an alarming peak: one in every three marriages ends in divorce. The reasons for divorce are so broad as to be beyond description. Couples can file for divorce as long as there is the slightest dissatisfaction between them. In particular, wives cannot tolerate any minor flaws in their husbands. For example, an issue of Time magazine published a story about a woman over fifty years old who sued her husband, who was over sixty years old, for abandonment and abuse, demanding a divorce. As for the evidence of abandonment and abuse, it was that the old gentleman was reading "Forever Amber" in bed. Another woman filed a lawsuit in court, demanding a divorce, on the grounds that her husband called her a "tomahawk" used by American Indians. Such cases, which would not constitute grounds for divorce in other countries in the world, are commonplace and very common in the United States. As the number of divorce cases increases, sexual morality fundamentally loses its existence, and children are thus deprived of the blessing of valuable family education.

Americans take divorce so lightly, which we always feel is too much.

But when we look back at ourselves, it seems that we are not enough. That is to say, we take divorce "too seriously," and are therefore willing to endure all the pain, and even sacrifice lifelong happiness. Couples regard each other as enemies until they die. In such families, children have no good family education to speak of. What they get is resentment, sorrow, cruelty, and other vicious and abnormal emotions and psychology. Under such circumstances, sexual morality can also be destroyed.

The ancients valued the status of a wedded couple, and there were also admonitions such as "Do not abandon a wife who shared hardship." They believed that after the decision of parents and the words of a matchmaker, it was a destiny determined by heaven, and it should never be broken up. Even if there was a separation, it was usually the husband driving out the wife, presumably because she had committed one of the "seven grounds for divorce." As for the woman, she would follow the chicken if she married a chicken, and follow the dog if she married a dog, and there was no possibility of her independently breaking away from the relationship with her husband. This trend is still very popular to this day, and has thus cultivated a psychology that if a man and woman divorce, it must be because the woman has done something wrong, thereby incurring social contempt. To this day, many couples with disharmonious feelings are reluctant to marry, often to avoid the damage that the woman will encounter in this regard. Economic reasons are certainly very important, but they are not the first thing to consider.

As for the new type of union, people generally think that since they have fallen in love with each other, how can there be any reason to regret it halfway? Even if they find that their personalities are incompatible, they cannot blame anyone, and they can only admit that they deserve it and prepare to "grow old together." However, they do not realize that personality is extremely elusive, and there are indeed men and women who initially fell in love but eventually became like ice and charcoal and could not tolerate each other. If such couples are forced to stay together, not only will they suffer, but even their children and even relatives and neighbors will feel pain.

Of course, I am not encouraging couples to divorce more. What I mean is that before getting married, the time for dating should be lengthened a little. After getting married, they should be more tolerant of each other. However, once they reach a point where they cannot tolerate each other (especially on the woman's side), they should resolutely file for divorce and seek a mutual liberation.

### Electric Writing Machine

— Bai Li

The electric writing machine consists of a sending station and a receiving station.

The sending station is a platform of about two square feet, slightly inclined to facilitate writing; there is a pen on the platform, with two iron bars attached to the pen, and two extremely sensitive wires attached to each iron bar; a bottle of ink is placed on the corner of the platform.

The receiving station is vertical, and its structure is roughly the same as the sending station.

An ordinary telephone is installed next to the electric writing machine, but this telephone can only listen and cannot talk back.

The application of the electric writing machine is as follows: First, use the telephone to dial the number of the other party's electric writing machine. Then run in the brief, if there is a "Qi Qi" sound, this indicates that the circuit between the two parties has been connected and you can start sending the message. If there is no sound, it means that someone else is sending a message to the same number of the electric writing machine, you can wait a few minutes.

Before sending a message, you must press the electric button on the upper right corner of the sending station, and the prepared paper will be rolled up from the bottom, then dip the pen in ink and write on the paper. After one sheet of paper is written, you can press the same electric button again, so that the second sheet of paper will roll up and you can continue writing. After sending the message, you must press the electric button in the lower right corner, and the paper will automatically roll into a prepared wooden box for the sender to save. Then put the receiver on the telephone, and the circuit will be broken.

When you press the upper right corner of the sending station, the paper will also be rolled up from the bottom of the receiving station on the other side; when you lift the pen, the receiving station on the other side will also lift the pen; when you dip the ink, it will also dip the ink; when you write, it will also write. In short, the actions of both parties are completely consistent. When you finish sending the message and press the electric button in the lower right corner, the paper of the receiving station will fall into a specially made wooden box, so that its owner can take it out to view it when he returns.

The electric writing machine was invented by the Swede Rithes, and later modified by the American Franklin.

We can first make a judgment: when the electric writing machine becomes popular all over the world, it will be the end of the postal business.

### Rebuilding the Statue of Peace

— Ye Lin

Since the Statue of Peace was demolished, the Jianghai Customs has lost its best movie shot, and the gentry and ladies also feel as if they are missing a piece of decoration, which is very disapproving. As for ordinary people like you and me, the goddess is not an important part of this big city, so whether she exists or not seems to have little to do with life. Only when we occasionally pass the stone seat of the statue and see bird droppings everywhere, we feel that this place, like other parts of the city, has become overgrown.

Not long ago, I heard that the goddess had been found, and everyone was happy. They were happy that she had not fortunately crossed the sea to become an accomplice of the warmongers. It was only rumored that she had broken wings and broken arms, and the scene was very miserable. However, after all, the goddess is ignorant, not as needy as the disabled beggars on the street. So after a long time, people forgot about it. However, our municipal authorities attach great importance to this matter, probably because it is related to the appearance of the city and concerns international image. Recently, it was said that it would be rebuilt, and the cost would be 300 million yuan. In other words, each citizen would have to bear 70 or 80 yuan, which is not enough for a streetcar ride, so it is naturally a small matter, but it is a huge expenditure for the municipal government.

Of course, although this expenditure is huge, it is probably important. The rebuilding of the goddess can be expected soon. Once completed, firstly, Shanghai will have another beautiful decoration, secondly, it will give people a little thought of peace, and thirdly, it will take care of international public opinion. As for the embellishment of the Bund, it is even more of a trivial matter. I only hope that those sensitive poets will not regard it as satire. As for us, since we are not paying out of our own pockets, we are naturally happy to see it completed.

Comparative Observation of the Depreciation of Currency Values in Various Countries After the War Jian Zhe

During the war, countless amounts of wealth turned into ashes, causing post-war inflation and the shrinking of the purchasing power of currencies in various countries. Whether it is a US dollar bill, a British pound, or a French franc, it cannot buy as much as it did before the war.

The attached figure shows the percentage of the purchasing power of currencies in major countries at the end of 1946 compared with the purchasing power in 1911-1919 (pre-war).

The currency value of Hungary is close to reaching zero. Italy was both a battlefield and a defeated country in this war, resulting in a sharp drop in currency value. Because the United Kingdom implemented controls, the situation was relatively good, but due to a shortage of materials, even if there was money, there was almost no goods to buy.

Movie Talk

### "The Pink Bomb"

— Wu Bian

Some film editors who stayed in Shanghai during the occupation found themes in the "underground work" circle for their works after the victory, such as "Number One Under Heaven", "From Darkness to Dawn", "Tides of the Sea of Desire", etc. Now this "Pink Bomb" is no exception.

These stories describing "underground work" lack real life. They are just dramatists' conceptual manipulations of characters. Those characters have no flesh and blood, no personality, no life, and naturally no thoughts. How can such a script move the audience and resonate with it?

"Pink Bomb" portrays the female spy Lu Peijuan as so elusive, alert, and brave, while the special commissioner Xu Gongwang is so careless, confused, and absurd. He casually puts the most important documents in his bedroom without any vigilance. Two enemy henchmen effortlessly cracked his important organization, making this group of intelligence agents almost wiped out in one fell swoop. This is simply a satire. Furthermore, the enemy's investigation director and the investigation team leader are both lustful. They forget everything when they see a woman. This is also unbelievable. I think people who have been in the occupied areas will not forget the ferocious faces and insidious methods of those enemy henchmen, secret agents, and running dogs. And it is too unlikely that an enemy puppet agent like the investigation team leader can still have a conscience and repent. Moreover, the only explanation in the play for his repentance is that the pain and struggle of his lover (singer Liang Manling) during the torture stimulated him. Then what if the tortured woman was not his lover? It is absolutely impossible for such a character to change his life just for one woman, and moreover, to place great sympathy on such a running dog character is a terrible poison.

Content determines form. The director's handling of the play is also mediocre and lacks characteristics. Gu Lan Jun's acting has no development, and Yan Hua's acting is too excessive. The only commendable thing is Cang Yinqiu's portrayal of the director's wife.

### Nazi Tactics

— Yamaguchi

There was a photo proving that Hitler's invading army quickly changed the conquered people and made them pay tribute to the Nazis. A British shortwave radio station revealed how the Germans used a Parisian outdoor concert at the time.

"Suddenly, the music stopped being played by a voice speaking loudly in French, 'Raise your hands if you don't speak a Germanic language!'"

In fact, none of these people knew that there were Germans among them, and millions upon millions of hands were raised. A flash! The posture of all the people standing at attention and raising their hands, just like the Hitler salute, were all photographed.

### A Record of a Dangerous City

— Qin Shouou

The town of Jinchengjiang is quite far from the highway, but very close to the railway station. Many commercial vehicles that take the highway also stop in the town for the convenience of loading goods. The cars departing from there are the starting point, unlike the passing vehicles, so they should be more empty in theory. Old Zhu felt that the military policeman did remind him.

He was running frantically on this three- or four-mile-long road. He was not only anxious, but also a little confused. Several times he wanted to purse his lips and blow a piece of his favorite tune "51115271...", but he failed.

When passing the large wooden bridge spanning the Jinchengjiang River, he heard the sound of a harmonica coming up from under the bridge, mixed with the innocent laughter of a little girl. He knew that Zhang Chang and the others were playing with Fei Fei, but he couldn't muster up the interest to greet them. He just changed from a quick walk to a slow walk, and breathed a sigh of relief.

The original three or four small hotels built entirely of bamboo outside the town still stood on both sides of the road. Old Zhu suspected that the news of the fire that Lu Qian heard was not true; but after walking two or three hundred steps, the most tragic scene of fire unfolded before his eyes. The small town that originally existed between the railway and the former railway hotel had completely disappeared, but he could not see the remaining walls and ruins that usually existed after a fire, because there was no tiled house in this town except for the railway hotel. All of them were awnings made of bamboo and wood; after the fire, all that remained were piles of ashes.

The baptism of fire that Jinchengjiang suffered this time was even more thorough than the previous two times. All the shops and houses were burned to the ground, and the furniture, clothes, and everything turned into ashes. Even several trucks parked near the railway station were burned into skeleton-like wreckage.

Walking to the edge of this scorched black town, Zhu Zhaonian's heart was already half cold. He looked around him despondently; the original path could no longer be recognized at all. Occasionally, he could still see the corpses of people burned into dead trees, lying scattered next to those living people whose hands were empty after being burned by the fire. Traces of the explosion of artillery shells and bullets could also be seen far away from the railway station.

"These damn bastards"! Thinking of how tense the war was at the front, and yet there were a large number of munitions here, which were squandered so much due to the irresponsibility of those absurd officers, and even destroyed a town in the process, Old Zhu couldn't help but crack his eyes and curse loudly.

"Bastard! Are you still scolding me"? Suddenly, a cold and trembling voice came from the left side of his body.

Old Zhu turned his head in surprise.
