### Nineteen Counties in Shandong Province Given a Deadline to Recover; National Army Continues to Recapture Jiaxiang Yesterday; Communist Troops in Zouxian and Tengxian Show Signs of Wavering

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng paid a visit to the Chairman at 11:00 am on the 20th to report on matters. Chen has been feeling slightly unwell recently and will not leave Nanjing in the short term.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Chief of Staff Chen reported to Chairman Chiang that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line may be opened within a few weeks or possibly before March 1st, allowing direct train service between Shanghai and Tianjin. Observers say this will have a direct impact on China's economy, both practically and psychologically.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] The Shandong Provincial Government convened a meeting on the 20th of leading members from the Party, government, and organizations from nineteen counties in southwestern Shandong, including Dingtao, Jiaxiang, and Yixian. The meeting stipulated that all relevant staff return to their respective counties immediately to rebuild local armed forces, stabilize the area, and begin recovery work. The provincial government will provide all transportation.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The National Army recaptured Jiaxiang at 4:00 pm on the 20th. The National Army, having recaptured Zaozhuang, is advancing towards Tengxian. The National Army advancing towards Feixian is eight to nine kilometers from the city suburbs.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] After the National Army recaptured Linyi, Commissioner Wang Hongjiu and County Magistrate Zhu Shaobai immediately led their troops into the city to carry out pacification work. Communist organizations are rapidly disintegrating. Local elders celebrated and the people voluntarily turned in large quantities of grain and military supplies stored by the Communists.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The National Army in southern Shandong, Linyi, and Yixian, sent a division to support the city on the 18th. The remnant troops of Zhang Guangzhong, the commander of the Communist Southern Shandong Military Region, numbering over ten thousand, are currently based near Sangcun, north of Zaozhuang, attempting to flee north. The National Army advancing north from Lincheng has reached the outskirts of Tengxian.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The Shandong Military Region Headquarters of the Communist Southern Shandong Military Region issued the following strategy for the current situation: (1) Use large-scale guerrilla warfare and small-scale mobile warfare to contain the National Army's forces. (2) Attack towns behind the enemy lines to establish new base areas. (3) Utilize the National Army's lenient policy by sending lower-level cadres to infiltrate the National Army's recaptured areas for covert operations. (4) Carry out assassinations and looting behind the National Army lines to create a state of terror.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The war situation in Shandong is gradually developing along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. After the National Army in southern, western, and central Shandong clears out the remaining Communist troops in their respective areas, they are adopting a multi-pronged approach to capture Chen Yi, who is trapped in the Yimeng Mountains. Furthermore, the National Army in Shandong recaptured Jiaxiang on the afternoon of the 20th and shook hands with Wu Huawen's troops, who had been fighting alone for one year and three months between Yanzhou and Jining. The Communist troops in Zouxian and Tengxian are now caught in a pincer movement by the National Army from the north and south and are in a state of extreme panic.

### National Army in Eastern Henan Enters Sizhou; Communist Base Area of Mengxian in Shanxi Recaptured; The Baoding-Shijiazhuang Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Will Soon Be Opened

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] The remnant troops of Liu Bocheng in eastern Henan, numbering over four thousand, were routed by the National Army on the 19th and fled north across the railway from the Chai River area. At the same time, the Communist troops in the Qixian area have also been cleared out, and the National Army has entered Qixian city.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] A telegram from Taiyuan reports that the National Army in Shanxi, following the recapture of Xiyan Town, recaptured Mengxian on the 19th, a base area of the Communist troops for nine years.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] According to reports from relevant authorities, strong units of the National Army in Shijiazhuang recaptured Dongchangshou on the 19th without encountering much resistance from the Communist troops and continued to advance north. The Communist troops in Dongchangshou and Xinle continued to retreat to both sides of the railway. Railway repair teams are following the army to repair the railway. Trains from Shijiazhuang can reach Dongchangshou in two to three days.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] News from Shijiazhuang indicates that the National Army in Baoding has advanced south, and it is rumored that Wangdu, the third station south of Baoding, has been recaptured by the National Army, but this has not yet been confirmed. After the second battle of Yixian and Xushui in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Communist troops have voluntarily switched from an offensive to a defensive posture. The opening of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section is inevitable. However, the authorities of the Eleventh War Zone may adopt a cautious approach and wait for the forces from southern Shandong to enter Hebei to open the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway in one go.

### Chairman Orders the Economic Commission to Supervise Economic Measures; Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Others Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the emergency economic measures, it is reported that the Chairman personally ordered the Central Economic Policy Research Committee to be responsible for supervising and implementing them effectively. Upon receiving the order, the committee immediately convened a meeting on the 20th to discuss practical supervisory methods.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Xu Kan will travel to Shanghai again by train on the night of the 20th to handle various issues related to finance and commodity prices.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Pang Songzhou, Xu Baiyuan, and others traveled to Shanghai on the evening of the 20th in the same train as Wang Yunwu and others to jointly supervise the implementation of the emergency economic measures plan with Song Ziwen and to discuss several pending issues. They are expected to return to Nanjing in two to three days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Xu Kan said on the evening of the 20th that the general situation since the implementation of the emergency economic measures plan has been good. If all parties can implement it effectively and cooperate with each other, it will not be difficult to achieve the desired results. Xu believes that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the current economic situation and said that the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics is discussing detailed methods for balancing the budget with the Executive Yuan, which will be formulated soon. The main purpose of this move is to reduce non-urgent expenditures.

### The Economic Policy Research Committee Will Be Subordinate to the National Defense Commission

It is reported that the committee will become a semi-permanent institution, the number of members will be increased, and it will be subordinate to the National Defense Commission. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 pm.

### The Ministry of Food Discussed Food Supply Issues Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Senior officials of the Ministry of Food held an important meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss how to ensure that the food section of the "Daily Necessities Supply Regulations" can be implemented as planned. It is reported that the current need is to investigate the total number of government employees and factory workers who need to be supplied with rice and flour under the "Daily Necessities Supply Regulations" in order to determine the total amount of supply and to make more appropriate preparations in terms of transportation and distribution methods. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Food, the Ministry's food reserves are extremely abundant and sufficient to meet current needs. If the distribution methods are meticulous, there is no need to worry about the people's food supply.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the technical issues of supplying daily necessities, the Executive Yuan is scheduled to convene representatives from all relevant parties on the 21st to discuss them. The Yuan convened personnel from relevant agencies at 10:00 am today to discuss the price assessment rules. Jiang Menglin, Wang Yunwu, Pang Songzhou, Chen Kewen, Xie Zhengfu, and others attended, and the rules were immediately revised and passed and sent to the National Defense Council for record.

### The Guangzhou Authorities Pay Attention to Preventing Funds from Fleeing to Hong Kong

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Since the government implemented the emergency economic measures plan, economic figures here believe that Hong Kong is a major loophole, and speculative capital will flow to Hong Kong in large quantities. At least dozens of people go to Hong Kong every day to join the Hong Kong gold and silver trading market. The authorities have increased the number of military police along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to strictly prevent speculative capital from fleeing to Hong Kong, but smugglers are still rampant. It is widely believed that the flow of speculative capital to Hong Kong will inevitably affect the rise in commodity prices there. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is paying close attention. If the Hong Kong government can strictly control commodity prices, this speculative capital may be invested in industrial real estate and stocks.

### Goods Hoarded in Xi'an Come Out; Prices of Grain, Yarn, and Cloth Continue to Fall

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 20th] Since the emergency economic measures order was issued, goods hoarded for days have been released, and people's livelihood goods, including grain, yarn, and cloth, have continued to fall in price. Gold ornaments are inventoried by the provincial government at the original stores, pending handling by the central government. The provincial government announced five implementation measures, stipulating that in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Chief of Staff of the First War Zone, the carrying of gold notes out of the designated counties in this province is prohibited. Some people believe that this is to prevent gold from flowing into Communist areas.

### The Legislative Yuan Holds a General Meeting to Review Economic Measures; It Is Believed That the Content of the Plan Still Needs to Be Improved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] At the 3-1 general meeting held by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th, the legislators made objective and serious criticisms of the emergency economic measures plan, believing that there are still many areas that need to be reviewed and improved. Sun Ke presided over today's meeting of the Legislative Yuan. After discussing the draft Household Census Law and other proposals, Luo Ding, the convener of the Criminal Law Committee, reported. The Criminal Law, Finance, and Economic Committees reviewed the emergency economic measures plan on the 19th, explaining that the attendees unanimously agreed that only the penalty part of the plan was being discussed; however, the penalties are based on various measures, and the entire plan has a significant impact on the people's burden and freedom. If the entire plan is not reviewed, it would not be appropriate to decide on the penalty part.

Please Submit the Entire Plan to the Legislative Yuan for Review

After detailed discussion, it was decided to suggest to the Supreme National Defense Committee that the entire plan be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution. Luo also explained that the government's past issuance of import and export subsidy measures did not complete the legislative procedures in advance, and now it has been abruptly abolished, which is legally inconsistent. In addition, the exchange rate has increased from 3,350 to 12,000. It seems necessary to hear an explanation of the basis for this. Finally, regarding the provisions on commodity prices and wages in the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period and the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities During the Emergency Period, it is worth considering whether the "emergency period" marked on them can still be applied one year after the Japanese surrender. Chen Guyuan said that it is inconsistent with the legislative procedure to only discuss the penalties without reviewing the entire plan. Situ De analyzed the plan in detail, believing that there are many questionable points. For example, changing the gold price to 4.8 million will affect the big players, but they have ways to deal with it. The most disadvantaged are the small citizens who are deeply afraid that the banknotes in their hands will continue to depreciate and eventually become worthless. They bought gold at high prices with their hard-earned savings, and this major change is a great loss. Although the government has drafted control measures for the circulation of US dollars, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no black market, and it may be difficult to eradicate the phenomenon of foreign exchange fleeing to Hong Kong. Zhang Jinyuan pointed out in a painful tone that the emergency measures plan has great drawbacks. The government used to sell gold at a price of 7-8 million, and now it wants to recover it at a price of 4.8 million, which is like digging a trap in advance and forcing the people to jump in. The situation with the US dollar is also the same. The government admitted a large number of self-funded students half a year ago. At that time, the official price of the US dollar was still 3,350. The students repeatedly applied, but the government did not allow it until the exchange rate was adjusted to 12,000. It is painful to talk about! The penalty part of the emergency plan also has great drawbacks. For example, prohibiting the circulation of gold will inevitably cause various inconveniences and hardships to the people during implementation. Situ De spoke again, hoping that the administrative authorities would have the courage to admit their mistakes and not blame others or make the people suffer for their own mistakes. Zhong Tianxin said that the most popular part of the emergency measures plan is the government's announcement to buy back the existing foreign currencies; however, why is this measure not purchased at a price of 3,350, as stipulated in the "Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange" for dealing with domestic banks' foreign exchange depositors, but at a price of 12,000? In addition, the purchase of overseas deposits must go through diplomatic channels and have meticulous arrangements. Now that all preparations have not been completed, it is equivalent to alerting the snake and allowing depositors to change accounts. The general meeting finally decided to follow the review opinions of the three committees and suggested to the National Defense Commission that the entire plan be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review to show solemnity.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, did not attend the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th, but sent a letter saying: "Due to matters in Shanghai, I cannot attend. I plan to attend the regular meeting of your Yuan on the 28th." The meeting decided that since the 28th is not the date of the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a temporary meeting will be held on March 1, and Mr. Song will be invited to report to the Yuan.

### Regulations on Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Price Agreements

### Our Government's Suggestions to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA): Machinery Exchange for Cotton and Wheat for Transportation to China; Rejection of Allegations Regarding Sale of Supplies; Remarks by Mr. Rooks

[Washington, D.C., U.S. News Agency, 19th] UNRRA Director General Mr. Rooks issued a statement today, saying that the UNRRA Central Committee will soon convene a meeting to discuss the proposals put forward by the Chinese government. The Chinese government had made several suggestions to the UNRRA personnel stationed in China, one of which was to request a change in part of UNRRA's plan in China, to focus on consumer goods such as cotton and wheat. This request is just one of the suggestions under consideration by UNRRA. It will prompt UNRRA to transport cotton and wheat worth 200 million US dollars to China, abandoning the original step of transporting machinery and other materials to China. The Chinese government believes that the encouragement this type of basic supply may bring to China's economy and currency system is greater than UNRRA's current plan. Rumors that the Chinese side intends to request permission to sell UNRRA supplies on the black market are completely unfounded.

Selling UNRRA's supplies locally through legal channels does not violate UNRRA's policy. UNRRA's general policy is to continue relief and rehabilitation plans, so that UNRRA's plan is a dual relief. The money from selling a loaf of bread made from UNRRA wheat to someone who can afford it is enough to offset the distribution cost of giving another loaf of bread for free to someone who cannot afford it.

Daily necessities transported to a receiving country should be distributed under careful rationing and price controls, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to obtain their due share. This is also one of UNRRA's general policies. Therefore, UNRRA's policy avoids priority or discrimination, regardless of whether such discrimination or priority is based on a person's financial status or other conditions. The distribution problem in China is particularly difficult, as China has a vast territory and has suffered greatly from eight years of war and two years of internal strife. Due to the lack of domestic transportation equipment and losses from the war, the cost of distributing UNRRA supplies in China is far higher than in other countries, and is extremely large. The actual distribution problem is further aggravated by the long distances, the fragmentation of the domestic transportation network, and areas of open warfare. At the same time, due to economic devastation and many government difficulties, China has failed to establish an administrative organization to implement an effective rationing system or control the prices of scarce resources. Due to the above factors, the work of distributing UNRRA supplies within China has become an extremely complex problem. Unlike other recipient countries, China has not obtained sufficient funds from the sale of UNRRA supplies to be used for distribution. As a result, the distribution costs must be supported by direct appropriations from the Chinese government, which is not only a major expenditure of the Chinese government's financial resources, but also contributes to China's inflation. "UNRRA authorities deeply understand this problem and are doing their utmost to overcome various difficulties. The Chinese government's suggestions on this issue are just one of the steps in this regard. The entire issue will be studied by the Central Committee, and it is hoped that a way can be found to promote the UNRRA plan for the benefit of all the people of China."

### New York Chinese News Agency Announces: No Request to UNRRA; Zheng Bin-nan Points Out Errors in Rooks' Statement

[New York, Central News Agency, 19th] The Chinese News Agency here issued a statement saying: Chinese official sources in Washington said that the recent rumors that China made a request to UNRRA are absolutely untrue. China requested an increase in the supply of cotton to China within the scope of UNRRA's China fund. Cotton is the most important commodity for manufacturing textiles, which is a basic need of the Chinese masses who have suffered from war for many years. Contrary to the rumor that the Chinese government intends to put UNRRA supplies into the black market, what must be pointed out is that the most important step taken by the Chinese government in the past few months to address the black market and inflation has been in the area of cotton yarn. In this regard, the Chinese government has been successful in using the above methods: (1) the cost of cotton yarn in factories is sold to the unified planning agency, which resells it to legitimate distributors at a limited price; (2) imported cotton is directly allocated to cotton mills to eliminate speculation. The success of this method has apparently stabilized textile prices to a considerable extent before the recent financial crisis occurred. According to the economic emergency measures recently announced in Nanjing, yarn and cloth prices must continue to be stabilized. In order to achieve this goal, a continuous supply of cotton should be guaranteed, and the effective methods used in the past to combat the black market and crack down on speculation should be actively maintained.

[Washington, Central News Agency, United Press, 19th] Chinese official sources here have disputed part of Rooks' statement. Zheng Bin-nan, director of the Chinese Executive Yuan's Washington office, said that Rooks' statement that China had "implied" that it wanted to sell supplies on the free market was incorrect. Zheng was supported by other Chinese officials.

### Huo Bao-shu Solemnly Refutes Rumors

[This City, Central News Agency] The United Press has published news for several days, claiming that the Chinese government would request that 200 million yuan of UNRRA relief supplies be sold at black market prices in order to obtain cash and overcome China's currency crisis. Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director Huo Bao-shu yesterday firmly denied the United Press's report and said: The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has never requested UNRRA to change the contract. It is even more impossible to say that it requested to exchange all relief supplies for sale on the market. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration absolutely denies having such a request. In the past, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had suggestions regarding the supplies that UNRRA transported to China, requesting that more suitable supplies be transported to China, but no spokesperson was heard to have said anything about the above-mentioned incident. (Note: Regarding our request to sell UNRRA supplies, President Song has already stated yesterday that there is no such thing.

### Philippine Foreign Minister Replies to Our Note, Expressing Willingness to Resume Negotiations; Unwilling to Concede on Two Points of Criticism

[Manila, United Press, 20th] Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino has replied today to the note from Chinese Envoy to the Philippines Chen Zhi-ping regarding the suspension of negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship, firmly asserting that the Philippine government is prepared to resume discussions. Regarding the two points raised in the Chinese note, attacking the Philippine government: (1) taking discriminatory actions against overseas Chinese during the negotiations; (2) revising parts of the draft that the Chinese side participating in the negotiations had already considered to have been agreed upon. Regarding the first point, Quirino said: The preferential rights of public market vendors have been granted by the government to Philippine nationals, "This is a privilege within the sovereignty of the government, a legitimate right granted to citizens of a country." The Philippine government has delayed this decree, postponing the nationalization of stalls for more than sixty years, but also stated: This action is now imperative due to the economic needs of the Filipinos, and this plan is not aimed at the people of a particular country. Regarding the second point, Quirino replied: "This is a common practice. Before an agreement is formally passed, all drafts under negotiation can be changed. The Philippine government is sincere in its negotiations and is willing to continue negotiations with this sincerity, but the Philippines cannot subordinate the interests of its people to the will of other countries." Quirino solemnly stated: "The Philippine government is extremely sincere and willing to reach a complete agreement with the Chinese government on an appropriate treaty to express the traditional friendly relations between the two countries."

### Suzhou Effectively Suppresses Rice Prices; 5,000 Yuan Lower Per Stone Per Day; With the Goal of Restoring Prices Before the Fluctuations

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Suzhou Provincial Government urgently telegraphed the Suzhou County Government on the 20th, stating that although the rice market has been calm recently, it has not yet seen a decline, and that rice merchants are intentionally waiting and seeing. It ordered the county government to suppress grain prices by 5,000 yuan per stone day by day in accordance with the Shanghai method, and to ensure that the rice market is not only lower than Shanghai, but also lower than Wuxi on a daily basis. After receiving the order, the Suzhou County Government convened an emergency meeting of the Provisional Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Grain Association at 4 pm.

### Jiangsu Province Comprehensively Plans to Make Up for the Financial Deficit

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Finance Department previously estimated that this year's expenditures would be 72 billion yuan, but tax revenue would only be 32 billion yuan, a shortfall of nearly 40 billion yuan. Moreover, the number of business expenses listed was still limited, and there were no large sums of money to subsidize poor counties and cities. The amount of the living subsidy reserve was not large, and future expenditures would be even greater if benefits were adjusted again and again. In order to remedy the situation, it was requested that the central government subsidize 24 billion yuan, but it has not yet been approved. Therefore, the deficit in the budget cannot be adjusted without comprehensive planning. The Provincial Provisional Council resolved to request the central government to return the 30% of the land tax that should be obtained to the provincial level, and to adjust the tax rate, collect legal tender, abolish the collection of actual objects and borrowing, and allocate half of the land tax collected to the province and counties, so as to make up for the financial deficit.

Editorial

### How Should the Economic Plan Be Advanced?

Complex situations must be resolved with complex means. In particular, the current economic problems, which are intricate and resemble a cluster of simultaneous illnesses, cannot be fully resolved by a simple method or plan. Such expectations are ultimately close to wishful thinking.

The Economic Emergency Measures Plan passed by the National Defense Council this time is extremely complex in content. It has clear provisions on all items such as gold, US dollars, foreign exchange, wages, prices, overseas deposits, and salaries of civil servants. In terms of nature and scope, it can be described as comprehensive and very different from the measures announced in previous resolutions. However, even with this plan, there are still many areas that should be supplemented or amended. For example, how should the buying and selling of ornamental gold be regulated? How should the implementation of rationing and the transfer of state-owned enterprises be prepared? How should the declaration of overseas deposits be effectively planned to make it effective? These are all obvious matters.

In addition to the above points, we feel that there are several key points that must be prepared immediately and implemented quickly to avoid losing the expected effect.

1. Promoting Export Goods. The most meaningful effect of this exchange rate increase is naturally to promote exports and restrict imports. However, judging from the experience of implementing export subsidies on the sixth of this month, it is very obvious that the beneficiaries are none other than hoarders who have goods in hand. Because those who are truly engaged in export are not necessarily the owners of the goods, and the farmers who directly produce and the manufacturers who process them have probably already sold them off in desperation under the pressure of high-interest loans. If they are resold again and again like kicking a ball, profiting from them, the effect of the exchange rate increase will inevitably be offset by such transfer transactions. In the short two or three days, the market price of general local goods has been rising slowly. Such profit-seeking activities cannot be effectively addressed by empty words of persuasion or forced coercion. In our view, if the real purpose is to promote exports, then the method of the public sector purchasing and then reselling them is still worthy of consideration. Moreover, this method should be implemented as soon as possible, and the opportunity must not be missed. If the price increase is too fast and completely offsets the benefits obtained from foreign exchange, then it will be impossible to start.

2. Price Control. To stabilize prices and maintain production, first stabilize wages at the level of January of this year. To stabilize life and maintain livelihoods, effectively control prices and prevent them from rising. This is naturally very well-rounded in theory and procedure. There are four measures: first, to implement quantitative distribution to workers based on the retail prices in January; second, to supply daily necessities to civil servants; third, to implement price limits on daily necessities in various places; and fourth, to implement control over general goods in accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Periods. Simply put, it is to suppress wages by stabilizing prices, and then suppress prices by restricting wages. If this chain system can be effectively implemented and not disconnected, it is naturally something that everyone deeply desires. What we are concerned about is: (1) Whether various rationed goods can be supplied on schedule and in the required quantities. We cannot but hope that the competent authorities will correct the bad habits of the past, such as shirking responsibility, perfunctory performance, profiteering, and slow pace, and strive to take on this major responsibility. (2) The control matters should be implemented effectively without being harsh or disruptive. We cannot but sincerely hope that the competent authorities will recognize their responsibilities and seek legal and reasonable ways from the painful experiences of past failures.

3. Combating Smuggling. This issue was not addressed in the emergency plan. However, the higher the exchange rate and the more difficult it is to import, the greater the profit from smuggling. The consequences are: (1) Imports still cannot be restricted; (2) A portion of the normal tariff revenue is lost; (3) The black market for US dollars cannot be eliminated; (4) A portion of remittances from overseas Chinese is offset; and (5) Legitimate import businesses become more and more unfavorable. Therefore, to achieve the effect of restricting imports, in addition to strictly reviewing foreign exchange settlements, we hope that the government will take further and effective measures to deal with smuggling.

4. Prohibition of Gold and Currency. This measure has already been seen in practice. The inspection of financial institutions and the capture of illegal buying and selling are being intensified. Jewelry stores in various places have also closed down as a result. We believe that this passive measure can easily achieve considerable results. However, people are driven by profit. What will they not do? Dealing with some petty vendors is a small matter, but how to eradicate this trend and ensure that gold and currency will indeed not cause trouble in the future is a very important matter. Because the mortgage of gold is still regarded as legal today, it has attracted the attention of the world, and rent, warehouse fees, and salaries have always been paid in US dollars. Whether this type of illegal transfer can be completely stopped in the future depends on the determination of the authorities.

Mencius said: "Mere goodness is not sufficient for government, and mere laws cannot carry themselves into effect." To make the entire economic plan truly effective and to prevent it from causing harm, the key lies entirely in personnel. Some people suspect that the efficiency of the administration is too low and may not be able to handle such complex economic affairs. This is not without reason. However, as society evolves, the economic component contained in politics increases. In extraordinary times, it is indeed necessary to adopt the above measures, and even in times of peace, it is impossible to return to non-interference and complete laissez-faire. Therefore, the preconditions for promoting economic policies, namely personnel and organization, are only those that the government hopes to pay close attention to and strive to improve in order to cooperate with this unprecedented economic plan.

### The Soviet Union Suddenly Agrees to International Supervision of Atomic Energy Plants: Gromyko's Surprising Statement Deserves Great Attention

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Before the Security Council resumed its discussion on atomic energy control today, Soviet Representative Gromyko claimed that the Soviet Union would allow international organizations to supervise and manage Soviet atomic energy manufacturing plants at any time. Gromyko had previously proposed amendments to the US plan, limiting monitoring to manufacturing plants that existed at the time of signing a world atomic energy treaty. The United Nations is optimistic about Gromyko's statement, believing that the US and the Soviet Union are gradually approaching this issue. At the same time, it is reported that the United States' largest atomic research laboratory, covering more than 3,600 acres, will be built southwest of Chicago in Illinois, with millions of US dollars in funding. It is named the "Argonne National Laboratory" and managed by the University of Chicago, but this is only one of several atomic laboratories planned to be established.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Thomas, the Deputy Director of a certain US atomic test plant, declared today at the Senate Atomic Energy Committee that the basic principles of manufacturing atomic bombs have long been known by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France. Geologists should first go to the Soviet Union to determine the importance of sodium and thorium mines in its territory.

### Wavell's Removal Approved, Mountbatten Appointed Indian Viceroy: Rumors of UK-India Defense Alliance, UK Announces Power Transfer to Indians Before Next Summer

[Our Newspaper] London, 20th Broadcast: Attlee declared in the House of Commons that the British government would transfer power to the Indians as late as June 1948.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: After British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, met with Secretary of State Marshall for 35 minutes, he told reporters that Indian Viceroy Wavell had resigned and that Mountbatten would succeed him.

[United Press, London, 20th] According to authoritative sources, the British government has telegraphed Indian Viceroy Wavell to return home. Prime Minister Attlee is preparing to make an important statement in the House of Commons at 4:15 this afternoon, announcing the progress of India towards freedom and independence. According to some sources, it is possible that Britain will withdraw from India within a specified period, with a maximum period of one year. If British forces are determined to withdraw within a certain period, the Indian issue will be left to the Indians to resolve themselves. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, hundreds of British officials and thousands of other personnel are preparing to return home next month.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 20th] It is rumored that Marshal Mountbatten will replace Wavell as Indian Viceroy. Observers say that when Viceroy Wavell took office, the military situation was critical. Now that the situation has changed, there is reason to replace him with a new person.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] It is learned that Marshal Mountbatten will replace Wavell as Indian Viceroy, and that British troops in India are scheduled to withdraw in June 1948. Mountbatten's mission in the future will be to ensure that India remains a member of the British Commonwealth or at least forms a close military alliance with Britain. Britain will demand two points from India: (1) British troops have the right to control a port in India, preferably Karachi, without the need for further negotiations. (2) Establish an army with the special mission of defending the northwest and northeast borders, as they are vulnerable to attack.

### France and Poland Sign Cultural Agreement, Alliance Negotiations to Begin Soon

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Since France and Poland signed a cultural agreement this morning, it has been learned from well-informed sources that all signs are sufficient to prove that the friendly relations between France and Poland will be further strengthened and will not stop there. The two sides will soon revise the 1921 treaty and re-establish a political agreement, which is quite possible.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] It was recently announced here that France will negotiate an alliance treaty with Poland in accordance with the British-Soviet alliance treaty. Negotiations for France to conclude a similar alliance treaty with the Czech Republic are already underway. The goal of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to conclude alliances with Germany's neighboring countries to prevent Germany from re-invading.

### UK-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations, Soviet Union Proposes Preconditions, Bevin Expresses Acceptance of This Proposal

### Draft of British-French Alliance Treaty, Differences in the Positions of the Two Countries

French Opinion is More Realistic

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources say that the draft of the alliance treaty between Britain and France differs greatly in the proposal for taking joint action to resist Germany's future aggression. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying the British draft. It is said that the British draft states that the two countries will only take joint military action against Germany when an act of aggression is discovered, while the French draft proposes that joint action be taken as soon as a threat of aggression is discovered. The former is based on the wording of the British-Soviet alliance treaty, while the latter uses the wording of the French-Soviet alliance treaty. The French-Soviet alliance treaty stipulates that action can be taken if necessary before aggression becomes a fait accompli. The French side believes that this provision is more realistic. The French pointed out that Hitler's invasion of the Rhineland in 1936, if Britain and France had taken joint action at that time, the outbreak of the European War might have been avoided. It is expected that the French government will firmly demand this point in the British-French alliance treaty negotiations.

### Soviet Representative Insists on Four Powers Dominating Peace Conference, Opposing Equal Negotiations for Small Nations; Foreign Vice-Ministers' Meeting Ends on the 25th of This Month

[French News Agency, London, 20th] Regarding the issue of allowing small nations to participate in discussions on the German peace treaty, the representatives of France and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce debate at yesterday's Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting. The distance between their opinions seems to have grown even further than before. French representative M. Mueville stated, "Allied soldiers and civilians sacrificed millions of lives for a common goal. If the Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting decides not to communicate reports to them, it will make them extremely embarrassed. This action is truly arrogant." Soviet representative Gusev immediately retorted, "Millions of Soviet soldiers are also buried in Europe. Who knows what they would think of the demands of certain governments? I really don't want to think about it anymore." The Soviet representative then rejected three other proposals, believing they would confuse the situation and turn the four-nation meeting into a plenary session. At this point, Mueville suggested that the Soviet Union's views should be revised, but Gusev remained unchanged, insisting on the principle of hierarchy, opposing equal negotiations, and advocating that the four powers should absolutely dominate everything. It is reported that this morning's Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting will further discuss the matter based on the French proposal.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers on the German question decided today to conclude its work on February 25th. They hope that the report on the views of small countries will be passed on Monday. The report on the procedures will be passed on Tuesday. At today's meeting, the representatives decided to establish a committee to maintain communication between the foreign ministers' meeting and the small countries. The Soviet Union's procedural draft calls it the Standing Committee, while the other three countries' drafts call it the Advisory and Information Committee. As to whether the eighteen small countries and the four powers should be members of the committee at the same time, a decision could not be reached and it must be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion.

### Corfu Channel Incident: Albania Submits a Defense, Counter-Accusing Britain of Violating Sovereignty

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] Albanian representative Capo today refuted Britain's accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel in the Security Council and counter-accused British warships of violating its territorial waters. Capo stated, "I resolutely deny this accusation. Britain has brazenly violated its territorial waters. The British warships entering the strait near the Albanian coast constitutes provocation and intimidation." During Capo's nearly two-hour speech, Soviet representative Gromyko immediately stood up to defend Albania and engaged in a verbal battle with British representative Jebb. The meeting adjourned during the debate and is scheduled to reopen on the 21st.

Our Consul General Yuan then inspected the Overseas Chinese district on the morning of the 18th and consulted with the French army on maintaining law and order, transporting food, and supplying water.

### Truman Recommends to Congress to Abolish Wartime Emergency Law

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] President Truman today requested Congress to abolish or amend approximately 100 temporary laws promulgated under the state of emergency. The President's message to Congress stated: The progress of the reconstruction work has enabled the American economy to gradually lift the shackles of wartime control. I hereby request Congress to abolish certain emergency decrees implemented after 1939, as well as the national emergency declared by President Roosevelt in 1941. I have ordered all government departments to stop exercising the powers granted by the emergency decrees. If this proposal is accepted, it will help the national economy get rid of wartime control and end the wartime emergency as soon as possible. I have continued to study the issue of terminating the emergency states declared in 1939 and 1941, and I plan to take action as soon as the environment permits. President Truman's action is the second step in repealing wartime legislation and is welcomed by all departments of Congress. The President announced the end of the state of war on December 31st last year. He stated at the time that the national emergency had not ended, which was his first step in repealing the emergency state. Today's action by the President is his second step. The next stage is often for the President to formally announce the end of the national emergency declared by the late President Roosevelt in 1939 and 1941. The final stage is to formally announce the end of the state of war.

### Municipal Government Financial Revenue Budget Can Increase by 23.2 Billion This Year; Budget Committee of the City Council Held a Meeting Yesterday; Resolution to Confirm Awaits Public Decision by the General Assembly

[This newspaper] The Budget Committee of the City Council, considering that the second session of the General Assembly is about to expire and the municipal government budget for the 36th year needs to be determined urgently, held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. First, it confirmed the various financial revenue items in preparation for submitting them to the General Assembly for enactment. In addition to the Budget Committee Senators Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Cheng and other twelve people, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan, Chief Accountant Min Xiangfan, and the section chiefs of various departments of the Finance Bureau attended the meeting to report. He Yuanming served as chairman of the meeting.

As a result of the discussion, the budget was increased by 33.1 billion and reduced by 9.9 billion, resulting in a net increase of 23.2 billion yuan. The resolved increases and decreases in tax revenue include:

(1) Land Tax: The municipal government originally budgeted 569 million. Now, the Budget Committee has requested the financial authorities to work hard to collect the tax effectively, and it is hoped that it can be increased by 50 percent, so that a total of more than 850 million yuan can be collected.

(2) Business Tax: It was originally determined to collect 40 billion yuan annually, of which this city should receive 70 percent, or 28 billion. It is now decided to temporarily add 40 billion, so the budget is 56 billion. The collection targets for this revenue recovery total 60,073 households.

(3) House Tax: The Finance Bureau estimates that 25 percent of the houses in Shanghai are used for business and 75 percent are used for residential purposes. However, the Budget Committee believes that this estimate is not entirely accurate and should be calculated based on 40 percent for business use and 60 percent for residential use. As for the rent, citizens may underreport. It is now tentatively decided to increase it by 50 percent, so that it can be increased to 2.7 billion based on the original 1.8 billion.

(4) Slaughter Tax: The original budget was 9.6 billion. The committee originally planned to increase it by 50 percent. However, due to the recent soaring prices and the obvious decrease in the number of citizens eating meat, the slaughterhouses slaughter pigs every day, previously at least 400, but now only 200. However, because the collection standard has increased slightly, it was decided to increase it by 25 percent, to 12 billion.

(5) Business License Tax: Approximately 30,000 households are currently being collected. This can be increased to 50,000 households. However, the central government has changed the tax rate to 3 per thousand, so the budget remains unchanged at 900 million.

(6) Usage License Tax: The original amount was 3.6 billion. Now, because the central government stipulates that the maximum collection for privately owned vehicles is 30,000 yuan, and the maximum collection for commercial vehicles is 50,000 yuan, the budget is reduced by one-fourth, which is 2.7 billion.

(7) Feast Tax: The original amount was 24 billion. Now, because the tax rate has been reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent, the budget is reduced by 4.8 billion, for a total of 19.2 billion.

(8) Hotel Tax: The original amount was 8.4 billion. Now, because the tax rate has been reduced, the budget is reduced by one-half, which is 4.2 billion.

(9) Entertainment Tax: Increase the original budget of 26.2 billion by 1 billion, for a total of 27.2 billion.

(10) Wharf Tax: Maintain the original budget of 3 billion.

(11) Inheritance Tax: The central government has decided to do its best to rectify it, so increase the original amount of 127 million yuan by one time, for a total of 255 million yuan.

(12) Public Property Rent: Maintain the original amount of more than 240 billion yuan and add a stall rent item of 300 million yuan.

### Focus on Fighting Tigers, Not Swatting Flies; Avoid Harassing Legitimate Businesses; Head of Supervisory Group Indicates Two Principles at Staff Meeting

[This newspaper] The staff of the Economic Supervisory Group held a meeting at the police headquarters office yesterday morning at 10 a.m. The head of the group, Xuan Tiewu, indicated two principles: (1) The Supervisory Group is ordered to thoroughly investigate this gold rush. It must start from the big picture, secretly investigate and strictly deal with large households that stir up trouble and engage in speculative manipulation. Legitimate businesses should be avoided from harassment, and other small households will be dealt with on a discretionary basis, adhering to the principle of "fighting tigers, not swatting flies." (2) The task of the Supervisory Group is not only to thoroughly investigate the gold and banknote price surge in the city after February 1st, but also to be responsible for implementing the economic emergency measures promulgated by the central government to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood. Therefore, any illegal acts related to social economy are within the scope of the Supervisory Group's investigation and handling. It is hoped that all working comrades will work hard.

[In addition news] The three-person team organized by the Gold and Banknote Group of the Economic Supervisory Group and the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices is still investigating the accounts of banks and money shops these days. Yesterday, in the Gold and Banknote Group office of the police station, work continued until late at night. The black list of suspected manipulators and speculators is gradually being compiled. This black list will be submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval after the investigation is completed. Yesterday, several money shops and banks closed down and stopped operating, claiming to the investigators that the manager had gone elsewhere and refusing to hand over the account books. The Supervisory Group has ordered that anyone who encounters this situation can be detained. Also, although the free trading of gold has been banned, the government has not made any explicit regulations on the disposal of gold stored by businesses and individuals. Speculative big players who have bought large amounts of gold are bound to be unwilling to sell it to the Central Bank at the legal price and will seek illegal ways out. The Supervisory Group recently discovered that a gold shop was melting large bars into small pieces. It is even more difficult to guarantee that there will be no black market. The Supervisory Group has few people and cannot see and hear everything, and feels very棘手. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the Gold and Banknote Group, has signed a report to the Supervisory Leader Xuan yesterday to submit it to the government, and plans to request a clear regulation on how to deal with the gold that the people have already purchased.

Prosecutor Liang Gengsheng filed a public prosecution against him in accordance with Article 29 (instigation) and Article 271 (murder) of the Criminal Law and sent it to the District Xiaoxun Office for handling.

### Coffins Have a Wonderful Use: Hiding Drugs Inside; Boss and Partner Arrested Together

[Our Reporter] Wang Bingyan, the leader of the Yijing Penglai Brigade of the Righteous Volunteer Corps, and his team members patrolled the Nanshi jurisdiction on the morning of the 18th. Passing by Maojia Lane, they saw someone smoking opium in a shantytown. They immediately arrested the opium addict and brought him to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, his name was Chen Linyi, also known as "Coffin Board." The opium he smoked was bought from Zhu Gengen at No. 12, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street, Dainanmen. Police were dispatched to the address, and Zhu was arrested. He confessed that he sold drugs, all of which he obtained from Zhu Youfu (18 years old), a clerk at the Hongchang Coffin Shop at No. 28, Qiujia Lane, Nanchang Street.

### Anonymous Accusation Against Hospital Director: Stealing and Selling Milk; All Nurses Called for Questioning Claim Ignorance

[Our Reporter] Cai Baotian, the director of general affairs at the Police Hospital on Huade Road in this city, was recently anonymously accused by "all the nurses" to the police station, alleging that Cai had embezzled 5,000 cans (more than 200 boxes) of milk allocated to the hospital by the headquarters and other materials. However, after investigation by the police station, all the nurses in the hospital denied the accusation, and there was no solid evidence that the milk was stolen. Although the police station could not ascertain the inside story of the case for the time being, if the anonymous accusation was true, the case would be major, and the accused Cai Baotian had already resigned. Although it was impossible to know whether the reason for his resignation was related to the case, it was still worth investigating. Therefore, the entire case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. The prosecutor specially summoned more than a dozen female nurses from the hospital, including Chen Zongzhen, Hu Limin, Shen Weizhen, Lu Fudao, and Wang Zhangzhu, for questioning. All of them stated that they knew nothing about the accusation against Cai Baotian. All the summoned people were ordered to return, and another investigation was launched.

### Liang Renda Met With Misfortune: Mayor Wu Deeply Mourned; Personally Visited Liang's Family Yesterday; Decided to Assist With Life and Education

[Our Reporter] Yang Ruijun, the righteous brother of Liang Renda, who was killed in the Quan Gong Building incident, visited Mayor Wu at the City Government at 11 o'clock yesterday morning to discuss Liang's funeral arrangements. Mayor Wu said that he wanted to discuss this issue with Liang's family, so he accompanied Zhang Peter, the chief of the Public Relations Section, to the Yongle New Village on Beisha Wujiang Road to visit Liang Renda's family. When Mayor Wu arrived, only Liang's aunt and wife were at home. They expressed their extreme gratitude for Mayor Wu's personal visit.

Fundraising; Joint Custody

Mayor Wu said: "Mr. Liang Renda was killed in the Quan Gong Building incident, and I am deeply saddened. I have now instructed the Police Bureau to step up the pursuit of the murderer. At the same time, I have ordered the court to work hard, and I believe that the truth will soon come to light. Please rest assured." "What I am most concerned about now is that Mrs. Liang is already pregnant, and the future life and education expenses of the orphans must be taken care of by the City Government. According to my intention, I hope that at least 100 million yuan can be raised. The method of fundraising will be collective donations. Although the market in Shanghai is currently sluggish, fundraising may be difficult. However, I am determined to find a way to raise funds. The funds raised can be used to establish a custody committee, with Mr. Guo Lingshuang, General Manager of Wing On Company, as the chairman, and one representative from the City Government and Liang's family will jointly manage it. As for the use of the donations, Mrs. Liang has the right to decide."

Funeral Arrangements; Should Be Simple

Regarding Liang's funeral arrangements, I believe that we should strive for simplicity. The family can handle it themselves. In addition, the City Government will hold a public memorial ceremony, and representatives from various groups will be invited to participate in it to express their condolences. However, we must not expand it to the point of involving political issues, which will not only affect public security, but also hinder fundraising. Wu said at the end: "The dead are gone, and we must help the living to comfort the soul of the deceased. Therefore, Mrs. Liang must take good care of herself and leave an heir for the deceased. If she feels unwell due to stimulation, I can find a way to contact the hospital."

Finally, Mrs. Liang expressed two wishes: (1) Please punish the murderer severely, and (2) Liang Renda's tomb should be surveyed and determined. Mayor Wu said that he would definitely be able to do it. Wu left at 12:30.

### Zang Daerzi Case: Lai Lingnai Sentenced; Instigated Injury Resulting in Death; Sentenced to One Year and Nine Months; Defendant Expressed Disagreement in Court

[Our Reporter] In the Zang Daerzi case, the Spanish sailor Lai Lingnai was prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of instigating injury resulting in death. After repeated trials by the court, the debate was concluded on the 14th of this month. The sentence was announced in the Criminal Division 8 of the court at 2 p.m. yesterday. American Vice Consul Wei Li and legal advisor Frankt were present in court. After Judge Wu Ronglin took the stand, he brought the defendant Lai Lingnai to court and read the judgment: "Lai Lingnai is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment for instigating injury resulting in death." The judgment stated: "The defendant Lai Lingnai was slightly drunk after drinking, which led to a misunderstanding and accidentally violated the law. His criminal circumstances are still pitiful and excusable. According to law, the original sentence should be reduced by one-half, and because his crime was committed before December 31, 1946, it is in accordance with the provisions of the Great Amnesty and Commutation of Sentence and should be reduced by one-half again, and he is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment." It was also found that the principal offender, Rao Delike, is an active-duty American naval officer stationed in Shanghai. In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulations for the Handling of Criminal Cases Involving American Military Personnel in China, he has been tried by the American Military Court in Shanghai. The defendant expressed his disagreement in court and will appeal to the High Court.

### This Newspaper Promotes Free Midwifery Movement; Many Applicants Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Generously

In recent years, the population of Shanghai has been increasing continuously, exceeding four million, and at the same time, the birth rate has also greatly increased. Every day in this huge city, countless mothers give their children new life. These new lives will become the masters of the country in the future, and they will shoulder the great mission of continuing the nation and creating the future. But unfortunately, many babies end their short lives when or before they leave their mothers, and even more pitiful mothers lose their health or sacrifice their lives forever for the sake of the new generation! We express our infinite sympathy for these unfortunate people, and we also want to provide assistance, but our strength is so weak that we can only cry out for them, hoping to get the sympathy and assistance of the vast population.

Countless pregnant mothers may be in extremely difficult circumstances. They cannot get enough rest, and they cannot get reasonable medical treatment. When they give birth, they do not have scientific methods to help them deliver. Under various unreasonable attacks, they lose their lives, and perhaps at the same time destroy the new generation. Although we have already launched the poor women's midwifery movement with the Renhe Hospital, its foundation still needs the support and encouragement of the readers of this newspaper and people from all walks of life to consolidate it.

(According to the free midwifery service, which began on the 14th of this month, eight applications have been approved, and their names are listed below: (1) Zhang Zhu's, (2) Zhang Chenxing, (3) Yao Feiyun, (4) Li Xiufang, (5) Wang Zhendong, (6) Mo Zhenqiu, (7) Yang Aying, (8) Man Yunxian. The above eight people have gone to the hospital to await delivery. Donations can be sent to the Shenbao Social Service Department.)

### US Ambassador Writes to Soviet Foreign Minister: Discussing US-Soviet Cultural Exchange; Requests Response to Nine Important Suggestions

[US News Agency Washington, 9th] The State Department has just released the contents of a letter from US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In the letter, Smith reiterated the US side's Fang Gan suggestions on cultural exchange between the two countries. The letter, dated February 3, was delivered to Moscow newspapers by Smith on Tuesday. The letter requests the Soviet Union to respond to several suggestions for cultural cooperation transmitted by the US Embassy. However, the Soviet Union's final reply has not yet been received. The full text of the letter is as follows: "Recently, it was reported that Marshal Stalin, when meeting with Roosevelt Jr., solemnly stated that he approved of the exchange of cultural and scientific information between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the exchange of students, artists, scientists, and professors. I am extremely gratified by this matter, because I have always been an advocate of this kind of exchange, as you know. This kind of exchange is sufficient to expand the basis of contact so that the people of your and our countries can understand each other's cultural life and goals. Recently, we have made some progress in this regard, especially in the exchange of cultural and scientific publications, but there is still much to be done in terms of the overall plan. After hearing Marshal Stalin's remarks, I was greatly encouraged, and I would like to draw your attention to several suggestions regarding the aforementioned exchange. These suggestions have been submitted to the US Embassy by various agencies and groups in the United States and are now awaiting your consent for implementation. The most important of these are as follows:

Exchange of Scientists; Focus on Medicine

(1) When the delegation of the Soviet War Relief Office visited the United States last August, Dr. Yang Ge suggested that a fully equipped penicillin factory be provided for the Soviet Union's convenience, and at the same time suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union exchange scientists, especially those in the field of medicine. Dr. Yang had discussed this matter with the Soviet Ministry of Health, but as of now, his suggestion has not yet received a response.

Please Have Soviet Graduate Students; Go to the United States to Teach Russian

(2) In July 1946, Mr. Zhai Pu and Dr. Rowan of the US Department of Commerce consulted with their Department of Higher Education when they visited the Soviet Union, discussing Cornell University's request to invite four Soviet graduate students to the United States to engage in post-graduate work and teach some Russian language courses. The US side did not insist on sending American students to study in the Soviet Union as an exchange condition. At that time, I had a thorough expression to the Soviet Department of Higher Education on this matter. At that time, I had the impression that the department was willing to accept this suggestion, but because the start of the fall semester was extremely imminent, we were unable to take any further concrete measures with the department. The plan was abandoned in November. A deputy director of the department, Mr. Sama Lin, recently wrote to me (letter dated January 29), saying that the department welcomed the embassy's suggestion, but it would be difficult to implement this suggestion during this academic year (1946-47). I very much hope that this item will be reconsidered and accepted when the spring semester arrives.

American Geologists; Willing to Conduct Joint Research

(3) Professor Flynn of Yale University is very eager to conduct field research with Soviet geologists and consult with them on the geological characteristics of the Soviet Union's alluvial period. Dr. Flynn's request and self-consideration letter were sent to the President of the Soviet Science School on December 16, 1946. Since he is an authoritative American geologist, I sincerely hope that his request will be approved.

The United States Advocates Setting Up; Scholarships for Soviet Female Students

(4) In the summer of 1946, Mrs. Diekinson, Chairman of the US Women's Club Federation, came here at the invitation of the Soviet side to inspect Soviet post-war work and study Soviet welfare plans. She set up a scholarship for Soviet female students studying abroad in the name of the General Federation. I believe that the number of scholarships can be increased. Mrs. Diekinson subsequently received a notice saying that the suggestion to set up a scholarship was not accepted. I hereby suggest reconsidering this matter, as it is clearly in line with the principles of expanding education and cultural contact.

Invite Soviet Song and Dance Troupes; To Participate in American Dance Party

(5) I recently forwarded to Vox a letter of invitation from American dance manager Herlock, inviting Soviet song and dance troupes to participate in the International Dance Party to be held at the New York Capital Theater in the spring of 1947, and to tour the United States after the Spring Festival. This matter is currently being discussed with Vox, but there is no concrete development yet. As you know, I greatly admire Russian song and dance, and I can assure you that Soviet song and dance troupes will be extremely popular in the United States. The participation of the song and dance troupe in the International Dance Party will have excellent results. I sincerely hope that this invitation can be accepted.

American Doctors Visit the Soviet Union; Request Soviet Permission

(6) I recently received a request from the United States, signed by the Chief Medical Officer of the Public Health Service, requesting permission for three American doctors, Huoqijia, Ximjin, and Hill, to visit the Soviet Union to study methods of treating cancer. The development of Doctors Roskin and Kliuva and other famous Soviet medical scientists in the research of cancer has aroused the greatest interest in the United States. I myself have met with Doctors Roskin and Kliuva and other members of the Soviet Medical Research Association, and I have been impressed that their recent contributions to the human struggle against cancer may have a great effect. If the United States' request can be approved as soon as possible, the people and the government will be very grateful.

American University Anniversary; Invite Soviet Scholars

(7) In February 1946, Dr. Du Zi, President of Princeton University, invited several famous Soviet scholars, including Professors Kabisa, Landau, and Daivilov, to participate in the university's 200th anniversary celebration through the Soviet Embassy in Washington. At the same time, the Rockefeller Foundation also sent invitations to Professors Vinogradov and Gutlierale. Although Princeton University's 200th anniversary has passed, I know for sure that if the Soviet government expresses its willingness to accept, they will be invited to the United States again.

American Symphony Orchestra; Invite Soviet Musicians

(8) In March 1946, the embassy forwarded to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs an invitation from Mr. Keiper, the leader of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Kai invited Mr. Marvinsky, the conductor of the Leningrad Orchestra, to the United States as a guest of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, from October 21 to November 4, 1946, or from December 16 to December 30. This invitation has not yet been answered, and the repeatedly postponed dates have also passed. However, the orchestra has told me that if the Soviet government has the intention to encourage musicians to accept the invitation, the orchestra will be willing to send out an invitation again.

Boston Orchestra; Plans to Go to the Soviet Union to Perform

(9) In June 1946, the embassy forwarded a letter from Mr. Kossevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The letter suggested that the orchestra be allowed to travel to the Soviet Union at its own expense to perform, stay for two weeks, and said that all ticket revenue would be donated to local public welfare organizations according to the Soviet side's instructions. The orchestra said that the Soviet Union had made great cooperation with the United States during the war, and hoped to express its gratitude. The embassy's letter was also unanswered. At the same time, given that the date proposed by the orchestra for visiting the Soviet Union (September 1946) was approaching, the ambassador sent another letter to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 2, asking how to respond to the change. However, no response has been received to date. If the Soviet side now intends to accept this suggestion, I am always happy to pass this news on to the orchestra so that it can reconsider the previous proposal.

I sincerely hope that you can express your opinions on the above suggestions, (especially on any further measures that this embassy can take for the important work of cultural and scientific exchange), and I would be grateful if you would allow it."

### Qian Dui Industry Members' Meeting; Requests Central Bank to Approve Deposit and Loan Business

[Our Newspaper Report] The Money Exchange Commercial Association held a general meeting of all members yesterday at 3:00 PM at the association's headquarters. 215 industry representatives attended, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM. At the beginning of the meeting, Wang Yuncheng, Chairman of the association, delivered a speech, stating that the government has promulgated new emergency economic measures to stabilize the domestic economy and finance. The industry should earnestly implement and support the national policy. However, it is also hoped that the industry can find a way out under the new plan. Before the war, the industry also engaged in small deposit and loan businesses. After the City Government announced the three measures for buying and selling US dollars on October 4 last year, the industry found it difficult to maintain its business. It had requested the Central Bank to allow it to engage in small deposit and loan businesses, but has not yet received a response. During yesterday's meeting, seven measures were immediately passed and recommended to the Central Bank: (1) Adjust the capital of Qian Dui companies to a considerable amount. (2) All companies that have obtained the Central Bank's Class A license to operate in foreign currency trading can also engage in small deposit and loan businesses. (3) To prevent the replacement of licenses, the important staff of each store shall not be changed. (4) Adopt a uniform accounting system for the silver and money industry for uniformity and to facilitate inspection by the authorities. (5) All deposits should also pay deposit reserve to the Central Bank in accordance with the general silver and money industry regulations to comply with financial laws. (6) All company names should be changed to the name of Qianzhuang. (7) The above points will be implemented immediately upon approval by the Central Bank. According to the industry, the industry's request to engage in small deposit and loan businesses is to maintain its own business, and because the industry has frequent contact with small industrial and commercial businesses, it is quite convenient to handle the business. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to send Chairman Zai Yuncheng, Standing Director Liu Xichen, Li Lansheng, and others to visit Mayor Wu, City Council Speaker Pan, Finance Director Xu Baiyuan, Central Bank Governor Bei, and the City Chamber of Commerce today to present the difficulties.

The association's planned plate, spot medium-grain white, rebounded by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.

### Yarn Market Process: Stable and Firm

Yesterday's yarn market was extremely stable, and people's hearts were still firm. The reason is that the reserve price is already cheap, and it is quite unlikely to fall again. Due to the high cost of raw materials and the increasing expenses, in terms of cost, yarn factories have no profit to speak of. Therefore, although customer sales have been silent for a long time, the price can still stand firm. The price of 20-count ordinary yarn is about 350,000 yuan. The closing price of the Special Double Horse is similar to that of the previous day. The price of 42-count slightly decreased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The rest of the counts saw ups and downs. At present, the yarn market is still in a hovering situation.

### Cotton Cloth Declines

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were stagnant due to tight silver circulation, and both the origin and customer sides were dull. Moreover, the price cone was too high, the purchasing power was very weak, and the dyeing factories in the market had sales of fine cloth. The Spinning and Construction Company supplied and sold 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth at a price of 148,500 yuan, and the on-site price was 153,000 yuan, which caused people's hearts to be empty and soft, and floating goods were full of chips, and once fell to 148,000 yuan, but the Hankou customer group absorbed medium-grade fine cloth, and the appetite was very healthy, so the market was stable, and it was slightly lower than the previous day by 2,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan. Other Shilin cloth and colored cloth, the foot also shaped uninspired

### Tung Oil Still Lacks Transactions

[Our Report] Tung oil still lacked transactions today, and the producing areas frequently reported price increases, and the price matched the peak of exports. According to a merchant in this city, there are frequent reports from Hankou that Hong Kong has a lot of appetite. In addition, the increase in export foreign exchange stimulated the market, so the foot was very firm, and the market was short of goods, and the bid was raised higher and higher. Yesterday, the price in Hankou was close to 400,000 yuan per dan. In Hangzhou, although there were still many goods arriving from the producing areas, the price was not low, and it had already stood at the peak of 400,000 yuan. The price negotiated by the industry in this city is 450,000 yuan per dan, which is actually at the top of the export price, or even exceeds it, and no transactions have been heard in the general market. In addition, domestic tung oil, Dingxi Hongji Yingfeng, has long disappeared, and Fuxi Hong is also in short supply. It is said that only one company still has inventory, and although the goods arriving daily are not very large, small quantities arrive one after another.

### Prices of Fur Goods Rise Sharply: Jewish Merchants Search Vigorously

[Our Report] The new prices of yellow weasel skin, badger skin, white weasel skin, leopard skin, and green goatskin have risen extremely sharply, and have increased by 100% to 200% compared to before February 6. Yellow weasel skin has risen from 14,000 yuan per pair to 32,000 yuan, badger skin has risen from 8,000 yuan per piece to 15,000 yuan, white weasel skin has risen from 9,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, leopard skin has risen from 170,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and green goatskin has risen from 6,000 yuan to 13,000 yuan. The market is active, Jewish merchants are searching vigorously, and the export prospects are optimistic.

### Hog Bristles Are Quoted at Different Prices: New Price of Casings Has Not Been Negotiated

[Our Report] Yesterday, the quoted price of hog bristles, Shanghai No. 17, is still between 3 million. The hog bristles in Hankou and Chongqing, because the producing areas have not yet officially started, the quoted prices here are still different. According to people in the industry, the new price can be made in Shanghai in the coming days.

Casings: The new price is still hindered due to the different steps in the operation and purchase price among the industry.

Galls: After the new price of belly pouch and corner pouch was opened, the market price rose again today. Each dan (133 pounds) has risen to 320,000 yuan, which is completely different from 170,000 yuan per dan before February 6. The price has increased by 100%.

### Mostly Medium and Secondary Transactions: Supply and Demand of Rice and Grain Are Both Low

[Our Report] Yesterday, more than 17,900 stones of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. The supply and demand were both low, and most of the transactions were medium and secondary. High-quality materials were quite rare, and the situation became that the high prices were decisive and the prices were flat.

Edible Oil: Because the off-market price is higher than the reviewed price, there is no transaction in the market. It is heard that the off-market raw soybean oil and sesame oil have consistently fallen by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake Shantou Xiamen moved slightly, the seller is also firm, and the market is stable. Yellow Beans: Nanyang Fuzhou adopted an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was stronger by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the high cost of raw materials. Bran's actual sales were not strong, it was firm early and tired in the afternoon, and the price was reduced by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame Nanyang moved unsteadily, with little honor or disgrace. Raw Peanut Hong Kong Nanyang moved to handle, drying and roasting, rising step by step, and continued to rise by 15,000 to 6,000 yuan. Mung beans arrived and sold indifferently, and the price was flat. The same is true for adzuki beans, which are both rare, and the market is mediocre. Broad beans have a fixed price, and Renliang has no fluctuations for the time being. Corn is dull and lacks vitality, and the market is downstream, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sweet potato dried goods are arriving more and more, gradually declining, and falling again by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Cotton cake is firm with the increase in fuel prices. Wheat is scarce and firm.

### Tea Export Business Association: Discuss Export Methods: Resolved to Continue to Ask the Government to Buy at a Price

[Our Report] The Shanghai Tea Export Business Association held a temporary member meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to promote the export of Chinese tea in the 35th year. More than 70 member representatives attended, chaired by Chairman Tang Jisan. The discussion was dismissed at about 6:00 p.m., and the results were decided on three points: (2) The tea collected last year is still requested by the government to purchase. The central purchase price of various teas is 1,188,000 yuan per dan for Qimen red, 950,000 yuan per group for Chen green, and 670,000 yuan for Ping green. It is also required that the purchase period should not exceed two months at most. (2) Organize a tea export promotion committee. If the government decides to purchase, it will assist the government in promoting exports. Otherwise, it will find its own way to export. (3) If the government does not agree to purchase, it is hoped that the original loan from the Farmers Bank can be extended for another three to six months. At the same time, it is requested to increase the loan by 40% according to the original loan amount in order to offset the export expenses.

### A Batch of Green Tea Transactions

The tea market, which had been silent for many days, still did not see any brightness yesterday morning. After this, some green teas, such as Chouzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei, which were loved by French Africa, had a heated consultation between Wu Chang Tea Company and foreign firms such as Xiehe and Tongfu, and the cargo party, and more than 1,000 boxes of new tea in the 35th year were officially agreed upon. In terms of price, Tuzhuang Tunxi Zhenmei jumped to 600,000 yuan per dan, and Wenzhou Zhenmei Jin Kou 450,000 yuan per dan. If Wenzhou needle eyebrow, from 220,000 to 270,000 yuan, Wenzhou deputy show eyebrow also reached 180,000 yuan, the market atmosphere was unanimously excited. As for Qimen black tea, which is watched by British export companies, the market still only has bidding prices due to unsuccessful negotiations. Other varieties are still extremely quiet.

### Cotton Yarn Purchase Price: Still Calculated According to Production Cost

[Our Report] The 25th regular meeting of the Spinning Management Committee was held in the City Government Conference Room at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, and the meeting was adjourned until 5:30 p.m. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Increase the price of two types of 34-count and 42-count three-strand yarn. The former price is 3,100,200 yuan, and the latter price is 4,216,000 yuan. (2) The purchase of cotton yarn shall be based on large packages. Factories that are not equipped with large packages shall not use grass bags instead. (3) Regarding the agreement on the purchase price of yarn, the Six District Cotton Spinning Association provided four methods, and it was decided that it should still be calculated according to the actual production cost. The new purchase price will be calculated by the Spinning Management Committee and submitted to Committee Member Wu for approval at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and it is expected to be announced and implemented tomorrow.

### Bituminous Coal Market Declines: Anthracite Coal Sales Are Still Active

The anthracite coal market is still active due to seasonal factors, and because there are not many arrivals, the market price continues to stand at a high peak. The bituminous coal has gradually been distributed to private factories for use as allocated coal. The spot goods in the market have also loosened, and the market has seen frequent declines, and the buyers are still lacking, and there is fear of a further softening trend.

New Medicine and New Drugs Edited by Shanghai Medical Association First Issue of Revival

### Our Stance

— Liang Junqing

Generally, whenever a publication is launched, there is always an opening statement declaring their work's direction and scope. Our supplement is a weekly publication hosted by the Shanghai Medical Association. It is also the only channel for connecting all Shanghai physicians and the readers of this newspaper. Therefore, the mission of this supplement is quite significant and arduous. We are well aware of the importance of this responsibility and the weakness of our own abilities. Therefore, we take this opportunity of the supplement's relaunch to briefly state the direction and scope of the journal's work in the future. On the one hand, we hope that our colleagues in the journal will have something to follow. On the other hand, we also hope that colleagues in this city can cooperate sincerely to jointly complete this great mission. If the authorities of this city and the readers of this newspaper can give us instructions and assistance from time to time, that would be what we sincerely expect and are extremely grateful for.

(1) We want to become a medical journal for readers: Most people who read newspapers are not interested in medical supplements because those publications are mostly too specialized, often causing headaches and making it impossible to finish reading them. Moreover, those publications are sometimes so dry and boring, simply like teachers lecturing students. Therefore, many people say that these publications are specifically for doctors themselves, not for us ordinary readers. Our colleagues in this journal are facing this reality squarely, so we are trying our best to avoid this shortcoming. We want to use a light and clear style to describe or explain various issues in both "medicine" and "pharmacy", so that everyone who reads this journal can understand it and get practical benefits, becoming a publication that every reader wants to read, instead of a publication specifically written for doctors themselves. Although this work is not easy, we are confident that we will be able to strive to do our best.

(2) Reporting new methods and new experiences in "medicine" and "pharmacy": I can honestly and bluntly say, "Not only is it difficult for readers to know about new medical methods and experiences, but ordinary doctors often don't have the opportunity to know due to busy schedules or other personnel matters." Although this statement may seem a bit excessive, it is actually true. Because in schools, there are professors to ask, and in hospitals, there are directors and the like to consult. But in private clinics, if one sticks to old ways, it is truly ignorant and pitiful. Let's think about it: science is changing with each passing day. If you don't follow the trend, you will fall behind and be eliminated. Some doctors sit in their clinics waiting for patients, not knowing how to contact colleagues to exchange new knowledge, not knowing how to subscribe to domestic and foreign medical publications. After a long time, how can they not become ignorant doctors? Moreover, current medicine is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and we certainly do not have much time to read medical journals from our own country and Europe and the United States. Therefore, if this journal can gather the strength of the entire Medical Association and faithfully report new medicine both at home and abroad, then not only will readers benefit, but it will also be welcomed by colleagues.

(3) Faithfully introduce or comment on new medical methods and new drugs on the market: We Chinese people have always had a bad habit of blindly believing in newly released drugs or newly practiced medical methods. This undiscriminating approach is most dangerous for patients. Because our country, since the Anti-Japanese War, has seen social morality decline to the extreme. Many unscrupulous merchants often take advantage of the Chinese people's weakness of "grasping at straws when sick" to invent names and sell some new drugs to swindle money. This is not only directly harmful to patients, but it can also indirectly cause the general public to lose faith in new medicine. This journal sees this point, so it hopes to faithfully introduce or criticize those currently new drugs on the market or recently popular medical methods.

(4) Assisting the health authorities with health facilities: We all cannot deny that the current health facilities are not yet perfect. For example, for the issue of epidemic prevention, the issue of garbage disposal, the issue of isolation of infectious diseases, and the issue of relief for the poor and sick, etc., we feel that there are still many areas that need to be improved. From the standpoint of being in the field, although it is not convenient to criticize the facilities of the health administration, we may also have insights that their health authorities cannot see. If we can publish our views in this journal and contribute to health facilities, wouldn't that be a better thing? Therefore, this journal also hopes to do its part in this area.

(5) Answering various difficult questions about medicine for readers: From the "Life and Health" supplement of the Current Affairs News fourteen years ago to the present, I have been the question answerer for medical affairs in many publications. I know deeply the heavy and difficult of this work. I can say very frankly: I failed in this respect, and I am very sorry to the readers who wrote to inquire. This is not because I can't answer or don't answer well, it is really because too many people come to inquire, not only asking questions endlessly and annoyingly, but also repeating them very much, causing my enthusiasm to gradually wane, and as a result, all the letters piled up (recently, the editor of the medical journal of Dagongbao also sighed about this), which not only betrayed the expectations of the readers, but also went against our original intention. What is the point of this? So I said I failed. I also went to see other people's answers, and it was difficult to satisfy people, either the answers were irrelevant, or the answers were too simple. What benefit is this to the readers? Some people are always playing their own calculations, desperately pulling patients to their own clinics, which is even more contrary to the original intention, and we don't bother to mention it.

So, for all kinds of difficult problems in this answering field, is there no way to solve them? Yes, I think there is a way. We are willing to agree with readers that as long as there are difficult and miscellaneous diseases with research value, we will definitely consult with experts and give detailed answers. If it is a common disease, as long as it has the value of being answered, then we will definitely combine everyone's questions and make a detailed general answer (for example, for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, we can make a very detailed answer once, and then we will not answer it again). In this way, not only will the patients themselves benefit, but other readers can also refer to it, and it can also reduce a lot of work for the colleagues of this journal. Isn't this a job that benefits all three parties? So we hope to work in this way in this area in the future."

In addition to the above five articles, which are the goals of our work in the future, we still have many tasks to do, such as the issue of "the debate between Chinese and Western medicine", the issue of "advanced studies for appraising physicians", and the issue of "the construction and rapid training of Western medicine talents", and so on. We will conduct detailed explorations. However, we don't want to predict too much, we only want to move forward towards the above five goals in a down-to-earth manner, only facts speak louder than eloquence.

Okay, let's work hard and move forward, and may readers give us assistance and correction from time to time!

### On the Question of the Effectiveness of the So-called New Anti-tuberculosis Drug Streptomycin

— Wu Manqing

A patient always hopes for another miracle when they are desperate. This is a helpless thing, and it is also an understandable fact. For example, regarding the treatment of tuberculosis, how many people have sought hope in disappointment and turned into disappointment in hope. Alas, how miserable this is, but the fact is always the fact, what can we do?

Around the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we often heard that the United States had invented a special medicine for treating tuberculosis, named Streptomycin. At that time, not only people with tuberculosis were hoping for it, but we doctors were also very excited about it, thinking that there would always be a way to solve the problem of treating tuberculosis. However, now that the victory is nearly two years away, the so-called special medicine for treating tuberculosis is always late in coming. This is really killing people. I am distressed about this, not only inquiring from colleagues, but also trying to consult documents about this drug, wanting to explore its truth. But the result is disappointing, because some doctors say it is very effective, and some doctors say it has more than 80% effectiveness, while some doctors say its effectiveness is unreliable. As for the documents published in the United States, although some say it is very effective, many scholars say that it cannot have practical evaluation in clinical aspects. In short, although this Streptomycin cannot be said to have no effect on tuberculosis, the word "special effect" cannot be put on its head.

Recently, I obtained a batch of Streptomycin, which is produced by Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company of the United States. I saw its package insert, which clearly states that it "may be effective for germs that penicillin cannot be effective, but for tuberculosis, Malta fever, and typhoid fever, etc., it cannot be cited at this time." Let's think about it, Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company is a large pharmaceutical company in the United States, their attitude is fair, they will definitely not refuse to do business, but they will definitely not use sweet words to deceive people. Therefore, I can very clearly tell the readers that the so-called special medicine for tuberculosis, Streptomycin, is just a scapegoat being used by others, it itself is innocent.

So, is Streptomycin a useless drug? No, it has many uses, but it does not belong to tuberculosis. Regarding its detailed situation, Dr. Yang Shida will describe it in detail in another article, so I will not repeat it.

However, finally, I still want to say: those poor tuberculosis patients have once again fallen from hope to disappointment.

### The Problem of the Spleen

— Yu Yunxiu

Now, in our country's scientific medical community, for patients with malaria, patients with typhoid fever, patients with leukemia, and patients with black fever, the lump that grows above the left side of the waist, below the ribs, of these several kinds of patients, is called the spleen. This "spleen" character is wrong! Originally, the spleen was a character in ancient Chinese medical books, but the spleen and stomach are often said together; as Suwen Jue Lun said: "The spleen is the one who manages the stomach and circulates its body fluids." Linglan Secret Canon said: "The spleen and stomach are the officials of the warehouse, and the five flavors come from them." Taiyin Yangming Lun said: "The spleen stores and is constantly connected to the stomach." It also said: "The spleen is connected to the stomach by a membrane." Lingshu Benshu Pian said: "The spleen is combined with the stomach." Chao Yuanfang's Treatise on the Causes and Manifestations of Diseases in the Sui Dynasty, Sun Simiao's Qian Jin Fang in the Tang Dynasty, and Wang Tao's Outer Terrace Secret Essentials also said the spleen and stomach together. The Shengji Zonglu in the Song Dynasty was the same. The Four Great Masters of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties had Li Dongyuan's Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach. All the way to the present, they all recognize that the spleen and stomach are one family. Therefore, there is no doubt that the spleen is an organ of the digestive system.

Also, Suwen Cangqi Fashi Lun said: "The color of the spleen is yellow." Yin Changming Lun said: "The spleen is earth, governs the center." It can be known that its color is yellow, its location is in the center, so looking at its color, its position, and its physiological function, there is no doubt that it is the current pancreas. In English, it is written as Pancreas, which is born behind the stomach, and can secrete three kinds of digestive juices, flowing out to the duodenum, to digest the food that comes out of the stomach to the duodenum that the stomach has not completely digested. It can continue the digestive work of the stomach to complete the digestion. The Inner Classic says "manages the stomach and circulates its body fluids", in fact, the gastric juice is not secreted by the spleen but by the stomach itself, it can only be said "continues the stomach and completes its digestion". In short, the observations of the ancients were mostly vague and could not be finely distinguished, and there is no need to delve into it deeply. However, it is indeed undeniable that the "spleen" mentioned in the old medical books is the current "pancreas", and there is no doubt about it. The Japanese call it "膵". This character is not in our Chinese dictionaries. I don't know why they created a new character "膵" to represent the spleen? It is only by investigating the era when the character "膵" appeared that we can understand. Master Zhang Taiyan said that it is probably a corruption of the character "脺". The Book of Rites Jiao Te Sheng has "spleen and stomach" (pronounced lv liao). Zheng Kangcheng's annotation said: "Fat between the intestines", this saying can only be regarded as doubtful words, and cannot be said to be certain.

As for the spleen that the new doctors are talking about now, it is strange to say that Chinese medical books have never mentioned this organ. I have also discussed it with Master Zhang Taiyan, and he also said that Chinese medical books have not mentioned this thing. In English, it is written as Spleen, in German, Milz. The Japanese rashly used our Chinese character "脾" to translate it, which is really wrong. The new Chinese doctors also rashly accepted his mistake, pointing a deer and calling it a horse, stubbornly giving the "脾" character, which has been commonly used to represent the digestive system secretory gland, to others, but using the colloquialism "胰子油" that is not commonly seen in ancient medical books to represent it. Furthermore, the blood-circulating gland that ancient medical books have never mentioned, and which often swells when it comes into contact with infectious diseases, is being branded with the "脾" character. This is really too inappropriate and too ridiculous. Colleagues who care about scientific terminology should pay close attention to it.

### Review of Streptomycin Treatment of Tuberculosis

— Yang Shida

Three years ago, we heard that the United States had invented a special medicine for tuberculosis, named "Streptomycin". We copied down the name, so as not to forget such an important name. Day after day, we looked forward to the arrival of victory, so that this savior of tuberculosis could be imported from the United States as soon as possible to save the thousands of tuberculosis patients in our country. Sure enough, shortly after the victory, a few were brought to Shanghai by special methods, and a few people were trying them. In recent months, a large number have been imported, and advertisements have been placed in newspapers to attract business. The price is quite expensive. Most of the medical community in our country has not used it, and it is inevitable that it will cause suspicion among the majority. Of course, for incurable diseases such as tuberculosis, the high price is not a problem. After all, life is more valuable than gold bars. The question is, does "Streptomycin" have any effect, and to what extent is it effective? This is a question that every patient wants to ask, and most medical colleagues find it difficult to answer for a while. The author has shallow knowledge, and although he has tried to use a small number of this drug in the pediatrics ward of the Municipal Fourth Hospital, he dare not draw conclusions. Today, I will report the results of the treatment of 100 cases of tuberculosis with "Streptomycin" recently published by H. Corwin Hinshaw and others in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to answer questions about "Streptomycin".

There are three major enemies of mankind in the world, namely syphilis, tumors, and tuberculosis. Every year, thousands of people die at the hands of these three enemies. Scholars from various countries are working hard and racking their brains every day to research and develop weapons to eliminate enemies. For syphilis and cancer, 606 and radium have been invented successively, which can achieve considerable effects in eliminating enemies. Only the special medicine for tuberculosis has been difficult to discover for a long time. As early as sixty years ago, we have recognized drugs that can prevent the growth of tuberculosis bacteria in test tubes, but when tested on animals with tuberculosis, they are not effective. It was not until the recent rapid development of chemotherapy that the invention of various sulfa compounds made it possible to cure artificially infected tuberculosis in animals. Since Waksman discovered "Streptomycin" in 1943, it has been known that many germs that "penicillin" cannot resist, "Streptomycin" can be effective. Waksman and others first tried it on artificially infected tuberculosis animals, and the effect was very satisfactory. H. Corwin Hinschaw and others have tried it clinically for two years, treating various types of tuberculosis, a total of 100 cases. (See the attached table) Among them, several patients suffered from more than one type or more than one site of tuberculosis. Because "Streptomycin" has recently been sold on the market, it is necessary to publish the treatment results. The tuberculosis cases they issued are all the various types routinely treated by internists and surgeons, and are not limited to pulmonary tuberculosis.

The clinical application of "Streptomycin" is based on the results obtained in the laboratory; after infecting animals with pathogenic doses of tuberculosis bacteria, "Streptomycin" can stop the progression of the infected tuberculosis. The recent observations of H. Corwin Hinschaw and others are even more convincing. The resolution, fibrosis, or calcification of lesions can be found in various animals. The surface disappearance of lesions can be seen in at least 30% of the treated animals. The tuberculosis test changes from positive to negative, and tuberculosis in animal organs cannot be proven to exist by any sensitive bacterial examination.

Table of Various Types of Tuberculosis Treated with "Streptomycin"

Type of case Number of cases Miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis Twelve cases

Adult non-surgical pulmonary tuberculosis Thirty-two cases

Tuberculous ulcerative lesions of the respiratory tract Seven cases

Tuberculous empyema Seven cases

Tuberculous hemorrhoids Fifteen cases

Urinary tract tuberculosis Fifteen cases

Bone and joint tuberculosis Five cases

Adult surgical pulmonary tuberculosis Seven cases

Other types of tuberculosis (suffering from more than one type or more than one site of tuberculosis) Eleven cases

"Streptomycin" has the biological properties of treating chronic diseases. Recent advances in manufacturing can produce more pure and less toxic products. Unfortunately, the production of finished products is very expensive, and it is difficult to obtain a large number of products for the application of tuberculosis treatment.

Results of treatment of miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis.

H. Corwin Hioschaw and others have used "Streptomycin" to treat twelve patients with diffuse tuberculosis. Nine had significant meningitis, two had autopsies confirming lesions in the brain, and one only had miliary tuberculosis without neurological involvement. Six of the twelve patients have died, and autopsies have been recorded in five cases. The five surviving patients are still under observation, having been observed for two to ten months. The remaining one only started treatment for one month.

(To be continued)

### A New Understanding of Measles Treatment

— Cang Long

This year's measles (also known as rubella) is particularly prevalent compared to previous years. Recently, an elementary school teacher told me that over half of the children in their school's kindergarten have contracted measles, resulting in a temporary suspension of classes.

Older people often say, "Measles is a very common childhood disease that everyone will get. Just keep the doors and windows closed, put down the mosquito net, prevent them from catching a cold and from seeing light, and they will get better in a few days without needing a doctor." However, I must tell readers that measles is not necessarily so easy in reality. We often hear of someone's child dying from pneumonia due to measles, or someone's child dying from encephalitis due to measles. As for measles later causing the onset of pulmonary tuberculosis, that is even more common. From this, it can be seen that measles is not an ordinary infectious disease; it requires our careful handling.

Originally, whether an infectious disease progresses well largely depends on the patient's ability to resist and the appropriateness of the treatment method. If the patient's body is good and the resistance is strong, then even if they have measles, they will recover naturally without a doctor. If their body is not very good and the resistance is not very strong, but because the treatment is effective, then they can also recover. However, in our opinion, strengthening the body and cultivating internal resistance is paramount. Many parents in Shanghai are always worried that their children will contract measles but do not know how to prevent it in advance. In fact, if they can pay a little attention to things like vitamins usually, then it would not only be measles; I think other infectious diseases can also be prevented to some extent. Mr. Allison of England once conducted a strict statistical analysis in the Royal Hospital and found that children who took sufficient amounts of vitamin A before or during measles had very good measles progression. For the past five years, the author has given large amounts of vitamin A to children with measles during the course of the disease, and the results have also been very good. Especially for pulmonary tuberculosis (because children who have had hilar tuberculosis can become more severely ill due to measles, and sometimes develop tuberculous meningitis... i.e., infantile convulsions), giving large amounts of vitamin A is even more effective.

However, I must bring up one point for discussion. Although the aforementioned vitamin A is of great help for measles, children with measles can sometimes develop very severe complications, especially in cases of measles sinking inward, which we often find very tricky to deal with. What is the reason for this measles sinking inward? According to our experience, the so-called sinking inward of measles is when, after a slight rash appears, the patient's face and limbs suddenly turn blue-purple, breathing becomes rapid, the whole body is irritable and restless, and all the rashes disappear. In medical terms, this symptom is a sign of heart failure and impaired blood circulation, which is very dangerous. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are most afraid of encountering this situation. And we Western doctors, although we have many ways to remedy it, sometimes worry that it will be too late to remedy it.

Since World War II, various sciences have been advancing by leaps and bounds. In medicine, there have also been many new inventions and new theories. Take measles for example, there are now new theories. I will briefly describe it below:

Originally, the symptoms of measles are similar to those of scarlet fever and rubella, with skin rashes as the manifestation of the infectious disease. Although the pathogens of the various diseases are different, these pathogens directly attack the capillaries throughout the body. Each pathogen and its toxins invade the capillaries, causing these capillaries to be damaged. If the damage is severe, bleeding occurs. If this bleeding occurs in the epidermis, then it is various rashes, such as measles rash in measles and scarlet fever rash in scarlet fever. If the bleeding occurs in the internal organs, then it can cause inflammation of the internal organs, such as nephritis, bronchitis, and inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. This is why children with measles are prone to coughs and diarrhea. Also, after suffering from scarlet fever or measles, there is often swelling of the face and eyelids, and even swelling of the feet. This is because the kidneys are bleeding internally, which means the kidneys are inflamed. If the internal bleeding is too great, then all the capillaries are destroyed, and blood circulation is immediately disrupted, and the heart also weakens. The patient immediately feels suffocated and restless. If the treatment is not appropriate, the patient will die of heart failure. This is the real reason why measles sinks inward and the rash cannot erupt.

Based on the above reasons, we must greatly change our treatment method for measles. In order to prevent the capillaries (i.e., the smallest blood vessels in any part of the body) from being damaged by pathogens or their toxins, we must give large amounts of blood-loss agents before or during the illness, especially vitamins PP, K, and C. Whether taken orally or by injection, the effect is almost the same. If it is during the illness, then it is better to use the injection method. The author has recently found in clinical experiments that the above method is very effective. Therefore, I will specially introduce it here without fear of trouble.

However, I must add one more thing: if you encounter measles sinking inward, with very dangerous symptoms, often just using cardiotonics is not enough (camphor preparations, epinephrine, and caffeine are the most effective cardiotonics), then the method of hot water bath (the hot water must have a temperature of 37 or 38 degrees Celsius) often has amazing effects.

In addition, regarding the treatment and prevention of measles, there are also things like placenta extract, patient serum, and maternal serum. Those are all methods that every doctor is familiar with, so please excuse me for not going into detail. I believe that the above-mentioned treatment to prevent capillary bleeding is not only of great value for medical practitioners to introduce, but also for those readers who have children at home, it is also beneficial to know something about it. If you can take some vitamin PP before you get sick, then maybe you can avoid many bleeding symptoms!

Spring and Autumn

### Introducing Several Modern Famous Painters - Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society - World Famous Painting Exhibition

Cézanne (Paul Cézanne) was a great painter of the 19th-century Expressionist school, inspiring the subjective new trends of the modern art world. He was born in southern France in 1839. His father was a banker. When he went to Paris, he initially studied law, and only began to engage in painting in 1863. Although he often associated with Impressionist painters at the time, he ultimately held his own views and was incompatible with them. In 1877, he moved back to his hometown, and for 20 years, he buried himself in painting, immediately burning anything he considered unsatisfactory. He observed objects with precision and seriousness, not only describing the objective form of things but also integrating his own emotions with the painting, subjectively expressing it with powerful colors and lines. His famous works include "The Bathers," and he is revered as the "Father of Emerging Art."

Van Gogh (Vincent Van Gogh) was a passionate and fiery painter of the 19th century. His paintings have the passion of fire, full of the galloping of power and the melody of passion. He was born in the Netherlands in 1853. He only began to paint after the age of 30. He was naturally uninhibited and bold, and he liked to use intense colors and vivid brushstrokes to depict the simple faces and straightforward behaviors of farmers, savages, and madmen. He also liked to express the splendor of the universe under the fiery sunlight. He committed suicide in 1890 due to an overflow of passion. The modern art world considers him a maverick of the 19th century.

Gauguin (Paul Gauguin), along with Cézanne and Van Gogh, was one of the three masters of Post-Impressionism. He was born in Paris in 1848. His family was poor, and he once served as a sailor on a merchant ship. When he specialized in painting, he was naturally eccentric, hated the hypocrisy of urban civilization, and admired the innocence and nature of savages. Later, he drifted to the island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, married a native woman, grew a beard, and lived the life of a primitive man. He used the scenery of the island as the subject matter, using simple and clumsy lines and colors to express the primitive and simple object, opening up a new realm and a new life in modern painting.

Henri Matisse (Henri Matisse) is the leader of modern Fauvism, a purely French painter. He was born in 1860. He initially studied with Moreau. After studying the paintings of Ingres, Daumier, and taking inspiration from the paintings of Seurat, Degas, and Gauguin, he further elaborated on the principle of pureization from the hints of black sculpture, and finally reached the simplification of modern comprehensive art painting. He also studied Cézanne's realism, grasped the sense of reality in painting, broke through all the old rules, and directly expressed the eruption of passion, making the composition of the painting a comprehensive beauty, using electric-like lines and flower-like colors to fully express Matisse's clear and unique personality. He is still alive and his works have reached the realm of more refined art.

Picasso (Pablo Picasso) is the leader of Cubism. He was born in Spain in 1881. He loved painting from a young age. At the age of 14, he honorably received the third prize at the Barcelona Exhibition. When he first arrived in Paris, he did not have any amazing characteristics. Later, he followed the style of Lautrec, showing a significant tendency. Since discovering Greco, the characters in his paintings have grasped the feeling of pathos in bluish-green colors. In 1917, he returned to the Neoclassical movement, and the characters he depicted had a full sensuality and astringent red color, a completely different look from the past, gaining a very big name in the Paris art world. He is a painter with extremely strong creativity, changing his style repeatedly, and is still alive in Paris.

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 176

— Ye Jingfeng

As for Mr. W, just looking at the fine lines on the corner of his phoenix eyes, the contained smile, you know that he understands everything on this scene like the back of his hand. He knows that there is no need for him to speak at this time; if he opens his mouth, delaying Tsurumi's opportunity to speak, it will definitely increase Tsurumi's embarrassment. So he just sits there, appreciating the special fragrance of the cigarette Tsurumi gave him; silently waiting for Tsurumi to untie this tricky puzzle ring.

"Oh!" A blush rose on Tsurumi's face, indicating that he was embarrassed by his misunderstanding; but he was not like ordinary people who would cover up their shortcomings and insist to the end to save face. This "Oh" indicates that he already understands his misunderstanding; "Miss Yao's words, maybe I didn't understand them, so I misunderstood..."! He pondered for a moment, "Regarding Pingzi's aspirations, I'm still a little unsure about it...".

"As you all know," Tsurumi expanded the scope of his speech from Yaoqun alone to include us several people; "Pingzi is doing secret agent work, this is beyond doubt. Moreover, her methods, skills, and the subtlety of her situation are all top-notch, and cannot be measured with ordinary eyes and angles. This top-notch situation can be said to be extremely subtle, so subtle that it is impossible to determine her trend, let alone grasp her motives; perhaps only Elder Aoki understands in his heart. I am very sorry..."!

This confession indeed broke Tsurumi's deadlock. What he showed was a piece of frankness. This reminds me of the English proverb, "Honesty is the best policy"! Anything with cunning and deception is bound to get worse and worse.

"I'm very sorry"! Tsurumi seemed to be hesitating a lot, "Pingzi is calling me to pay attention to this "eight" secret. Unless...unfortunately..."!

"Unless what?... What a pity?... "Yaoqun's degree of worry deepened.

"..." Tsurumi was still hesitating.

"Unless you try to interrogate Pingzi,... Unfortunately, she is not here..." I replied for Tsurumi from the side.

"I'm afraid there are bigger secrets in this 'eight'". Mr. W finally spoke his mind.

"If Pingzi were here, she..."? Yaoqun's words were not finished, and she stopped abruptly again, perhaps she was thinking about another question again.

"Are you saying that she might not be willing to speak"? Tsurumi asked Yaoqun.

"Yes... Just now the captain said that in this "eight", I'm afraid there are even bigger secrets, not the eight leading secret stations, nor the eight major regions that you just discovered, nor the agent number eight... If it's a bean-sized secret, I'm afraid Pingzi alone may not have fully absorbed it... Then you can ignore it for the time being. I just want to know, can you get Pingzi to tell the truth..."?

"Not much confidence, can only try". Tsurumi's brows furrowed together even more.

"If she comes, I have a way"! I lightly grabbed a sentence.

"Oh"? Everyone in the room was surprised.

"Really, Mr. Yue"? Yaoye was a little bit happy with the surprise.

"Brother...? Tsurumi also couldn't believe it.

### The New Power of Painting Print Editions

— Wang Tingqi

— Written for the "World Famous Painting Exhibition" of the Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society

Saying that the power of "literature" is greater than that of "painting" seemed undeniable in the past, because as long as you can read the words, you can appreciate literature, and a famous work can be printed in thousands of copies. But the original painting, even with a very good copy, can never compare to the printed words. Therefore, in the past, paintings had to rely on words to explain and spread them. Fortunately, paintings above Impressionist painting have more relationship with literature, such as depicting biblical stories, literary stories, or literary-flavored styles. However, modern painting has become independent and is rapidly moving towards pure, abstract, and musical state. Only painting itself can express the direct intention of creation. Therefore, modern painting particularly feels that the power of communication is too weak. On the other hand, it is even more difficult to understand the works of modern painters. Today, this difficulty is about to pass, and it has already been resolved in Europe and the United States, that is, the progress of painting print editions, and the large number of prints.

Now the best art prints, their size can be the same as the original, the oil taste, the water taste, and the taste of various colors can all be printed. The obvious thickness of the brushstrokes and the coarseness of the cloth pattern do not seem to be printed. The difference between it and the original is very small. This progress first defeated the work of European and American hired painters in museums to make replicas. And another phenomenon has emerged, which is to bring the printed matter to the front of the original to do some repairs to the photographs.

This "World Famous Painting Exhibition" held by the Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society indeed has the meaning of reading the original works. Although they are all printed matters, I believe that in the future, the painting world will give art lovers the opportunity to contact them frequently through the wide-ranging holding of this kind of exhibition. The degree of public appreciation will naturally increase, and all cultures will be on a higher level.

— Wang Dongxuchu

In the autumn of the twenty-ninth year, Zhang Muhan and his wife traveled to Mount Qingcheng and Mount Emei, completing a compilation of their Sichuan travel notes. Daqian painted it for them. More than a year later, he showed it to me and asked me to write a poem on it. I readily composed this interpretation. The emerald bamboo screen and the spiritual light of Luogu are both scenic spots of Mount Emei.

Driftingly carrying occasional encounters in the forest, seeking mountains adds to the wonderful interest; staff and shoes guide the heavenly wind, in the high places of Mount Emei; the bamboo screen passes the morning rain, and the spiritual light of Yangu gathers deeply: idly recalling calling apes, a long whistle, willing to come as companions.

Lingering with old friends, on the raw silk, lightly flying musk ink evenly applied; it is naturally full of romance, writing the beauty of all the families, a compilation is entrusted to supplement; also do not let down Zhang Xu of the willow bank, late in pointing out the graceful smoky hair, remembering living together in the Pure Place.

### Return

— Pan Yunfen

Nine years - a long time has passed.

Today, I am once again immersed in the place where the most precious dream shadows of my golden age once disappeared. All the people, all the things, everything, even the grass and trees here, have a sense of intimacy.

Looking at the setting sun of late winter hiding behind the big trees, I do not leave a trace of feeling lost.

"The setting sun will take away the severe winter's severe cold, desolation, and desolation, and even take away all the filth, selfishness, and meanness of the world," the morning sun of early spring will bring new hope to good people. ... So, I smiled happily, jumping, as if I were in the green fields of my hometown in early spring - vitality, activity, sunshine, flowers, youth, wheat seedlings... everything is the joy of life.

Walking towards the top of the small mountain where I once stayed, I sang loudly the anger, shame, and suppression that had been buried in my heart for many years and suffocated people.

By the gurgling stream, I whispered a long string of worries in the long years, no poems, no spring, everywhere filled with harm to the good and exploitation of human nature, it is a gray history, I almost fell into the sinking abyss of the city's paper drunken gold fans, became a grain of dross in the sewage. Fortunately, the soul that was not infected with vulgar breath has now awakened again. The sprouting grass is nodding to me, and the birds on the branches are playing pleasant music, is it blessing the new life of human troubles, is it welcoming my return?

I lay on the green grass by the spring river, the hard-working farmers and the old soldiers who were always panting brought me lofty ideals and noble beliefs:

"Life is endless work and struggle, and no harvest does not rely on cultivation"... I jumped up, shouted, and beautified.

"How many years have you not come back, it should be happy that your hometown has not changed much, right? After many years of looting and ravages" A lengthy and heavy voice awakened me from my fantasy.

"Oh, Uncle, no--"

"Isn't it cold, stand in the west wind and go inside!" After his reminder, I suddenly felt boundless cold invading my whole body, it turned out that it was not spring yet, the cracked land, the frozen river, the desolate countryside, the simple hearts were all shattered by the reality of military food, conscription... of words.

"Long years have passed, what about later? Still lost!" I heard the elders sighing.

Late at night, the candles kept shedding tears, accompanying the shadows shaking in the darkness, the cold wind, heavy rain hitting the window, leaning on the too intimate table, I remembered the past that had become a relic. ...

"Pak, Pak, Pak,..." The sound of the clapper vibrated my heartstrings, and I hurriedly pushed open the window. In the dim candlelight, that thin and pale face was so familiar. Nine years of separation, nothing has changed, only thinner, thinner!

Is it the third watch? I suddenly woke up, is the dark night about to pass?

"There will never be an endless dark night, winter days,... "Really, in the sound of this "Pak, Pak, Pak,...", I heard the prophecy of dawn and the call of spring.

"Should you bless?... "Thank you, great clapper, you have awakened countless people groping in the dark night, may you knock louder, awaken all those who are lost.

"Am I back?" Such a cordial voice, scenery? Really, only in this too familiar place, too intimate voice, in the overly simple, honest, and warm human feelings, I should be happy.

### Two Short Poems

— Flying Hong

Wonton

You are naturally full of grievances,

Only to be kneaded at will,

And abandoned in boiling water;

Several ups and downs,

Your face is full of wrinkles.

Deep Alley

A glimmer of light is revealed on the high-rise building,

The fortune-teller has passed,

The wonton seller is still stopping,

Dut, dut, dut….

### Two Themes of Prose

— Ke Ren

Mountain Stream

In spring, the mountain stream breaks free from the shackles of severe winter and sings melodiously, carrying ice chips and dead branches along the way; the water foam spits out freshness, jumping and swirling towards the two banks, as if whispering the warmth after a long separation; and the desolate and indifferent valleys also bring some vitality to it.

The mountain stream is not lonely! Sheep often crane their necks and drink it; those white and neat giant teeth greedily gargle, occasionally swallowing a few mouthfuls of stream water with the fresh aroma of grass. Gradually, farmers also stretched down their feet covered with mud, washing them hastily, and the nearby water surface stirred up a turbidity; the mountain stream hated this, so it flowed even louder.

What the mountain stream loves are the flowers that fall from the branches from time to time, and the willow catkins that are occasionally rolled off the wings of the wind; it gently floats these, slowly flowing away; stopping, and then swaying away, the waves at the bottom of the mountain stream are romantic.

Also, those girls who sneaked out of the village once hurriedly took a picture of their flushed faces by the stream.

Therefore, whenever I hear the light murmur of the mountain stream from afar, my heart is filled with the joy of spring.

Stars

On how many lonely nights, the mother picked up the young one who was not yet stable in her steps, stood by the window, and pointed to him the cold stars flashing in the sky: the child curled up on the mother's shoulder, his thick black eyelashes blinking in surprise; is it the greatness and profundity of the universe that was initially conquered? But she gradually fell asleep in the mother's murmur and light song: she also sighed, what the mother pointed to was her passing youth?

When the child grew up, he inherited all the mother's faint melancholy. At night, he often wandered alone under the starry sky, thinking about the mysterious eyes of his little lover in his hometown, which were like stars; now he understands why the mother always likes to dream silently about the stars.

Due to the passage of time, the mother was aging: standing by the window late at night, there was no warm child in her arms, but the desolate shadows of wanderers in the distance were looming in front of her. I don't know if there will be another day for the reunion of the stars in this life? Thinking about it, the mother's tears and the starlight reflected each other.

However, the house stars are always existing with the outer space.

### Protection Tax

— Li

The Kung I Company on Avenue Petain hoarded a large quantity of rice, and 235 bags were seized. The shop owner is at large, and the accountant was arrested. In his confession, he said, "The company was discovered hoarding rice by a certain organization some time ago. At that time, a bribe of six million legal tender and twelve dan of rice was paid to settle the matter." And a set of documents was presented.

What do these "a set of documents" prove? Do they prove that the hoarding of rice is legal from now on? The newspaper's record is vague, and I still don't know what kind of "organization" it is, what jurisdictional relationship it has with the hoarding of rice, and even less do I know the tone and attitude of the accountant when he confessed. Judging from the point of "presenting a set of documents," it seems very confident, although the newspaper uses the word "bribe."

"Bribes" certainly cannot "settle the matter," but the accountant was arrested, and what was presented was these "documents" obtained through bribery. Whether viewed from the front or the back, the hoarders at least believed that with the "documents" from the "organization," they had paid a "protection tax." Otherwise, knowing that bribery is a crime, why wouldn't the accountant fear the combination of two crimes, adding crime upon crime, and happily "present a set of documents" to confirm his crime?

Two hundred and thirty-five bags of hoarded rice were bribed with twelve dan of rice and six million legal tender. When converted, this protection tax almost cost a quarter of the profit. From the perspective of investing capital to seek profit, it was quite sophisticated to exchange for "a set of documents" for future use in case of an incident. Otherwise, why would these "documents" be so valuable? If these "documents" were originally intended for reporting, then why were they presented only after the hoarded rice was seized?

It can be seen that the use of "documents" is regarded by them as a guarantee of "attempting to sell at a high price," which means that the "high price" must also include the "25%" protection tax and its profits.

Now the hoarded rice has been seized, and the bribed legal tender and rice certainly cannot "settle the matter." The criminals have been sent to the garrison headquarters to "await legal action," so it seems there is more to come.

But will the tricks of hoarding and speculating disappear? This still depends on how the competent authorities deal with organizations similar to "a certain organization"!

From the period of occupation to this day, profiteering merchants have learned a concept from experience: if discovered, bribery is possible. And after bribery, it is secretly equivalent to paying a protection tax and having protection. When the truth comes out, the supervisor, in order to avoid too much involvement or to prevent family scandals from being exposed, will also "settle the matter."

Isn't that right? Today's rice hoarders copied the old article and presented the "a set of documents" of bribery. They and "a certain organization" had already "settled the matter" long ago.

### ### The God of Wealth's Lost Treasure

— Yang Mosu

The five Gods of Wealth in the Temple of the God of Wealth held a roundtable meeting. Taking advantage of the social and economic turmoil and the chaotic market, they prepared to launch offensives from all sides and unanimously engage in speculation. The first God of Wealth, with a golden face, took the lead, absorbing a large amount of gold, whether it was gold bars, gold nuggets, ingots, or gold ornaments, all of which were hoarded. He instructed his henchmen, "Bringing Wealth" and "Increasing Wealth," one busy weighing "ten thousand taels of gold," and the other busy measuring "daily income of a bucket of gold." The second God of Wealth, with a white face, was envious and immediately followed suit, hoarding grain and manipulating prices. The third God of Wealth, with a black face, was unwilling to be outdone, and spared no effort to search for and purchase US dollars, creating a black market situation of 20,000 to 1. The fourth God of Wealth, the Civil God of Wealth, frantically absorbed yarn shares, and the fifth God of Wealth, the Martial God of Wealth, followed suit by controlling public debt. The Temple of the God of Wealth was filled with a booming atmosphere. Ordinary poor people, with the belief that "being close to the rich will surely bring a small fortune," all flocked to the Temple of the God of Wealth to burn incense, long ingots, and bribe openly, hoping to get some light on the face of the Bodhisattva, which caused chaos and panic. This angered the local City God, who, upon the order of the King of Hell, took emergency measures, brought eight bailiffs, carrying a large abacus, and personally went to the Temple of the God of Wealth to settle accounts with the Gods of Wealth.

The five Gods of Wealth initially thought that "money is omnipotent," and that as long as they spoke about "favor" and entertained, there would be no problems. However, the City God was impartial and handled official matters according to the law. Seeing that the God of Wealth with a golden face was arrogant and snobbish, he first settled accounts with him, moving the large abacus beads. "You have a thousand calculations, but not as good as my one calculation." Ninety-nine eighty-one, the gold was confiscated and buried in the cellar, never to be reborn. From then on, gold became dirt, let's see how you can be active. The God of Wealth with a white face saw that the situation was not good and was originally the most timid. He voluntarily took out the hoarded rice and sold it to the public at the fair market price. However, the God of Wealth with a black face had been overseas before, could speak a foreign language, and had a dark heart. The City God moved the abacus beads and said, "Very well, the official price of US dollars will be 12,000 from today." The God of Wealth with a black face couldn't express his suffering and couldn't even say a word. The City God turned around, but couldn't find the Civil and Martial Gods of Wealth. He hurriedly asked "Bringing Wealth" and "Increasing Treasure." According to the answer, when the Lord was settling accounts with the three Gods of Wealth, they disguised themselves as poor people and secretly slipped out of the temple gate. The City God was furious and thought for a moment, saying, "I have a plan. Publish their real names in the newspaper, issue a strict warrant for their arrest, change the professions of 'Bringing Wealth' and 'Increasing Treasure' to make a living, expel them from the temple, and order Zhuo to seal the temple door with nails. The temple property will be confiscated, and half of each of the three large golden characters 'Temple of the God of Wealth' on the plaque in front of the door will be painted over, becoming 'Cai Shen Yue'." After everything was completed, he returned to the palace. The old people who burned incense before did not dare to raise their heads when passing by, and said in unison, "This measure allows us to 'Cai' speak a word for the poor."

### ### Remembering Immortal Beauty

— Hu Lu

Lingzhi

Don't say "lovers" should be practical, don't envy immortals for not being money! What is lingzhi? It's not as good as gold and is good-looking! Who wants it? It doesn't suit the hearts of the tycoons!

Note: Lingzhi is produced near Lover's Bridge. According to ancient legend, lingzhi is an immortal herb, and it is exhibited at the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, priced at 50 million yuan, but there are no customers.

### ### Dialogue of Love

— Kong Yuan

What is the most interesting question for anyone, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, male or female, old or young?

If you ask me this, I will answer you without hesitation with one word! "Love."

Have you read Plato's "Symposium"?

This great Greek philosopher, in the form of a play, used exquisite language to explain the true meaning of love with infinite wisdom and joy in a poetic way.

I want to learn from him.

Don't think I have too many love stories.

Every Valentine's Day, I always wander alone in my small room day and night.

This year's Valentine's Day, I recited a poem to myself, revised from a text:

"In front, I don't see spring flowers, behind, I don't see autumn moon; thinking of the悠悠 of love, I caress my chest alone and burst into tears."

You won't laugh at me? You may remember Tagore saying:

"If there were no flowers in the world, you would truly understand the love for flowers."

### ### Memories of the Pear Garden's Old Green

— Ting Song

The Gengzi Chronicle Poem by the Master of the Pingdeng Pavilion says: "Who cares about the rise and fall of the country? The streets are full of singing Jiao Tian'er." With these two sentences from the Qing Dynasty, one can understand the situation. However, in recent times, those who admire the Tan School call him Tan Xinpei the Great King, Tan Yingshou. In the mid-Guangxu period, we only knew him as Xiao Jiao Tian. Why is he called Xiao Jiao Tian? Because Tan's father was named Jiao Tian, and he was the son of Jiao Tian. After Jiashen, Guifen came to Shanghai, and after Gengzi, Juxian also came out of Beijing one after another. Tan's reputation rose sharply, and the situation of the three schools standing side by side changed to the Tan School dominating the stage alone. However, those who looked down on him said that he had no sound of great bells and chimes, like Zhou Ziheng, a gentleman from Tongrentang, who specialized in learning the big head. Every time after singing a song at the banquet, he would always make derogatory and disdainful remarks about Tan. There was also a Taoist priest from Sichuan, Huang, who also mixed in the capital, not a Taoist priest. He had a naturally rich voice and was good at the back of the head sound. I am very fond of Peking opera, and in social occasions, I knew that there were these two gentlemen at the banquet, either Zhou or Huang. I would definitely encourage the people at the same table to ask them to try their singing voice. As a layman, I listened attentively, and occasionally put my elbow on the table, and my wrist would vibrate. The magnitude of the two people's voices can be imagined. Therefore, those who knew Tan often laughed at him as the sound of national demise. In fact, it is not a fair comment, because Tan's singing focuses on charm, not on winning with a loud voice. At the same time as Sun, there was also a Xu Chu, whose appearance was extremely dignified and was best at Wang Mao opera. The volume of his voice was also comparable to that of Juxian, but there was no charm at all. The people of the capital ridiculed him as a donkey's bray, which was also abusive. He was the father of the martial artist Xu Deyi. Sun's singing was less charming than Zhu, and although the big head's charm was rich, it was naturally revealed, and there were also times when it was straightforward, far less than Tan's lingering and all-encompassing taste, without any regrets. The ancients said, "The lingering sound surrounds the beams," which is true, not just a reputation. It is said that Tan would repeatedly study and research the singing of Mu Ri when he was in a state of intoxication, and would only stop when he was satisfied. Therefore, in the second performance of a play, the lyrics would definitely have slight changes, because he was deliberately creating and improving day by day. He was like a good student, diligent and tireless, which is admirable. The only one who could get his charm was Xiao Yu, but even then it was only five or six out of ten. Those who achieved a little success by dipping into his leftovers were Meng Xiaodong. It is important that singing does not rely on the voice, but should focus on pursuing charm as the foundation.

### ### Shaw's Clever Reply

— Hua

The great producer Goldwyn once discussed with Shaw the purchase of the film rights to Shaw's various plays. Shaw bargained closely and refused to let go, making it impossible for Goldwyn to lower the price, so the negotiations seemed difficult to succeed. Finally, Gao said, "Think about it, as long as it is made into a film, millions of people who have read your play will be able to see it. For the contribution to art, please sacrifice a little."

"Unfortunately," the old man replied, "you only think of art, and I only think of money!"

### ### Art and Literary Circles
