### Draft Peace Treaty Review Completed: Our Country Still Advocates Lenience Towards Japan, Clarifies Attitude on Ryukyu Sovereignty

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The foreign ministry's preparatory work regarding a peace treaty with Japan, which began at the end of the War of Resistance, has been largely completed after years of careful and precise handling. All issues have been thoroughly considered and resolved after multiple meetings of responsible officials of the ministry and the Peace Treaty Review Committee, as well as written opinions from experts and scholars nationwide. The entire work is nearing completion, but the Review Committee will continue to exist to convene meetings and provide consultation as needed. According to an authoritative source speaking to our reporter, the satisfactory completion of this task is a great achievement. The draft treaty encompasses all important issues, not only representing our country's views on peace terms but also resolving issues based on the human principles of safeguarding world peace, punishing the guilty, and eliminating hatred. It can be presented as the most reasonable basis for discussion when a peace conference with Japan is convened in the future. According to our reporter, the result of the Peace Treaty Review Committee's participation has led to changes in some issues after careful consideration. The territorial provisions have confirmed our claim to the Ryukyu Islands. This has already been reported to the Political Consultative Council last month by President Zhang Qun. In addition, it is appropriate for Japan's South Sea islands to be placed under trusteeship. In the political provisions, the proposals for various educational measures and ideological reforms to eradicate its aggressive spirit have been unanimously confirmed, and it is stipulated that the martial tradition be eliminated from its social organization. The identity of the current Emperor and his relationship with the war must be assessed based on facts and legal principles. The duties and titles of his future successor should also be reconsidered. In the reparations section, the level of retained industry has adopted a standard based on a time limit, possibly the standard of the three years after 1930. However, our country does not intend to compromise on the types of retained industry. Any industry that can be directly or indirectly used for military production must be dismantled. Our country's percentage of reparations claimed should not be less than 48%. The "construction" carried out in overseas occupied areas by forcibly compelling the local people to shed blood and sweat in order to consolidate the occupation and strengthen aggression, as well as all loans containing aggressive intent, cannot be recognized as its overseas assets and must be regarded as the wealth of the people in those regions.

### Equipment Obtained by the Soviet Union from the Northeast Should Be Deducted from Reparations

As for the assets and industrial equipment removed from our Northeast by the Soviet Union, they cannot be regarded as "spoils of war" obtained from Japan and should be deducted from the amount of Japanese reparations it is entitled to, as fair compensation. As for the military provisions, we still insist on the disarmament of all its forces and restrict any future development beyond maintaining domestic order and security. In addition, regarding the implementation of the peace treaty after it is signed, our country still insists that there must be some form of certification. Military occupation may be discussed at length due to practical difficulties, but civil administration supervision must not be abolished. In summary, the draft peace treaty with Japan that our country has finally decided on and intends to submit to the peace conference may be more lenient in some respects than originally anticipated. This is the result of the majority of experts considering the facts, and Foreign Minister Wang's impressions from his visit to Japan also carry significant weight. After returning to the country, Wang publicly declared that Katayama and his cabinet do have the desire to lead Japan onto a path of democracy and peace, and have already shown some signs of it. Wang also sympathizes with the general suffering of the Japanese people. An authoritative source further emphasized that our country has no vengeful motives in dealing with the Japanese issue, only seeking to ensure that they thoroughly repent of their past mistakes and contribute to the Far East and the world.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] After Britain, following the Soviet Union, also rejected our proposal for a preparatory meeting for a peace conference with Japan, the capital felt quite regretful. Note: Our country's proposal was to accommodate the main parts of the discrimination between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, in order to seek a compromise between the two sides, but it was rejected by both sides one after another, inevitably feeling embarrassed. However, China's desire for an early convocation of a peace conference with Japan has not been abandoned and has become even more urgent because the preparation of the draft peace treaty with Japan is nearing the final decision stage, and the time to legally end the war cannot be further delayed. According to official sources: the United States has not yet responded to our proposal. However, they did not comment on whether our country will wait for a decision from the United States or immediately strive for US cooperation as a final effort to break the deadlock.

### White House Holds Meeting to Review Foreign Aid Plan, $16.5 Billion Needed Over Four Years

[News from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman met with Congressional leaders from both parties for eighteen minutes today. Afterwards, Republican Senator Vandenberg said: The President hopes to submit the long-term Marshall Plan for European aid before Congress adjourns the special session on Friday. He also said: He had asked the leaders of both parties about the timing of the adjournment of the Congressional special session, and they told him that both houses hope to adjourn on Friday. Fan did not reveal when the President's message would be submitted. Truman also did not reveal the content of the message, presumably because the meeting time was too short.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman invited Congressional leaders to the White House on the 15th to review the government's long-term plan to assist Western European reconstruction, which would require a total of US$16.5 billion over four years. After the invited guests discussed the overall foreign situation with the President, they returned to Congress. The Senate will take swift action to pass the temporary aid bill of $597 million for France, Italy, Austria, and China. According to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: This emergency aid bill represents a compromise solution for the relief program between the Senate and the House of Representatives, and it should be passed by both houses today and sent to the President for signature. However, it is rumored that the House Appropriations Committee may recommend a reduction of $50 million to $100 million or more. Regarding Marshall's long-term relief plan, the President seems to want to know the opinions of the Republican and Democratic leaders first, and resolutely insisted that Congressional members first pass a four-year plan, and the annual appropriations could be decided by Congress.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] It is reported that a powerful group on the House Appropriations Committee still intends to reduce the $597 million stipulated in the Foreign Aid Bill, and there is a concern that the China portion may also be deleted. It is currently heard that a draft has been agreed upon, stipulating that: the China portion will not be included in the emergency relief bill, and the relief funds for France, Italy, and Austria will be reduced by $50 million to $60 million. What remains to be discussed is whether the $60 million originally intended to aid that country will also be deleted now that the China portion has been deleted. The Appropriations Committee group discussed this matter in strict secrecy and is scheduled to continue the meeting on the 15th. Once an agreement is reached, it will be submitted to the full Appropriations Committee for review. However, since the head of the group and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee are both Republican Congressman Taylor, what the group decides will definitely be approved by the full Appropriations Committee.

### Chen Qitian Returns to Nanjing, Talks About Impressions of Trip to Jinan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian returned to Nanjing by train from Jinan on the 15th and spoke to reporters on the train about his impressions of his trip to Jinan. Chen said: I went to Jinan this time at the invitation to attend the opening ceremony of the Puji Railway and to inspect the coal production, coal transportation, and industrial and commercial conditions in Jinan along the Jinpu Railway. Jinan is an isolated city with its transportation cut off on all sides for a long time. It is rare that the Shandong military and political authorities and the people have worked together to support it until now. While in Jinan, I met with the Shandong military and political authorities and business leaders many times and inspected several power plants, textile mills, and flour mills. I deeply felt that all parties were able to work hard in a practical manner, which is admirable. However, in order to permanently protect Jinan, it is necessary to quickly restore the entire province of Shandong. In order to quickly restore the entire province of Shandong, in addition to having sufficient National Army to suppress the bandits, it is also necessary to expand the local security forces. The character of the people of Shandong is most suitable for military requirements. If more troops composed of the people of Shandong are added, it will not only benefit Shandong Province but also the entire country. (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### Party, Government, and Military Circles in Peiping Welcome Fu Zuoyi, Fu Emphasizes Military-Political Coordination

[Our Peiping Dispatch on the 15th] Fu Zuoyi gave a speech at a welcome meeting held by all sectors in Peiping today, emphasizing military-political coordination and implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood in order to overcome the current difficult situation. The welcome meeting was held in conjunction with the expanded memorial week of the municipal party headquarters, presided over by Li Zongren. All party, government, and military leaders in Peiping participated. Li Zongren first gave a speech, saying that he believed that Fu would be able to complete the heavy task of suppressing bandits in the five provinces of North China with his hard-working style. Then, Fu stepped onto the podium amidst thunderous applause. Fu said that although the situation is grim, after many analyses, he firmly believes that the communists will eventually fail. He listed five points to prove this conclusion: the implementation of democratic constitutionalism will help suppress the rebellion; people who previously believed that the communist problem could be resolved peacefully have now realized this and are helping the government suppress the rebellion; the people in the government's peaceful and free areas have already tasted the horrors of war caused by the communists, and we should implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and reform politics to relieve the people; the communists rule the people entirely through terror policies, and the hatred is deep-seated, and the people will rise up in resistance because of the National Army's rescue; During the recent inspection, I learned that the tactics, strategies, and military discipline of the various units in dealing with the communists have improved. Finally, Fu said: In today's situation, the problem cannot be solved by the military alone. Military-political coordination is necessary, with the military covering politics and politics covering the economy in order to achieve success. The phenomenon of joining the party to become an official in the past will no longer be seen today.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 15th] The Northeastern war, which had been silent for almost a month, has now entered a new stage due to the bandit's Eighth and Ninth Columns harassing western Liaoning again. The bandit's Eighth Column, from the Rehe-Liaoning border area, passed through the Songling Bianmen (about 30 kilometers northwest of Jinzhou), Xuejiatun (5 kilometers north of Jinzhou), and other places, directly harassing the Shuangyangdian and Dalinghe stations on the Beining Qian Line, attempting to disrupt railway traffic. The National Army is currently intercepting in separate directions, and fierce battles have broken out along the railway line. The main force of the bandit's Ninth Column has not made any rash moves in the Songling Bianmen area. There has been no major contact in northern Liaoning, and the communist troops are moving frequently. Its First Column has moved to Xifeng, and the Third Column has moved south from Xi'an, with unclear intentions. The bandit's Second Column on the west side of the Middle-Long Line has also moved to the vicinity of Bamiancheng. The local National Army, in order to control the enemy first, has dispatched troops in separate directions to suppress them. Since the recovery of Haicheng Dashiqiao in southern Liaoning, that area has been consolidated. However, the bandit army southeast of Liaoyang has recently attempted to move again. The National Army has made strict deployments in response to this, and if the bandits invade, they will suffer a serious blow.

### Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Repeatedly Defeated

Legislative Yuan Convenes Subcommittee to Review the Organization Laws of the Five Yuan and the Preliminary Draft of the Organization Law of the Presidential Office

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The organization laws of the five yuan are currently being reviewed by a subcommittee convened by the Legislative Yuan. The organization law of the Legislative Yuan has now been amended, and the entire work will be completed before the end of this month, and then submitted to the State Council for discussion. It is learned that the organization of the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the number of people attending the meeting must be one-third, that is, if the number is less than one-third, the meeting cannot be held, but it has now been changed to one-fifth, because the total number of new legislators is as many as 773. If one-third is counted, there will be more than 200 people, which is more difficult to convene and hold a meeting, so it is changed to one-fifth. In addition, the Legislative Yuan's various committees have added special committee members, mostly serving legislators. The organization of the Control Yuan will not undergo major changes. Only the retention or abolition of the Supervisory Envoy's Office is still under study. Because the Constitution stipulates its abolition, and it is currently needed in reality, all parties are requesting its restoration. Regarding the Judicial Yuan section, the current Supreme Court is cancelled according to the Constitution. Under the Judicial Yuan, there are civil and criminal chambers, and the chamber director is concurrently held by the President of the Yuan. Some people believe that it is not appropriate for the great power to be concentrated in the President of the Yuan and advocate maintaining the original proposal. Regarding the Executive Yuan section, there may not be any changes, but the Information Bureau will be included in the formal organization of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The organization law of the Presidential Office has been drafted after several meetings of the Civil Service Office of the National Government and the designation of a person responsible for drafting the articles. It is learned that the regulations have been initially finalized and are being studied by the Civil Service Office. However, they still need to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and passed by the State Council before they can be promulgated.

### Investigation Reveals the Truth of the Fraud Case at the Guangdong Provincial Bank's Hong Kong Branch

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] Feng Ciqi, who came to Hong Kong to investigate the case of the Guangdong Provincial Bank's Hong Kong branch being defrauded of HK$100,000, has completed his work in Hong Kong and is scheduled to return to Guangzhou on the 16th.

However, the branch manager, Yang Zhongli, has served diligently for more than ten years and has never been at fault. This momentary carelessness is truly unfortunate. After returning to Guangzhou, Mr. Feng will report the facts to the provincial government for deliberation.

### Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

Today marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This newspaper, having the same vintage as the company, cannot help but offer a few words of congratulations on this grand occasion. The past 75 years have indeed been a very important period in Chinese history. Due to the incompetence of the Qing Dynasty, the powers intensified their aggression against China step by step, until it was impossible to close the country off. Thus, the doors were opened wide, even to the brink of partition. Due to contact with the powers, this politically stirred up the high tide of the National Revolution. Relying on the successive sacrifices of the martyrs, the Qing Dynasty was finally overthrown, and the Republic of China was established. This in turn triggered the invasion of Japanese warlords, culminating in the full-scale War of Resistance and the victorious end of the war. In economic and cultural terms, we gradually realized that we could not stick to old ways and that we must learn from the West's strong armor and sharp weapons, promote science, and devote ourselves to the establishment of domestic heavy industry and modern transportation. At the same time, we must enlighten the people and improve the general level of knowledge of the masses. Only by advancing on both fronts can China join the ranks of modern, prosperous, and strong nations. Both the Shen Bao and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were founded under this call. The 75th anniversary of this newspaper was not long ago, and now we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. As "contemporaries," we would like to offer our heartfelt congratulations here.

Looking at the history of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the past 75 years cannot but fill us with many feelings. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded at the same time as the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Before the war, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha had more than 150 ships with a total tonnage of over one million tons, and its routes spanned the globe. It was listed as a world-class shipping institution. Our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, on the other hand, clung to the old and neglected the new. Not only did it not have any new developments, but the courage and ambition of its founding had also waned, and it had completely turned into a dilapidated household. When the Chinese people saw the contrast between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha at that time, everyone couldn't help but sigh. However, the reasons for the decline of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were not simple. The existence of unequal treaties meant that even the shipping within China's territorial waters was controlled by the powers, which was, of course, a fatal blow to the development of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mismanagement also cannot be excused. Due to these multiple reasons, the development of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was frustrated everywhere. Today, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, there are a few points that we seem to cannot help but put forward first: During the War of Resistance and after the victory, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company devoted its limited ships to military transportation and reconstruction work, which can be said to have done its best for the country and the nation. Since Mr. Xu Xueyu took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been determined to reorganize its operations. Not only has he cleared old debts, but he has also added new ships and devoted himself to the expansion of long-distance routes, which has given the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company a new life. Today, on the 75th anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, when the company is experiencing a new life, we are mindful of the painful past and look forward to the future, and we would like to offer a few more words:

First, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as a state-owned shipping institution, currently has a very low tonnage. Not only does it not have the one million tons of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha before the war, but it is also quite far from half of that, 500,000 tons. Our shipping industry is still very, very far from our ideal. Now that Japan has been defeated, its former position in the Eastern and even world shipping industry should be given to our country. However, with our country's current merchant ship tonnage, it is really not enough to shoulder this mission. The government should promptly submit a proposal to the relevant parties to grant at least one-third of the total tonnage of Japan's existing merchant ships to China as part of the compensation. China is also a belligerent country against Germany and Italy, and part of the merchant ships of Germany and Italy should also be handed over to our country.

Second, we should actively establish our shipbuilding industry. Our country's shipbuilding industry began in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Mawei Shipyard and the Jiangnan Shipyard both enjoyed a temporary reputation, but they then declined. Today, our shipbuilding industry does not even have the original foundation. Without the establishment of a shipbuilding industry, the development of the shipping industry will have inherent limitations. We can certainly purchase ships from abroad in peacetime, but this will not only consume foreign exchange, but may also be affected by war once it occurs. If we want to develop the shipping industry, we must establish our own shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding industry is a heavy industry and should be state-owned in accordance with the economic policy of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we hope that the government can pay attention to this and establish our shipbuilding industry as soon as possible.

Third, from a national defense perspective, the merchant ship fleet is an indispensable part of national defense. Needless to say, the merchant ship fleet can participate in naval service during wartime and become a part of the navy. Even if it does not directly participate in the war, the transportation, guard, and other services it can undertake are directly or indirectly related to national defense. Now that we are committed to rebuilding our navy to defend our seas, we must not ignore the establishment of a merchant ship fleet. The United Kingdom, which is known for its navy, uses its merchant ship fleet as its Merchant Navy. Our country's current conditions for establishing a strong navy seem to be insufficient, so how to expand the tonnage of our merchant ship fleet, the government should give the greatest assistance to the shipping industry.

Finally, from an economic point of view, the operation of long-distance routes is an important tool for developing foreign trade. In today's situation of extremely difficult foreign exchange, self-transportation and self-sales are even more important. In the past, the imbalance in the balance of payments, the excess of imports was certainly a major reason, but the amount of expenditure on freight was also quite alarming. According to reports, our country sold surplus scrap steel to American steel mills this time, and the freight alone accounted for US$18 million. It can be seen that in international trade, if there is no overseas shipping line operated by ourselves, the amount of foreign exchange consumed is really considerable. Now that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has opened up long-distance routes, we hope that due to the increase in tonnage in the future, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can further expand its overseas shipping lines to win our overseas markets and help the development of our national economy.

### Chen Qitian Talks About His Impressions of Visiting Jinan

(Continued from page 1) Shandong's position in the country is important from a military, political, transportation, and cultural point of view, and the central government should continue to pay attention to it. The most urgent task at present is to strengthen military strength and eliminate the remaining bandits in order to restore transportation and develop industry. Shandong is rich in minerals such as coal, iron, and gold, and agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, peanuts, and tobacco. The table-style industry also has a considerable foundation, but at the moment, because the railways, mines, and factories have been destroyed by the communists, the output of various products has been greatly reduced. Even the existing small amount of various products is not easy to transport to the places where they are needed. For example, Shandong's coal production is so high that it can be used for the whole country, but the Jinan power plant has been shut down for several months due to traffic congestion and insufficient coal transportation. To fundamentally solve the problem of coal consumption in Jinan, the Jiaoji Railway must be repaired as soon as possible so that Zibo coal can be transported to Jinan in large quantities by rail. The current method of relief is to transport coal from Lincheng and Xuzhou. As for the coal production and storage of the mines along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines, the situation is as follows: The Huainan Mine in the Huainan District produces 90,000 tons per month and has 35,000 tons in storage. The Huadong Mine in the Jiayong District produces 60,000 tons per month and has 30,000 tons in storage. The above two mines are fully equipped. The Zhongxing Mine in the Linyi District produces 33,000 tons per month and has 42,000 tons in storage. The Xintai Mine in the Xinlai District produces only 1,000 tons per month. The Huaxian Mine in the Taining District also produces only 1,500 tons per month. The machinery of the above three mines has been completely destroyed, and they are currently mined by indigenous methods. The machinery of the Zibo Mine in the Zibo District has also been half-destroyed, producing 20,000 tons per month and storing 25,000 tons. The Fangzi Mine in the Weixian District is mostly fully equipped and produces 10,000 tons per month. The mines in the Zhangqiu District have been completely destroyed and have no production. According to the above statistics, the monthly coal production in Shandong Province is about 108,000 tons, and the coal reserves are about 132,000 tons. In order to prevent coal shortages in various places, we are currently trying to transport the coal reserves of various mines to Beijing, Shanghai, and Jinan. In addition to requesting the railway bureau to allocate three special coal transportation trains to transport coal to Beijing and Shanghai, it is planned to transport about 36,000 tons of Zhongxing coal from Lincheng to the south, and about 6,000 tons to the north. In addition, 5,000 tons of Huadong coal will be transported from Xuzhou to the Jinan power plant. All the mines along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines, except for Huainan, Huadong, and Fangzi, have been almost completely destroyed by the communists. This kind of destruction not only directly kills the people within the mining area, but also indirectly starves the people outside the mining area, which is really heartbreaking. The reason why the Shandong communists have been able to destroy and disrupt again and again is said to be that they have been receiving a steady stream of Japanese-made guns from the Northeast across the sea. This proves that the communist rebellion is not only a domestic war, but also has international implications. If it is not put out as soon as possible, it will not be easy for China to achieve peace and democracy, and the whole world will be difficult to obtain peace.

### Macao Authorities Order a Ban on Gold Imports and Exports

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] The Portuguese authorities in Macao have ordered a ban on the import, export, and transit of gold and platinum. Hereafter, the transfer of these precious metals will require a special permit, with a limit of 50,000 ounces of gold and 20,000 ounces of platinum per application, and subject to taxation. The same applies to transit gold. The Macao authorities stated that the continued free movement of these precious metals would inevitably have an adverse impact on Macao's economy, so the promulgation of restrictive measures was unavoidable.

### Guangdong Customs Cracks Down on Smuggling; Outskirts of Macao to be Blockaded

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] According to Zhang Yongnian, the customs officer of the Guangdong Customs, who is about to be transferred to the Jianghai Customs, the center of smuggling in South China has shifted from Macao. Smugglers in the Zhongshan area have reached an unprecedented level of rampant activity. The main export smuggling is rice. The customs has now decided to blockade the outskirts of Macao to cut off the smuggling route. In addition, smuggling in the Dongjiang area has recently been slightly curbed, and it is hoped that smuggling in South China will be reduced in the future.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] From the 5th to the 9th, the Guangdong Customs seized a total of 2,512 cases of smuggled goods by sea, land, and air, worth more than 20 billion yuan. Most of the smuggled goods were prohibited from import and export and evaded foreign exchange settlement.

### Price Fluctuations Seen in Various Places

Wuxi [This newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] Today's prices are soaring. The price monitoring team has stationed special commissioners in the rice, flour, oil, and yarn markets to suppress prices, resulting in no market for rice, wheat, and flour. Only white japonica rice is being traded at 930,000, wheat at 900,000, flour at 360,000, and cooking oil at 1,930,000.

Suzhou [This newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] Suzhou rice prices are still rising. Although credit is tight, scattered households are doing their best to absorb it, and speculators are manipulating and raising prices. The market is chaotic. Although the social science department of the county government has worked hard to persuade and advise, it has not seen any effect. The price of white rice is as high as 880,000, and various rice shops are selling black market rice for 930,000 yuan. The prices of other items such as wheat, cooking oil, and sugar have also increased.

Nantong [This newspaper, Nantong, 15th] Although the source of rice is smooth and the stock is abundant, the price increase has not stopped. Today, japonica rice has reached 990,000 per shi, and indica rice has reached 860,000, which is higher than Shanghai and Wuxi. The source of wheat is not smooth, and flour has increased by 120,000 per bag.

Wuhu [This newspaper, Wuhu, 15th] The prices of rice and yarn have slightly decreased. 20-count Sando yarn is 800,000 yuan, down 50,000, and machine-milled rice is 710,000 yuan, down 50,000 yuan.

Tianjin [This newspaper, Tianjin, 15th] The Tianjin military and police authorities continue to monitor the market. On the 15th, they arrested more than 20 illegal brokers. Grain prices have fallen again, and flour has returned to 500,000 yuan.

In addition to handling the transportation and sales of grain and regulating military and civilian food in the north, the company will also try to export soybeans and peanuts from North China and the Northeast in exchange for foreign exchange to purchase foreign wheat.

### Fuzhou Shops Closing Down

[This newspaper, Fuzhou, 15th] The market here has been changing a lot lately. On the one hand, due to the stimulation of large denominations, prices of everything have soared. On the other hand, due to the suspension of lending by banks, credit has tightened, leading to the active participation of usurers, with high interest rates reaching 7%. Some shops cannot withstand the exploitation and have announced their closure, and the act of suspending interest and returning capital has become a trend. It is expected that the trend of closures will intensify by the end of the year. The Fuzhou Four-Bank Joint Office is studying this economic crisis and discussing remedial measures. It has decided to invite representatives from the city's industrial, commercial, and financial circles to meet tomorrow to discuss the matter.

### Fuzhou's Trade Surplus Exceeds 30 Billion Last Month

### Soviet Union Implements Currency Reform New Ruble in Circulation from Today, Exchanging Old Currency at a Rate of One to Ten Unified Prices and Abolition of the Rationing System

[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] The Soviet Union has abolished the rationing system and implemented currency reform. The new ruble is scheduled to be in circulation from December 16th. The order issued by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party states: The Soviet Union is now facing the task of reforming the currency system to strengthen the exchange rate of the ruble and abolishing the supply rationing system to expand trade. During the war, the maintenance costs of the army and the development of military industries increased rapidly. The sharp increase in expenditure required the circulation of huge amounts of currency, which was the case in all other participating countries. At the same time, the production of goods for people's consumption also decreased, and the volume of retail trade transactions decreased significantly. The purpose of currency reform is to alleviate the consequences of the world war on currency circulation and to help improve the material welfare of workers. The currency held by the people's national cooperatives and state-owned enterprises, except for auxiliary currency, will be exchanged for new currency. Furthermore, during the war, German troops and other invaders issued a large number of counterfeit ruble notes in the temporarily occupied Soviet territory, which further increased the amount of currency in circulation, exceeding what the national economy needed, thus reducing the purchasing power of the currency. Today, it has become imperative to take steps to strengthen the value of the Soviet ruble. Although under war conditions, the Soviet government was able to maintain the prices of rationed goods throughout the war due to the implementation of the rationing system for food and industrial products, the reduction in trade in consumer goods by the state and cooperatives, as well as the increase in people's demand for collective farm products, led to an increase in market prices, which exceeded fifteen times the pre-war level. Moreover, speculators accumulated large amounts of goods in an attempt to obtain windfall profits.

### New Currency Exchange Standards Minor Losses Suffered by Labor Seriously打击打击 Serious Blow to Profiteers

The Soviet Cabinet's order then announced the detailed rules for the exchange of new currency for old rubles as follows: Bank deposits of 3,000 rubles or less will be exchanged for new currency at equal value; deposits between 3,000 and 10,000 rubles will have the first 3,000 rubles exchanged for new currency at equal value, with the remainder converted to new currency at a ratio of three to two; for deposits above 10,000 rubles, the first 3,000 rubles will be exchanged for new currency at equal value, 7,000 rubles will be converted at a ratio of three to two, and the remaining portion will be converted at a ratio of two to one. Cash on hand will be exchanged at a rate of ten old rubles for one new ruble.

Currency held by cooperative businesses and collective farms will be converted at a rate of five old rubles for four new rubles. Government bonds issued before 1947 will be converted at a rate of three old rubles for two new rubles and renamed Unified Bonds. For three days on December 15, 16, and 17, bank deposits will be suspended. The order also announced that the distinction between commercial prices (free market prices) and current prices (official prices) will be abolished to unify retail prices nationwide. The Ministry of Commerce will be instructed to formulate new prices for food and industrial products in accordance with the announced reform. On average, the prices of industrial products will be reduced by one-third compared to current commercial prices. The order also pointed out that the losses suffered by the majority of the working class will be short-term and minor, while profiteers will suffer the most severe blow. Although the working class will suffer losses, they can be compensated by the abolition of higher commercial prices and the reduction of current bread and grain rationing prices. However, the people must bear a significant portion of the sacrifice, which is considered to be the last sacrifice. Bread and grain prices will be reduced by 12% and 10% respectively, beer prices will be reduced by 10%, other grains will generally maintain current prices, liquor prices will remain unchanged, industrial products will be higher than rationing prices, but will be reduced by one-third compared to commercial prices. Meat, fish, fat, sugar, tobacco, candy, potatoes, and other vegetables will maintain prices equal to current rationing prices, and new prices will be set for milk and eggs.

The exchange of new currency is expected to be completed within two weeks starting from December 16. During the exchange period, old currency can be used at one-tenth of its face value. From a certain date, the old currency will cease to circulate. Government-issued public debt and special savings certificates will be exchanged for new currency bonds at a ratio of three to one between May 3 and July 3, 1948. The two phases of the Reconstruction Bonds issued in 1947 are not included in the exchange. The aforementioned order was signed by Stalin, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee, Zhdanov.

### Soviet Official Regulations New Food Prices

[Our Dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Moscow, according to the new food prices posted here today, roughly as follows: black bread at three rubles per kilogram, second-class white bread at 4.4 rubles, first-class white bread at seven rubles, black flour at 4.8 rubles, second-class white flour large, two rubles, first-class white flour at eight rubles, macaroni at ten rubles, lump sugar at fifteen rubles, first-class meat at thirty rubles, white pagoda sixty-four rubles, sunflower oil thirty rubles, fresh fish twelve rubles, salt 1.6 rubles, oats 2.5 rubles, apples sixteen to twenty-five rubles, coffee seventy-five rubles, ice cream twenty rubles, milk three to four rubles.

### Observations by British and American Figures Expected that the Soviet Union Will Establish a Ruble Bloc to Counter the Marshall Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Officials here believe that the Soviet Union's currency reform and the abolition of rationing can help the Soviet Union counter the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the Soviet Union may try to establish the international value of the ruble. Although the ruble has a nominal international value, there are actually no international ruble transactions. Until now, the Soviet Union's trade with other countries has been conducted by exchanging goods at the discounted currency of the other country. If the Soviet Union can establish the international purchasing value of the ruble, then other countries can trade with the Soviet Union at the discounted price of the ruble, allowing the Soviet Union to expand trade with Scandinavia and Eastern European countries. Officials here also expect that the Soviet Union will establish a ruble bloc to compete with the sterling area and the dollar bloc, and to compete with the Marshall Plan. Soviet economists are expected to propose a plan to make the ruble a gold standard currency with gold as a reserve to stabilize its value and counter the Marshall Plan. The Soviet gold reserves are estimated to be worth between 875 million and 4.25 billion pounds.

[United Press, London, 15th] International observers here believe that the Soviet Union's decision to re-establish the value of the ruble is a sign that the Soviet Union will seek power in Europe. Its purpose is to strengthen the Soviet domestic economy and fight the future Marshall Plan. There are also rumors here that the Soviet Union may put the ruble on the world market to compete with the dollar. According to the Soviet government's currency reform plan, the ratio of the ruble to the dollar remains at 5.3 to 1. Some British experts on Soviet affairs said: The Soviet currency reform will have the most significant impact on the people of the Baltic Soviet Republics and other new Soviet territories, which may accelerate the collapse of their independent peasant class. Experts continued to point out that the so-called collective farms in the Baltic countries have not yet been established in practice, and collective farms in the former Western Ukraine and the former Czech Carpatho-Ukraine are still not strong. The currency reform may promote their growth. Because in the reform, the middle peasant class, which suffered heavy losses, will thereafter take a collective form to protect the security of its property.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Federal Reserve officials said: The currency reform order broadcast by Radio Moscow actually indicates that the severity of inflation in the Soviet Union is even worse than outside observers had expected. State Department Deputy Director of the East European Division, Steven Stance, pointed out that one thing is very clear, that is, "the Soviet government has reduced its debt by one-third at once." He also said that savers have lost as much as one-tenth of their property under the new order, which is most tragic.

[Reuters, New York, 15th] New York morning newspapers commented on the Soviet government's announcement of currency reform and the abolition of rationing, believing that the economic difficulties faced by the Soviet Union are the same as those of some capitalist countries. The New York Times said: The Soviet Union's move is to use totalitarian remedies for similar capitalist diseases. From the Soviet government's order, it can be seen that after thirty years of communist rule in Russia, the human nature of seeking profit has also revived in the Soviet Union. The New York Herald Tribune commented: The Soviet economy is as sick as the capitalist economy. However, the Soviet system may not be able to overcome such states.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Reopens Yesterday Marshall Responds in Writing to Soviet Accusations Denies Obtaining Commercial Profits from Germany

[United Press, London, 5th] It is believed here that Molotov had a long talk with the Kremlin last weekend to determine Soviet policy, so the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are eagerly watching today whether Molotov will cause the Foreign Ministers' Conference to break down. The delegations of Western countries are questioning whether the meeting this afternoon will determine whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can continue.

This morning, Marshall discussed with his delegation countermeasures for any possible actions by Molotov. Bevin also discussed the crisis of the Foreign Ministers' Conference with Prime Minister Attlee. Marshall's final decision depends on whether Molotov has changed his position after two days of cold reception.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The U.S. delegation participating in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference issued a statement denying that any U.S. gold industry had obtained German commercial property during the occupation period. This statement was submitted to the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on Saturday to answer questions from the Soviet Union. The statement said: The United States has previously suggested prohibiting foreign interests from acquiring all German property and suggested that each occupying country report to the Allied Management Committee on its policies on this point, as well as factual reports on changes in property ownership in each occupied area. Although this suggestion was not accepted, the United States has always adhered to this principle. The statement of the U.S. delegation further stated that the materials exported from the Anglo-American zone were all sold at world market prices, and none of the proceeds from the sale were obtained by the occupying powers, and were used to purchase the main items needed for the German economy to import into Germany. From January 1 to November 1 of this year, the total exports of the Anglo-American occupied area reached 165 million US dollars.

### Former British Conservative Politician Sir Baldwin Dies He Once Forced Edward VIII to Abdicate

[United Press, London, 14th] The Marquess of Baldwin, a former British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister three times, passed away in his sleep on the night of the 14th. After automatically relinquishing the position of Prime Minister in 1937, Baldwin settled in his old residence in Stanhope to spend his old age. He suffered from rheumatoid disease and was hemiplegic, and suffered from severe hearing loss.

Baldwin's Brief History

Sir Baldwin was born in 1867 and is exactly eighty years old this year. Baldwin has been a member of the House of Commons since he was elected in 1908, until he resigned as Prime Minister in 1937, having spent thirty years in his political career. He is a senior member of the Conservative Party and is considered a typical figure of British Conservatism. Between the two world wars, he served as Prime Minister three times, and had a significant impact on British political and financial affairs in recent decades. Baldwin began as a member of the House of Commons at the age of forty-one, and has represented his district for 29 years. He joined the cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1921. In 1923, when the Law Cabinet collapsed, Baldwin came out to form a cabinet, which was his first time serving as Prime Minister. Shortly thereafter, he stepped down due to the issue of guaranteeing tariffs. In 1924, he won the general election, and Baldwin again served as Prime Minister, until 1929. During this period, the construction of the Singapore Naval Base, the resolute severance of diplomatic relations with Russia, and the implementation of political blockade policies were all resolutely promoted by Baldwin. The great coal miners' strike in 1926 further realized his proclaimed "industrial peace and goodwill." In 1931, in order to cope with the financial crisis, McDonald led the organization of a coalition cabinet, and he provided a lot of help. In 1935, Baldwin served as Prime Minister for the third time.

In December 1936, he forced Edward VIII (i.e., the Duke of Windsor) to abdicate, and then retired himself, handing over the position to Chamberlain. At that time, Baldwin and the Archbishop of Canterbury forced Edward to choose between the throne and the beauty. Edward would rather abandon the throne and marry Mrs. Simpson, who had been divorced twice, becoming a timeless story of not loving the country but loving the beauty.

### Various Tax Rates to Be Increased Next Year Property Tax and Business Tax to Be Doubled Municipal Government Revenue to Increase by Approximately 40 Billion

All tax rates in the city will be comprehensively adjusted starting next year. The Ministry of Finance has already sent official documents to the Municipal Government to increase the following six items: property tax, business tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, vehicle license tax, and hospital prescription business tax. According to Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, who told the Dagong News reporter yesterday: This adjustment of tax rates is nationwide. The adjusted tax rates are as follows: The property tax will be doubled. The original tax of 5% is now 10%, and the original tax of 2.5% is now 5%. The business tax will be doubled. The original tax of 1.5% is now 3%, and the original tax of 3% is now 6%. The vehicle license tax (automobile license, etc.) is now increased to a minimum of 500,000 yuan and a maximum of more than 1 million yuan. The business license tax is increased tenfold. The original tax of 3/1000 is now 30/1000. The slaughter tax maintains the original tax rate of 5%, but increases the slaughter tax on cattle and horses. The banquet tax is increased by 5%, from the original 15% to 20%. The entertainment tax is increased by 5%, from the original 25% to 30%. However, the adjustment orders for banquet tax and entertainment tax have not yet arrived. Hospitals are charged a 3% business tax for prescriptions.

It is estimated that the Municipal Government's tax revenue will increase by more than 40 billion yuan next year after the tax rate is increased. However, according to Tian, even after the tax rate is increased, it will still be difficult to balance the Municipal Government's revenue and expenditure.

### Establishing a Special Committee to Handle Year-End Bonus Disputes, Two Extreme Factions Are Willing to Mediate

[Our Correspondent] To handle the year-end bonus issue for industries and businesses this year, the Social Affairs Bureau previously established a Research Committee on Year-End Bonus Issues. After convening industrial associations, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union to solicit opinions, a method was formulated and submitted to the Municipal Council for approval and implementation. The task of the Research Committee has now come to an end. Currently, the Bureau believes that it is inevitable that labor and management in various industries will have disagreements regarding year-end bonuses, leading to disputes. Therefore, it has decided to establish a special committee, named the Committee for Handling Year-End Bonus Issues, to be responsible for handling these disputes. The Bureau has appointed Lu Jingshi, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, as the chairman of the committee. Zhao Banfu is appointed as the vice-chairman, and Shen Ding, Fan Zhenbang, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Kaidi, Ling Yingzhen, Zhang Yongqin, and Gu Zusheng are appointed as committee members.

[Further News] Since the Municipal Council approved the method for distributing year-end bonuses to various factories and businesses in this city this year, stipulating one month's salary as the principle, calculated based on the index of that month, the industrial association first expressed that due to the economic downturn this year, they are unable to afford it. The General Labor Union also expressed disagreement with the points stipulating phased payments and allowing for amounts less than one month's salary, and both intend to appeal to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau separately. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that these are two extreme positions, and the Social Affairs Bureau will mediate to bring them together, and all issues must be resolved.

It is stipulated that bonuses will be issued according to last year's method, equivalent to one month's salary, and will be paid uniformly on January 15th of next year, calculated based on the cost of living index of that month. The payments on January 15th will be based on the December index of this year, with adjustments to be made after the January index is released.

Additionally, regarding the year-end bonus issue for the cotton textile industry in this city, labor and management attempted to negotiate on their own without success, and voluntarily convened at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon for further discussion. Zhao Banfu participated in the mediation. The management proposed three levels for the annual bonus: ten days, twelve and a half days, and fifteen days, which the labor side did not accept. Preliminary mediation did not yield any results, and it was decided to continue discussions tomorrow.

### Theft of Mail from the Longshun Steamer, Two Passengers Suspected and Detained for Investigation

[Our Correspondent] On the 8th of this month, while the Longshun steamer was sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, it was discovered that several postal bags out of the ten large parcels entrusted by the post office had been slashed open, and the contents were stolen. Subsequently, a passenger, beef vendor Wang Yongchang, was found hiding in the cargo hold. Due to strong suspicion, he was detained. On the 10th, the incident was telegraphed to the Shanghai Post Office Management Office, which reported it to the Port Police Station. On the morning of the 11th, when the ship arrived in port, officers were dispatched to investigate. It was found that there was also a cotton quilt, a pair of woolen shoes, a Russian-style hat, and a bundle next to the postal bags. Under the cotton quilt, twelve bolts of Changdang brand colored cloth, a grass-green military blanket, and three wooden boxes of various sizes that had fallen out of the postal bags were discovered. Members of the post office were sent to identify and claim the above-mentioned cloth and other items. At this time, Ye Jingduo, who had previously posed as a public official while wearing a uniform, stepped forward and claimed that the cotton quilt belonged to his friend, who had gone ashore to buy cigarettes, and that he intended to collect it on his friend's behalf. The police station suspected that Ye was also involved, and took both suspects, Wang and Ye, into custody. They were later transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the prosecutor held a hearing. Wang Yongchang stated that he had purchased a third-class ticket and that the cabin was extremely crowded. Due to the strong sea breeze outside, he had no choice but to find a gap in the cargo hold to rest, and denied any theft. Ye Jingduo stated that he had previously served as a soldier in the salt tax police corps in Wenzhou Haimen and other places and was currently working as a freelance laborer. He had purchased a fake seal of the Tianfu Management Office of Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, for 1,000 yuan and wore it to buy half-price tickets. He also denied theft. The prosecutor ordered both men to be temporarily detained and scheduled another hearing.

### The Crux of the Fisheries Dispute, Unideal Distribution, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Has No Authority to Deal With It, Minister Zuo Suggests Two Points

[Our Correspondent] This reporter inquired about the handling of the fisheries dispute in this city with Minister Zuo Shunsheng. According to him, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has no authority to deal with this matter. He believes that the crux of this dispute lies not in overproduction, but in unideal distribution. If the Fisheries Management Office can supply fish to cities other than Shanghai on a wider scale, increasing production further would not seem to be a problem. During his visit to Shanghai, he suggested two points to the newly appointed Director of the Fisheries Management Office, Zhao Junmai: CNRRA should expand the fish market outside of Shanghai as much as possible. CNRRA should use new equipment to focus on fish processing, such as making salted fish or canned fish, for distribution to the interior. He believes that this approach is beneficial and harmless to the Fisheries Management Office, and private fishing companies can avoid going bankrupt due to excessive losses. He believes that this matter will be appropriately discussed at today's Jiangzhe Fisheries Improvement Conference. However, he has not received any complaints or requests from the private fisheries sector. Due to urgent matters within the Ministry, he returned to Nanjing by overnight train last night.

In the afternoon, the meeting continued at the Bankers Association, where the rules of procedure were adopted, and then divided into four groups: administration, construction, economy, and technology, to review proposals.

### Shenyang Textile Factory Staff Impersonating CNRRA to Commit Fraud, Air Freight of Dyes Worth Over 100 Billion, Extensive Involvement, Complex Inside Story, Liu Tianhong and Other Three Detained and Sent to the District Court for Questioning

[Our Correspondent] Liu Tianhong, director of the Shanghai office of the state-owned Shenyang Textile Factory, along with employees Chen Shanmin, Zhang Jingqiu, and Chen Jinping, impersonated the Northeast Branch of the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and entrusted the Chennault Air Transport Command to transport 319 barrels of dyes, each weighing 603 catties. The barrels were all painted with the words "Northeast Branch of the CNRRA". The Air Transport Command dispatched eight aircraft to transport the dyes. The planes took off from Panyang and first landed at Beijing Airport, where 43 barrels of dyes were unloaded. The remaining 276 barrels flew directly to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the CNRRA had received a tip-off in advance and sent people to wait at Jiangwan Airport. When the plane landed, they immediately detained it in conjunction with the police bureau. Liu and the other three were arrested one after another, while Chen Jinping fled upon hearing the news. The police bureau, on the grounds that Liu and the others were all civil servants, transferred the suspects and stolen goods to the District Court for trial yesterday on charges of special criminal corruption. It is reported that the value of the dyes is over 100 billion yuan, involving the Panyang Textile Factory, the Air Transport Command, the Northeast Branch of the CNRRA and other agencies, and the inside story is extremely complex. The case is being heard by Judge Meng Tingke, and a hearing is scheduled to be held within this week.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's 75th Anniversary, Speaker Pan Expresses His Thoughts

[Our Correspondent] Today marks the 75th anniversary of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. When a reporter asked Speaker Pan Gongzhan for his thoughts, Pan said: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) were established almost at the same time, but before the war, the scale of the two was vastly different. The Japanese ships' routes covered the globe, while the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's routes did not go beyond the rivers and seas within the country. We are deeply ashamed. Few Qing Dynasty officials were willing to think about protecting the shipping industry and recovering profits like Li Hongzhang, and few people in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company over the years had the courage and boldness of Sheng Xuanhuai to acquire all the assets of the American-owned Russell & Company. This is an inherent and fatal wound. Fortunately, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was liberated due to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and it is hoped that it can be revived. The company's demobilization preparations during the Anti-Japanese War and the demobilization work achieved after the victory are even more commendable. The six ships that fortunately escaped the robbery in the Sichuan River were able to overcome difficulties and be completely repaired. They were used for the transportation of military personnel and public servants, and the macro benefits were achieved, which could not be achieved by other transportation agencies. This is one. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's assets were almost completely mortgaged. The eight years of bloody battle resulted in even greater debts, especially the debts of foreign banks. After the victory, at a time when financial resources were exhausted, it resolutely made repaying the price its top priority. After more than a year of negotiations, it was able to pay off all debts, and all the deeds that had been pledged were also fully recovered. From then on, the company's foundation became stronger, and it was able to focus on developing its shipping business. The quick resolution is unmatched by ordinary banks for those who have outstanding debts and unresolved lawsuits. This is two. After the revival, it happened that the country had many misfortunes, the Communist bandits were operating, and roads were destroyed everywhere. Waterborne military and public transportation became more frequent, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's battle was particularly difficult. Today, Qingdao is still preserved, Yantai has been recovered, and the entire Northeast has not yet fallen completely into the hands of the bandits, which cannot be said to be due to the company's rapid military transportation. If shipping rights had not been recovered by now and foreign ships could not be requisitioned, I am afraid that the rampant Communist bandits would be even more unimaginable. This is three. Although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is state-owned, it can coexist harmoniously with private shipping companies, cooperate sincerely, and have equal rights and obligations. Compared with other state-owned enterprises, they do not compete with the people for profit, but instead fight each other, resulting in both sides being hurt in the past, which cannot be compared. This is four. Just these four points can be considered the longevity of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. We should hope that after celebrating its 75th anniversary, the company will strive to serve the public and develop ocean shipping routes with the spirit of its old age, in order to fulfill its due mission.

### Celebrations Held by All Branches Nationwide

### A Disaster Ridden, Twist-Filled Saga: The Whole Story of the Pukou-Jinan Section Opening to Traffic - Special Correspondent of This Newspaper

— Ling Songshou

[Aviation News from Jinan, This Newspaper, 11th] On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway main line, Cangxian to the north bank of the Yellow River, Tai'an to Hanzhuang, and the areas north and south of Bengbu have all been thoroughly destroyed by the communist bandits, cutting the line into three sections. When the government issued a ceasefire order on January 13, 1946, only three sections of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were able to operate: Tianjin to Cangxian, Jinan to Tai'an, and Hanzhuang to Pukou. What is most heartbreaking is that the equipment of the three major coal mines along the line in Zibo, Southern Xintai, and Zaozhuang were all destroyed by the communist bandits. Due to the overall coal shortage, thousands of train wheels stopped turning, and the entire railway's transportation entered a state of paralysis.

After the ceasefire order was issued, the communist bandits not only did not stop their rebellious acts of harming the people's livelihood and damaging the nation's vitality but also intensified their efforts to occupy stations, detain vehicles, seize ticket revenue, and set up their own railway bureaus, thereby disrupting the entire railway management system. When the Executive Headquarters was in Tai'an, there was once an agreement to rush repairs southward, but when the repairs reached Dakou, they were again obstructed by the bandit army, and the bandit army even captured nine stations between Tai'an and Chaomidian.

The evolution of the situation to this point has in fact demonstrated the ambition and intentions of the communist bandits. They absolutely do not want this major north-south artery to be smoothly restored and contribute to the stability of the people's livelihood.

Following the development of the military situation, the Railway Bureau decided to disregard all dangers and difficulties and began construction northward from Hanzhuang on October 9, 1946. By October 24, they had reached Lincheng. Based on the abundance of materials at that time and the enthusiasm of the employees, they could have continued to rush repairs forward. However, the flames of war north of Lincheng had not yet subsided, so they had to temporarily stop.

This spring, the war situation in Shandong took a sharp turn for the worse, and Xingzhou, an important town in southern Shandong, was also relieved. Thus, starting from March 11, repairs began from Lincheng towards Yanzhou. After 56 days of work, the great task of opening the Xuzhou-Zhaqian section to traffic was finally completed on May 18.

The section from Yanzhou to Jinan is 143 kilometers long. Because this section is near the mountainous area of Mount Tai, there are not only many curves and steep slopes, but also the bridges along the line are very high and long. For example, the Da Wen River Bridge is more than half a kilometer long, and the remaining bridges, such as the Shidian Bridge and the Jin River Bridge, are all between 14 meters and 18 meters in height. This section of the project is the most difficult section of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Railway project.

Driven by hot blood and a sense of responsibility.

The 42,000 employees of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau did not flinch due to the harsh environment and the enormity of the project. Before the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section was opened to traffic, they began the earthwork for the Jinan-Yanzhou section. Track laying and bridge construction began on May 31. The initial plan was to work simultaneously from Yanzhou in the south and Jinan in the north, in order to complete the work as soon as possible. However, at that time, the Jiaoji Railway had been interrupted for the second time, and Jinan had become an isolated island. The transportation of materials was extremely difficult. Therefore, the employees who were evacuated from the Jiaoji Railway were used to dismantle the minor branch lines near Jinan and lay and nail the tracks. By the end of July, they had reached the south side of Gangshan Station, and the materials were exhausted. This group of people was then transferred south to Yanzhou to participate in the work of rushing repairs northward from Yanzhou.

The progress of this part of the project from Yanzhou northward was quite smooth. By July 10, the tracks had been laid to the south bank of the Houhe River. However, because the area south of Dakou South Station was filled with war clouds at that time, work was forced to stop for two months. Work resumed on September 10. Fourteen days later, the most difficult project—the temporary bridge of the Da Wen River Bridge—was almost completed. Who knew that a heavy rain on the night of the 23rd caused a mountain flood, which washed away the temporary bridge that was about to be completed. It was not until October 6 that it was completed and opened to traffic. The track laying work continued for a month and had already reached the foot of Mount Tai. Unexpectedly, the traffic between Xuzhou and Bengbu was interrupted twice, and the supply of materials could not keep up, causing a slight delay. After the traffic on the southern section was restored, the work

accelerated forward, and finally, at 11:00 p.m. on November 29, the rails were connected at kilometer 384 to 400, north of Zhangxia Station. More than two years have passed since the victory, and this disaster-ridden railway has finally completed its most difficult part after many twists and turns.

I boarded the special ceremony train and looked at the tracks extending towards Pukou and the broken walls and ruins on both sides of the railway, as well as several severely damaged bridges. I really couldn't describe what kind of mood I was in. The reporter saw Captain An Wenlan on the special train. He told me about the situation on the night of the rail connection. The Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications to complete the rail connection and open the line to traffic before November 30. Captain An was determined to complete it on the 29th. That night, when their work was still 1.7 kilometers away, there was suddenly intelligence that a group of bandits was coming to disturb them. After careful consideration, Captain An said to all the employees, "There is no sound of dogs barking in the surrounding villages, which is enough to show that this intelligence is not accurate." So he continued to work and finally completed it that day. In fact, at that time, An himself could not judge what the bandit situation was like. However, in order to achieve the final goal of

connecting the rails and opening the line to traffic, he had no choice but to use this to stabilize the morale of the employees and complete this final part of the work.

When the Da Wen River Bridge was being built, due to a sudden downpour, the water level suddenly rose, and the waves surged, resulting in more than 70 people falling into the water. Those who continued to build, several employees braved the deep autumn cold water, stripped naked and entered the water, resulting in illness, and are still under treatment.

### Eight Bandits Came to Suzhou, Buying Weapons and Were Arrested

[Suzhou This Newspaper, 15th] The Suzhou Garrison Command received a report that communist bandits from northern Jiangsu were disguising themselves as self-defense forces from Rugao County to sneak into the Suzhou-Shanghai area to purchase weapons. After days of careful investigation, yesterday, they successively arrested eight key criminals, including Zhang Fangce, who falsely claimed to be the captain of the 34th Company of the 12th Brigade of Rugao County. They also seized two rifles and various bullets that were waiting to be transported. The arrested criminals confessed to the arms trafficking and stated that they had already shipped out one machine gun and several pistols and rifles. The main culprit, Yan Yusheng, is hiding in Shanghai, and personnel have been dispatched to arrest him. Today, various military and police agencies are still cooperating in the search and arrest.

The Pukou-Jinan section has finally opened to traffic thanks to the blood and sweat of millions of people. As the reporter took the first direct train from Pukou to Jinan, passing through various cities and towns along the way, countless people accepted the excitement brought by this train and the bright future that was about to come with smiling expressions.

### Zhenjiang Plainclothes Police Arrest the "Noodle King"

[Zhenjiang This Newspaper, 14th] The drug dealer Li Yadong was a member of the puppet investigation team during the enemy-puppet period and specialized in trafficking drugs, earning him the nickname "White Noodle King." After the victory, he continued to use his smooth-talking skills to collude with illegal soldiers to cover up drug trafficking, and he has not yet desisted. The Provincial Police Department received a secret report and conducted a thorough investigation. Because the criminal had extensive connections and his illegal organization was quite large, the arrest procedure was also carefully planned. On the 13th, the Inspection Office of the Bureau dispatched personnel to set up a plainclothes police net at the intersection of Daxilu and Binta Road. Sure enough, Li Yadong came riding a bicycle and was arrested on the spot. Five bags of white noodles were found on his person. He was escorted to the Judicial Section of the Provincial Police Department for interrogation. The large-scale drug trafficking organization has also been detected, and there will be further arrests soon.

### Cotton Merchant Representatives Visit Chairman Yuan of the Textile Adjustment Committee; Report on Cotton Transportation and Sales Situation; Unified Purchase Measures Can Be Implemented Once Approved by the Central Government

[Report from our newspaper] Representatives from the Shanghai Cotton Commercial Association, including Liu Pingsun and Zou Zhecheng, visited Chairman Yuan of the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday at 3:30 PM. Mr. Liu and others reported in detail on the recent cotton transportation and sales situation: The cotton purchasing season has only one and a half months left this year. If the announcement of the unified purchase measures is delayed, it will affect the cotton picking season. Transportation on the Longhai, Pinghan, and other railways, as well as in various cotton-producing areas, is frequently blocked, so timely emergency transportation should be carried out. Currently, the cost of transporting cotton from Hankou to Shanghai already accounts for half of the cost. Although Shanghai cotton merchants currently have goods arriving, various yarn factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude because the unified purchase is imminent and are not purchasing. On the one hand, the unified purchase measures have not yet been promulgated, and the unified purchase organization has not been established, so cotton merchants are feeling financially strained. It is hoped that under the future unified purchase situation, the position of the cotton merchants will still be taken into account.

Chairman Yuan indicated that the unified purchase measures can be implemented as soon as they are approved by the central government. In the future, the unified purchase measures will still be willing to use the original cotton purchasing agencies, including cotton merchants. Applications will be made by various agencies to purchase on behalf of the government in various locations, according to the regulations. Chairman Yuan finally expressed the hope that cotton merchants would continue to purchase cotton, and the Control Committee would definitely not allow cotton merchants to suffer losses.

Another report: The implementation measures for cotton yarn and cloth management, after being drafted by Chairman Yuan Liang and others of the Textile Adjustment Committee, are now being personally submitted to Nanjing by Mr. Yuan for approval today. Once approved, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee can be prepared to be established and actively carry out its work.

### Price of Textile Construction Allocation Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Initially Stable, Then Lower

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday in the yarn market, Textile Construction opened for sale as usual, and the allocation price was unchanged. The market situation was initially stable, then lower. Near closing, it rebounded slightly, but as a result, 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn fell 200,000 compared to Saturday's closing price, falling to 49 million. In addition, various counts of coarse and fine yarns mostly fell back.

Another report: The China Textile Construction Company and the Textile Adjustment Committee sold yarn separately yesterday as usual, resulting in a total sale of 1,720 pieces of various counts of yarn, equivalent to 2,295 pieces of spun yarn. There were a total of 649 applicants.

The price of various counts of yarn sold yesterday, the 20-count yarn sold by Textile Construction, was still calculated at 28.11 million. The Textile Adjustment Committee sold yarn in the cotton yarn market, with a reserve price of 31.6 million for 20-count Hong Kuixing.

Cloth Steady

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was mostly stable, but there were few customers. Internal traders were unable to make any progress. Near closing, there were occasional scattered transactions, and as a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, continued to rise compared to Saturday, from 5,000 to 14,000. Serge sales were relatively strong, also rising 5,000 to 10,000, while the market for other cloths was firm and steady.

Spot Cotton Quiet

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet, with few transactions. Yarn factories were short on cash, and traders were also short on funds. Sellers were holding on to their goods, so transactions stalled.

### Committee of Private Textile Factories in the Rear Area Hosts the Press; Plans to Request Three Points from the Authorities

[Report from our newspaper] The Committee for the Resumption of Private Textile Factories in the Rear Area hosted the press in the city yesterday at the address of the Textile Federation. More than ten representatives from various factories attended, including Shi Fengxiang, Li Jiyao, Zhu Xianfang, and Shi Xueheng.

During the War of Resistance, the various private yarn factories in the rear area, including Yuhua, Yufeng, Dahua, Zhenhuan, and Shenxin No. 4 Factory, suffered significant losses, totaling sixteen units, while also making great contributions to supplying military and civilian needs. Now, two years after the victory, the situation of these factories is still extremely difficult, and the government has not yet provided any assistance. It has recently been heard that the state-owned Textile Construction Company will soon sell off private enterprises, so it is planned to request three points from the authorities, with the following steps:

Request priority purchase rights (this point has recently been approved by the National Economic Council). Please ask the government to implement priority purchase rights as soon as possible. It is hoped that representatives can be dispatched to attend the valuation and sale committee's subcommittee meetings, so as to contribute opinions.

### Exchange Brokerage Houses That Stop Trading Must Have Their Licenses Revoked

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has provided a specific explanation regarding whether the business licenses of exchange brokerage houses that have stopped trading should be revoked, stating that "Since the announcement of the economic emergency measures, any exchange brokerage house that stops trading must have its business license revoked, and there is no possibility of resuming trading."

### Source Stagnant, Production Area Prices High; Rice Market Prices Soar Again; Rice Rationing for Poor Households to Be Increased Next Phase

[Report from our newspaper] The rice market was relatively stagnant yesterday, with a total arrival of 12,363.6 shi.

### British Merchants Order Keemun Black Tea

[Report from our newspaper] The Four Banks Joint Treasury has approved a two-month mortgage period for export boxed tea mortgages this year. Any tea that is not redeemed after the mortgage period will be handled according to the processing measures. The mortgaged boxed tea has been expiring continuously since the 20th of last month. The Shanghai Export Association wired the Four Banks Joint Treasury requesting a two-month extension due to export difficulties, but it was not approved. Now, tea companies are rushing to raise funds to redeem the large batch of mortgaged boxed tea that is due to expire on the 13th of this month, fearing that it will be processed, but the issue of exporting after redemption is causing much hesitation. It has been learned that the Anhui Tea Company recently sent samples to London, England, to actively promote sales, and yesterday received a reply from there, stating that they were ordering several hundred boxes of Keemun black tea, which could be packaged and exported in the near future. This is the beginning of Keemun black tea producers exporting to the United Kingdom.

Another report: Yesterday's tea market: Domestic sales and export tea trading were almost completely stagnant. Due to the impact of the rain, both buyers and sellers were hesitant to move forward. In this situation, the overall trend was one of consistent calmness and immutability.

### Outside Speculative Funds Infiltrate; Chinese Stocks Generally Rise

Chinese stocks initially weakened yesterday, then rebounded. After the infiltration of speculative funds from outside the industry, small-cap and miscellaneous stocks showed their strength, causing a general rise. Evergreen Silk and other major stocks, however, lagged behind, and the future continued to look uncertain.

Initially in the morning, there were no signs of changes in exchange rates, and the unfavorable effects of checking warehouses and controlling brokerage houses suddenly arose. Evergreen Silk opened at 433 yuan and 446 yuan. After opening, it rose to 436 yuan and 449 yuan, then retreated to a low of 428 yuan for immediate delivery and 437 yuan for deferred delivery. China Enamel for both prompt and deferred delivery were at their daily limit. Evergreen Silk rose to 438 yuan and 452 yuan, then declined slightly to 432 yuan and 444 yuan, the off-exchange finally squeezed shorts, higher than the on-exchange by as much as 10 yuan, sentiment was brisk, the number of small-cap stocks was extremely low, even easier to increase, all kinds of hot money absorbed endlessly, a dazzling scene. Zhabei Underwear, Tongyi, China Silk, and Firewood first forcibly reached the rising limit in the chaos, followed by Yonggong, Tongyi, French Business, New Hundred, China Textile, Jinglun, Lianan, and Huaxin raising high to the upper limit. Near noon, Evergreen Silk rose to a high of 466 yuan for prompt delivery and 480 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at 461 yuan and 475.3 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Evergreen Silk rose less than half a percent, China Xing rose slightly, China Cement and New Asia were flat, Xinhe, American Asia, New Guang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Wuhe each rose strongly by 10%, Zhabei, French, Xinhua Underwear, Datong, Rongfeng, and China Textile rose after hitting the limit, squeezing up 10% to 15%, Xinhua, China Enamel, Lianan, Firewood Business, China Silk, and Tongyi reached the daily limit. For deferred delivery shares, China Enamel and Yonggong reached the daily limit, Xinhe, American Asia, Jingfu, New Guang, and Qinxing each rose strongly by 10%, and Evergreen Silk rose half a percent.

The after-market continues to be brisk, with as many as sixteen kinds of stocks hitting the upper limit during the morning session. Evergreen Silk advanced to new highs of 475 yuan and 485 yuan, and then fell back to lows of 466 yuan and 472 yuan. Although it later advanced to 470 yuan and 480 yuan, with many National Bank trades in and out, it fell to 461 yuan and 467 yuan, with settlement and then exits. The closing price was 464 yuan and 468 yuan, with only China Enamel, Xinhua, Jinglun, China Cement, and China Textile rising to the limit, and the rest falling back. As a result, compared to the morning closing price for prompt delivery shares, Qinxing and Yonggong were flat, New Asia rose half a percent, Huaxin, Zhabei, Xinhe, New Guang, Jingfu, Underwear, Lianan, Firewood China Silk, Tongyi, and Rongfeng slightly retreated, China Enamel, Xinhua, China Cement, Jinglun, and Business rose to the limit, the rest all rose slightly.

Off-exchange old shares Xinxin and Shanghai Cement rose 10%, as did Wuzhou, Dasheng and Culture shares each rose half a percent.

### Paper Production Increase Plan Decided; Bright White Paper and Wood Pulp Will Increase Greatly

[Report from our newspaper] The National Economic Council convened a paper production increase conference on the 12th and 13th of this month, attended by more than thirty representatives from government agencies, private factories, and agricultural land. After two days of research and discussion, the following important resolutions were produced:

Increase Production: This year's domestic production of white paper is 66,000 tons, and it is planned to increase it to 110,000 tons next year. This year's production of paperboard is 50,000 tons, and it is projected to increase to 70,000 tons next year, for a total increase of approximately 70,000 tons, hoping that half of it will be used for newspapers.

Increase Wood Pulp Production: In addition to preparing to import 50,000 tons next year, it is also planned to increase the production of domestic factories and establish new wood pulp mills. There will be a total of five new mills: Qingdao Mill, producing 20 tons per day; Shanghai Mill, producing 30 to 50 tons per day; Zhejiang Mill, producing 20 tons per day; another mechanical wood pulp mill will be established, producing 30 tons per day; Tianjin Mill will produce 10 to 25 tons per day; Hunan Mill will produce 50 tons per day. In addition, the Tainan Paper Mill has decided to implement an increase in production. It is expected that after four months, it will be able to produce 60 tons of bagasse pulp per day, but with the prerequisite of having coal, because the raw material is easily obtained with coal. The Yibin China Paper Mill will be able to produce 5 tons of fir pulp per day after six months, and 40 tons per day after a year and a half.

The meeting also decided that convenience in foreign exchange settlements should be given to machines used to manufacture wood pulp and newspaper. Among the various materials used in papermaking, uranium copper wire netting will be allowed to be imported. Blankets used for manufacturing high-quality paper will also be allowed to be imported, while blankets used for manufacturing lower-quality paper will be restricted. Canvas that China cannot manufacture itself will also be allowed to be imported.

In addition, it is planned to open one copper wire blanket factory and one copper wire netting factory. The foreign exchange needed will be provided by the government, while the working capital will be raised by private factories. Regarding the future supply of copper wire netting, blankets, and canvas, it was decided to organize a material supply committee, jointly composed of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the National Resources Commission, and representatives from various regions, to conduct a joint review.

According to Chen Taoxin, head of the Chemical Engineering Section of the Guidance Office, who attended the meeting, if all parties can cooperate, China will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in paper within two to three years under this plan. In the future, imported paper will in principle be limited to three categories: newsprint, cigarette paper, and cellophane; among them, cigarette paper consumes an average of 100,000 rolls per month, but the Minfeng Paper Mill can produce 60,000 to 80,000 rolls next year, and it is hoped that imports can be gradually reduced within one to two years, and eventually completely self-sufficient.

There were two major gains from the meeting convened by the National Economic Council. One was that without the above plan, the Qingdao Mill might shut down next year, and paper production in the city would decrease, and the paper mills in southwestern Taiwan would only be able to maintain their current status; the other was that the implementation of the production increase plan would save a lot of foreign exchange, which could be used to purchase papermaking equipment.

Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market trended upwards due to a slight increase in digestion, white sugar continued to rise 4-67,000, red sugar rose 3-45,000 per package. The Guild traded, two-four coarse white large bags were 1.278 million yuan, two-zero medium sand white was 1.23 million yuan, Taiwan red was 1.23 million yuan, totaling a hundred or so packages. Xinghua white high goods were 1.225 million yuan without any, Louzhuang was 1.189 million yuan, Xing red was 1.12 million yuan to 100,000 yuan, totaling over eight hundred items. Diao Qing was 880,000, totaling over three hundred packages.

Commercial Briefs

The China Trust Bureau's auction of enemy property in November yielded a total of 150 billion yuan, 50 billion yuan more than the previous month.

Jin Guobao, head of the accounting department of the National Bank, went to the United States in August to attend the International Statistical Congress and has returned to China after completing his work, arriving in Shanghai on the 14th.

Yesterday, cigarette prices initially fell and then rebounded. Ten Sticks of Gouying Old Knife No. 2 cigarettes were up 350,000 to 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes were also firmer.

Daily necessities soap, trading was still good, Gu Ben, Arrow, Xiangmao, soft Guanghua, Niupai, and Tingli, etc., strongly increased by 5-670,000 yuan, the match market was also not prosperous.

In the timber market, cedar wood was firm due to rising prices in the production areas, and the market price has exceeded 5,000 yuan.

According to statistics from the Qingdao Port Authority: In November, the total volume of imports and exports was 60,181 tons, of which coal accounted for an estimated 30%, followed by flour, wood, and fish. Exports totaled 18,544 tons, of which salt and cotton yarn each accounted for an estimated 82%, followed by alcohol.

### Yan Fu and Hegel

— Zuo Yu

Mr. Yan Jidao holds an extremely high position in the Chinese intellectual world. Yan's contributions to the introduction of new Western ideas at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China were significant. I remember when I was a child, I studied at a senior primary school in my hometown, and a teacher named Li, with slightly newer ideas, taught us Yan's translation of Evolution and Ethics. I read it and liked it, and I could almost recite the whole article. Later, in middle school and university, Yan's famous translations, such as A System of Sociology, On Liberty, Mill's Logic, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, became the object of my search and study. This was not only because I liked the novelty of the ideas, but also because I liked the elegance and rigor of the writing. When students of the early Republic wrote, they would often use phrases such as "survival of the fittest" at the drop of a hat, which was undoubtedly influenced by Mr. Yan. Looking back today at China's New Culture Movement, Mr. Yan's contribution cannot be denied.

Judging from the various books translated by Mr. Yan, the Western thought introduced by Mr. Yan seems to be limited to the evolutionism and utilitarianism of 19th-century England. Such as Spencer, such as Huxley, were speakers of evolution. Such as Adam Smith, such as Mill, were speakers of utilitarianism. Mr. Yan should be held responsible for the introduction of evolutionism and utilitarianism into China. Mr. Yan has no special books introducing the orthodox schools of Western philosophy, such as Kant and Hegel. This is why those who speak of orthodox Western philosophy today feel quite regretful. Those who discuss Mr. Yan also mistakenly believe that Mr. Yan was unaware of the theories of Kant and Hegel because Mr. Yan did not translate the works of Kant and Hegel. In fact, although Mr. Yan did not translate the works of Kant and Hegel, he was not unaware of the theories of Kant and Hegel, nor was he completely unfamiliar with them. Mr. Yan once wrote an article entitled "On Hegel's Idealism," which was published in the second issue of The Chinese Students' Quarterly. This article is little known, and it is not included in the collection of Mr. Yan's writings. When we read Mr. Yan's article, we know that Mr. Yan has a deep understanding of Hegel's theories. The author's note at the end of the article is especially sufficient to show Mr. Yan's understanding of orthodox Western thought. Here is a special record of his author's note as follows:

"Yan Fu said that the European theory of mind and nature underwent a change with Descartes, and a second change with Kant. Since then, all those like Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer have promoted what Kant invented. However, there are also people who have made progress, which is sufficient to make up for what previous philosophers have not achieved. And Hegel and Schopenhauer have gained even more. Therefore, they have been able to establish their own theories, and German philosophy has competed with ancient Greece in terms of brilliance. The reason why Kant is regarded as the supreme master of modern philosophy is that he clarified that the two things of the universe are the good abilities of the human mind, and the human mind is like the five senses to the form. If space and time are indeed internal and not from the outside, then the theory of 'the world is created by the mind' by Gautama, and the Confucian doctrine of 'achieving balance and harmony, the heavens and the earth are in their proper places, and all things are nurtured,' are all clear and unambiguous, and are explanations that cannot be erased. Hegel was based on this theory, so the theory of idealism arose. In ancient times, the theory of transformation was based on the idea that what is internal is the divine, and what is external is the material, and the two do not conspire with each other and are completely separate. But Hegel believed that everything is in the mind, but the subject and object have different views. This combines the theories of Kant and Descartes. From this, the phenomena of ancient and modern history, ups and downs, changes and subtractions, are all the actions of objective psychology. However, there is order in it, so the evolution is to move towards a state of mind without opposition, which I have translated as 'Imperial Ultimate.' Therefore, his theory of transformation is often a borrowed arrow for modern evolutionists, and it also has points of intersection with the subtle words and exquisite meanings of our country's past sages. (Such as Zhang Hengqu's saying: 'Establishing a heart for the earth,' try to ask where the heart of heaven and earth is seen?) Hegel wrote many theories, and later scholars often find them difficult to read. In the summer of Bingwu, I returned to Shanghai from Anhui. Just as The Chinese Students' Quarterly was published, the president, Mr. Li Denghui, and others came to me to ask for writing, writing seven or eight letters before and after, almost unable to stop, so I reluctantly waved my sweat and revealed Hegel's essence as above. The discussion is limited to the two minds of living and objective, and there is still no time to discuss the mind without opposition."

Although this author's note is only a few hundred words, it cannot be said by those who have not entered the door of orthodox Western thought. That Mr. Yan had researched Hegel, can be clearly demonstrated here. In addition, there are one or two points in Mr. Yan's translation of Hegel's philosophical terms that are also worth noting. For example, Dialectic is usually translated as dialectics, which is not very satisfactory. Zhang Dongsheng once translated it as "opposed performance method", He Sa once translated it as "contradiction method", and Yan Fu translated it as "mutual generation". Moreover : "Hegel's dialectics, that the conflicting principles generate each other. For example, the stricter the rules, the more secret the means of trickery. What Lao Tzu said, is mostly this kind of name studies." This translation is one that has not been noticed by recent people. Also, Absolute is usually translated as absolute, He Lin once translated it as Taiji, and Yan Fu translated it as "Imperial Ultimate". Which is better, Taiji or Imperial Ultimate, is not easy to judge lightly. The author knew that many people know that Mr. Yan has a deep relationship with evolutionism and utilitarianism, but do not know that he also has research on Hegel's philosophy, so I will briefly explain it as above.

### Russell's Childhood - Xie Youwei

·One of Russell's Autobiographies·

The British philosopher Bertrand Russell is one of the greatest thinkers of our time. His scholarship and writings have long been known to the Chinese people. He once came to China to lecture and had a considerable influence on China's intellectual circles. His scholarship is very broad; he is not only a philosopher but also a scientist. He discusses political issues, social issues, and educational issues. His discussions are never conventional and are always innovative. He is now nearly eighty years old, still alive and well, and still writing constantly. Just two years ago, he published a monumental work of over eight hundred pages: *A History of Western Philosophy*. His energy is astonishing. How did he achieve his current position? What was his academic journey like? What were the stages of his intellectual development? These are all things that are worth knowing. Recently, in the *Library of Living Philosophers*, edited by Northwestern University in the United States, there is "The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell," including Russell's autobiography, titled "My Mental Development," which details his personal academic journey. It provides a clear account of the reasons for his intellectual transformations in his early, middle, and later years. It seems that anyone who studies knowledge should read it. Unfortunately, the article is too long to introduce in its entirety. I intend to divide it into three sections and describe them succinctly. Now, let's start by describing his childhood thoughts and life.

Russell was born into an aristocratic family. His grandfather, Lord John Russell, had served as the British Foreign Secretary. His father, Lord Amberley Russell, had also served as a member of the British Parliament. Russell lost both parents early in life. He was only three years old when his father died, and only two years old when his mother died. He was raised by his grandfather. His thoughts seem to have been directly unaffected by his parents, but strangely, his thoughts had many similarities to his father's. He was a liberal, and his father was also a liberal. His father strongly believed in the doctrines of John Stuart Mill, advocating for women's suffrage and birth control. He had no enthusiasm for religion; his father also did not believe in Christianity at the age of twenty-one and did not attend church. Even his mother was very progressive in her thinking and advocated for gender equality. If a person's thoughts can be inherited, Russell's thoughts are an example of such inheritance.

Russell believed that he was greatly influenced by his grandmother in his childhood. His grandmother was a Puritan and lived a very austere life. She did not value clothing or food, and she was especially opposed to drinking alcohol and smoking. She wanted her descendants to be useful and virtuous people, but she did not want them to pursue worldly glory. She believed in the dignity of private judgment and individual conscience. On his twelfth birthday, Russell's grandmother gave him a Bible, which Russell still keeps to this day. In this Bible, his grandmother wrote down many of her favorite maxims from the Bible, one of which was, "You shall not follow a crowd to do evil;" and another was, "Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." Russell said that these maxims "deeply influenced my life, and even after I stopped believing in God, they seemed to retain some meaning."

When Russell was eleven years old, he began to read Euclid's *Elements*. At first, he was quite disappointed with Euclid because Euclid started with axioms, and axioms had to be accepted without proof. But after reading it, he was very happy with it. Therefore, during his entire childhood, most of his interest was concentrated on mathematics. He said that his interest in mathematics was due to complex reasons: partly because he discovered that he had a certain knack for it, partly because he liked the power of deductive reasoning, and partly because of the quiet certainty of mathematics; but the main reason (when he was still young) was because he believed that nature operated according to mathematical laws, and if we had enough skill, human actions, like the movements of celestial bodies, could be predicted. He said that at the age of fifteen, he came up with a theory very similar to that of Descartes. He firmly believed that the actions of organisms were completely governed by mechanical laws; therefore, the doctrine of free will must be false. However, he could not accept materialism because he believed that consciousness was an undeniable "datum." At this time, he still believed in God because he thought that the First Cause Argument for God's existence was irrefutable.

Russell did not attend school in his childhood. His early education was entirely provided by private tutors. He was taught by several German and Swiss nannies and governesses, and later by English tutors at home. He said that at the age of fourteen or fifteen, he had a strong interest in religion. He gradually began to study the arguments for free will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of God. His life was very lonely. He felt that there was no one he could talk to. He could only write down what he had learned in his diary in Greek letters, and he dared not tell anyone. For a full three years, his mind was focused on religious issues. First, he abandoned the doctrine of free will, and then he abandoned the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, but it was not until he was eighteen years old that he stopped believing in God. The reason was that at that time, he happened to read Mill's autobiography, which said, "My father taught me that the question, 'Who made me?' cannot be answered, because this question immediately raises another question, 'Who made God?'" Thus, he decided that the First Cause Argument for God's existence was wrong.

During his home education, Russell read a wide range of books. No one guided his reading, so he felt that he had read many useless books. He had read many bad poems, especially those of Tennyson and Byron. It was not until he was seventeen that he found Shelley's poems to read. For many years, Shelley was his favorite ancient writer. He had also read many of Carlyle's essays, especially admiring his book *Past and Present*. He agreed most with Mill. Mill's books, such as *Principles of Political Economy*, *On Liberty*, and *The Subjection of Women*, had deeply influenced him. He had also carefully read Mill's *Logic* and written many marginal notes. But he could not agree with Mill's claim that mathematical propositions are empirical generalizations, although he still did not know what mathematical propositions could be.

It was not until he was eighteen that he entered Cambridge University. This ended his lonely life at home and opened up a new world for him in academia.

### The Heart and Emotion in Aesthetic Experience - Han Yuwen

In aesthetic experience, the heart is contemplative or meditative, and emotion is expressed in a concrete structure or form. Now, let's briefly explain these two points separately.

I. The Heart in Aesthetic Experience is Contemplative or Meditative.
The term "contemplative" or "meditative" is often used in the aesthetic attitude. In other words, we often say that the aesthetic attitude is contemplative or meditative. For example, we say that a lover of nature, an admirer or critic of a work of art, holds a contemplative or meditative attitude towards the object they love, admire, or criticize. At the same time, we say that their attitude is aesthetic; although the aesthetic component of their attitude is not as genuine and complete as that expressed by a creative artist; because the truly aesthetic attitude, on the negative side, cannot be immersed in the object being admired, becoming lost and adrift, never to return, even to the point of losing the clear, bright, transcendent, and pure original mind; but general admirers of art, such as theater or dance audiences, concert audiences, are easily overwhelmed or led away by the objects they admire; the creative artist must maintain their clarity, freely pursuing the emotional narrative of their aesthetic experience and trying to express it faithfully. From this, we can know that the truly aesthetic attitude, on the positive side, is expressive and active; it is not merely a passive enjoyment. In short, in aesthetic experience, the still heart is clear, tranquil, and active; it has neither the satiety of material enjoyment nor the greed of material enjoyment. This contemplative attitude, like the theoretical and practical attitudes, has its objects, or is directed towards its objects. But the theoretical and practical attitudes both manipulate and change their objects; the characteristic of the practical attitude is to create objects with will; the characteristic of the theoretical attitude is to use concepts to explain objects; the characteristic of the aesthetic attitude is to contemplatively express objects, without changing them. Even in creative art, the creation is a perception, attached to full imagination, complete "seeing" and "hearing," which will be discussed later.

II. Emotion in Aesthetic Experience is Concretely Expressed in a Structure or Form.
This is a very important characteristic of aesthetic emotion. Because emotions that generally lack structure or a definite form of expression are unclear, private, and constantly changing with the changes in an individual's body and mind, easily disappearing. Its object is a natural object with thoughts, not an expression of emotion. There cannot be deeper, higher aesthetic experiences in this. If you have the power to depict the object or content in which you place your emotion, and give it an imaginative form, or express it as poetry, or express it as painting, or express it as music, etc., then your object becomes a definite, lawful, objective object; and your and others' emotions towards it must obey its laws, and cannot be arbitrarily changed, increased, or decreased; on the contrary, the emotion at this time must be permanent, orderly, harmonious, and simply put, valuable. If it is joy, your joyful heart clearly feels your joy, and also clearly understands what you are joyful about; if it is sorrow, your sorrowful heart also clearly feels your grief, and also clearly understands what you are sad about. In short, your object at this time is like a carved, translucent, intricately inlaid gemstone, with a concrete form to observe, a definite standard to take, and the whole is an expression of your emotion, so your emotion and your object become one, and also have a concrete form and law that lasts unchanged, clear and transparent, can be transmitted. Universally understood, and not a chaotic, blurry, self-focused, confused private emotion. This kind of concretely expressed emotion, when you feel it, is aesthetic emotion.

### Anecdotes from the Academic World (2) - Zhang Qiyun

The Science of Livelihood and Settlement

Isaiah Bowman, President of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. On September 11, 1943, at the Association's annual meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, Bowman gave a speech entitled "Commanding Our Wealth," the original manuscript of which was published in *Science* (September 15 of the same year). This article specifically mentions China. Please briefly describe the main points for reference.

Bowman said that if, after the war, people still cannot enjoy a reasonable life, then it can be said that victory has not been achieved. He quoted Bismarck's words that a nation with abundant resources but ignorance, or even if it knows them but cannot make full use of them, the richness of resources is enough to invite national disasters. Therefore, he advocated that the way to build a nation is people first, land second. The difference between China and the United States is that China relies solely on agriculture, so-called building the country on agriculture, land is the source of life, and farmers often struggle on the poverty line. In the United States, agriculture is only one of the elements of building a nation. Industry is developed, technology is advanced, industry and agriculture, cities and villages, support each other and maintain balance, so people's lives are more satisfactory. Today, the key points for building a nation are to reclaim wasteland, afforest, control water and conserve soil, use machinery, develop resources, revitalize industry, and develop transportation, in order to increase employment opportunities, improve living standards, maintain social justice, and promote international cooperation. Just in terms of agricultural production, how to increase production, improve quality, expand markets, and stabilize prices, the details are complicated and the relationships are intricate. But such undertakings cannot be effective with empty principles, and must engage in detailed regional research. Where is suitable for forestry, where is suitable for animal husbandry? Even in the same place, due to different altitudes, climate, plants and people's livelihoods also vary. Regional investigation and experimental work are the foundation of the great cause of building a nation. The tree of peace can only flourish if its roots are deeply planted in scientific research. Bowman named this kind of knowledge the Science of Settlement, the purpose of which is to master and adjust land, population, and resources.

The national boundaries of various countries in the world cannot be arbitrarily changed, and each country pays attention to domestic unity and national unity. Those who cannot assimilate foreign immigrants are often not welcomed. The policy of building a nation is better to develop resources and utilize the way of improving life within one's own territory. China is also like Europe. If it can build peacefully, it is enough to support the national population. It is better to seek help from oneself than from others. In terms of overseas immigration, it is already extremely difficult to maintain the historical status of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Bowman's intention is that if policies like the White Australia policy are recognized as having present reasons, then the economic recommendations to help China are a natural conclusion. The industrialization of China is very important to world peace. The world cannot be partly broken and desolate, and partly prosperous and happy. Boasting about national power and disregarding others is tantamount to deceiving oneself, which is extremely dangerous. Even with the prosperity of American industry, after the Battle of Dunkirk, it took four years of operation to exert national power to defeat the enemy. This is a lesson for the future. With this point of view, one knows that American aid to China is not only helping others, but also helping oneself.

Roxby and Lyde on China

Professor Percy Maude Roxby, the representative of the British Council in China, died in Nanjing in March this year. China lost a true friend. Roxby studied history at Oxford University in his early years, and after graduation, he studied geography with Professor A. J. Herbertson. In 1908, he was recommended by Herbertson to be a lecturer at the University of Liverpool, and was promoted to professor in 1917. For nearly forty years, his teachings were extensive. He came to China three times, first in early 1912, revisited in 1921, and came to the temporary capital with his wife in 1945, serving in the position of Sino-British cultural cooperation. He wrote many treatises on Far Eastern issues, and many sections on China in the *Encyclopædia Britannica* were also written by him, making great contributions to promoting understanding and sympathy between the two countries. He deeply loved Chinese philosophy and art, and was deeply concerned about the poverty of our country's rural areas. During the war, he wrote a book "China" for the reference of the British military authorities, and it is said that it will soon be published to the world. He was born in 1880 and lived to the age of sixty-seven.

Lionel William Lyde, a retired professor at the University of London, passed away in January of this year. He was born in 1863 and was eighty-four years old. He was one of the elder geographers of the United Kingdom, and was as famous as Herbertson and Mackinder, each making contributions. He was also a graduate of Oxford University, with a deep foundation in literature and history. In his early years, he wrote teaching materials, which were popular in the United Kingdom. He began lecturing at the University of London in 1903 and retired in 1928. His books, such as *The Continent of Europe* (1913) and *The Continent of Asia* (1933), are regarded as classics by scholars. He had a deep understanding of Chinese culture. According to Professor L. D. Stamp of the University of London, Lyde's geographical philosophy was actually influenced by Chinese thought.

Scholars of Roxby and Lyde's generation had very thorough insights into Chinese issues. They liked to compare China with Europe, because China's vast territory and large population are indeed comparable to the entire Europe. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, although there have been times of division and separation in China, it has always been able to maintain a unified scale. Since the decline of Rome, Europe has never been unified again, and the reason is worthy of deep thought. They believed that Chinese culture has its own advantages. Comparing Europe with China, one can know the difficulty of our nation-building cause. Our country's sages valued the balance of centrifugal force and centripetal force in their discussion of national affairs. Today's nation-building thought should still give play to this excellent tradition, on the one hand, making local autonomy vigorous, and on the other hand, making national unity a complete success, maintaining each other internally and externally, so as to consolidate the foundation of the country, and not disappoint the expectations of overseas confidants for us.

### Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company - Li Jing

The earliest navigation organization in our country was the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, and has been 75 years since then. At the beginning of its establishment, it had a basic scale; unfortunately, due to political and personnel reasons, progress was hindered. After the Republic of China, during the First World War, although our country had the opportunity to develop the shipping industry, due to the lack of government support and the squeezing out of foreign ships, the business did not get reasonable development. The government established its capital in Nanjing and attached importance to shipping construction. The Ministry of Transportation repeatedly sent people to reorganize it. Before the Incident in 1937, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a total of 53 large and small ships, totaling more than 80,000 tons. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the coastal areas were occupied, and all seagoing ships, in addition to undertaking transport for the government, were either sunk or destroyed, or temporarily transferred to foreign flags. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which moved westward into Sichuan during the war, had only more than 20 large and small river ships, totaling more than 25,000 tons. After the victory and recovery, the shipping rights were recovered. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took over enemy and puppet ships and actively purchased Allied seagoing ships. The business expanded. As of now, there are a total of 460 ships, totaling more than 333,000 tons, which is a large increase compared with the war, and has also increased four times compared with the pre-war period. This is indeed the result of our country's arduous struggle, which is gratifying and comforting. Now, General Manager Xu Xueyu and all employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can all understand the importance of their responsibilities, and are working hard to promote it. Externally, they are clearing up debts, and internally, they are eliminating long-standing malpractices. The bureau's affairs are new, and the future is limitless, which is admired by colleagues in the transportation industry.

Our country's shipping policy adopts the principle of equal emphasis on state-owned and private enterprises. This is different from postal and telecommunications and railways. Therefore, state-owned shipping should be committed to undertaking arduous work, avoiding competing with private enterprises for profit, and supporting private shipping. The obvious advancement of this policy is that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company focused on developing ocean voyages after the war, hoping that private shipping companies would take on inland river voyages. Ocean shipping is related to international competition. If the state leads, it is easier to succeed. Now that Japan has been defeated, its shipping power in the Far East should be replaced by our country. To achieve this goal, it is hoped that state-owned enterprises will be the backbone, cooperate with private enterprises, and embrace the spirit of mutual assistance to move forward together, so as to keep pace with the world's shipping industry.

On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, we recall the grand plans of our predecessors in starting the business, are wary of the precedent of our country's shipping industry losing the opportunity to revitalize after the First World War, and look forward to the future of the shipping industry being renewed day by day. It is like an old man of 75 years old, who has already returned to his youth. Briefly describe the past and encourage the future. I sincerely express my views and hope that we can encourage each other.

### The Victory and Restoration of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: A General Overview of Operations

— Hu Shiyuan

"State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," the only state-owned shipping enterprise in China, was founded in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1872 AD), initially named "China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau." It was established by the Northern Ocean Minister and Governor-General Li Hongzhang on behalf of the Qing court, marking its 75th year. Over these 75 years, China has suffered from foreign invasions and unequal treaties. The growth of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been fraught with difficulties. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the company swiftly revived after suffering significant losses during the eight-year war. It not only restored its pre-war state but also significantly improved its operational capacity and transportation capabilities. Its development is of national interest, and a summary is provided below:

(1) Increase in Ships

Before the Anti-Japanese War, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company possessed twelve river steamers with a total tonnage of 33,784.54 tons, sixteen ocean-going vessels with a total tonnage of 37,575.99 tons, twelve small vessels with a total tonnage of 1,120.33 tons, six iron barges, and seven motorized boats, totaling over 80,000 tons. During the war, nine ships were sunk by bombing, three were destroyed, and fifteen were requisitioned to block ports, resulting in heavy losses. After the victory, besides the ships preserved in the rear and those obtained from seized enemy and puppet assets, a large number of ocean-going vessels were purchased from abroad. As of recently, the company's fleet and tonnage are as follows:

(1) Ocean-going Vessels: 61 ships, 186,278.46 total tons
(2) River Steamers: 28 ships, 56,128.24 total tons
(3) Tugs and Small Vessels: 142 ships, 15,911.51 total tons
(4) Iron and Wooden Barges and Special Vessels: 229 ships, 74,840.64 total tons

Total: 460 ships, 333,644.63 total tons

(Note: The ship and tonnage figures in this article are based on statistics as of the end of November of this year, including the newly added "Chenggong," "Hongzhang," "Jiaoren," and "Tieqiao" vessels. The other data is based on statistics from the end of August, hence the discrepancy. Please note this, Editor.) The tonnage listed in the table above is approximately four times the pre-war tonnage. The increase in transportation capacity is quite remarkable.

(2) Distribution of Shipping Routes

After the victory, in addition to rapidly restoring shipping in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coastal ports, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company extended its routes to various locations abroad. Its current routes are as follows: A. Yangtze River Routes:

In addition to the above routes and ships, other ships and barges serve as support vessels, providing important transportation services, and some are engaged in barging operations in Tianjin and Shanghai. Because China Merchants Steam Navigation Company undertakes military, government, and commercial transportation, its workload is very heavy, and the number of ships is not sufficient to meet the needs. To open up overseas routes, a large number of new ships are needed. It is expected that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will have four passenger ships purchased from abroad and two passenger ships built by the Jiangnan Shipyard put into operation next year, which will meet some of the needs. To manage its operations, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has established branches and agencies at various locations domestically and abroad, as follows:

Chongqing Branch, Wanxian Office, Yichang Branch, Shashi Office, Hankou Branch, Changsha Office, Jiujiang Branch, Anqing Office, Wuhu Branch, Nanjing Branch, Zhenjiang Branch, Yingkou Branch, Huludao Branch, Qinhuangdao Office, Tianjin Branch, Tanggu Office, Yantai Office, Qingdao Branch, Haizhou Branch, Ningbo Branch, Zhenhai Office, Wenzhou Office, Fuzhou Office, Taipei Branch, Keelung Office, Kaohsiung Office, Xiamen Branch, Shantou Branch, Hong Kong Branch, Guangzhou Branch, Zhanjiang Office, Manila Agency, Haiphong Agency, Bangkok Agency, Singapore Agency, Yangon Agency, Kolkata Agency, Haikou Agency. Based on the distribution of the above routes and branch locations, the position of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the shipping industry is significant, and it has a considerable foundation. How to further develop and promote it is its main task.

(3) New Measures in Business Operations:

China's shipping industry has historically been backward. Besides the issue of poor equipment, there is much room for improvement in management. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has paid great attention to innovation. The following are some of the important measures:

(1) Thoroughly Destroying the Comprador System: In China's shipping industry, most of the legal systems refer to the rules of foreign merchants. The comprador system was created by foreign merchants, resulting in a special class of compradors who profited by acting as intermediaries and hindering business operations. To thoroughly overhaul its operations and shoulder the responsibility of developing China's shipping industry, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has completely eradicated the comprador system and similar systems, allowing no trace to remain. Currently, there is no comprador mentality among the staff of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is a key step in reforming the shipping industry.

(2) Reforming the Cargo Handling System: The cargo handling system in shipping is a byproduct of the comprador system. In the past, when shipping operations were handled by compradors, they hired cargo handling personnel who lived on the ships and handled cargo operations. The biggest drawback of this system was the increased number of personnel on board, occupying passenger berths, which increased expenses and wasted space. For companies with fewer ships, the losses were not significant, but for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which owned many ships, it was uneconomical. Therefore, since 1947, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has gradually changed the cargo handling system from on-board to dockside. The original on-board cargo handling personnel were transferred to work onshore at various ports. Since the implementation of this system, many berths have been freed up on the ships, which can be used to transport passengers and increase passenger revenue. The efficiency of onshore cargo handling is much higher than that of on-board cargo handling. This reform can be considered a major innovation in China's shipping industry.

(3) Ship Service Staff: Hospitality and service are highly valued in modern hotel and transportation industries. Passengers need to enjoy comfort and convenience during their journeys. The mission of the ship service staff is to serve passengers and make them feel at home. To achieve this, it is not easy. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recognizes the importance of service and has established training classes to improve the service skills of the ship service staff. The goal is to ensure that every ship service staff member can effectively perform their duties and serve passengers diligently.

(4) Conducting Intermodal Transportation: To facilitate the long-distance sales of goods, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has partnered with the Pinghan Railway and the Great American Shipping Company to conduct intermodal transportation. Once the cargo is properly declared, shippers can obtain an intermodal bill of lading at the origin and use it to obtain bank financing. This is very convenient for merchants' capital turnover. However, overseas intermodal transportation has not been successful due to the lack of coordination between ship schedules and the need to settle some freight costs in foreign currency. This requires exporters and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to discuss and improve.

(5) Paying Attention to Passenger and Cargo Services: The nature of the transportation industry is to sell services. An enterprise that handles transportation without understanding service cannot be considered excellent. The goal of service is not only to meet the basic requirements of transportation, such as safety, speed, and comfort, but also to consider the needs of customers. Only then can it be considered to fulfill the spirit of service. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recognizes this and pays great attention to promoting service. For example, handling customs declarations and insurance for customers, providing car pick-up and delivery of passenger luggage, establishing ticket offices and waiting rooms at docks, information desks, and improving passenger and cargo handling procedures.

Conclusion

Modern world powers all pay attention to maritime transport to expand their national power and compete for the world market, as a plan for prosperity and strength. If China wants to talk about revival and construction, it must follow this path. After the war, the special privileges of foreign powers in inland navigation were abolished. China's shipping industry is thriving and has unlimited hope. Under the leadership of the government and with the assistance of all sectors, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has fortunately achieved a considerable scale. In the future, it should work harder to meet the expectations of the people. It is hoped that everyone will work together to make it the largest shipping organization in the Far East and make China a major maritime power in the world, which will benefit the country's future.

### Inaugural Address

— Xu Xueyu

The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been established for seventy-five years. In these seventy-five long years, the changes in national affairs, the turmoil of the political situation, the gains and losses of diplomacy, the changes in organization, the replacements of personnel, the adjustments of facilities, and the rise and fall of business operations are all important pages in the history of China's transportation. On this anniversary, we review the past, respond to the present, and plan for the future. We feel infinitely excited. In addition to compiling a commemorative booklet, we have also attached a special edition to the Shen Bao, which has the same seventy-five-year history as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. We want to inform people who care about shipping about China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's reports, and to give us guidance, sympathy, and encouragement, so that we can work harder, so that the industry can cooperate more, and so that China's shipping industry can progress towards an ideal state.

In these seventy-five years, China's shipping industry has established some foundations in the equipment of docks and warehouses. However, in terms of the tonnage and performance of ships, as well as the equipment for shipbuilding and repair, it is not worth mentioning. Compared with other maritime countries in the world, it is even more unattainable. Today, when we reflect on ourselves, we only feel ashamed and vigilant. How dare we harbor any self-consolation or pride!

In the two years since the victory and restoration, China's shipping industry has gradually increased from less than 100,000 tons of ships to more than 850,000 tons, which can be said to be the fastest period of progress in history. This is certainly due to the wise policies of the government, but also to the assistance of friendly countries and the cooperation of the industry. If we continue to do so, our shipping industry will soon be able to compete with other maritime countries in the world. If the establishment of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can represent the development of China's shipping industry, then December 16 should not be a celebration of the birthday of an old man, but a celebration of the birth of a newborn baby. In the future, the growth and success of this child will depend on the love and care of the public.

### 75th Anniversary of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

— Liu Hongsheng

Starting a business is difficult, maintaining it is not easy, and restoring it is even more difficult. Seventy-five years ago, when the maritime ban was lifted, foreign ships entered and exited China's coastal and inland rivers in an endless stream. Shipping companies were organized to control shipping. At this time, this bureau was established and purchased four ships to transport grain and commercial goods. Docks were purchased in Tianjin and Shanghai for storage and transfer. At that time, this bureau was still in its infancy. It was obstructed by sand ships and competed with foreign ships. Even when the bureau's ships were insured with foreign insurance companies, they were rejected for marine insurance. Fortunately, under the strong leadership of the Northern Ocean Minister Li Hongzhang, it was finally able to raise commercial shares, add ships, and acquire all the ships and docks of the American-owned Qi Chang Steamship Company. Sheng Xuanhuai was then appointed to supervise the bureau, and the bureau's affairs were carried out smoothly. The foundation of this bureau was laid. The difficulty of starting a business can be seen here.

After the foundation of this bureau was laid, it should have used its inherent human and financial resources to seek development. Unfortunately, the national strength was weak, and there were the Sino-French, Sino-Japanese, and Eight-Power Allied Forces wars, which caused the ships of this bureau to change flags repeatedly, and inland port navigation rights were opened up several times. Foreign shipping companies were assisted by their governments and dominated the seas of China. Although this bureau also added ships and docks one after another, it was not easy to compete with foreign shipping companies with strong financial resources. As a result, the business of the North and South Oceans and the Yangtze River routes was almost monopolized by foreign ships. In the last few years of the commercial operation period, business declined, debts were incurred, ships were old, and there were no funds for repairs. Maintaining the status quo was not possible, let alone development. The difficulty of maintaining a business is like this. When it was changed to state-run, Hongsheng took over as general manager. Fortunately, under the leadership of Minister Zhu, a loan was borrowed from the Sino-British Gengkuan to build four ocean-going vessels, and the Haiyun vessel was also purchased with a loan. However, five old vessels were also taken out of service because they were not able to operate. The tonnage remained the same. Three years passed, and I was ashamed that there were no achievements, so I retreated to a more qualified person. Not long after, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. Some of the ships of this bureau were sunk by themselves, some were destroyed by enemy aircraft, and some were sold to British merchants. There were only eighteen ships of all sizes left, and some of them had always traveled in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The ships were large and had deep drafts, so they could not be used in the Sichuan River. In this extraordinary period, it was almost impossible to defend anything. This bureau encountered many difficulties. Looking back on the past, there was a feeling of being in a storm.

Fortunately, two years before the victory, the United Kingdom and the United States abolished unequal treaties and recovered navigation rights. Later, the Japanese surrendered, and Japanese ships disappeared from China's territorial waters. This was a great opportunity to restore the business of this bureau. During the recovery period, this bureau bore the mission of military and public transportation, which was extremely important. Fortunately, General Manager Xu had the belief that the Anti-Japanese War would be won before the Japanese surrendered. The small and large river steamers in Chongqing were repaired with loans. After the victory, the recovery work was successfully completed. His foresight is evident. Since this bureau moved to Shanghai, General Manager Xu has followed the instructions of the Ministry of Communications, and colleagues, under the leadership of General Manager Xu, have worked hard to seize the opportunity and bury themselves in hard work. Now, in terms of ships: including the ships ordered by the government from the United States and Canada, there are 330,000 tons; in terms of wharves: during the occupation, the docks and warehouses were damaged and unusable. After the recovery, they were repaired one by one, and four wharves were leased from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for business use; in terms of business: in addition to restoring the Yangtze River North and South Ocean routes, new routes were opened up to Bangkok, Calcutta, Singapore, Manila, Japan, South America and other places. The business is booming. In addition, the rectification of wharf order, the abolition of tips, and the implementation of the wharf cargo handling system are all important measures to restore the business of this bureau. It is booming, like the rising sun, full of the atmosphere of new life. General Manager Xu is restoring private shipping companies, working together, with the goal of co-prosperity, and taking on the full responsibility of the entire transportation. With this perseverance, the future development is unlimited. However, the difficult operation of the authorities is even more difficult than starting a business. Today is the 75th anniversary of this bureau. Hongsheng is a director and is very honored to attend this event. Looking at the past and thinking about the present, I will briefly describe my feelings. I am especially ashamed that I am old and sick, and I have not been able to contribute my strength.

### The Significance and Methods of Establishing a Shipping Scholarship

All the employees of this bureau, in view of the rapid progress of shipping restoration after the war, and the urgent need for shipping talents, which cannot be achieved without speeding up large-scale training, take the opportunity of this bureau's 75th anniversary to initiate a donation scholarship movement, borrowing the meaning of a hundred-year tree, to congratulate the eternal existence and continuous development of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It has been approved by all sectors, and many people plan to convert congratulatory gifts into scholarship funds. The colleagues of this bureau consider themselves weak and difficult to achieve great things. Now, they are fortunate to receive assistance from all sectors. The original quota was only a maximum of ten or more people per year. If the funds are sufficient with the assistance of all sectors, they will continue to seek expansion to promote education. The scholarships that students of various schools receive in the future are actually given by all sectors.

### The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Over Seventy-Five Years and its Leaders Through the Ages

— Wang Shaozeng

Due to limited space, this article is divided into seven major periods for narration:

(I) The Founding Period (1872-1884)

Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Beiyang (later promoted to Grand Secretary) of the waning Qing Dynasty, believing that shipping could defend against foreign aggression and benefit merchants, resolved to establish the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After repeated preparations, in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872), he appointed Zhu Qiang and Zhu Qizhao to Shanghai to plan capital, purchase ships, and select routes, officially opening the bureau on the sixteenth day of the twelfth month. In the initial years, although the number of ships owned by the bureau was small, the routes were very long, centered on Shanghai, going east to Kobe and Nagasaki, south to Hong Kong and Shantou, and north to Tianjin and Dagu. British companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire, and the American company Russell & Co., which were already engaged in shipping in our country, were deeply jealous and repeatedly lowered prices to compete. At one point, the bureau was almost unable to sustain itself. Fortunately, Grand Secretary Li stipulated that all grain tribute must be transported by bureau ships, which enabled it to safely overcome the crisis. Russell & Co. suffered huge losses due to excessive price reductions and could not continue, so in the third year of Guangxu, it sold all of its assets, including ships and warehouses, to the bureau. From then on, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company grew stronger day by day. The leaders of this period initially included Zhu Qiang and his brother, followed by Sheng Xuanhuai, Tang Tingshu, and Xu Run. Under the wise planning and leadership of Li Hongzhang, they worked hard and devoted themselves to the bureau's affairs, laying the foundation for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.

(II) The Development Period (1884-1900)

After the Sino-French maritime conflict arose, bureau ships were unable to operate. A contract was once signed with Russell & Co. to sell the ships to the company for management, but after the war ended, they were reclaimed. This period lasted for sixteen years. Initially, business was smooth due to a price agreement with Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson. New ships were added, old ships were repaired, and warehouses and wharves were built in various navigable locations in our country. At the same time, investments were made in establishing the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and exploiting coal mines in Tangshan, Pingxiang, and Dongliu. The bureau's affairs developed, increasing day by day. The Qing government, recognizing that the bureau had maintained itself with difficulty since its establishment and had been able to handle the transportation of troops and relief supplies quickly and appropriately, established incentive measures such as exempting 20% of the Beiyang export tax, reducing tea transportation tax, and increasing grain tribute transportation fees, all of which were sufficient to encourage the bureau to move forward. The leaders of this period, in addition to the death of Tang Tingshu, were mostly overseen by Sheng Xuanhuai, with Ma Jianzhong, Xie Jiafu, Shen Nenghu, and Gu Zhaoxi co-responsible.

(III) The Decline Period (1900-1911)

Li Hongzhang, the sole founder of the bureau, died of exhaustion in Beijing in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901) while negotiating the Boxer Protocol. Yuan Shikai, as the Minister of Beiyang, sent Yang Shiqi to the bureau as general manager, and Sheng Xuanhuai retired for a time. The shareholders' meeting was held in the first year of Xuantong, and a board of directors was established. Sheng Xuanhuai and eight others were elected as the first directors. However, at this time, revolutionary rumors were spreading everywhere, and the Qing government sent bureau ships to transport troops and grain frequently. Furthermore, the Dangshun, Haichen, and Xiehe ships successively encountered accidents and sank. Although the bureau was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Posts and Communications in the first year of Xuantong and new regulations were established for reorganization, the country was in turmoil, and it was difficult to expect revitalization. By the time the Republic of China was established, the bureau had accumulated huge losses over the years and owed millions of taels.

(IV) The Revival Period (1912-1927)

After the establishment of the Republic of China, a national harvest occurred, and there was an urgent need to transport local goods from various places, thus increasing business. In addition to adding the Jianghua ship in the first year of the Republic, the other ships were all extensively repaired. A new board of directors was established, with Yang Shiqi and Sheng Xuanhuai elected as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. Three departments—shipping, business, and accounting—were established, with directors Tang Dexi, Chen You, and Shi Yijue serving as department heads. In the third year of the Republic, the Jiyu Property Company was re-established to manage the bureau's assets unrelated to shipping. Sheng Xuanhuai passed away from illness in the spring of the fifth year of the Republic. Sheng had been in office for more than thirty years, carefully planning and working hard. His contributions were truly undeniable.

During the middle of this period, World War I occurred, and foreign ships returned west. The bureau was almost the only shipping organization in China, and the prosperity of its business can be imagined. By the end of World War I, the number of bureau ships had increased from 26 to 39. At the same time, warehouses, wharves, and city houses were built and purchased, and the China Merchants Public School was established to facilitate the education of bureau employees' children.

During this period, Sheng Xuanhuai and Yang Shiqi initially presided over the bureau's affairs, followed by Sun Baoqi, Li Guojie, and Sheng Chongyi. Aside from the chaotic situation at the end of the period, this was truly the bureau's revival period.

(V) The Reform Period (1927-1937)

After the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition captured Wuhan, it planned to reorganize the bureau's affairs. Yang Quan was ordered to come and "handle the affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company." The government established its capital in Nanjing and appointed Zhang Jingjiang and ten others to organize the "Committee for Investigation and Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company" to audit accounting records and investigate business conditions. Detailed investigations were conducted on coal purchases, ship rentals, and inland river bureaus. In the seventeenth year, the bureau was formally reorganized, and the ministry appointed Zhao Tieqiao as director-general. After Zhao arrived at the bureau, he immediately engaged in major reforms, establishing a navigation school, dismissing foreign sailors, abolishing the Jiyu Company, and improving the accounting system. Unfortunately, on July 24th of the nineteenth year, he was assassinated by thugs and died in the line of duty. After Zhao's death, the ministry appointed Cai Pei as director-general, but he was soon succeeded by Chen Xizeng. Both of their terms in office were very short.

In November of the twenty-first year, the Executive Yuan issued an order to convert the bureau into a state-owned enterprise, and the Central Bank repurchased the shares at a price. Liu Hongsheng was appointed as the first general manager. During his three years in office, Liu borrowed Boxer Indemnity funds to add four ships, the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen, and spared no effort in reorganizing the bureau's affairs. After Liu resigned, the ministry appointed Cai Zengji as general manager.

(VI) The War of Resistance Period (1937-1945)

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a portion of the bureau's personnel followed the National Government westward, via Hankou to Chongqing, forming the Yangtze River Business Management Office responsible for inland river shipping. Former General Manager Cai led another portion of the personnel to Hong Kong to establish an office. Not long after, the area fell, and most of the original archives and accounts were lost in Hong Kong. All of the Yangtze River and ocean-going ships, except for the four ships Yuanheng, Lizhen, sold to British company Jardine Matheson, and the six major Yangtze River ships, Jiangshun etc., and seven small ships barely able to sail to Sichuan, were either requisitioned to block the harbor, bombed by enemy aircraft, or seized by the enemy, resulting in heavy losses.

In the spring of the thirty-second year, Zhu Yangpu, as Minister of Communications, believed that military transportation during the war needed to be strengthened, and postwar reconstruction also awaited planning. The bureau's affairs could not be interrupted, so he ordered the bureau to resume operations in Chongqing, appointing Xu Xueyu as general manager. Thus, the bureau officially resumed operations on April 26th. After Xu took office, he sent seven small ships to assist with river transport on the Sichuan River on one hand, and repaired the six major Yangtze River ships one by one on the other hand, while retaining the employees on the ships to maintain operations. Therefore, after the Japanese surrendered, the bureau immediately took on the responsibility of military and public repatriation transport on the Yangtze River, all due to careful planning in advance.

(VII) Current Situation (1945-1947)

After the victory of the War of Resistance, the bureau's personnel came to Shanghai in early September of the thirty-fourth year. Under the joint planning and guidance of General Manager Xu Xueyu and Deputy General Managers Shen Zhongyi, Hu Shiyuan, and Wei Huanzhang, many bureau affairs have been organized and innovated in the past two years. These are briefly described in eight major categories as follows:

(A) Taking over enemy and puppet shipping assets and U.S. and Canadian ships—When ordered to recover after the war, the enemy shipping assets (including ships and real estate, etc.) were taken over. Except for a portion necessary for national shipping, which was purchased from the China Trust Bureau, the others were exchanged with or on behalf of that bureau for ships. The total tonnage of ships received in Shanghai was 60,000 tons, so the total tonnage of the bureau's ships is now 326,800 tons.

(B) Responsible for repatriation water transport—After the victory, banditry was rampant in various places. Seventy to eighty percent of the bureau's ships were allocated for military transportation, and the remainder was mostly used to transport rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi, sugar and rice from Taipei, salt from Qingdao, and to send Japanese nationals back to their country, assisting in the transportation of public education personnel and displaced civilians returning to their hometowns.

(C) Clearing old debts—Before the war, in order to compete with the powers in shipping and maintain the situation, loans were taken out from various Chinese and foreign banks, resulting in almost all of the bureau's assets being mortgaged. After two years of active repayment, all debts have now been cleared.

(D) Repairing ships, docks, and warehouses—Various ships were too dilapidated or unsuitable for use and needed to be repaired. After eight years of war, bureau buildings and docks in various places were severely damaged and have been repaired in order of urgency.

(E) Eliminating old habits—The name of the ship's "tea room attendant" was changed to "waiter," training was implemented, and the practice of collecting tips was strictly prohibited. The contracting and labor arrangements for docks were abolished and replaced with self-managed labor, establishing a new atmosphere.

(F) Expanding routes—In addition to dispatching dedicated ships to regularly operate the Yangtze River, Nanyang (Southeast Asia), and Beiyang (Northern China) lines, overseas lines were added, dispatching ships to India, the Philippines, Thailand, and Burma, benefiting from barter trade and increasing national glory.

(G) To facilitate passenger transport, a service committee was established, and a reception center was set up at the dock to facilitate passengers waiting for ships, providing shuttle trucks for picking up and dropping off passengers, and ferry services across the Huangpu River.

(H) Investing in the establishment of the China Tanker Company and the Taiwan Shipping Company, and maintaining close contact with private shipping companies, mutually benefiting from cooperation.

From now on, it will be a period of revitalization for China's shipping industry. Because shipping rights have been recovered, the opportunity for the development of the shipping industry is better, and the responsibilities are also greater. "Striving for Self-Improvement" is what all of us in the shipping industry should encourage each other to do.

### Riding the Ship Today

— Xu Yi

It has been more than two years since the victory. Ships flying the national flag have long taken on the heavy responsibility of domestic shipping after the war. But when it comes to "riding the ship," I am afraid you will still think of the chaos on the dock, the difficulty of buying tickets, the arrogance of the ship's tea room attendants, and the rampant spread of various bad habits and陋規. The lingering fear of this long nightmarish experience cannot but make you feel like you are寸步難行.

Recently, you may be乘船 again. If you are riding a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company today, I believe you will definitely have a different feeling—a feeling that makes you feel a little安慰 in today's environment.

Speaking of the difficulty of buying ship tickets, it used to be too much and too terrible. Although the biggest reason is that there are too few ships and too many passengers, it is an undeniable fact that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company delayed the improvement of management in this area while it was busy with repatriation. Today, when you step into their ticket office, although you still see a constant stream of guests, there is no squeezing and chaos that you expected. The renovated ticket office does appear spacious and convenient. When you see that there are still vacancies on the passenger seat牌掛 on the wall, you can quickly buy your ship ticket. If you are late, the ladies at the information desk will ask you to leave your address and register for the next ship ticket. They will answer your questions in detail and诚懇ly help you solve your difficulties. Needless to say, black market tickets will never exist there.

On the dock of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the dark secrets and chaotic situation that plagued you in the past have also been thoroughly rectified. They have further established passenger reception centers on the docks, which are decorated neatly and generously. It is really too urgent for passengers who have just come down from the ship to find a quiet place to recover from the fatigue of the journey. Passengers waiting for the ship on the dock also need a place to rest and shelter from the wind and rain. If you have ample time and the ship has not yet启錨, you and your friends can also go there to sit for a while and have some hot refreshments. There is a播音器 there that will report the departure time at any time. When you pay the bill, you will be sure to find that the price you pay is much cheaper than you imagined.

On the ship, what you are most afraid of seeing is probably the arrogant "tea room attendant" that you used to see. Well, now the people接待ing you are a group of "waiters" who have been rigorously trained. They are attentive, humble, and know how to take care of elderly and young passengers getting on the ship, and how to make you feel comfortable and satisfied.

The "food" on the ship may be the point you are most concerned about. Now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has appointed a catering expert who once studied in the UK to be responsible for the ship's meals. He has frankly admitted that he cannot make the ship's dishes suit the tastes of every passenger, but he is striving to achieve the three points of "cleanliness," "nutrition," and "deliciousness." When you have another chance to try it, you will definitely not be disappointed, and you will recognize that his words are not an un兑現ed check.

When you look at the long and large sea surface on the deck, you can't help but feel a burst of inexplicable岑寂. Maybe you will feel the need for some entertainment to pass the time. Of course, on the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company today, things like gambling are already悬掛為例. But you can find the books, newspapers, and magazines that you like. On several ships, broadcasting equipment has been installed to转播 various important news, ship dynamics, and pleasant music. When you have a book in your hand and quietly listen to beautiful songs and famous songs, will you believe that you are on a ship? On a Chinese ship?

Your health and safety are also what they are concerned about. Although the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company do not yet have medical equipment like hospitals, the emergency medicines needed by passengers on a short voyage have been prepared very completely.

Your comfort and satisfaction, whether you live in first class or fourth class, are the goals that the various management departments of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are trying to improve day and night. In the process of their efforts, the difficulties they encounter are arduous. There are still so few passenger ships, and material resources are so difficult. If we recognize reality and do not ask for perfection, their achievements are of course worthy of揚. But to help them achieve a more perfect future, I am afraid we still need our greater assistance and策勵.
