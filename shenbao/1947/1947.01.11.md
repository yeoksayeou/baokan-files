### Researching Negotiation Methods; Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, and Others to Return to Nanjing in Two or Three Days; U.S. Ambassador Paid Visit to Chairman Last Night for Talks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong spoke on the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference, saying that he is not pessimistic about the future of peace talks and that it only depends on our efforts. As for the resumption of peace talks, there are currently three approaches being considered: (1) Negotiate first, then reorganize the government; (2) Reorganize first, then negotiate; (3) Conduct both simultaneously. This will be decided after Zhang Qun arrives in Nanjing. The content of the peace talks cannot yet be discussed; the first thing worth studying is the method. He expressed his admiration for Marshal Ma's past efforts to promote peace. Zhang visited Qi Biwu on the 9th, but he was out. On the evening of the 10th, he attended a dinner hosted by the Soviet Ambassador and scheduled a press conference for 5:00 PM on the 11th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Shao Lizi said on the morning of the 10th that he only learned from the newspaper today that the government would send someone to Yan'an. As of speaking, the question is only whether it is feasible because the government has not yet understood the intentions of the Chinese Communist Party. Shao said in a firm tone: Peace will inevitably come; the only question is what method to use to make it happen sooner.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is said that the plan for the government to send someone to Yan'an was suggested by a certain neutral diplomatic figure. Shao Lizi stated that he had not heard of it. Many believe Zhang Qun might be chosen.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 9th for half an hour. On the morning of the 10th at 10:00 AM, Wang Bingnan visited the U.S. Ambassador to exchange views.

[Central News Agency, This City] Lei Zhen, Secretary of the Political Consultative Conference, who has been traveling busily between Nanjing and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by car the night before last. After resting briefly at his hotel upon arriving here yesterday morning, Lei immediately drove to visit Sun Fo and Zhang Qun to convey the government's intentions. In the afternoon, Lei also visited Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party and continued to exchange views on issues such as reorganizing the government and resuming peace talks. According to Lei, he told reporters that the government reorganization is actively underway, and efforts are also being made to find an opportunity to quickly resume peace talks. The government hopes that peace talks can be resumed before the reorganization. His mission is to continue discussions with various parties to ensure the government reorganization begins as soon as possible and that the desire to "return power to the people" is realized promptly. It is also learned that Lei, Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, and leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party will travel to Nanjing together within two or three days.

Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Joint Meeting to Discuss Peace Talk and Reorganization Plans

[Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party held an important meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees from the Democratic Socialist Party included Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, and other Standing Committee members. Attendees from the Youth Party included Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and others. The focus of the discussions was to study concrete plans for reopening peace talks and reorganizing the government. Regarding the first point, all attendees believed this was a matter of sincerity from both sides, and given the current situation, it would be extremely difficult to achieve. Aside from the efforts of other parties, the government should strive to reform politics to win back popular support. Regarding the reorganization of the government, it was believed that the reorganization must be thorough, from the central government to the local levels, and must be carried out earnestly to create a good government and establish the people's trust in the government. Yesterday's meeting did not produce a concrete result, and it was decided to continue the meeting at Fan Garden tonight. Once a concrete plan is completed, Zhang Junmai will travel to Nanjing to meet with the Chairman and personally present everything. Xu Fulin also told reporters that the opinions within the Democratic Socialist Party are closer than before.

[Our Newspaper] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters: In the next day or two, government representatives and the Youth Party will exchange views. Regarding the peace talks, he said: No one opposes reopening peace talks; this is part of the effort to solve the current problems. Whether this can be achieved depends less on parties outside the two parties and more on the attitude of the two parties themselves.

[Our Newspaper] Since President Sun suggested convening a party conference to discuss and resolve national affairs, reporters inquired about this with various parties. Except for the Chinese Communist Party, which did not respond actively, Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party expressed support in principle, and Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party also expressed no opposition but hoped to clarify the specific methods. Xu also praised President Sun's sincerity in uniting the parties to jointly seek solutions to national affairs. The Democratic League stated that it had not yet studied it and that the Democratic League's position on the current situation would be published in a political declaration soon. (President Sun's talk on the current situation is in another article.)

### Communist Party Still Insisting on Two Points; Yan'an Will Issue Statement Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Communist Party member Wang Bingnan said on the 10th that the Communist Party's demand today is for China's true and lasting peace. If the government intends to restore peace, it should accept the two demands put forward by the Communist Party. This is the Communist Party's basic stance for seeking domestic peace. Without these two conditions, there is no way to talk about peace.

[United Press, Beiping, 10th] The Chinese Communist Party representatives in North China are still studying Marshal Marshall's statement upon leaving China. Ye Jianying, the CCP representative in the Military Mediation Team, announced today that Yan'an is expected to issue a formal statement on Sunday. American representative Giron of the Military Mediation Team declined to comment on the dissolution of the Military Mediation Team. Government representatives have no knowledge of the future of the Military Mediation Team.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 10th] Well-informed sources here revealed this morning that the government will likely send Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan to Yan'an soon to negotiate with Yan'an leaders on matters such as ending the civil war and the CCP's participation in the government. It is expected that as soon as Zhang Qun returns to Nanjing from Shanghai, the two government officials will depart for Yan'an. Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, will likely accompany Zhang Qun, as Marshall's statement mentioned the Democratic Socialist Party as the "middle ground," and its position is now gradually becoming more important.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong said on the morning of the 10th that his position in Xinjiang Province is to represent the central government, implement the Three Principles of the People, and support the development of ethnic minorities. The only way to solve the ethnic problem in Xinjiang is to give ethnic groups genuine equality.

### Ambassador Gu Praises Marshal Marshall, Says His Mission to China Can Be Considered Successful

[Reuters, Cleveland, Ohio, 9th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun told reporters here today before a debate on national political affairs hosted by Time magazine that he was pleased that Marshall had been appointed Secretary of State. Marshall had achieved as much as he could in his mission to China. He had induced the Chinese government to accept many of the demands of the opposition parties, especially the Communist Party. In that respect, his mission could be considered a success. When a reporter asked the Ambassador to comment on Marshal Marshall's statement regarding reactionary elements within the National government, Gu said that within every political party, there were bound to be various different factions.

### Ambassador Gu Gives Speech in the United States: We Respect Treaty Obligations; Negotiations on the Takeover of Dalian Will Begin Soon

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun gave a public speech yesterday to discuss the Dalian issue, stating that formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union will begin soon.

[Associated Press, Cleveland, 9th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun recently gave a speech at the International Political Debate, condemning the Soviet Union's invasion of Northeast and Southeast Asia as contrary to the Yalta Agreement, and believing that this situation could cause friction and discord. He stated: China was not invited to participate in the Yalta Conference, which was the price the Soviet Union received for its cooperation in defeating Japan. However, the policies decided at the conference can only be regarded as temporary measures taken to accelerate the war. Even so, the consequences and impact should not be limited to the war period. The current situation is that the Soviet Union has a foothold in the Northeast, occupying the main railways from west to east and from Harbin to Dalian, extending to the Kuril Islands in the heart of the Bering Sea, and bordering China for 3,000 miles. All of this is an abnormal state. Therefore, China attaches great importance to the speedy return of Dalian. Moreover, in terms of the Yalta Agreement, although it is a joint cooperative movement in terms of morality and politics, it is unheard of for one country to demand the price of another country by sacrificing the interests of a third country. China accepted this agreement and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 as a supplement. China is determined to respect its obligations, so the other party should also respect its obligations. At this point, Gu Weijun also criticized the actions of the CCP as sufficient to alienate the friendly relations between China and the United States. He also stated: The CCP's indecision on the political situation will make the economic situation even more difficult. The CCP's intention is to continue to create a chaotic situation, discredit the government, and then seize power. Under these circumstances, the government can only do its best to promote its plans for political unification and economic revival.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] Regarding the situation, regarding the Sino-Soviet implementation of the friendship treaty, it is heard that there have been thorough discussions in Nanjing, and the opinions of both sides are very close. At present, most of the research is on technical issues. It is said that there are about three major items discussed by both sides: (1) The Sino-Soviet joint management of the China Changchun Railway. The point of contention at the moment is that we strongly advocate limiting it to the property rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway before 1945, while the Soviet side requires that the property rights of the South Manchuria Railway operated by the Japanese be included. The above disputes may be resolved by seeking a compromise. (2) The Soviet side raised the issue of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau purchasing property rights from the Japanese in various parts of Northeast China before the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (3) The issue of our receiving Dalian. If the first two issues can be resolved first, then we may be able to receive Dalian sooner.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast previously sent Section Chief Xu Liqun to Andong to assist the local military in negotiating the specific issues of receiving the Shuifeng Dam and the Laguqiao Dam of the Manchu Power Plant. Xu once contacted the Soviet garrison on the Yalu River Bridge and sent a letter in the name of Zhao Gongwu, commander of the Third Pacification District, to the commander of the Soviet garrison in northern Korea to discuss the date of the meeting. After many days, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Andong stating that no response had been received from the Soviet side to date and that the meeting was still uncertain.

### Overview of the Shuifeng Power Plant

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The Yalu River Laguqiao Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Plant was jointly operated by the puppet Manchukuo and Korea. Construction began in 1937, and all construction was completed by the end of 1941. The steel and concrete dam, 898.7 meters long and 116 meters high, cuts off the flow of the Yalu River, extending across both sides of the Yalu River. The plant's machinery is located in the Korean territory on the south bank, with a total of seven generators, divided into two types: 50 cycles and 60 cycles. The 50-cycle generators are used exclusively in Northeast China, while the 60-cycle generators supply Korea. Each generator has a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, and the seven generators can generate a total of 700,000 kilowatts per day. Half of the electricity generated is supplied to various parts of Northeast China. After the Japanese surrendered, the Soviet army looted seven generators. Of the remaining four, one was damaged and cannot be used. Among the remaining three, two are 60-cycle generators and one is 50-cycle. Today, the Shuifeng Power Plant only has 100,000 kilowatts of electricity available for use in Northeast China. Currently, there are three transmission lines from the plant. One line is used by Korea, and the other two supply Andong and Lushun-Dalian, respectively. Today, the electricity in the Lushun-Dalian and Pulandian areas still relies on this supply.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th] The U.S. Military Headquarters in Beiping announced today that Lieutenant Colonel Masta will be the defense attorney for the "Beiping U.S. Military Rape Case," with Captain Claymik as his deputy. The chief prosecutor of the military court is Lieutenant Colonel Fitzgerald, and Captain Yanke is the deputy prosecutor. All four have considerable experience with military courts and met with the witnesses for the first time this morning.

Fitzgerald explained to the Chinese people present that the military court is not similar to a civil court. The military court is investigating what disciplinary actions the U.S. soldier violated. He also stated that Miss Shen can only be regarded as one of the witnesses in court.

### Admiral Lee May Have Possibility of Serving as Ambassador to China

Newsweek Publishes News

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] According to Newsweek, after Marshal Marshall was recalled to the country, some people in Washington believe that Admiral Lee may replace Stuart as the ambassador to China. Lee has never hidden his disagreement with the Communist Party, so Lee's appointment would be a severe blow to the Communist Party and a strong endorsement of Chairman Chiang. Note that this article was written before Byrnes resigned.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Legislative Yuan has not held a meeting for a month and a half since its last plenary session in mid-November of last year, when it passed the draft constitution. Recently, the National Assembly has closed, and the term of office of the legislators has been extended until the establishment of the Legislative Yuan under the constitution by a joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council.

[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 10th] The Communist army has now established a Railway General Bureau in Harbin and divided it into four railway sub-bureaus: East Manchuria, South Manchuria, West Manchuria, and North Manchuria, including the China Changchun Railway and the North Manchuria Railways.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The Communist army in Northeast China has recently mobilized small units to disrupt the railway lines around Changchun in an attempt to threaten the Changji area. It is reported that: (1) Xinglongquan, near Laoshaogou on the south bank of the Songhua River, was surrounded by 2,000 Communist soldiers on the afternoon of the 8th. Our security team fought bravely for an hour, and the Communist army was unable to withstand and retreated. The Communist army is currently increasing its strength northwest of Xinglongquan and attempting to move south.

### President Sun Suggests Situation Recommendations, Hopes Parties Open Roundtable

[Central News Agency, This City] President Sun issued a written statement yesterday entitled "A Suggestion on the Current Situation." The full text is recorded as follows:

Our country won the foreign war and leaped to become one of the great powers. It can be said that heaven and man returned, and it was an opportunity for thousands of years. Unfortunately, a large-scale armed political dispute followed, causing the people to suffer unspeakable pain and becoming the laughing stock of the international community. Engaging in political disputes with force is originally a barbaric and backward method, which has long disappeared in modern countries. Even the civil wars that once occurred in Greece and Egypt have been resolved, but in our country, one and a half years after victory, the civil war has not only not ended, but also seems to be becoming more intense and protracted. This should be regarded as a great shame by everyone, whether in or out of power, in government or among the people.

Recalling the days of the Political Consultative Conference a year ago, the people yearned for governance, and the whole country was filled with an atmosphere of unity and love. The various agreements it established were undoubtedly the only path for China to achieve peaceful unification and democratic construction. Not only did Marshal Marshall, who facilitated this meeting at that time, still affirm this in his recent statement and report, but the evolution of the situation over the years can also be said to be a strong proof. If the parties participating in the meeting were not blinded by their own subjective positions and temporary interests, and could have opened their hearts, been honest with each other, and unanimously promoted the rapid establishment of a coalition government after the meeting closed, I am sure that China's situation over the past year would have been much more advanced than it is now.

On the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference, when we read Marshall's statement, in addition to admiring his fairness and correctness, we should especially reflect deeply on ourselves. The current situation of domestic political disputes is so dangerous. If we do not open up a path to resolve the problem quickly at this time and let it develop, then the future of our country will be unimaginable. I believe that the best way to solve the problem is for responsible representatives of all parties (including representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, of course) to hold another roundtable meeting in the near future. Everyone can abandon prejudices and subjective wishes, value the objective realities at home and abroad, act in the spirit of unity and cooperation, and consider the happiness of all the people of China. I believe that all problems can be solved peacefully. I hereby put forward such a suggestion to all parties and hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to promote its realization.

### Mei Ru'ao Flies to Tokyo Today; The Trial of Japanese War Criminals Can Be Completed in June; Execution Will Be in Tokyo After the Verdict

[City News] Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge of the Far East International Military Tribunal, returned to China from Tokyo a few days ago and reported to President Song on the work of the Military Tribunal. He is scheduled to take a US military plane back to Tokyo at 3 p.m. today. Yesterday, Mei told reporters from the Central News Agency that when the Far East Tribunal reopens at the end of January, it will begin to hear the evidence presented by the defense lawyers. It is expected that the prosecution can be completed within four months. The lawyers from both sides will begin to argue in late May, which is the real beginning of the struggle in the Far East Tribunal. The verdict can be pronounced in June. The convicts will be executed in Tokyo. Mei also said that he was pleased that his return to China had enabled the people of the country to understand the purpose of the work of the Far East Military Tribunal. The purpose of the work of the Far East Tribunal is not only to address the life and death issues of the 26 Japanese war criminals, but also to establish new principles of international law, or to clarify such principles of international law. In addition, it is to make the world understand that a war of aggression is a crime, and this responsibility is not only borne by the aggressive country, but also by the individual war criminals. In other words, we are all working to establish a new system to build world peace. At the same time, no one can use this to educate the vast Japanese people and assist them in building democracy and no longer being fooled by the warlords. Judge Mei also stated that Chinese law focuses on "free conviction," which is very different from English and American law, which focuses on evidence. China has suffered the most from the Japanese, and this time, in presenting evidence in court, at least more preparations should be made in that regard in the future.

### The Yellow River Closure Will Be Completed Soon; If the Chinese Communists Build a Dam to Block the Water, the People Will Suffer Endlessly

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The Huayuankou closure project has been 80 to 90 percent completed. The opening is shrinking day by day. The water level upstream of the pontoon bridge has risen by about two meters. The pontoon bridge originally had more than 100 openings, but only 10 remain for water to pass through. The old course of the river has been restored, and the water flow has now reached Changyuan, with a width of about 20 meters and a depth of 1 meter. If it flows into Shandong Province, the riverbed is not sandy soil, and its speed will be faster than in Henan Province. As for the Chinese Communist side's rumored construction of a transverse dam to block the water, according to an engineer, if the Chinese Communists do this, it will not only be extremely clumsy technically, but will also harm innocent people, which is really unwise. The flooded area in the former flood zone reached 6,000 square kilometers. After the autumn floods, two-thirds of the area is still flooded. After the closure is completely closed, the flooded area will all become fertile land.

Representatives of Refugees in Henan Province Request the Speedy Completion of the Closure

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The people in the Yellow River flood area were extremely shocked by the Chinese Communist side's sudden opposition to the imminent completion of the Huayuankou closure. They specially sent representatives Li Mingzhong, Bu Zhen, and Li Guanyi to the Huayuankou Closure and Restoration Bureau, requesting that the work not be stopped under any circumstances in order to comfort the people in the flood area. The Li family and others hosted the press, painfully stating the pros and cons, saying that in the nine years of repeated disasters in the flood area, 20 counties were affected, and 13 counties are still in deep water. There are more than 10 million refugees, of which 3 million have moved far to the northwest provinces, living a precarious and miserable life. Those who have not moved have died of kala-azar in recent years, with more than 200,000 deaths. Under this long-term severe disaster, they only hope that the closure can be completed as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communists ignored the suffering of tens of millions of refugees and opposed it. The refugees in the flood area cannot remain indifferent. If this project is obstructed by the Chinese Communists, the refugees in the flood area will automatically come to throw stones to block the closure. The Li family and others also pointed out that there are still more than 10,000 Communist troops in the flood area who are constantly harassing the local people.

Group discussions were held in the afternoon, and the closing ceremony was scheduled for 2 p.m. on the 11th. On the 12th, they will visit Zhongmu and the Hugou flood area.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] The Henan Construction Department and the Agricultural Bank discussed and formulated agricultural loan measures for the flood area and disaster area.

### Huo Baoshu Returns to Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 10th to report to President Song on the progress of the negotiations with the Chinese Communists in Shanghai on the issue of relief funds for residents of the riverbed, and returned to Shanghai that night.

### Spring Floods in the Daqing River Are Worrisome

Embankment Construction Workers Kidnapped by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 10th] During the flood season last year, the Communist army dug up many sections of the Daqing River embankment in Qingyuan, causing huge losses. The Construction Department of the Hebei Provincial Government sent personnel to Qingyuan County to investigate the case. On the night of the 6th, the Communist army attacked the Xianrenqiao stronghold and kidnapped eight workers. The embankment construction project has been suspended, and the spring floods this year are particularly worrying.

### Zhongshan County's Minguo Daily Confiscated by the Portuguese in Macau; Petition to the Government to Lodge Representations

[Report from our Guangzhou Office on the 10th] Minguo Daily, based in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, has been sold in Macau. However, the Macau government recently used the excuse that the newspaper published articles on the 5th about overseas Chinese being harassed and on the 6th about the public trial of Japanese war criminal Zesawa, claiming that it violated Portuguese law and confiscated all copies of the newspaper. After unsuccessful negotiations, the newspaper argued that the news it published did not contain any slander against the Macau government, and now the government has unreasonably confiscated the newspaper. This barbaric act is a contempt for public law and a suppression of public opinion. It has been reported to the government and requested to lodge a protest.

Editorial

### Focus of Economic Problems

The most disturbing phenomenon in society now is nothing more than economic problems, and the crux of economic problems is nothing more than financial problems. Some people think that many disturbances in the economic sector are mostly caused and promoted by finance, which is not an exaggeration. Because the exchange rate problem, the currency system problem, the usury problem, the gold problem, the price problem, the banking system problem, and the repayment problem of pre-war deposits are all prominent financial problems, and what we have seen and heard is caused by financial problems. There are not a few other incidental problems caused by the disturbances of the following:

(1) The Reinstatement of Commercial Banks On January 22, 1945, the Ministry of Finance promulgated supplementary measures for the reinstatement of commercial banks in the restored areas. Originally, all types A and B banks were required to submit various documents and apply for reinstatement within three months, and they would not be processed after the deadline. They must be ordered to suspend business, or they will not be allowed to resume business. Although special permission was granted to extend the deadline, it was also extended to July 15, 1946, and there was no further extension. But in fact, it is said that applications for sideline business can still be accepted so far, and it seems that the local municipal and county government's certification that it is closely related to local finance is too abstract, causing many unexpected entanglements. At a time when the restriction on the establishment of new banks is strictly enforced, the seriousness of this problem cannot be ignored. We believe that the Ministry of Finance's attitude towards this matter is not clear enough.

(2) The Black Market for US Dollars In fact, the black market for US dollars is one of the important factors in price fluctuations. In terms of law, it is difficult to solve the problem of country A's currency being used in country B. Moreover, the central and local governments have repeatedly declared that black markets are not allowed, and foreign currencies are not allowed to be used as a tool for paying prices and rents. However, those who are prohibited are prohibited, and those who use them use them, and each goes his own way, and it seems that they do not interfere with each other. Recently, there is a tradition of "foreign exchange self-management" for certain foreign goods. If what is said is not true, then without using US dollars, I wonder how this foreign exchange can be self-managed? In addition to seeking black markets, I wonder if there are any other ways to self-manage like US dollars? The current black market exceeds the official limit by an unknown number of times, and I don't know if the previous US dollar trading method has been clearly abolished or revised? Some people explain: it is true that there are many difficulties in prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency. However, before the military and public, foreign currency was more prevalent than it is today. At that time, the government unified legal currency and prohibited foreign currency, which was really effective. We do not believe that the difficulties are worse than before after the abolition of unequal skipping.

(3) The Problem of Checking and Carrying Banknotes One of the advantages of banknotes is that they are more convenient to carry than coins, which is a fact that everyone works. However, this convenience has now completely disappeared. Moreover, the entire banknote that makes Kun, even though the seals are mottled and the seals are intact, is actually a public fact that private tickets are added, and theft and damage are openly and secretly. Sitting and making innocent people be eroded horizontally, they can only sigh helplessly, and countless disputes have occurred. The responsible authorities must know this, right? But we have never seen any effective measures.

(4) The Problem of Returned Checks Returned checks are a legal problem, not just a moral problem. However, now the returned checks are in the thousands, without any scruples. According to the number of returned checks announced by the exchange house, it has exceeded the normal exchange amount before the war, but I know that there is still no effective way to prevent it. The administrative and judicial aspects are probably irrelevant to them, and they can be ignored.

(5) The Supervision Problem of Commercial Banks The prior approval procedures for the establishment or reinstatement of commercial banks were originally very prudent. After the event, there are also permanent inspection agencies, deposits, loans, and there are preparation and review methods. Speculation, hoarding, gold and real estate mortgages are all prohibited. The authorities' maintenance of finance and introduction of the right track can be said to be the ultimate, there is nothing to add. However, if there is a slight disturbance in the market, there is always a type of uncautious firm that is directly or indirectly involved in the vortex and cannot extricate itself. If it is said that these firms are completely self-inflicted and should be eliminated, and there is no need to care about them, this naturally has a considerable reason. What is strange is that there are always some schadenfreude people who take advantage of others' difficulties and intend to replace them. The methods are particularly clever, or even 30 to 20 percent off, and heavy profits are made. On the surface, they are helping people in emergency, but in fact, they are receiving high interest rates. This cannot be said to be a strange phenomenon.

(6) The Loan Problem The procedures for various loans have long aroused many criticisms. Because it is clearly a loan for relief purposes, asking for this below and responding to this above, everyone admits it clearly. Therefore, in addition to the necessary investigation and guarantee to prevent it from flowing into improper uses, everything that can be Liu Tong should be given special consideration and should not be considered from a business perspective everywhere. For example, the heads of frequent banks and unlimited guarantees, as well as other trivial procedures, seem to be negotiable. Now aren't there many accounts that are discouraged and would rather give up this favor? Isn't there also a request from the authorities for simplification and relaxation? This can also prove the excessive trouble of the current method.

The public understands that this is a time of public and private difficulties. Industry and commerce are naturally waiting to be fed, thirsting for the government's emergency relief. The government's finances have long reached the point where they rely on printing money to deal with emergencies. How can there be sufficient surplus capacity to satisfy the general insatiable demands? According to normal theory, circulating finance and supporting industry and commerce are the natural duties of general commercial banks. They are unable to do so. Only when special circumstances occur do they turn to national banks to be their backing. The meaning of the so-called bank of banks is that in these situations, national banks should be asked to help, not to ask them to take on difficult tasks alone and replace the business of general banks. Therefore, the financial authorities must, on the one hand, strengthen national banks so that they can fulfill their responsibilities, and at the same time, they must assist general commercial banks as much as possible and make full use of them to share the responsibility of regulating finance. It is really like two wheels on a car, like two wings of a bird. A slight injury will affect the strength of the general and even themselves. This is a very clear theory. What is the current situation? We do not want to speculate deeply, but there have long been people advocating the abolition of the Four Allied Banks and the specialization of national banks, and the abolition of commercial banks' loan limits and the bottom-out deposit reserve, etc., have been partially realized, so it can be seen that the support for commercial banks still needs continued efforts.

Other problems, such as the flight of funds, the overflow of preparedness, and the deformed currency system in Northeast China and Taiwan, all need to be corrected to continue the national currency system and consolidate national resources. Therefore, the pressing problem now seems to be concentrated on finance. It is hoped that all parties concerned will recognize this point, concentrate their efforts, and solve it first, and then the entire economic problem will be better organized.

### Representatives of Shanghai Refugee Students Petition in Nanjing Without Success; Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Report the Process

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Yang Peilin, Yang Hanxun, and Qin Bangnan, representatives of the Shanghai Refugee Students Association who went to Nanjing to petition, held a press conference at the China University Student Union at 3:00 PM this afternoon. They stated that after arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th, they went to the Ministry of Education to petition. Councilor Guo received them and expressed sympathy. On the same morning, Yang and others went to the Ministry of Education again to see the minister. After being referred, they contacted the Higher Education Department. Section Chief Gao of the department met with them and said that the matter of public funding for poor refugee students from private schools had been submitted to the Executive Yuan, but had not been approved. The Ministry of Education was very clear and sympathetic to their difficult situation, and they would resubmit the situation to the Executive Yuan for instructions. Yang and others were not satisfied with this answer and decided not to return to Shanghai on the 10th. They decided to go to the Ministry of Education again on the morning of the 11th to request Minister Zhu to obtain concrete results before leaving Nanjing. Yang and others also stated that all of the more than 500 members of the petitioning group had originally planned to go to Nanjing together, but because of the incident of the rape of a female student at Peking University, in order to reduce trouble for the government and avoid misunderstandings, they changed to sending three representatives to Nanjing. If this action does not yield substantial results, all 500 refugee students may go to Nanjing to expand the petition.

Philippine government officials explained that the strict implementation of Philippine immigration law is not intended to make things difficult for the Chinese government, but Chinese people here say that the Philippine government's current tough policy is aimed at prohibiting immigration.

### Mrs. Cripps States that the British People Should Continue to Aid China; Very Satisfied with the Allocation of Aid to China Fund

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Mrs. Cripps, chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund, stated at a press conference in London tonight that her trip to China has convinced her that the British United Aid to China Fund should continue its work, as it has a clear task to fulfill in promoting friendship between the two countries. If the Aid to China Fund stops its work because of the cessation of hostilities, it will be unfortunate for the future relationship between the two countries, so now is the time to test British friendship with China. Mrs. Cripps also stated that it is amazing that the Aid to China Fund can be used extensively in all aspects of Chinese life. She was very encouraged that the Chinese people can sincerely recognize that the Aid to China Fund is a fund established by the British people for the welfare of the Chinese people. Mrs. Cripps is also very satisfied that this fund can be allocated to several organizations in a fair and skillful manner. There are more than 700 organizations in various parts of China (including Yan'an) that have received assistance from the Aid to China Fund. Mrs. Cripps praised the Chinese press when reporters visited her. She said that no matter where she went in China, the attendance at press conferences was very enthusiastic.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 9th] A love murder occurred here today. A Cantonese dancer was strangled to death in a hotel room by a young businessman.

The meeting adjourned at noon. It is learned that Yang will stay in Suzhou for a while and then go to other counties.

### A Slap Kills a Vendor; Town Chief Bribes to Settle the Murder Case; The Weak Younger Brother Cries Injustice

[Our Liuhe Dispatch] Donggou Town in the third district of the county is connected to Donggou Township in the fourth district of Yizheng County. Only the Daqiao Bridge on this street is the boundary. The area east of the bridge is Donggou Township in Yizheng County, and the area west of the bridge is Dongning Town in this county. When there are special circumstances, the township chiefs of both sides will consult with each other to handle them. At about 10:00 AM on December 25th of last year, Li Jiucai (about 40 years old), a villager from Donggou Township, Yizheng County, was selling tofu along the street. When he was on the Dongning Town section, Sun Lishu, a town resident, bought two catties of tofu. A conflict arose between the two over a 100 yuan change. Sun Lishu was young, strong, fierce, and unusual. Taking advantage of the fact that he was unprepared, he raised his hand and slapped Li in the ear. Li fell to the ground and died on the spot. Town Chief Zhang Yifang of Donggou Town asked local people to settle the matter hastily for more than one million yuan. Li Jiuhai, the younger brother of the deceased, reported to the Dongqing Township Office for legal handling because his brother was beaten to death innocently. After receiving the report, Township Chief Xia Boru of Donggou Township believed that Town Chief Zhang Yifang of Dongning Town had bribed and settled the murder case, forcing the family of the deceased to accept the settlement, which was an illegal act and violated the criminal law. He will report the details of the case to the Judicial Office of this county for legal handling.

### Jin Hua Tongji Bridge Damaged Again Half a Year After Repair

[Report from our Jinhua Bureau] The Tongji Bridge in this county, historically known as a marvel of eastern Zhejiang and a vital transportation artery, was partially destroyed by enemy bombing in April of the thirty-first year (of the Republic - 1942) due to strategic considerations during the Japanese invasion of eastern Zhejiang. Later, Jinhua fell into enemy hands, and the enemy purchased wood to repair it. After the restoration of sovereignty, the government authorities, recognizing that the bridge had been damaged and dilapidated after being occupied by the enemy for three years, deemed it necessary to repair it again. They previously requested and were approved by the Administrative Yuan Branch Office to use the method of "work-for-relief," inviting merchants to contract the project, which was completed in July of last year. However, recently, due to the large number of heavy vehicles passing over it, the wood in the middle section has cracked again, and the wooden railings on the west side are also shaky and about to fall. The safety of pedestrians is a concern. It is reported that the county police bureau is discussing with local gentry and relevant authorities to find a way to repair it again to ensure safety.

Since the government announced the Conscription Law, conscription has begun. Because the knowledge level of our compatriots is not high enough, every new policy will inevitably cause some disturbances, let alone conscription. To compatriots with insufficient knowledge, the facts are already terrifying. Furthermore, the village heads and heads of groups lack prior publicity, leading to various disturbances. I, as a member of the nation, should support conscription. Therefore, I offer a humble opinion for reference:

(1) Our compatriots are afraid of military service due to long-standing habits and a current lack of knowledge. To make our compatriots unafraid of military service, the fundamental solution lies in education, and the immediate solution lies in advocacy. The fundamental solution is not something that can be achieved overnight, but the immediate solution is that grassroots workers lack sufficient preparation. No wonder our compatriots are confused and want to fear and evade it. Their method of evasion is to find substitutes, and hiring substitutes costs a great deal of money. The village heads and heads of groups assign how much each substitute should pay. Poor compatriots, fearing conscription, have no choice but to painfully pay the money. I ask, are these substitutes beneficial to the country? The purpose of national conscription is to prevent problems before they occur and to be able to cope with sudden events at any time and anywhere. But how can these substitutes cope? Secondly, these types of substitutes can repeatedly perform substitute work. Over time, this will inevitably evolve into career soldiers. If something happens, they will be at a loss. Can this seriousness be ignored? Therefore, I believe that the government should ( ) before starting conscription, earnestly guide the meaning and mission of military service, and earnestly warn against substitutes. If there are substitutes, how should they be punished? (B) The conscripted soldiers should be strictly inspected for their qualities. If any suspicion of substitutes is found, they should be rejected and the conscription officers should be responsible for resending them.

(2) Poor compatriots are also afraid of being conscripted because of their livelihoods. They are already struggling to make ends meet. Once they are conscripted, their families will be eligible to starve to death. The government is also aware of this and has regulations for deferment. However, deferment only postpones conscription temporarily. During the deferment period, the economic situation of these poor compatriots is unlikely to improve. So what will happen after the deferment period? Therefore, I think it would be better to organize a conscript mutual aid association. The purpose of the mutual aid association is: (A) For any conscript who is indeed responsible for the livelihood of the entire family, it is stipulated that a mutual aid fund will be provided. The amount of the fund can be adjusted at any time according to the cost of living index. The mutual aid fund will be paid monthly to their family. (B) The mutual aid fund will be shared equally by all conscripts in the district. (C) After the conscript completes his service, he must also fulfill the same obligation. (He Zhongmou)

The Displaced Urgently Need National Identification Cards

I am a refugee from Huai'an who fled to Shanghai. Although I have a place to live and am not suffering from the hardship of sleeping in the open, my longing for my hometown is constant. Fortunately, our army recovered Huai'an City in mid-September. I was overjoyed upon hearing this good news and wished I could fly home immediately. When I was packing to return home, I suddenly received a letter from my family saying that anyone who fled outside the city must have a national identity card to enter the city. It is not easy to stay in an inn along the way. Therefore, I registered with the head of the security office. (Because the first phase of registration had passed when I came to Shanghai.) I really hoped to get it back home in ten days or half a month. Unexpectedly, more than two months have passed and there is still no news. If it is delayed like this, how can I not feel anxious?

Because your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, I urge you to publish this letter and hope that the relevant authorities will expedite the issuance of supplementary national identity cards to the heads of each district for distribution to the applicants, so that many refugees can return to their hometowns and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

The Problem of Sewage Contracting in This City

Regarding the sewage contracting problem in this city, it has recently become a hot topic again. Because there is a lot of money to be made, various parties are competing to obtain this good business and immediately become a huge undertaking. Whether their calculations are stable or not, we don't care. But from the standpoint of public health, it is necessary to review it.

Anyone who has been in Shanghai for a long time knows that for the past several decades, the municipal authorities have entrusted such an important sanitation task to several contractors, resulting in the creation of several "sewage kings" who have also accumulated a special kind of power that still exists today and cannot be eradicated for a while. A single alley is controlled by a single sewage worker, a single section is controlled by a single vehicle owner, a single pier is controlled by a single pier director, and a single area is controlled by a single "sewage king." They collude with each other, manipulating this interest, and will never easily allow laborers to intervene. Therefore, they do not attach importance to this sanitation work, but only seek profit, taking income as the first priority. They arbitrarily demand monthly fees from residents, request gratuities for festivals, and yearly bonuses. When they are not satisfied, they can arbitrarily refuse to empty the sewage, or even jointly strike. The authorities and millions of residents have no choice but to sigh helplessly. As for the proposed restoration of the contracting system, as long as we look at the facts before us, not only the sanitation authorities recognize it very clearly, but every resident will definitely not agree to its revival. Since the Yongda Company, a contractor, was changed to a public-private partnership in November of the 34th year (of the Republic - 1945), and then on April 1st of the 35th year, the municipal council resolutely decided to formally establish the Sanitation Bureau, which was completely taken over by the city, citizens across the city have placed deep expectations on this! The wise measures should be thoroughly implemented to reform our administration of decades in one fell swoop. I remember that the media at the time greatly encouraged this, because every citizen had suffered from the pain inflicted by the contractors and hoped to be liberated from the hands of the "sewage kings." But how long has it been? Now there is talk of reviving the contracting system again. It is impossible not to be surprised. I heard that since the establishment of the Sanitation Bureau, monthly income has gradually increased. Recently, monthly income has always been more than 300-400 million yuan. Compared with the period when contractors profited from it, it is no longer the same. If it is said that the contracting system is being restored to increase municipal revenue, it is obviously not justified. So what is it for? Is it because difficulties were encountered in promoting the work, or is it to place the responsibility for improving public health on a few profit-seeking contractors and evade this responsibility themselves? That is even more unreasonable. At the same time, our sanitation authorities should not and cannot evade this responsibility.

Now let's review the achievements since the establishment of the Sanitation Bureau. As for the internal situation of the Sanitation Bureau, outsiders cannot know it in detail. But from what we have seen, for example, the extortion and refusal to empty sewage by sewage workers, once citizens report it, the bureau has now improved a lot regarding the sewage workers who violate the rules. Regarding the monthly fee amounts and the regulations on public deputy paper sales prices and taking gratuities, the bureau has also issued repeated announcements. The original lack of standards is now something that citizens across the city have adapted to. The original sewage truck transportation and pier work hours were indefinite, but now they can all comply with the stipulated time. Under deeply rooted malpractices, this small improvement, although not entirely satisfactory, is already commendable. We are definitely not protecting the current sanitation administrators, but only hope that the sanitation authorities can select competent talents to take on this sanitation work that is closely related to millions of citizens, so that it can be further improved to comfort the longings of the citizens.

According to the reports in the newspapers a few days before the festival, the sewage contracting system is on the verge of being revived, and has been passed by the municipal government, and has also put forward several points of opinion, which will be submitted to the Health Committee of the current Municipal Council for discussion and passage. I hope that our city councilors and municipal authorities should think about the welfare of the public. Hopes placed on a small number of profit-seeking contractors are fundamentally unreasonable.

### The US Government's New Budget Proposal: Truman Submits to Congress, Amounting to Over $37.5 Billion; Defense Expenditures Still Account for the Largest Share

[United Press Washington, 10th] President Truman today submitted to Congress the US government's estimated budget for the year beginning July 1st, totaling $37,528 million, and 恳 (earnestly) requested Cheffer to reduce tax rates. However, Republican congressmen claim that this amount can be cut by $8 billion, and those who advocate tax cuts are quite determined. President Truman's annual budget consultation estimates that if income taxes are collected as usual, the government can have a surplus of $202 million by June 30, 1948, the end of the next fiscal year. Furthermore, if Congress approves the continued collection of luxury taxes that are currently scheduled to be reduced starting July 1st, and the Post Office Department increases postage to make up for the shortfall in postal expenses, then this surplus can increase to $800 million. President Truman does not agree with the Democrats' claim that tax rates can be reduced while still balancing the budget, stating, "This is a realistic budget, and it is as perfect as possible within our capabilities. If there are any surplus funds, they should be used to pay off the public debt, which currently totals $260.4 billion." President Truman allocated $6,758 million to the Army and $4,423 million to the Navy, and also stated, "Defense expenditures are still the largest item in the budget. We still bear significant responsibilities arising from the war. The military occupation of Europe and the Far East must continue. Defense expenditures, fixed expenditures, tax refunds, international expenses, and assistance to veterans require a total of $33 billion and cannot be cut. The rest is the cost of the programs carried out by various departments and agencies. The expenses requested by various departments and agencies are far more than the amount in the budget."

[Central News Agency Washington, 9th, Associated Press] Marshal Marshall, who is about to take office as Secretary of State, will go to Moscow in late February to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee indicated today that the committee would inquire about a wide range of diplomatic issues, including all major issues. Influential senators strongly stated that the Senate's rapid passage of Marshal Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State was not unconditional, so they very much hope to hear his views on world issues.

[Reuters Washington, 9th] It was reported today from authoritative sources that US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson has agreed to remain in office until June 30th. This proves that Marshall's peace policy will be no different from that of Byrnes when he was in office. Acheson will be Acting Secretary of State during Marshall's absence to attend international conferences, so it is very important for him to continue to serve in the State Department.

[Reuters London, 9th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the special representatives of the four major foreign ministers will begin discussing German and Austrian peace treaties in London on January 14th. The 18 countries invited to present their opinions to them can present them orally or in writing, or simultaneously using both methods. The spokesman pointed out that the current invitation to the 18 countries to present their opinions is only a preliminary request for opinions at the current stage, and it is not impossible to convene a full peace conference similar to the Paris Peace Conference last summer in the future.

### Gartner to be Envoy to England: Approved by US Senate

### Hull and Byrnes Send Telegrams to Marshall to Congratulate Him

[Associated Press Washington, 10th] Former Secretary of State Hull sent a telegram of congratulations to Marshall from Bethesda Naval Hospital, which read, "Your talents will surely enable you to create a great record as Secretary of State." Byrnes also sent a telegram saying, "You have served with outstanding talent in three departments of our country's government, namely the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the State Department, and have built great and lasting achievements." When Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, his annual salary will be reduced by $751. When he was a five-star general, his base salary and allowances reached $15,751, but when he takes office as Secretary of State, his salary will only be $15,000.

### Administration of the US-Occupied Zone in Germany to be Taken Over by the State Department

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: After Marshal Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, all affairs related to the occupation of Germany will be transferred from the War Department to the State Department. According to Senator Brewster, after Marshall returns to the United States, he will propose that the occupation of Germany be transferred from the War Department to the State Department. Brewster continued that US Military Governor of Germany General Clay recently returned to Washington and requested that Byrnes take over all affairs within the German-occupied zone, but this was not approved.

### The United States Government Has Decided To Demand Japanese Reparations Immediately; MacArthur Will Proceed As Soon As Instructions Arrive; Unwilling to Accommodate Soviet Objections

[Associated Press Washington, 9th] The State Department and the War Department announced today that the United States has decided to demand Japanese reparations immediately, and is unwilling to accommodate objections from the Soviet Union and other wartime allies. According to Penfield, the Acting Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, it will be used for reparations. Under Secretary of the Army Peterson also stated that MacArthur and the Japanese government will be notified as soon as possible which industries should be left in Japan so that the Japanese can base their economic recovery on realistic foundations and no longer rely on US aid. Although this move is often notified to the Far Eastern Commission, it does not need to wait for its formal approval. Regarding the occupying forces in Japan, the United States has 124,000 troops, and the United Kingdom has 40,000 troops. Peterson also stated that the United States has shipped a total of more than 2 million tons of food to Japan, which should be paid for by Japan.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 10th] After reports from the Philippine Five-Person Reparations Committee and Nanjing that China had also decided to send a five-person delegation to this country to inspect Japanese factories that could be used as reparations, it was learned today that other Allied countries will also send the same delegation.

### Many Difficulties in Transportation Issues

[Associated Press Tokyo, 10th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today that no instructions have been received regarding the dismantling and removal of Japanese factory machinery as reparations. Once instructions arrive, it will be handled immediately. MacArthur Headquarters has now designated 1,000 Japanese factories for dismantling and removal, but transportation procedures are a major problem. It is not yet known which country will provide ships to transport this industrial equipment to the countries requesting reparations. China and the Philippines do not have ships and may need to borrow US ships for transportation in the future. As for how to allocate the machinery of the more than 1,000 Japanese factories that have been designated, a list has been drawn up, but a final decision has not yet been made.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco 10th Broadcast: The Soviet Union has made a request to Norway to establish bases in Spitsbergen. This location is on the edge of the Arctic, between the Soviet periphery and Greenland, directly off the American defense line, across the Arctic. The matter may be submitted to the United Nations for discussion. According to reports from Oslo: The Norwegian cabinet is scheduled to discuss this issue today, and the news will be announced tonight. US officials have not made any comments on this matter before receiving official information.

### Today's General Assembly Agenda: Budget Review in the Morning, Proposal Discussions in the Afternoon, and Notification for the Materials Supply Bureau to Attend and Report

[Our Reporter] The City Council will hold a general review meeting this morning to discuss the budget for the 36th year, the city government's work report, the central work plan, and the policy reports of various bureaus. The Director of the Executive Yuan Materials Supply Bureau, Jiang Biao, has been notified to attend the meeting at 10:00 am to report. The afternoon will continue with proposal discussions.

### Over 300 Mu of Civilian Land: Military Needs Cited as the Reason for Non-Return, According to Zhu Ping

[Our Reporter] Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau responded orally to the inquiries of councilors the other day, stating: (1) Regarding the enemy and puppet forces occupying over 300 mu of civilian land near Zhujiaqiao in Pudong to build an anti-aircraft artillery position, after the city government's restoration, it received requests from the landowners for return in November of the previous year. However, at that time, the Third Corps Command stated that there were important matters requiring its retention. After the Land Administration Bureau jointly dispatched personnel with the Third Corps Command for on-site surveys, it was claimed that there were still military needs. A decision on how to proceed would be made after further study, but no response has been received to date. Now that it has been raised, the bureau will send a letter to General Tang Enbo of the Garrison Command in Nanjing and Shanghai to inquire. If there is no longer a need, it will be returned to the landowners. (2) From the start of land value tax collection on November 16th to December 31st last year, a total of 3.07 billion yuan was collected. The previous council meeting stipulated that 3 billion yuan be collected, and by the end of last year, it had been fully collected, exceeding the target by 70 million yuan. The Land Administration Bureau only collects and does not receive; the collection is handled separately by personnel dispatched by the city treasury. As for the allocation of the collected funds, since everything is统筹統支 by the city government, the Finance Bureau can be consulted on how it is allocated. The exact acreage of land taxed requires detailed investigation. (3) Regarding the suggestion that the city government lease public land to civilians to solve part of the housing shortage problem, the city government's solution to the housing shortage, drafted at the end of August last year, already stipulated the leasing of public land for housing construction. Therefore, this proposal aligns with the city government's established policy. Moreover, the city government not only leases public land but also stipulates that new buildings are exempt from land value tax for two years and house tax for one year to encourage the construction of new houses. (4) Regarding the illegal sale of public land during the enemy and puppet period, the results of the investigation regarding the old Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council have been obtained from the central government. As it involves diplomacy, negotiations are being conducted separately with Britain and France, and concrete results are pending. Additionally, leases and sales by the puppet city government are declared invalid. (5) The land value tax collection applies to areas where land registration has been completed. Areas without registration are still subject to land tax. (6) The standard for land value estimation during the land value tax collection was determined after investigation and discussion by an evaluation committee organized in accordance with central regulations. Land value division is based on average prices determined by region, not estimated for each individual plot. Therefore, those with lower values benefit slightly, while those with higher values inevitably suffer. Land values are planned to be re-estimated this year, and every effort will be made to correct inaccuracies at that time. As for the point that land value tax collection does not consider income, land value tax is a property tax and is not based on income. According to the central land law, vacant land must also be taxed, and at a high rate. (6) Regarding the fact that land ownership certificates have not yet been issued, the review process requires fifteen procedures, and according to law, there is also a two-month announcement period. Due to these legal procedures, it is unavoidable. However, when owners need them, they can be returned after being photographed to avoid hindering the owners' capital operations.

### Agreed Solution for Vegetable Vendors Inside and Outside the Eleventh District Market

[Our Reporter] Vegetable vendors outside the Eleventh District Market petitioned the city council, requesting to set up stalls in their original locations outside the market. However, vendors inside the market also petitioned the council, requesting that vendors outside the market comply with the police bureau's regulations and relocate to locations 300 yards away from the market. The two sides were deadlocked. After the speaker dispatched Councilors Yan E'sheng and Tang Shichang to jointly consult with Section Chief Zhi Chao of the police bureau and Director Zhang Wei of the health bureau, a solution was agreed upon: (1) The more than 80 vegetable vendors who were originally inside the market but later moved outside must return to their original stalls inside the market to do business. (2) On the Zhenshanhaiguan Road side of the market, from the Chengdu Road intersection to the Shanhaili, and on the Chengdu Road side, from the Zhenshanhaiguan Road intersection to the Sanderli, all vegetable vendors outside the market must relocate and are not allowed to set up stalls. (3) All other locations remain unchanged. (4) This solution is temporarily approved until the end of the lunar year. However, Section Chief Fang stated that in the future, apart from the front and side of the market, where stalls are not allowed, if other locations do not obstruct traffic, they may be allowed to continue setting up stalls until the deadline; otherwise, they must be banned.

### Budget Subcommittee Review Results: Net Increase of 41.3 Billion Yuan Deemed Possible; Hope for Further Streamlining of the City Government's Extensive Organization

[Our Reporter] Based on the budget reports from various bureaus and departments of the city government the other day, the city council's budget committee held a subcommittee review meeting at the residence of Councilor Xu Yongzuo yesterday evening at 7:00 pm to review this year's budget. Councilor He Yuanming chaired the meeting, and Speaker Pan also attended in person. After preliminary deliberations, the committee plans to make some increases and decreases within the regular expenditure category, resulting in a net increase of over 41.34 billion yuan. Increases include: land value tax 3.6 billion, business tax 28 billion, slaughter tax 4.8 billion, business license tax 3.6 billion, wharf dues 15.1 billion, inheritance tax 2 billion, fines over 3.88 billion yuan, administrative fees 1 billion, business fees 8.8 billion, and excess land revenue over 13.3 million yuan, totaling approximately 52 billion yuan. Decreases include: vehicle license tax 1.8 billion, banquet tax 4.8 billion, and inn tax 4.2 billion, totaling approximately 10.8 billion yuan. Entertainment tax will remain unchanged.

The committee found the budget review extremely difficult because revenue departments could not be increased much, and expenditure departments were difficult to reduce. However, the city government's organization is too large, with numerous agencies and excessive personnel. Therefore, the committee can only ask the city government to consider streamlining and merging under the principle of retrenchment and will submit this opinion for discussion at today's general assembly.

### Request to Determine the Number of National Assembly Delegates for Directly Governed Municipalities; Telegram Nationwide to Unanimously Support the Constitution

[Our Reporter] At yesterday's city council meeting, chaired by Speaker Pan, discussions on proposals began, resulting in the passage of six proposals related to civil affairs. Among them, the proposal to suggest that the Legislative Yuan legally determine the number of National Assembly delegates to be elected by directly governed municipalities to rectify omissions in the constitution and demonstrate fairness was met with enthusiastic speeches by Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Qu Cheng, and others. They argued that Article 26 of the constitution, which was passed by the National Assembly and regulates the organization of National Assembly delegates, is particularly disadvantageous to directly governed municipalities. They requested that the status of directly governed municipalities be determined, with each district of a directly governed municipality being equivalent to a county in a province, generating one representative. The discussion resulted in the passage of the original proposal, with the council sending letters to the city councils of other directly governed municipalities to jointly advocate for suggestions to the central government.

A temporary emergency motion by Zhou Lianze and 23 others to send a telegram nationwide to support the constitution was unanimously passed.

Other civil affairs proposals passed include: (1) Suggesting that city government officials periodically inspect suburban areas to promote suburban development. (2) The city government should promptly implement the resolutions of the first general assembly to respect public opinion. (3) Requesting the city government authorities to reduce redundant personnel and increase the salaries of working staff to prevent corruption. (4) Suggesting that the central government determine the autonomy of citizens in directly governed municipalities as soon as possible and that the council draft a local autonomy law for the city. (5) Each suburban area of the city should quickly establish a people's self-defense force.

### French Tram Slowdown Incident: Please Expedite Impartial Interruption and Immediately Restore Normalcy

[Our Reporter] A temporary motion submitted by City Councilors Shi Zhifu and 26 others at yesterday's general assembly stated: "The public vehicles operated by the French Tram Company are moving slowly. Please urge the relevant authorities to immediately supervise improvements to facilitate transportation." The general assembly resolved that the city government should promptly order the Public Utilities and Social Affairs Bureaus to impartially interrupt (截断) [translator note: cut off, intervene] within a specified period and order the company to immediately restore normal traffic conditions. If the company fails to comply with the interruption for any reason, it should be sanctioned according to the law.

Mayor Wu stated regarding this case: "This matter is a labor dispute, but the responsibility does not lie entirely with the company. We should sympathize with and assist the labor side, but the labor side's intentional work slowdown before mediation and arbitration is illegal."

Additionally, the temporary motion submitted by Shao Yongsheng and others regarding the shantytown problem requested that, based on the principle of not harassing the common people and not endangering public safety, the Public Works, Social Affairs, and Legal Regulations Committees, along with representatives from the five bureaus, hold regular joint meetings to formulate concrete measures for the government to implement conscientiously. The general assembly passed the motion without objection.

### Stalemate in Year-End Bonus Issue: Evening Newspapers Continued to Suspend Publication Yesterday

The city's major evening newspapers, including Lianhe, have been suspending publication since the day before due to the inability to resolve the year-end bonus issue between labor and management. According to the person in charge of the newspaper workers, "The management of each newspaper had agreed to issue one month's salary as a year-end bonus, and some had already advanced half of it. However, on the evening of the 8th, the management took joint action, announcing a rigid rule of half a month's salary for the year-end bonus and enforcing it forcibly. As a result, the management stopped providing manuscripts for the past two days, and the labor side was unable to work. The responsibility for this should be borne by the authorities of each newspaper. For more than 360 days a year, we work tirelessly, using both our hands and brains, sweating and exerting ourselves, living in a state of constant tension. If we take sick leave or personal leave, we must find replacement workers at high prices. We have no weekly holidays and no salary increases or overtime pay. Therefore, our actual income for the year is less than ten months out of twelve, with a monthly salary of only over 100,000 yuan. Therefore, our request for one month's salary this time is fair and reasonable. As for the management's difficulties, that is indeed the case, but most newspaper operations report losses. We cannot stop eating for fear of choking."

Moreover, the Shanghai Night Newspaper Liaison Association issued a letter to the workers of various night newspapers yesterday, stating: "We believe that the year-end bonus issue raised by the workers of the six evening newspapers this time should be sympathized with. We accept it in principle. The problem is that in the context of the overall industrial and commercial decline in Shanghai, we have exhausted our efforts and exceeded our capabilities. Therefore, we never believe that the workers' demands should be ignored. We only hope for mutual understanding of the actual difficulties and seek a solution that suits the actual conditions of both sides. We hope that with your understanding, we can resume our duty to society as journalists as soon as possible. Therefore, we are extremely willing for the problems between us to be resolved quickly."

### Foolish Thief Turns Himself In

[Our Reporter] The Xicheng cigarette paper shop at 370 Fujian Road was robbed on the evening of the 5th of this month at 8:30 pm by five or six bandits who claimed to be searching for opium and robbed 660,000 yuan in cash and gold jewelry. Before leaving, they even forced the shop owner, Gao Huanren, to issue a check for 1 million yuan from the Coal Industry Bank. Afterwards, Gao reported it to the police bureau, and Section Chief Li dispatched officers to investigate. On the afternoon of July, the bandits, because the check was a crossed check and could not be cashed, sent the bandit Sun Qiutao to negotiate with Gao, where he was arrested by the police. He confessed that his accomplices were hiding at 150 Julu Road. The police rushed to the address and arrested Xin Ruolei, Yu Haoran, Chen Xiaoyun, Xin Tianyu, Ding Youding, and five others. They then went to 30 Wenchang Lane, Tanggu Road, and seized three pistols, one Mauser pistol, 21 bullets, and stolen goods including a gold ring. During the interrogation, Xin Ruolei even claimed to be a section chief of the Central Statistics Bureau, while the bandit Yu claimed to be a deputy secretary. However, after the police bureau investigated with the Central Statistics Bureau, they learned that it was all a false pretense. The case was completed yesterday. The suspects confessed to impersonating the Central Statistics Bureau and robbing the Xicheng cigarette paper shop. All firearms were supplied by the fugitive Huang Jinman, so they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

### Embezzlement by Staff Still Under Investigation

### Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Zhenru Plant Announces Dissolution at the End of the Month: Official Explanation is Due to No Achievements in a Year

[Our Reporter] The spokesperson of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration announced yesterday that the Zhenru plant has been scheduled to be dissolved at the end of this month. The remaining machinery and equipment, approximately 100,000 tons, will be taken over by the Shanghai branch's industrial and mining equipment warehouse. Except for a portion to be laid off, the remaining employees in the original plant will be assigned to other parts of the general office to work. The authorities' decision to dissolve the Zhenru Equipment Plant is officially explained as being due to no achievements by the plant in the past year. However, it is generally believed to be closely related to the recent discovery of senior officials of the plant stealing materials and equipment.

It is said that the senior officials of the plant used their positions to steal materials and equipment from the plant and privately entrusted commercial firms to sell them, resulting in significant losses. After the incident, nine Chinese and foreign engineering personnel, including Deputy Director Heath, were implicated and are currently under investigation. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration authorities have conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and are trying to recover the stolen goods. According to reporters' inquiries to the responsible parties yesterday, the value of the stolen goods recovered to date is approximately over 100 million yuan, approaching 200 million yuan. The total value of all stolen goods is difficult to estimate because the theft has been carried out more than ten times. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration authorities are continuing to investigate, and have also ordered the plant to investigate the receipt and dispatch of materials over the past year, and the truth will soon come to light.

The official claim that the plant's work was fruitless refers to the aspect of training talent. The plant was established in the spring of last year, and it was intended to train people to use various state-of-the-art machines in the manner of a technical school. The reporter still remembers that when the plant hosted a tour in August, Deputy Director Heath claimed that it could be completed within half a year, but to date, it is understood that only a few tractor drivers have been trained.

### Old Judge Changes Sides: Sun Shaokang Pleads Not Guilty, Claiming He Was Ordered to Serve as a Puppet Official

[Our Reporter] Sun Shaokang, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court who later defected and served as the president of the puppet Shanghai District Court, was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Sun is already 62 years old, bald with graying short hair, wearing a blue cloth robe and black cotton shoes. He spoke with a Northeast accent and carefully reviewed the transcript of his previous court testimony, wearing old spectacles to read each word and correcting two errors. He then argued that when he was serving as the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, the Shanghai Concessions had not yet fallen into enemy hands. The Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, Qiao Wanxuan, had already collaborated with the enemy. He initially did not know this, and was lured by Qiao to a residence in western Shanghai where he was taken by a member of Unit 76 to participate in a puppet organization. He replied that the central government severely punished collaborators with the enemy, and without considering patriotism, he was simply afraid of dying, and he婉转地 [tactfully] answered to the puppet agent. After being released, he reported to Pan Zixin, who telegraphed the Military Intelligence Bureau, and later received (1) Jing Chenyu, (2) Jing Xuyu, (3) Jing Xu San telegrams approving his participation in the puppet organization to engage in underground work to protect underground workers. After receiving the telegram, he took office as the puppet president. He even said with a confident tone that with his small qualifications, if he were to be a traitor, he would be more than just the president of the District Court. He had served as the president of the District Court seven or eight times before the war, and he was really tired of doing it. His words implied that he was lowering himself. He also requested to confront Xia Zhongming, a puppet agent from Unit 76 who was in custody, because Xia had testified in the previous hearing that he had participated in the Unit 76 court colleagues' research society, which was quite detrimental to him.

### Publisher of University Eye Drops Denies Supplying Alcohol to the Enemy

[Our Reporter] Wang Zhensan, the original publisher of University Eye Drops, was accused of opening the Hequn Alcohol Factory during the enemy and puppet period, hiring Japanese technicians, and supplying alcohol to the enemy. He argued in the High Court yesterday that the alcohol was not supplied to the enemy, but was sold through ordinary stores. The defendant's defense lawyer presented two advertisements published in puppet newspapers at the time as proof. The court ordered further investigation and adjourned the hearing.

### Tao Zhongli, Accused of Harming Underground Workers, Was Questioned Yesterday

[Our Reporter] Tao Zhongli, accused of colluding with the enemy and puppet forces to harm underground workers and extort merchants, was questioned in the High Court yesterday. The defendant claimed to be a businessman and denied colluding with the enemy and puppet forces. The court adjourned the hearing.

It is said that Tao Zhongli once organized the Dazhong Shipping Company, the Dongfang Shanghai Opera House, and the Jichang Cotton Shop. He was very close to the captain of the enemy's military police, Takeshita, and the translators Zheng Jinwen and Wang Bin. On October 5, 1942, he led enemy soldiers from Tanaka and lured Weng Maoxiong, the standing committee member of the 20th branch directly under our party committee in Nanhui County, to the enemy's military police team at Wangjia Wharf in the city for detention, where he was subjected to severe torture. Tao extorted 50,000 yuan in puppet currency from him before Weng was released on bail. In May 1945, he extorted merchants Xi Deming and Fan Jinkun. Xi was extorted of ten tins of White Tin-Wrapped cigarettes and 50,000 yuan in puppet currency, and Fan was extorted of 1 million yuan in puppet currency. All of these were handled by Tao Zhongli and handed over to Takeshita for distribution, with the defendant receiving 200,000 yuan in puppet currency.

### Wife and Children Scattered, Old Father Commits Suicide: Chen Hui Sues for Damages of 100 Million Yuan

Zhang Guanfu, a local resident who ran a shoe store at 265 Zhejiang Road, was previously accused of being a traitor by Chen Hui in the High Court. The High Court ruled that since the defendant did not hold any positions in the enemy or puppet organizations, nor did he participate in groups affiliated with the puppet organizations, and it could not be proven that he had conspired with the enemy, his arrest of the plaintiff together with the enemy police, whether out of coercion or willingness, was difficult to punish as treason. However, his suspicion of obstructing the freedom of others was quite serious, and jurisdiction was in error, and he should be transferred to the local court for trial. It is learned that the plaintiff has now hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the civil court, demanding that the defendant compensate for incidental civil damages totaling 132.31 million yuan, stating that the plaintiff once worked underground, and the defendant betrayed his conscience, causing his wife and children to scatter. In October of the same year, his father committed suicide by jumping off a building, leading to the destruction of his family. This case was heard yesterday, with the lawyer acting on behalf of the plaintiff, and a re-examination is guaranteed.

### Jeep Girl Testifies in Rickshaw Puller Stabbing Case: Another Sailor Involved, Prosecutor's Office Speeding Up Investigation

[Our Reporter] In the case of the American sailor stabbing the rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang on New Year's Day, Huang Daping, the prosecutor in charge of the case at the prosecutor's office, went to the Gongji Hospital with a forensic doctor yesterday to verify the injuries, and summoned Wang Xiulan, the "Jeep girl" who witnessed the incident, to testify. Wang testified to the prosecutor that Cheng Rongfang was indeed stabbed by Rogers with a knife, and stated that another American sailor named Poros also assisted Rogers in beating Cheng Rongfang. The prosecutor will expedite the investigation, given that the incident occurred after December 31, 1946, and that he may be eligible for amnesty, and will file a public prosecution for assault. Poros, mentioned by Wang Xiulan, will also be summoned for questioning.

### French Tram Still Moving at a Snail's Pace: Round Trip Takes Nearly Four Hours

[Our Reporter's Special Report] When the French Tram was not "slow-working," vehicles on the Jinling East Road section from Ba Xian Qiao to the Bund were as congested as weaving shuttles. The bell rang all day long, constantly making you feel extremely nervous. But these days are different. Although the road is still as congested as before, the tight ringing of the tram bell has been reduced, reduced to only two or three crisp and slow rings within an hour.

Looking down the long Xiafei Road, you can see rows of trams moving slowly. Some say they are "bull-pacing," but in fact, although "bull-pacing" is slow, it is much faster than the "slow-working" trams that stop and go. If you don't believe it, try it.

Yesterday, the reporter took a long "bull-pace trip." At 1:43 pm, I boarded the No. 2 tram, starting from the first station at 16 Pu, stopping at 18 stations along the way. After arriving at Xujiahui, I waited for half an hour and then returned on the same tram, arriving at 16 Pu at 5:23 pm! The average stop time per station on the way out was more than one minute, but the situation was very different on the return trip. There were dark crowds of people waiting for the bus at each station,挤满在站 [packed in the station]. The car was already completely impassable. Few people got off the bus when it arrived at the station, but many people wanted to get on, so they desperately squeezed onto the bus. Even if they couldn't squeeze on, they refused to step back, leaving half of their bodies hanging outside the bus. The ticket inspector, citing compliance with the company's regulations,任乘客們去擠 [allowed the passengers to squeeze], so the delay was prolonged again and again, and it was already dusk when I returned to 16 Pu. It is said that if it were not for the "slow-working," a one-way trip would only take 35 minutes.

When the tram was moving, it was also moving slowly, without the feeling of lightning and wind of the past. A woman in her forties came up to me on Ferguson Road. The small basket she was carrying was already squeezed flat. She不停地问電車走慢 [constantly asked why the tram was moving slowly], whether it was because of insufficient power. Several people in the car felt bored and got off to walk. I poked my head out of the window to look at them, and their backs gradually disappeared from me.

The ticket inspectors and drivers all seemed listless. Anxious people sighed in the car, and some simply leaned against the car wall and started snoring!

It is said that with this "slow-working," the capital's losses have been cut in half. This fare money has been transferred to the rickshaw and rickshaw pullers. From Ferguson Road to the Bund, the fare is at least 5,000 yuan!

### Robbery on the Republic Road Last Night: Losses Reach Over 20 Million

[Our Reporter] Last night at around 6:00 pm, more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived at the Tongda Company and Jiande Bank inside 269 Republic Road Xin Kai He Kou. All of them were wearing Russian hats and holding wooden shell guns and other military equipment.拥人入内 [crowding into the interior], the bandits first tied up the staff of the two companies with hemp ropes and confined them in a room, with one bandit guarding them with a weapon, forbidding them from moving. The remaining bandits broke into the accounting room,翻箱倒篐 [ransacking boxes and cabinets], and as a result, 21 million yuan in legal tender was robbed, along with four gold rings on the staff's hands. They took the stolen goods and escaped at around 7:00 pm. After receiving the news, the Huangpu Branch ordered the police to rush to the scene, but the bandits had already escaped far away.

### Private Newspapers Petition Again: Hope to Simplify Loan Procedures

Twelve private newspapers in Shanghai, facing financial difficulties at the end of the year, jointly requested an emergency loan of 30 million yuan each from Executive Yuan President Song and Central Propaganda Department Minister Zhang. President Song approved the request for the Four Banks Joint Office to handle, and Minister Peng verbally agreed to find a way to expedite its realization. Yesterday, the Four Banks Joint Office sent a telegram to each newspaper instructing them to directly contact the Central Trust Bureau to handle the loan procedures. However, the loan methods still require oil,墨紙張 [ink, paper] as collateral, or bank acceptance, and the private newspapers have no surplus items other than those supplied for their own use to mortgage. Therefore, the newspapers believe that this loan method is no different

The Ancestral Master at the Top of Mount Wudang - The Chu Overlord on the Crest of the Qinling Mountains - The Mystery of Li Xiannian's Flight to the West
Zhengzhou, January 3rd (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin from this newspaper in Zhengzhou - After Li Xiannian, former commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, was redesignated as the guerrilla commander of the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi border region, where exactly did he go? It remains a mystery. Since Li Xiannian fled westward from the Guangshan-Luoshan area in southern Henan to the border region of Shaanxi and Hubei, crossing the Dan River, there has been no definitive news for half a year. Some say he was killed in action, some say he disappeared, some say he disguised himself and fled to Yan'an, and others say he is still hiding in the Qinling-Funiu Mountains. What is the truth? It remains as mysterious as ever.

Li Xiannian, leading thirty to fifty thousand troops, engaged in a westward flight that could be called a grand "Long March." His ambitions were also quite considerable; presumably, he wanted to be the ancestral master at the top of Mount Wudang, the Chu Overlord on the crest of the Qinling Mountains, and Brother Song in the Funiu Mountains. However, those places are truly barren and the people impoverished. Bringing a large force there means that even if they are not captured by the Nationalist army, they will be exhausted by the demons and monsters in those desolate mountains. To say nothing of the fact that to reach Mount Wudang, one must get on all fours and climb like a dog; to reach the top of the Qinling Mountains, one must wind around eighty or ninety spiral roads for several days; and to get into the Funiu Mountains, one must cross more than forty rivers every day for a week. This is enough to make Li Xiannian suffer. Therefore, during his westward flight, his soldiers deserted in droves, their first words being, "Give me food first, then talk." Indeed, at that time, the Nationalist army had a complete supply line, and even then, they sometimes had to rely on airplanes to drop food.

If they could struggle, they would always try to struggle. Not long after Li Xiannian crossed the Dan River, he established the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Military Region, with five military sub-regions under its command, and simultaneously established the Wudang Military Region, with four sub-regions under its command. The former was prepared to operate in the area between the Qinling and Funiu Mountains, while the latter was prepared to operate on both sides of the Laohekou-Baihe highway. To gallop among these mountains and reign supreme in this vast countryside was also a matter of pride in his disappointment. Within the twenty-nine counties of the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi border region, they probably left their footprints everywhere, but they never set foot in a single county seat.

Ambitious
The Yan'an authorities once ordered Li Xiannian to contact the "underground army" in the Shangnan-Wei area, seize the Qinling Mountains, cut off transportation between Shaanxi and Hubei, and also collude with the bandits in southern Shaanxi, while inciting the people, preparing to take Tongguan in the north and exit Lantian in the west, in order to coordinate with the Communist army in northern Shaanxi to seize the entire province. "The situation of the world is calculated from Chang'an." If this were achieved, wouldn't the situation of the world be in hand? Chang'an should not suffer disaster. During the war, the enemy tried every means to take Chang'an, but ultimately failed. Of course, it is also impossible for the Communist army to try every means to take it.

Now, the first military sub-region under the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Military Region of the Communist army, led by Wu Shi'an, and the fifth military sub-region, led by Wang Anshan, have completely collapsed, and the Wudang Military Region has only two or three people left.

But on the other hand, Li Xiannian also had some achievements. For example, his first policy after his westward flight was to incorporate bandits, which he did successfully. For example, bandit leader Wang Lie from Lantian became the commander-in-chief of the Wei, Hua, Lan, Wei, and Shang five counties, and bandit leader Gong Defang from Luonan became the commander of the second military sub-region of the Qinling Mountains. There were many other bandit leaders who became regimental or battalion commanders. His second policy was to "establish local political power." He had his plans and methods, but they were not fully realized. For example, he planned to establish a base area in the area of Lushi, Luoning, Lingbao, and Shan County, dividing it into three county-level central districts: the area west of Guandaokou was to be the Luling County, the area south of Guandaokou was to be the Luoluo County, and the Luolu County was to be established in Mutonggou. This was one of his plans. His methods included a land tax of one dou and five sheng of unhusked rice per mu per year (or three thousand yuan, or one zhang and five chi of homespun cloth, or three jin of cotton), and a reduction of 20% to 50% in business and sales taxes (but not including loans). The township offices and lower-level organizations were allowed to mediate cases, expand local autonomy, welcome outsiders to participate, and educational institutions were not to be garrisoned by troops. However, none of these things were actually implemented.

Wearing a Fox Skin
To explain the methods he promoted and his actual actions, we can look at two recent letters he wrote to people. In one case, a middle school in Xi'an sent a batch of medicines from Zhengzhou for disaster relief, but they were intercepted by Li Xiannian's troops. They left a letter saying, "We need these medicines very much, and we have nowhere to buy them, so we borrowed them. Originally, we wanted to give you some compensation, but we don't have the funds." The other letter was written to a local gentry in Luonan, saying, "We must ask you, sir, to emulate the ancients like Xu Shu, and give us more care! Please alleviate the suffering of the people, do not harm the Communist army personnel, and do not persecute the people who assist the Communist army... Otherwise, it will be difficult to guarantee the safety of your life and property." In the world, there are cases of foxes wearing tiger skins, and naturally there are also cases of tigers wearing fox skins.

A Man of the Hour
However, Li Xiannian can be considered a prominent figure in central China in recent years. After Wuhan was occupied by the enemy, Li came from Yan'an with dozens of cadres to Gouzhu, where he and Wang Laohan together established a teaching brigade with forty or fifty people and guns. Later, he did not cooperate with Zhang Xueshi. At that time, after Gao Jingting was killed, Li advocated the armed reorganization of the Hubei Communist army, forming a column called six regiments. When the New Fourth Army Incident occurred, Li seized the opportunity to be promoted to the commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, ambushing the Fourth Regiment of the Eastern Hubei Security Force, annexing the puppet army of Wang Buqing, and expanding into the 13th, 14th, and 15th Brigades. Thus, he established the military sub-region, the Security Command, and the Henan-Hubei border region administrative office. Originally, he was also the secretary-general of the Henan-Hubei border region party committee, but after Zheng Weisan was sent from Yan'an, he stepped down to become the deputy secretary-general. Regarding his background, some say he was a carpenter, and others say he was always in the Communist army. It is not necessary to concern ourselves with that, but after his westward flight this time, his whereabouts are indeed unknown. He crossed the Dan River, and it is unlikely that he was killed in action, because since then there has been no major contact between the Nationalist and Communist sides. If he had really been killed in action or disappeared, his troops might have completely disintegrated. It is more likely that he disguised himself and went to Yan'an or is hiding in the Qinling-Funiu Mountains. Now, Li's whereabouts have been located, saying that he is under the Rose Tree Village in southwestern Lushi, which shows that he has been hiding for some time. There are still rumors about him going to Yan'an, saying that he went twice, once disguised as a Nationalist army major general, and once disguised as a merchant, but these are just rumors. No matter how much Li Xiannian has the ability to be in multiple places at once and hide himself, the general trend of his westward flight is destined for his failure. The Yan'an authorities recently decided to transfer him to northern China. This is very likely, because the Yan'an authorities originally decided to establish a base area in the northeast and northwest under the cover of northern China, and after the base area was established, withdraw from northern China (including Yan'an). They have changed this to establishing base areas in the northeast and northwest, while strengthening the base areas in northern China.

A Dream of Crossing the River
Li Xiannian now probably has more than ten thousand people left, most of whom are local bandits who have been incorporated. These bandits certainly do not want to be taken away, because the capital for making trouble must still be placed between the Qinling, Funiu, and Wudang Mountains. Then he has to take some of his close troops to cross the Yellow River. There have been several attempts to cross the Yellow River, but they were driven back near the Longhai Railway. He originally wanted to send the remaining eighth regiment of the third brigade of the first column, led by Min Zijian, the troops of Wang Shicheng, and part of the sixth regiment, together with the independent regiment reorganized from the local team in Suixian County led by Huang Lin, commander of the Henan Military Region, and more than 4,000 cadres in the training team, to fly across the Yellow River. Now, we have to see how he flees again.

Prospects for Municipal Administration in Beiping
He Siyuan

Among China's famous metropolises, if Nanjing is the heart of Chinese politics and Shanghai is the nerve center of the Chinese economy, then Beiping can be said to be the soul of Chinese culture. Beiping is the city with the richest collection of Chinese old and new cultures. It possesses historical honors and characteristics, and was the capital of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It still preserves some beautiful scenery and magnificent architecture. At the same time, Beiping is also the center of educational institutions. Here, there are social celebrities and specialized scholars who diligently strive for culture and academics throughout the year. Therefore, Beiping is not only a city that the Chinese people can be proud of, but the name "Beiping" is also the most tempting term internationally. It is precisely because it possesses such great vertical and horizontal value that since I took office in this city, I have been deeply vigilant in addition to being delighted, hoping not to fail the mission given to this world-famous city and the times.

Beiping During the Occupation
Since the invasion of the enemy, this international famous city has unfortunately been in ruins for eight years. Looking at it today, although the external appearance has not suffered significant damage, the internal and intangible devastation inflicted by the enemy, even a year after victory, Beiping's vitality has still not been restored to its former state. Whether it is the economy, culture, morality, or social organization, everything has suffered great pain, and it is difficult to remedy it suddenly. During the long period of occupation, the people's living standards dropped sharply, and all production mechanisms, economic arteries, manpower, and material resources were extremely exploited and destroyed. As a result, the people are poor and their wealth exhausted, and their vitality is lost. As for the original cultural facilities and organizations, they have also been destroyed, causing the youth's morals and psychology to be miserable and passive, and from passive to hesitant and divergent, leading to depravity. In addition, the enemy and the puppets openly...[text missing]... our citizens, causing significant damage to Beiping's economy and morality. Therefore, although Beiping's appearance remains the same after the pursuit of profit, a careful examination of the reality reveals that it is suffering from a hundred diseases.

Beiping After Victory
Beiping after victory originally needed extreme recuperation and should have been quickly restored, but the greatest misfortune was that it encountered a new crisis, which had a direct and indirect impact on this famous city.

Beiping is a cultural city and does not prosper from industry and commerce. Therefore, everything needed by the citizens is supplied by other places and its surrounding villages. Now, due to traffic congestion and the presence of many obstacles in the suburbs, not only is it difficult to import the daily necessities of the citizens, but also the materials used for industry, commerce, and restoration cannot be transported in continuously. As a result, the lives of the citizens are becoming more and more difficult, industry and commerce are becoming more and more depressed, and the number of refugees from the surrounding counties entering the city is increasing, and the daily necessities of the citizens are becoming more and more expensive. It is impossible to save money and impossible to find new sources of income. Therefore, the living burden of the citizens has invisibly increased. Furthermore, due to the poor environment in the surrounding areas and the lack of pacification of bandits, the disturbance to the citizens' spirit is difficult to describe. Frankly speaking, Beiping after victory, although nominally restored, is actually suffering more in its inner spirit and material difficulties than before. Thinking of this, I feel extremely saddened.

Beiping in the Future

How Beiping in the future, that is, Beiping in the plan or in hope, will develop, is our responsibility. I have always advocated that governance should involve less talk and more action, because it is more practical to do without saying than to say without doing. However, some things must be planned before starting in order to proceed step by step and reach the goal to achieve the expected results. Otherwise, it will be like a rudderless boat or a bridleless horse, and there will be nowhere to go. Now, I will briefly discuss what I have carefully considered, in order to ask for advice from fellow compatriots who care about Beiping, and also to encourage myself.

There are two key points in the goals of the municipal administration work in Beiping: (1) to restore the old foundation (recovery), and (2) to establish a new foundation (construction), and to follow these two points to achieve the ultimate goal of building a free, democratic, and prosperous Beiping. As for the focus of the work, it can be divided into three stages: (1) from the time of receiving the city in the 34th year to the present, it can be further divided into two stages, first, receiving and organizing (emphasizing receiving), and second, organizing and constructing (both are equally important); (2) this year (the 36th year) is still a stage of organization, and will focus on construction; (3) construction goals: "freedom, democracy, and prosperity" to seek the concrete realization of the Three Principles of the People in Beiping. The principles for implementing the work: (1) to handle recovery work in accordance with central laws and regulations, taking into account local conditions, so that the people can quickly get recuperation and the country can quickly embark on the road to construction; (2) to address the various aggressive poisons that the enemy and puppets have implemented against us in politics and economics, in order to correct the citizens' psychological thoughts and bad habits in life; (3) to organize and develop the vitality and organizational power that has been suppressed by the enemy and puppets for a long time, in order to cope with the current difficulties; (4) to organize, repair, and supplement all tangible affairs that have been destroyed by the enemy and puppets; (5) to simplify administrative procedures and eliminate all bad practices; (6) to complete local autonomy; (7) to develop the local economy.

In addition to what I have announced at the Provisional Council of Beiping, I will now add a few more explanations on the key items of implementation, as follows.

(1) In terms of civil administration: In addition to organizing Baos and Jias, training autonomous personnel, and organizing people's organizations as the basic key to government, which must be carried out vigorously in accordance with laws and regulations, what is particularly important is to pay close attention to the sufferings, hidden pains, hopes, and demands of the people, and strive to achieve the point where "what the people like, we like, and what the people hate, we hate," so that the municipal administrative staff can integrate with the people and achieve the goal of unity between officials and the people.

(2) In terms of education: In addition to the necessary repairs to school buildings and equipment, adjustments to funding, and improvement of teachers' salaries, improvement of teacher quality, and improvement of curriculum, more emphasis is placed on increasing the number of national schools, increasing the number of temporary middle schools, accommodating out-of-school youth, and eliminating illiteracy. Since Beiping is a cultural city and the representative of the national cultural district, the knowledge of the citizens of Beiping should be universally improved. According to Beiping, in addition to more than ten national colleges and universities and one municipal vocational school, there are currently 63 middle schools (municipal and private combined) with 28,669 students. There are 300 primary schools with 81,296 students. However, among the 1,695,204 citizens in the city, there are currently more than 140,000 children of school age. If we compare the total number of primary school students currently in school with the number of school-age children in the city, there are still more than 40% of children who are out of school. This is a major regret for a cultural city. Therefore, I believe that increasing the number of primary and secondary schools and eliminating illiteracy are imperative. In the 36th degree plan, it is planned to increase three middle schools, one normal school, and one vocational school, and implement it according to the reported recovery plan. In addition, 15 middle school classes, two normal school classes, and seven vocational classes will be added to the original secondary schools, and the funds will be allocated by the central government, and the funds for the summer vacation youth training class will be transferred. In addition, it is planned to expand nine national schools in order to reach the minimum standard of one school per Bao.

(3) In terms of finance and economic construction: In addition to abolishing harsh taxes, organizing tax revenue, simplifying procedures, eliminating corruption, and reducing waste, it is also planned to take from the people and use it for the people under the principle of not increasing the local burden and not burdening the central government, and also use it properly, using one penny as two pennies, to organize and build municipal administration. However, in today's situation where the autonomous financial revenue and expenditure of Beiping are too far apart (for example, the autonomous revenue in September was 55,242,110,622 yuan, while the expenditure in that month was 306,646,032,610 yuan, which is roughly the same every month), there is a feeling of having no rice to cook and being stretched thin. However, we cannot give up eating because of choking, and we must strive to find a way to support ourselves. This is the self-sufficient economic construction that is currently being planned, and it is difficult to predict its success or failure, but I hope to try it with the spirit of "only ask for cultivation, do not ask for harvest." At the very least, the following points must be promoted: (1) Establish cooperative farms and wounds, and first set up four places on public land in the suburbs, using cooperative methods to achieve the purpose of improving agriculture, in order to save Beiping's extremely backward agricultural technology. (2) Handle agricultural loans and assist farmers in obtaining loans from banks as fees for purchasing agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and repairing damaged soil, opening ponds, and drawing wells, in order to help farmers restore their old business and promote their production. (3) Increase the production of eggs, milk, fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables, purchase excellent egg species, use incubators, and sell them to farmers at low prices in order to promote excellent egg species. Send personnel to inspect milk farms and dairy cows, protect excellent cattle species, and encourage the increase of dairy cattle. Use marine ponds inside and outside the city to raise young fish and protect their reproduction. Establish a pig farm to make good mating and sell them to farmers at low prices. Guide planting areas, sell seedlings at low prices, and guide planting. Set up vegetable gardens in the suburbs, improve seeds, and sell tools and insecticides at low prices. (4) Manage municipal parks and gardens, establish nurseries, encourage the public to afforestation, issue seedlings, and send personnel to guide planting. The above sections are all minimum plans, and it is expected that all will be completed within one year in order to achieve the effect of assisting farmers in increasing production.

(4) In terms of public utilities: Beiping's public utilities are all backward, and there are many that lack the conditions of a modern city. In this difficult situation where the country is poor and the local area is even poorer, it is impossible to talk about construction extravagantly, and it takes a lot of effort to maintain the status quo, but various constructions cannot be suspended due to poverty. It is planned to hire experts in the near future to design and form a company to combine Beiping's public utilities, borrow from foreign countries, or attract investment, to build a new Beiping. According to rough statistics, if it can be completed satisfactorily, the benefits will be quite large. Of course, technology and management still need to be carefully studied, but for the long-term plan, I think it is feasible.

(5) In terms of hygiene: The biggest hygiene problem in Beiping at present is the garbage that has been accumulated for eight years. According to reliable estimates, there are about 1.5 million tons. Calculated with the latest maximum cleaning force, 2,000 tons can be transported out every day, and it is expected to take two years to clean it up. However, the daily production is more than 1,800 tons, which has not been calculated. This huge monster accumulated by starlight is really a feeling of looking at the sea and sighing. But if this is not removed, there will be no hygiene in Beiping. Recently, a Cleanliness Movement Committee has been launched by the party, government, military, and civilians to clean up the garbage generated by everyone with everyone's strength, which can be set up in both emotion and reason. If this plan can be completed satisfactorily, there may be hope of cleaning up within half a year. In addition, Beiping does not have a perfect sewage system, and sewage removal is the most serious problem. It is almost impossible to solve it thoroughly with Beiping's current economic strength. This can only be solved in one fell swoop after the company for public utilities is realized.

(6) In terms of official governance: In addition to eliminating redundancy, we will try our best to eliminate the habits of meetings, rectify officialdom, cultivate new life in politics, establish a new style in politics, and expect every administrative staff of the municipal government to truly reach the level of a modern civil servant. As for all the social habits that should be improved, the municipal administrative staff must take the lead in setting an example in order to change the atmosphere of an era. In addition, the election of talented people, the elimination of turbidity, and the comprehensive examination of fame and reality, the trust of rewards and punishments will also be the central work in the future.

In addition, in the rational promotion and application of human and material resources, the maintenance of public security, the supply of food for the people, the renovation of the city appearance, the strengthening of security, and the promotion of land registration can all be carried out step by step. Finally, there is one thing that must be announced to the social people, that is, after I took office, I realized that most administrative organs suffer from having a top-heavy structure, with people concentrated at the top level, and no one responsible for basic-level politics. As a result, the central government's good laws and good policies are only circling around in official documents, and administrative personnel often think that they have achieved their mission if they can handle official documents well. In order to thoroughly correct this situation, I transferred capable personnel from various bureaus and offices to form an autonomous guidance group and used the power to go to the local level. It has now been officially established on December 15th, and it is expected that Beiping will have an ideal new atmosphere next year. At the very least, there will be someone to ask about and deal with things below. This hope does not seem difficult to achieve.

What has been described above is quite incomplete, and is not very lofty, but if these things can be fully accomplished as planned, then it can also be gratifying to the people of the country. In short, Beiping's natural conditions and social conditions have things that other cities do not have. In particular, the people of Beiping are law-abiding, honest, polite, knowledgeable, and have a clear sense of right and wrong, which is a good basis for political promotion.

The Anniversary of the Siege of Liaocheng
January 3rd (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Li Tian from this newspaper in Shandong

Liaocheng has been under siege by the Communist army for a whole year, with both hard attacks and soft sieges! Under the leadership of Commissioner Wang Jinxiang, the 40,000 soldiers and civilians in the city, in order to ensure its safety over the past year, sacrificed more than half of the best and most loyal souls and lives of the Chinese nation. The remaining ten thousand or so soldiers and civilians, due to difficulties in receiving supplies and malnutrition, are generally suffering from achromatopsia, leg swelling, abdominal distension, and rotten gums. Finally, on New Year's Day this year, after enduring a year of hardship, they had to wave goodbye with tears and reluctantly obey orders to voluntarily abandon the city under the cover of the Nationalist army!

Originally, throughout history, Liaocheng has always been a place that strategists must fight for and defend. As early as the Warring States period, when the state of Qi attacked Yan, the Yan general stubbornly defended Liaocheng, and the Qi soldiers attacked for three months, but failed to take it. During the Ming dynasty, when Wang Lun rebelled, the city was besieged for more than ninety days, but the city still stood firm. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the War of Resistance broke out, Commissioner Fan Zhuxian also used this as a base, leading hundreds of thousands of Yan-Zhao soldiers to ensure the safety of more than 30 counties in northwestern Shandong for more than a year, delaying the enemy's crossing of the river and cooperating with the Battle of Xuzhou and the battle on the periphery of Wuhan, severely damaging the enemy army. His great achievements are enough to glorify history and shine through the ages. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party claimed troops to carve out a separatist regime. Because Liaocheng not only controlled the western Shandong Plain geographically and was as closely connected to Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong, as lips and teeth support each other, but also became the eastern gateway to the Communist army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, the Communist army had to occupy Liaocheng. Retreating could ensure the safety of the eastern side of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, and advancing could plunder Jinan at any time to prepare for seizing the three provinces of Qi. Therefore, Liaocheng was a must-attack for the Communist army. Therefore, since the enemy army surrendered in August of the 34th year, Wang Jinxiang, the administrative inspector and security commander of the sixth district of Shandong, was ordered to lead all the staff of the office and security teams to just recover Liaocheng and its subordinate counties of Boping, Renping, and Dong'a, while Tangyi, Chaocheng, and Yanggu had not yet been recovered. The Communist army, under the command of Liu Bocheng, Song Renqiong, and Yang Yong, mobilized 50,000 troops and first "liberated" more than 20 counties in northwestern Shandong, such as Yucheng, Linqing, Pingyuan, Gaotang, and Guantao. After that, Liaocheng was also on the list of being liberated. Therefore, since January 2nd of last year, they have concentrated their forces to besiege Liaocheng and Boping. Boping was captured on January 5th, and Liaocheng was attacked day and night from January 2nd to 17th without any rest. Since the 14th, the Communist army's attack has been particularly fierce. More than 20 mortars were concentrated on the southeast corner and northwest corner of the city to bombard fiercely. Finally, several places on the southeast corner of the city wall were bombed down by concentrated artillery fire. The Communist army's commando team then stepped on the ice and climbed the city, and a commando team surged up the collapsed city wall. When Commissioner Wang received this phone call in the headquarters, he immediately ordered that in addition to one adjutant, all officers and soldiers, as well as cooks and residents, with guns taking guns and without guns taking knives, all reinforced the southeast corner of the city. Finally, with the concerted efforts of the soldiers and civilians throughout the city, the Communist army that climbed the city wall fell into the moat batch after batch! The city wall was also repaired under the desperate blocking battle of the officers, soldiers, and civilians throughout the city!

Blood-Stained Moat - River Ice All Red
The Communist army repeatedly failed to capture the city. At this time, it was the fourth day after the ceasefire order took effect (January 17th). The Communist army finally temporarily stopped the attack, and the casualties on both sides in this battle were at least more than 10,000, with blood covering the moat and the river ice turning red.

In addition to the original 20,000 soldiers and civilians in the city of Liaocheng, there were also more than 10,000 gentry who had fled to the city from various counties in western Shandong because they could not bear the "liquidation" and "struggle," and most of them were tenant farmers and tenant farmers. There were also 4,000 to 5,000 public servants and their children and students from the Lusi Sixth and Fourth Commissioners' Offices and their subordinate counties. Naturally, Commissioner Wang's entire family was also in the city. They realized that if the city was not defended, they would all be liquidated and struggled. Instead of being liquidated and dying, it was better to die with the city. In addition, the leader Commissioner Wang graduated from the eighth term of Baoding Military Academy and had 30 years of military experience. He had been promoted to brigadier general for his merits and was known for his experience in leading troops and protecting the people. Therefore, the soldiers and civilians in the city were happy to obey orders and follow him in resisting. After the Communist army failed to capture the city, they changed to soft siege tactics, stationing troops in the towns and villages around the city to completely cut off traffic inside and outside the city, so that materials from outside the city could not be transported in. Under this kind of blockade, the soldiers and civilians in the city suffered a fate far more cruel than attacking the city.

The first serious problem that arose was food. The only passive solution was for the special office to implement control and make overall plans, but due to the lack of active and large-scale external supply, at the most difficult time, each soldier and civilian in the city was only supplied with four liang of moldy and rotten grain per day to fill their stomachs, and grass roots and tree bark had long been eaten up. Continuing down, fuel and clothing became a big problem. The wood of many houses was taken out to burn as firewood! Many clothes and quilts were also broken and unable to keep warm! As a result, diseases such as achromatopsia, abdominal distension, leg swelling, rotten gums, malaria, and typhoid fever occurred due to the imbalance of heat and cold and malnutrition. Due to the lack of medicine, death closely followed the disease! Watching thirty, fifty, or even more than a hundred people silently fall down every day!

The executive group of the military headquarters went to the city to tour last spring to mediate the siege of Liaocheng, regardless of the dangers. Driven by the sympathy of human beings, after witnessing this extremely tragic siege of the people, they decided to add eight trucks loaded with 1,000 bags of flour, 20 boxes of milk, and condolence materials from the provincial government to the second trip to relieve the suffering. However, when the car arrived in the suburbs of the east gate of Liaocheng on May 3, all the relief materials became the spoils of the Communist army, and the group members, except for the Communist representative, also became prisoners of the Communist army and were "treated favorably" in the Communist army's "detention room" for two days before being released back to Jinan.

The soldiers and civilians of Liaocheng spent seven months in such difficult conditions. By August of last year, the Communist army took advantage of the soaring river water and breached the dikes of the Zhe River outside the east gate and the Majia River outside the west gate in an attempt to flood the entire city, so that the soldiers and civilians in the city would be buried in the belly of the fish. Fortunately, God saw pity, and when the water level was level with the root of the city, the river water just reached a balanced state. Not only did the entire city not suffer land subsidence, but the moat outside the city was widened to two li, becoming the most favorable natural defense line of the joint city.

December! In this cold season, the moat outside Liaocheng was dry and frozen due to the cold weather, and even cars could come and go! This again gave the Communist army the most rare opportunity of the year. Therefore, after half a month of preparation, starting at 7 pm on December 20th, the Communist army concentrated more than 10,000 elite troops, more than 10 mortars, and one field artillery piece to attack the city again. The 10,000 soldiers and civilians in the city were awakened by the sound of artillery fire in a dying state. A kind of instinct for survival and the concept of protecting the country and defending the city once again awakened their vitality. He/She still guarded the original post and supported it for the most difficult eleven days. On the first day of this year, the elite troops sent by Commander Wang Yaowu attacked the edge of the city, and then he/she safely withdrew from Liaocheng. Arriving at Renping that night, it is estimated that it will arrive in Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. In total, from January 2nd of last year to the breakout on this year, Liaocheng was besieged for exactly a full year.

Liaocheng was abandoned! The fellow villagers of Liaocheng, who are traveling to Ji, collectively petitioned Commander Wang Yaowu on the 2nd, requesting to organize an armed homecoming group to fight back to their hometown. These affectionate and sensitive people who had survived the disaster, upon hearing Commander Wang describe how the Communist army "liberated" the place where their ancestors' graves were located, and that in order to rescue the more than 10,000 orphans in the city, they had to reluctantly abandon the city walls and withdraw from the city, all the petitioning villagers could not help but burst into tears!

Free Talk - The Profession of the Awkward Person in Shanghai - Parasites of the Metropolis
Jianhua

There is now a kind of awkward person in Shanghai. They are neither robbers nor thieves. They are unwilling to be hooligans who hold thighs, and they are unwilling to be beggars who snatch cold rice. To catch them, they are called "incubating stone eggs," also known as "mixing tea and rice," because their lives are to get by one day at a time, and one year at a time. Some get rich, and some are like Wang Xiaoer over the New Year, getting worse every year. The titles of their professions include "Swallow's Nest Runner," "Salted Meat Partner," "Model Broker," and so on.

In the Swallow's Nest
The harm of opium is well known, but old addicts who are addicted to it still puff away, digging their own graves. Therefore, those who ban ban, those who smoke smoke, and the stricter the ban, the more ingenious the tricks of drug trafficking. At present, the number of illegal opium dens in Shanghai is probably more than four digits. However, the location of the opium dens is very secret, and it is not easy for non-guests to find them. In addition to regular customers, they also want to recruit new patrons, so they hire this kind of awkward person to be the runner for

### Standardization of British and American Military Equipment; Montgomery to Explain to the Soviets; Soviet Union Can Participate in Any Agreement Reached by Britain and the United States; Warm Reception and Harmonious Atmosphere

[United Press, New York, 10th] British Chief of the General Staff Montgomery, whose name is often associated with artillery and less so with diplomacy, has now become Britain's newest envoy. According to a report from Moscow, Montgomery will explain and reassure the Soviet Union regarding the standardization of British and American military equipment. This visit is the most important representation of British individuals to the Soviet Union in recent times, with an immense mission. The Soviet Union is quite uneasy about the standardization of British and American military equipment and has asked: "Besides the Soviet Union, what other country has such vast power that it requires Britain and the United States to jointly resist?" The United States views it as merely a normal application of the lessons learned in 1939, while the Soviet Union wants to see the underlying motive. In 1939, American industry began to specially manufacture weapons for Britain and France, and subsequently, various arms factories had to change their plans and adopt American-style equipment. The Soviet Union also knows that the unification of military equipment is related to the United States' desire to establish military bases in northern Canada. This matter has not been agreed upon because some Canadians believe that this plan will strengthen the combination of Canada and the United States while weakening the connection with Britain. However, if the entire plan includes Britain, then Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King will more easily persuade his countrymen. The Soviet Union is somewhat uneasy about the United States' plan to establish defenses in Canada. The mission of Montgomery's trip is clearly to inform the Moscow government of the following: First, there is no need to panic. Second, the standardization of military equipment between the two countries is quite reasonable from the perspective of Britain and the United States, given that the world is not yet stable. Third, the Soviet Union can participate in any transaction reached by Britain and the United States, and the door is not closed. Fourth, the military preparations of Britain and the United States are the same as the Soviet Union's intention to form a defensive ring around its weaker neighbors.

[United Press, Moscow, 9th] On the evening of the 9th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky hosted Montgomery at the British Embassy. Montgomery said in his speech: "Although the Allied countries conflict in the United Nations and at peace conferences, the Allied countries are still good friends." Vyshinsky replied, "He feels that open debate among countries to discuss differing views is a big step towards the path of progress. Although there have been frequent disputes in the United Nations General Assembly and peace conferences, good friendship still exists among the Allied countries."

### Security Council Discusses Disarmament Issue; Verbal Battle Between the US and the USSR; Jones Insists on Prioritizing Discussion of Atomic Issue; Australia Proposes Compromise to Reconcile US-Soviet Opinions

[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today launched a full debate on the issue of disarmament. Soviet representative Gromyko accused the United States of attempting to delay the implementation of a universal disarmament plan, saying that the United States' insistence on prioritizing discussion of atomic energy control implied, "If you agree with the United States' atomic control plan, then we will agree to draft the implementation steps for a universal disarmament plan. Conversely, if the United States' atomic plan cannot proceed smoothly, then we will reject the drafting of any disarmament implementation steps." At the beginning of the debate, Australian representative Makin warned that "this is not the time for disputes" and then proposed a compromise in the hope of reconciling US-Soviet disputes.

According to Makin's compromise, the Security Council should accept the disarmament plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly and then take three practical steps: (1) In accordance with the Soviet proposal, establish a committee to immediately discuss steps to implement the General Assembly resolution and establish international control to ensure the reduction of troops and armaments. (2) Accept the report of the Atomic Energy Commission as a blueprint for continued discussion and accelerate the establishment of an international atomic control convention. (3) The issue of the United Nations peacekeeping force should be immediately submitted to the Military Staff Committee for discussion, paying attention to the General Assembly's resolution on all member governments providing reports on military strength.

[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] After Soviet representative Gromyko accused the United States in the Security Council of obstructing the discussion of the disarmament issue, US representative Johnson immediately refuted and insisted that the issue of atomic control should be prioritized. It was stated: "Effective international control of atomic energy is the key to the entire plan and must be discussed first. If atomic energy is not controlled first, then the control of other armaments will be difficult to achieve. From our point of view, controlling atomic energy is a test case. We believe that the Security Council should guarantee significant progress in the area of atomic issues before discussing the control and reduction of traditional armaments, which is therefore a secondary issue." Jones denied that the United States intended to delay and said that the United States was prepared to agree to the arms adjustment plan, but on the condition that the atomic issue be prioritized for discussion.

### Before Security is Guaranteed, the US Must Maintain Strong Military Strength

[Our Report] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal delivered a speech today to the World Affairs Council, stating that before the United Nations can effectively carry out its mission, the United States will maintain a strong military and that the United States will use its full strength to act as the backbone of the United Nations.

### New Fishing Method: No Hooks, Bait, or Nets; Using Sound Waves to Lure Fish into Shells

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Japanese fishermen will soon use a new fishing method that does not require nets. Recently, Dr. Taguchi and others invented a sound generator, which will change traditional fishing methods, making hooks, bait, and nets obsolete. The method involves installing a machine on fishing boats to emit strange noises, driving the fish towards the shore. Then, another machine is used to emit beautiful music, luring the fish and making them easy to catch in their confusion. According to Dr. Taguchi, we already know that fish have special reactions to certain sounds, and the latest technology is simply a scientific application of this knowledge. Some sounds are liked by fish, while others are not. Americans have used sound to find where herring live. Now, Japan will be the first to use sound waves to catch fish.

### Forcibly Occupying District Offices; Humiliating and Beating Senators; Illegal Atrocities by Soldiers; General Assembly Unanimously Indignant; Resolution on Three Cases Demanding Strict Handling

[Our Report] The City Senate held its fourth meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss four important temporary motions: (1) Personnel of the Garrison Headquarters insulted District Chief and Senator Hou Junren of the 12th District and forcibly occupied the residence of Senator Lu Huimin. (2) Slow operation of the French-owned tramway. (3) Slum shantytowns. (4) Telegram to the entire country supporting the Constitution. All four cases were discussed and passed by the General Assembly. During the meeting, the directors of the Finance, Land Administration, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus responded to the inquiries from the third meeting. At the same time, six civil affairs proposals were discussed. Senator Li Wenjie reported on the 35th-year budget revision, which was passed by the General Assembly and will be formally notified to the city government.

[Further Report] Regarding the three temporary motions proposed by City Senator Jiang Huaisu and dozens of others in the General Assembly yesterday, all of which were related to the incident in the morning when Inspector Zhang Yamin of the Garrison Headquarters forcibly occupied the District Office at No. 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinza Road, District Chief and Senator Hou Junren reported the details to the General Assembly. It was stated that No. 12 Zhonghua Village was the property of the traitor Zhou Bangjun, which they were in charge of managing. Inspector Zhang Yamin of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters and his family also lived in the same house. In the morning, Senators Lu and Hou were both attending the Small Review Committee of the City Senate when they returned home and saw that Zhang had led a dozen armed personnel and thrown all the furniture and documents from Lu's residence and the District Office out into the street. When Lu negotiated with him, Zhang actually said, "I'll beat you to death." District Chief Hou was also beaten and nearly tied up. Later, the district police station was notified and the mayor was asked to intervene. After the mayor issued a handwritten order, they were persuaded and mediated, and allowed to move the items back. Speaker Pan and all senators expressed that military and police personnel were acting so recklessly, openly infringing on local autonomous institutions, and insulting the District Chief of the District Office and City Senators, then the unlawful maltreatment of ordinary citizens who have no one to turn to can be imagined. If citizens cannot live and work in peace, how can it be called a "city"? Strict measures must be taken to stop this. The General Assembly resolved three points to be handed over to the responsible authorities for investigation: (1) Request the municipal government to notify all military, police, and security agencies in the city to strictly prohibit the atrocities of soldiers. (2) The Senate will send a letter to the Garrison Headquarters requesting that these unlawful soldiers be strictly investigated and punished. (3) The Senate expresses its deep indignation at the insult suffered by Senator Hou Junren and Senator Lu Huimin at the hands of unlawful soldiers, and the responsible authorities should express their apologies to the Senate in writing.

### Increase Electricity and Phones; Solutions Will Be Available This Year; Decision to Relax Electricity Usage Limits Starting Next Month; Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Answers Inquiries

[Our Report] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue gave oral answers to the inquiries from the senators at the General Assembly yesterday: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau's management policy for foreign companies is to respect contracts, enforce laws, improve management, and increase efficiency. Foreign and Chinese companies are treated equally. All foreign companies have good cooperation. (2) The restriction on electricity usage for lights had originally been decided to be cancelled from February 1st, removing the 70% discount and the minimum 20-unit limit. The actual electricity consumption in November of the previous year will be used as the standard, but it must not be exceeded, and those consuming less than 30 units will be allowed to use up to 30 units. The penalty will also be changed to a warning system, with electricity being cut off after three warnings. When electricity increases slightly in the near future, it will be further relaxed to outdoor neon lights, which was also decided in consultation yesterday to be opened from April 1st. (3) The frequent power outages in the Nanshi district are due to a malfunction in one of the power company's generators. (4) The crackdown on rickshaws is being carried out under central government orders. The rickshaws that have been drawn and eliminated have been converted into three-wheeled vehicles, still driven by the original rickshaw pullers, so the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers is not a problem. (5) The number of buses has been increased to more than 120. The number of trams has also increased from 332 to 386. (6) The Shanghai Telephone Company has ordered 10,000 new lines from France, and one unit will arrive in Shanghai in mid-February. (7) The problem of slow connections with the "02" telephone line will be addressed by ordering the Shanghai Telephone Company to pay attention to improvements. (8) The installation of streetlights will be completed before January of this year. (9) The issue of adjusting the tram routes involves demolishing houses to widen the roads and requisitioning land, which is being referred to the central government for instructions. (10) The number of vehicles in the city has increased by 14,861 three-wheeled vehicles compared to before the war, which did not exist before the war. The biggest reason for the city's traffic congestion is the concentration of vehicles in the central district after the city was unified. As for the zonal traffic management method, it has been submitted by the mayor to the General Assembly for discussion. (11) The restriction on three-wheeled vehicles and other vehicles passing through the Garbage Bridge was originally a temporary measure to solve traffic congestion. They can still pass before 8:00 AM and after 6:00 PM. After the Public Works Bureau repairs the Wenzaobang Bridge within a month, it will be opened. (12) The problem of the 160 yuan change for ferry tickets at the Dongchang Road Wharf has been changed to 200 yuan from December 11th, while the long-distance fares have been reduced. As for the attitude of the staff, the ferry company will be ordered to correct it, and citizens are encouraged to report any issues. (13) The issue of connecting electricity to shantytowns before obtaining a construction permit is that in principle, builders should obtain a construction permit before starting construction, and the installation of electric lights in new buildings should be carried out at the same time as the construction project. This bureau has no restrictions.

Central Work This Year

[Our Report] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue said in the Senate yesterday that the central tasks of the Public Utilities Bureau this year are: (1) To increase electric power by more than 50,000 kilowatts. This bureau will do its best to increase it to meet the needs of the citizens. (2) To enrich other public utilities, such as the city's telephones, which have a five-year expansion plan to add 10,000 numbers. The water supply problem in the West Shanghai is also being solved, and the British gas company needs it. (3) To organize the wharf warehouses. Recently, it is planned to establish Nanshi Wharves Nos. 1 to 9 to restore the pre-war state. (4) To strengthen public transportation, it is planned to add 120 buses to the routes opened and operated by the former British-owned Public Bus Company in ten years, which this bureau is determined to complete this year.

### Petitions Abound; Stall Vendors Demand Full-Day Opening; Students Request Preservation of Drama School

[Our Report] Nearly a hundred stall vendors from the Huangpu and Laoza districts again petitioned the City Senate yesterday, claiming that they are still being arrested by the police for setting up stalls in designated areas, with fines of 5,000 yuan each time, even several times a day. The General Assembly then dispatched Senators Tang Shichang and Zhu Yakui to meet with them. The stall vendors put forward two requests: (1) The authorities designated July 20th for setting up stalls, but after the stall vendor incident, they were only allowed to set up stalls from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM, but business is slow during this time, so they are requesting a full-day opening. (2) They are requesting that the Social Affairs Bureau be asked to approve the organization of a fellowship association for stall vendors in the Huangpu and Laoza districts. Senators Tang and Zhu promised to convey this intention to the municipal authorities. According to Mayor Wu, a method for dealing with the establishment of stalls has been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. Once the results are available, the entire stall vendor problem in the city will be solved, not just the Huangpu and Laoza districts.

Also, students from the Municipal Experimental Drama School lined up to petition the City Senate yesterday, stating their reasons for requesting the preservation of the Drama School. Senators Tong Xingbai and Zhou Feicheng met with them, stating that they had no right to decide and promising to submit the matter to the General Assembly for discussion. In addition, those who came to the meeting to petition included the Shanghai Business Association and male and female workers from the Wing On Textile Factory.

(3) The reason why the business tax has not been accelerated for collection is that most of it is stall vendors. To take care of the livelihood of the small vendors, it has been specially postponed until after the end of the lunar year before it is collected. (4) The reason why it is not easy for suburban schools to receive funds is because there are only three people handling the distribution of funds. The schools have been accumulating payments for a long time, so they are too busy at once, and the order is difficult to maintain. At the same time, according to central government regulations, the procedures for withdrawing funds are too complicated, which delays a lot of time. As for the attitude of the staff, it will be strictly reprimanded and improved. (5) The deadline for municipal construction donations and fines is three weeks after delivery. If fines are paid before the deadline, they should be refunded, such as the amount wrongly fined to Senator Tang Shichang, which has been refunded after investigation. (6) It has recently been discovered that there are cases of people posing as the Finance Bureau to sell business tax laws and housing donation receipts to the outside world. Investigations have been carried out, but there have been no results. However, the Finance Bureau never sends personnel to sell any items, and the collection of funds is also handled by the accounting department, so if such incidents are discovered, please report them immediately. (7) More than 6 billion yuan was received for municipal construction donations last year, but it did not exceed the budget, because other departments collected less than expected.

According to Director Gu, the city's public bonds currently include (1) two types of old municipal government bonds, which have been ordered to be registered with the four banks and await disposal. The principal and interest due at the end of the 35th year are more than 36 million yuan, which will be allocated from this year's budget using tax revenue as collateral. (2) Six types of former International Settlement bonds, with principal and interest due in the 35th year of more than 14 million yuan, have been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Public Settlement and French Concession Official Assets and Obligations Debt Clearing Committee for handling. (3) Eleven types of former French Municipal Council bonds are also being actively cleared.

### Two Air Force Personnel Sent to the US for Internship to Return After Completing Studies

### Shantytowns Neither Built Nor Demolished; Tunnel Planned to be Built Across the Huangpu River; Director of the Public Works Bureau Answers Inquiries

[Our Report] Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang answered the oral inquiries of the senators the other day: (1) The shantytown problem is a whole social and economic problem. The Public Works Bureau must consider three issues: the housing of civilians, public safety, and whether there is any conflict with the land rights of the owners. From beginning to end, the Public Works Bureau has no strict crackdown measures, and the crackdown is not necessarily demolition. Currently, in the prohibited construction zone, the principle of "neither build nor demolish" is adopted, that is, those that already exist will not be demolished, but new ones are not allowed to be built. So far, a total of seven ongoing shantytowns have been cracked down on, and the homeowners have all been able to listen to the advice. It is hoped that the City Senate can entrust the shantytown problem to the municipal government for handling, and give instructions at any time. The municipal government will definitely take care of all parties and give everyone a satisfactory answer. (2) According to accurate investigations, there are a total of 8,327 households in shantytowns in the prohibited construction zone, and 63,762 households in the non-prohibited zone, totaling 72,089 households, of which only 3,053 have obtained licenses from the Public Works Bureau. (3) Regarding the dredging of river channels, the engineering technology is the responsibility of the Public Works Bureau, and the planning and recruitment of workers is the responsibility of the district offices. Among the first-class trunk rivers, the Huangpu River is the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, and the Suzhou Creek is subsidized by the Public Works Bureau for part of the expenses. The Wenzaobang has already been surveyed and does not need to be dredged this year. In addition, there are more than ten second-class rivers, and seven or eight of them will be dredged this year. (4) For the Huangpu River Bridge, the technical research cannot be handled by the personnel of the Public Works Bureau, so it has been handed over to the China Bridge Company for design, and it is proposed that: a low-level movable bridge would cost 46 billion, a tunnel would cost 79 billion, and a high-level fixed bridge across Shanghai would not be suitable. After research, although the engineering cost of the tunnel is greater than that of the low-level movable bridge, it is the best in all respects. The review has been submitted to the Huangpu River Crossing Project Committee for discussion. The location, capacity, and cost of the wharf need to be planned and researched. (5) In the past year, more than 1 million square meters of road projects have been repaired. Due to poor materials and too many vehicles passing by, at least 200,000 square meters have been damaged and repaired again. There are currently more than 2 million square meters that have not been repaired. The reason for only repairing the middle of the road and not the sides is due to materials and funding, because the middle of the road must bear the weight of large trucks, while the sides only have rickshaws. (6) The project to remove the obstacles left by the enemy and puppet regime in a part of the Nanshi area is still under negotiation because it has not been approved by the local military authorities.

### Wrongly Fined Construction Donations Should Be Refunded; Director of the Finance Bureau Answers Inquiries

[Our Report] Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan said at the General Assembly yesterday in response to inquiries: (1) Regarding the investigation of grain registers, start by registering grain households so that all land in the old tax register can be found with the real household name, mu points, and address. However, paying grain cannot be recognized as the owner. If they are the owner, they must still go to the Land Administration Bureau to register. (2) Public property consolidation: the city government's public property is managed separately by various bureaus and offices and has not yet been fully collected. The rental income from city-owned houses in December was more than 188 million yuan. There are currently 22 municipal vegetable markets, with a collection of more than 8.87 million yuan.
