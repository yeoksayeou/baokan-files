### Communist Forces in Southern Shandong Decimated; National Army Clamps Down on Linyi from Two Directions; Pacification Work Begins in Tancheng

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Chairman Chiang flew to Xuzhou on the morning of the 2nd at 10:00 am aboard the Meiling special plane. Only Chen Cheng and Xue Yue greeted him at the Xuzhou airport. The Chairman had lunch in Xuzhou and met with Chen and Sa. He returned to the capital at 2:30 pm, with Chen Cheng returning to Nanjing on the same plane.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] (1) The main forces of the Communist army in southern Shandong are showing a tendency to flee towards the mountains, and Linyi is in a state of panic. (2) The National Army stationed in Tancheng is currently restoring local order and carrying out pacification work in the surrounding villages. (3) The three columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui were seen fleeing towards the territory of Luyi and Boxian on the 2nd.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] After the National Army captured Tancheng and pressed on Linyi, the Communist 9th Division had been dispatched from Mengyin, 54 miles northwest of Linyi, to reinforce the Communist forces defending Linyi. At the same time, the National Army under Wang Yaowu is also moving south from Jinan to attack Linyi from both sides.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist army in southern Shandong is nearing the end of its rope, becoming increasingly restless. Due to the previous fighting on the Heli branch line, where they suffered as many as 50,000 casualties, and the defection of Hao Pengju and his troops for dual reasons, their military and political control has completely collapsed. The main force of the Communist army in the area north of Lincheng has been rapidly advancing east towards Taierzhuang day and night, indicating their intention to concentrate their main force to defend and attack the area. The Communist army's illusion of pincering Xuzhou has now become a pipe dream.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army is currently advancing northward, stationing in Tiefo Temple, Shibu and other places on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong on the 1st. There are no longer any Communist disturbances in Pi County.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The war situation in southern Shandong took a sudden turn for the worse.

In addition, the National Army advancing north from Pi County entered Changcheng Town in Luxu today, while another National Army unit is approaching Lanling Town.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] There are no major battles in Jiaodong and northern Shandong today. The Jiaoji Railway was not damaged by the Communist army last night, creating a peaceful situation not seen since the Spring Festival. The focus of the war is still in southern Shandong. Qualified observers believe that it should be absolutely no problem for the National Army to occupy Linyi, the highest command post of the Shandong Communist forces, ten days ago.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 2nd] Communist forces were discovered on the outskirts of Shangqiu, attempting to besiege Shangqiu. The Longhai Railway was damaged, and trains from Xuzhou to Bian only reached Shangqiu. Fighting occurred near Minquan.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 1st] Han Dedong, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, flew from Xuzhou to Haizhou by special plane yesterday afternoon to oversee the local pacification work.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist forces in various parts of Shandong are actively taking action, and a full-scale war is about to break out. Approximately 20,000 Communist troops from the wings of Qihe County are gathering more than ten miles west of the city, threatening to attack Qihe. In addition, the "Eleventh" and "Twelfth" Divisions of the Bohai Military Region of the Communist army have arrived north of Ancheng, preparing to attack Ancheng, and the National Army is strictly guarding against them. Xiong Jiming, the commissioner of the district, was injured while breaking through from Weizhai, and his whereabouts were still unknown as of the 2nd.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 1st] After Li Yingxiang's troops broke through from Weizhai and retreated to Daweijiazhuang, the Communist army followed up with a fierce attack at midnight on the morning of the 1st. Li's troops counterattacked, retreating and advancing three times, and finally repelled the Communist army in February. However, Sanguancheng nearby, which was guarded by the Pingyin County Security Team, was captured by the Communist army. The above all occurred within Qihe County. Qihe and Zhencheng are firmly defended by the National Army and are safe, but the outskirts of Jinan are tense.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] Large buildings inside Tai'an City have been widely damaged by the Communist army. Piles of firewood have been stacked in various places in Dai Temple, and the fate of this ancient site with thousands of years of history is uncertain.

### Fighting South of Baoding; Cannon Fire Shakes the City Walls

The Communist Forces Attacking Xushui Have Been Repelled

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist forces that fiercely attacked Xushui on the 1st failed to achieve their goal and retreated at 6:00 pm.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the 8th Army Group, arrived in Pulandian on the afternoon of the 31st for inspection. The residents of the area, who have valued Han official ceremonies for 52 years, were quite excited. Since Pulandian was ceded after the Sino-Japanese War, Liao is the highest-ranking official to have personally visited this place after its recovery by the National Army. In other news, part of an independent division of the Communist army is currently constructing strong fortifications along the east-west line of Xingshukou, south of Pulandian.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] There are still constant clashes between the National and Communist armies on the Pulandian front lines. Near Taishan, 20 li southeast of Pulandian, the Communist army fired mountain guns at the National Army positions on the evening of the 31st.

### Traffic Restored Between Beiping and Tianjin; Shangguan Yunxiang Arrives in Tianjin from Tangshan; Chen Jicheng Goes to Inspect the Beining Line

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] After the Pingjin Railway was damaged again, traffic was restored on the 2nd, but the Communist threat remains to be eliminated. Shangguan Yunxiang came to Tianjin from Tangshan at noon on the 2nd and has made some deployments for future military measures. After mines were quickly discovered on the Jinyu section for two consecutive days, the transmission line from Tangshan to Tianjin was also damaged by 200 meters before dawn on the 2nd, resulting in a loss of 4,000 kilowatts of power to Tianjin.

### Situation in Taiyuan Increasingly Tense; Communist Forces Discovered in Fenhe and Mengxian Areas; Yan Xishan Has Returned to Taiyuan to Personally Oversee Operations

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The situation in Taiyuan is becoming increasingly tense. Yan Xishan returned to Taiyuan on the evening of the 29th to arrange defenses. It is reported that the "Twelfth," "Fifteenth," and "Thirtieth" regiments of the Communist army had moved from Taigu to villages near Liushigou, which belongs to Taiyuan, on the 30th. It is also reported that the Communist army in northern Shanxi is gradually moving south, attempting to attack the central Shanxi area. More than 10,000 troops under He Long have also been discovered west of the Fen River in Taiyuan, and a large force of Communist troops has also been discovered in the Mengxian area. Therefore, Yan Xishan hurriedly returned to Taiyuan to personally oversee operations. Since the Communist army gathered nine brigades in Fenxiao on the 16th of last month, Yan went to Pingyao on the 18th to supervise the troops. By the time he reached Xiaoyi, it had already fallen, and one force had moved to the Pingyao Jiexiu area, while another moved to Fenyang Wenshui. Yan immediately ordered Sun and Zhao's troops to block and attack in separate routes, inflicting considerable casualties on the Communist army.

### US Generals Hold Meeting; Discussing Procedures for US Military Withdrawal; Admiral Cooke and Minister All Attend

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] US Army General Cooke, stationed in Qinghai, flew to Nanjing from Qinghai at 9:00 am on the 2nd. After disembarking, he went to the US Embassy, and the Minister summoned senior officials of the embassy and senior US Army and Navy generals in Nanjing to hold an important meeting to discuss the procedures and technical issues for the US military withdrawal from China. He left Nanjing by the same plane at approximately 3:00 pm to return to Qinghai.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 2nd] The families of nine US military officers from the Beiping Executive Headquarters were en route to Beiping aboard the transport ship "General Weigle." At the same time, the US Embassy in Nanjing happened to announce the withdrawal of US military personnel from the Executive Headquarters. The ship was thus moored in Tanggu Bay, awaiting instructions from Washington. The families remained on board. There is currently no definite date for the withdrawal of US military personnel from Beiping. It is reported that during the withdrawal period, the US Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force will be responsible for patrolling the Pingjin line.

### Withdrawal of US Forces from North China; Announcement Possible Within Two Days

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] A United Press reporter learned today that the date for the withdrawal of US forces from North China may be announced within 48 hours. However, Communist guerrillas appear in the Pingjin Railway and highway, cutting off traffic. How to evacuate the 2,000 US personnel of the Executive Headquarters, including women and children, is quite complicated. In addition, the US military transport ship General Weigle, carrying the families of nine officers, twenty-one people, and one hundred and twenty-one soldiers, sailed to Tanggu. Originally, it was intended to ignore the US decision to withdraw from the Executive Headquarters and transport them to Beiping by plane, but this idea has now been abandoned, and the reason has not been explained. These officers' families do not intend to land in Tanggu.

### Communist Personnel of the Executive Headquarters

Likely to Begin Withdrawal on the 5th

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The government side of the Executive Headquarters may end as early as next month, and Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi will be transferred to the position of military attaché at the US Embassy.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] General Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the government side of the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to host a banquet at the Beijing Hotel on the afternoon of the 5th on behalf of government member General Zheng Jiemin to bid farewell to the Communist personnel of the department who are about to withdraw from Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] According to a person in charge of the government side of the Executive Headquarters, government personnel will withdraw from Beiping before the Communist and American personnel, and will await assignment. In addition, the Communist personnel have been busy packing for days and originally planned to start withdrawing on the 3rd. Due to flight availability, the departure will be delayed for two or three days.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] Du Yuming told reporters that the Communist personnel of the Changchun Executive Subcommittee who wish to go to Beiping or Harbin will be sent back by our side. As for the future of the Northeast, we will still act in accordance with the government's orders, and we will never attack first. External speculations that a major war is about to break out are premature. Du said: We are determined to do our best to protect traffic safety and are determined to thoroughly reorganize traffic order in Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Shanhaiguan. Deputy Commander Ma Zhanshan will come to Shenyang in the next few days, and the troops under his command will come together.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist personnel of the Executive Headquarters may begin their withdrawal on the 5th. The Communist Party submitted a note to the US side on the 1st regarding the withdrawal, and the Communist Party has not yet responded. Wang Liangke, previously sent by the Communist Party to Changchun to investigate the radio station incident, returned to Beiping this afternoon. It is reported that the Changchun Communist radio station has indeed been returned by the government, and the personnel there are also preparing to withdraw. According to the Communist Party, as of today, Yan'an has not sent any instructions to Beiping regarding the transfer of Communist personnel from the Executive Headquarters, and no clear orders have been issued. The Communist Party seems to be taking a cautious and uninterested attitude towards the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters. A certain Communist Party official told reporters: Although the US personnel have been ordered to withdraw, neither the Nationalists nor the Communists have ordered the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters, so its dissolution today seems illegal. He believes that the Executive Headquarters should be formally terminated in another way.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Regarding the proposal submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party to the government as rumored in Shanghai, the reporter inquired about Jiang Yuntian's proposal for even land distribution as its content. It is said that the Democratic Socialist Party's proposal was only a verbal opinion and not a concrete document. The Democratic Socialist Party hopes that the government will have a concrete opinion after the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and then the effective methods of the Democratic Socialist Party can also be put forward to help solve the current situation.

### Opinions of the China Youth Party

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng, a spokesman for the China Youth Party, said recently: "If the government does not clarify its attitude, this party does not intend to participate in the reorganization of the government. This party's line of action is that national concepts are more important than political concepts. The future Premier of the Executive Yuan should be trusted by the President of the Republic, enjoy international prestige, be supported by all parties, and be a financial expert. The reorganization of the government, the reorganization of the National Government Committee, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, and the reorganization of local governments should be carried out simultaneously, and the Communist seats in the National Government Committee should be reserved throughout."

### Wu Tiecheng Returns to the Capital

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Wu Tiecheng returned to the capital from Shanghai at 7:00 pm on the 2nd.

[Our Report] Mr. Zhang Junmai is scheduled to publish eighteen essays in the short term as the basis for the "Party Doctrine" of the Democratic Socialist Party. He also plans to give public lectures in important cities in various provinces within this year, and only plans to go to the provincial capitals of the border provinces. As for the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, due to too many restrictions, he does not intend to go.

### Executive Yuan Commends Martyrs

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Executive Yuan, recognizing that Wang Yichong, the Kunshan County Library Director, and Lu Jian'an, a local gentleman, preserved documents and devoted themselves to education, both died of overwork. In addition, Deng Shaoyun, the County Magistrate of Hengshan in Xiang, died heroically defending the city during the enemy's attack on Hengshan. Yesterday, they were specially commended by the Executive Yuan.

### Gold Imported into Hong Kong Reached 90,000 Taels Last Year

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd] According to statistics from the Hong Kong government customs, 90,000 taels of gold were imported into Hong Kong last year, worth (201,976,11) yuan, including gold bars (5,752,000) yuan and ink gold (14,445,611) yuan. Exports included (19,305,000) yuan to Macao and (4,243,700) yuan to North China. Last year, the Hong Kong government approved the import of 120,000 taels of gold, but only 90,000 taels were shipped to Hong Kong. The remaining 30,000 taels arrived in January of this year. The Hong Kong financial authorities believe that the influx of gold is sufficient to supply demand, and since the end of last year, they have stopped issuing gold import licenses. Gold merchants have instead applied for import licenses from Macao, requesting the Hong Kong government to allow them to transport gold through Hong Kong to Macao, with a requested amount of 500,000 taels, but only 250,000 taels were approved.

### Democratic Socialist Party Hopes the Government Will Propose Solutions to Problems Such as Government Reorganization

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Before the Chinese New Year's Eve, Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party returned to his hometown in Anhui for the New Year. Then, he received a telegram from Lei Zhen in Shanghai, urging him to go to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. Jiang arrived in the capital on the 31st and scheduled to visit Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and other important government officials on the 3rd. He will take the night train to Shanghai on the 3rd. The reporter recently visited Jiang and inquired about the Democratic Socialist Party's views on participating in the reorganization of the government. He replied as follows: Since the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, it cannot shirk its responsibility for constitutional government. Therefore, its basic principles for participating in the reorganization of the government will not change. However, there are currently two points to consider: (1) If the political atmosphere created by one party rule over the past 20 years cannot be improved, can the Democratic Socialist Party make a new change after participating in the government, and save the national crisis? (2) The Democratic Socialist Party jointly formulated the constitution with the government, and will not shirk its responsibility for constitutional government, but if the current situation does not change, it is not certain whether it can assume the responsibility of constitutional government. According to Jiang, the statement by Zuo Juesheng published in a Nanjing evening newspaper today, saying "how much connection is there between Zhang Jun of the Democratic Socialist Party and Zhang Dongsheng of the Democratic League?" is not true. Because this party is currently considering the above two issues, it is definitely not so-called "drawing and pulling" to take care of personal relationships.

### National Political Council to Meet in Early April

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 2nd] After the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang decides to hold a meeting on March 15, the National Political Council will also meet in early April. It is heard that the Third Plenary Session will discuss the end of the period of political tutelage and issues related to the internal policies of the Kuomintang.

### To Solve the Far East Problem, the United States and the Soviet Union Should First Withdraw Their Troops. "The US Herald" Published a Commentary

[United Press, New York, 1st] The "The US Herald" said in today's editorial: "We have already seen Moscow-style 'coalition governments' in places like Poland and Yugoslavia, and we do not want to see such a coalition government again. The United States and the Soviet Union should have a necessary agreement in the Far East, but they need to withdraw their troops from the United States and the Soviet Union from the liberated areas of Korea, Manchuria, and China. If this is the case, the people of those countries will be able to freely organize their own governments according to their own needs and aspirations. This is the provision of the Atlantic Charter, and it was recognized by Russia in Tehran and Yalta."

The author concluded: "For the United States and the Soviet Union, this is the only truly democratic way to solve the Far East problem."

### Serious Disaster in Anhui

Zhang Zhizhong Generously Donates Ten Million Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The disaster in Anhui is serious. People in Nanjing, including Zhang Zhizhong, are concerned about their hometown and will launch a fundraising campaign to help the disaster victims. Zhang himself generously donated ten million yuan as the first donation.

### Zhang Shaowu, Commander of the Communist Central China Region, Declares Defection

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Zhang Shaowu, commander and political commissar of the Huaiyang Column of the Communist Central China Region, and his chief of staff, Liu Weifeng, led their troops to defect on the 22nd of last month and declared their separation from the Chinese Communist Party on the 29th, obeying the government and serving the country. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Since the Japanese invaders invaded China, the whole country was in turmoil. At that time, Shaowu was driven by conscience and participated in the anti-Japanese war effort in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, hoping to win glory for the nation. In the 27th year, the CCP used the united front as a slogan to strive for the final victory. Shaowu and others aimed to resist Japan, and the Communist Party also used the Anti-Japanese Resistance as its slogan, so they did not ask about the future and resolutely joined the CCP organization, hoping to strengthen our anti-Japanese camp. Unexpectedly, for eight years, the CCP repeatedly lied and used killings, and China has been devastated for several years after Japan's surrender. How can we bear to meet each other with weapons and only harm the people? If the CCP values the country and the nation, it should respect the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and work together harmoniously to build the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and then China can move towards unity and join the ranks of the powerful. Because every country, without government leadership, loses its center and the whole country will fall into chaos. Even if the CCP and the government have political disagreements, they should discuss them frankly. For a year, the government has endured patiently and convened peace talks, but the CCP has repeatedly overturned the previous case for excuses, creating a situation that cannot be resolved. The CCP is determined to undermine peace and fight among themselves, and its policy of murder and terror, and the launching of class struggle, have long been abhorred by Shaowu and others. In the future, it will abandon the Chinese people, launch civil wars, harm the country and the people, and destroy unity. Shaowu only knows to love the country, regardless of party and personal interests, and it is difficult to stay on the wrong path. Therefore, with the approval of Deputy Director Li, the Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative District, stationed in Huaiyin, we are allowed to be lenient. On the 22nd of January of the 36th year, we led more than a thousand officers and soldiers of this unit to defect, arrived in Yanghuaji, Suqian, and waited for orders, serving the country. From this day on, we break away from the Chinese Communist Party, obey the government's leadership, and hope that the armed comrades who have been deceived by the CCP will return as soon as possible so that the country can achieve peace and the nation can be fortunate. Sincerely declare, I hope you will consider it. Former Commander and Political Commissar of the Huaiyang Column of the Communist Central China Region, Zhang Shaowu, Chief of Staff Liu Weifeng (January 29th). (printed)."

### Fifth Army Participates in the Battle of Shanghai, Commander Twice Commended by Telegram, General Zhang Zhizhong Answers Reporter's Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] General Zhang Zhizhong, in response to a reporter's request on the 31st, answered the following questions: (Question) According to Shanghai newspaper reports, before holding the "January 28th" commemoration, General Zhang was invited to Shanghai to participate. Is this true? (Answer) On the morning of the 27th, I received a telegram from Mr. Huang Yanpei, which roughly stated, "The Shanghai community is holding the 'January 28th' Commemoration Meeting, and my colleagues have unanimously entrusted me to invite you to attend and give guidance. I am sending this telegram to respectfully request your early arrival," etc. However, because I had an important appointment on that day, I was unable to attend, and I am very sorry. I sent a reply telegram to Mr. Huang to express my gratitude. (Question) On the 29th, the Shanghai Wenhui News reported that during the "January 28th" commemoration meeting, someone said in a speech: "At that time, although the Fifth Army was ordered to ostensibly provide support, in reality it was monitoring, but the officers and soldiers were moved and resolutely participated in the war." General Zhang, as the commander of the Fifth Army at that time, what are your thoughts on this statement? (Answer) This point is absolutely inconsistent with the facts. I was ordered to purely assist the 19th Route Army in the war. The Supreme Commander at that time sent two telegrams, Xianxu and Qiaoxi, to instruct and encourage morale, with earnest words. The officers and soldiers were extremely moved, and the Fifth Army's bravery in battle, its heavy sacrifices, and its sincerity in uniting with friendly forces are all facts that are well known to both Chinese and foreign people. (Question) Regarding the withdrawal from the Military Three-Person Group and the Peiping Military Mediation Executive, General Zhang was the government representative in the Three-Person Group. What are your opinions on this? (Answer) I once represented the government and successively signed the plans for the restoration of transportation, reorganization, and unified compilation, as well as the Northeast Armistice Agreement, etc. Now they have all vanished, and I cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. The government has already issued a statement on this matter, and I have no other opinions. (Question) It is said that Ambassador Petrov visited General Zhang on the 27th for a long conversation. I wonder what the content of the conversation was? (Answer) The Soviet Ambassador came to meet me for a friendly visit only. The conversations were all broad and casual and did not involve any specific issues. (Question) What are General Zhang's recent activities? (Answer) I originally planned to return to my hometown at the end of the old lunar year to sweep the tombs, but I was subsequently ordered to prepare to go to Yan'an, so I canceled it. Now that the trip to Yan'an has been "blocked," I still plan to take a few days off after finishing my official duties and go back to Chaoxian County to take a look before returning to Xinjiang. The reporter then asked General Zhang's secretary to provide the original texts of the two telegrams, Xianxu and Qiaoyou, sent by Chairman Chiang during the "January 28th" Battle of Shanghai to General Zhang. The reporter believes that these are valuable historical documents and has specially transcribed them below: Xianxu Telegram (Titles omitted): Today, your brothers have decided to resist to the end in your original positions. Your spirit of struggle is extremely commendable. I hope that you brothers will work hard to unite and win glory for our Party and country... I hope that you will work together with comrades Chiang and Cai of the 19th Route Army, unite and struggle, and obey the orders of General Commander Chiang in a thorough and practical manner, without the slightest estrangement. If we do not demonstrate the spirit of national revolution here and resolve to sacrifice, when should we wait? Convey this meaning to all officers and soldiers. Qiaoyou Telegram (Titles omitted): Resisting Japan is related to the survival of the nation and is by no means a matter of the honor or disgrace of an individual or a certain unit. All my officers and soldiers in the front should thoroughly understand this meaning. Therefore, the honor of the 19th Route Army is the honor of the entire National Revolutionary Army. There is absolutely no distinction between each other's honor and disgrace. This time, the Fifth Army has joined the battle line. If it can consistently fight in the name of the 19th Route Army, it will further demonstrate the strength of our National Revolutionary Army's combat power, sharing life and death together. How can there be any consideration of honor or disgrace? Please earnestly convey this meaning to all officers and soldiers of the Fifth Army, and be sure to unite and struggle with my 19th Route Army. No sacrifice should be spared to complete the mission of the revolution.

### Prisoners Granted Amnesty, National Total Estimated at 70,000 to 80,000, Those Involved in the Assassination of Wang Jingwei May Be Released

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, recently told reporters: The total number of prisoners in the country is estimated to be about 220,000. Based on the assumption that one-third of them will be released this time, there will be 70,000 to 80,000 people. The Ministry of Judicial Administration previously issued a general order to courts across the country to actively prepare for the protection of released prisoners based on the existing precedents. Our country also has precedents for the proper handling of released prisoners. In the 31st year of the Republic, when I inspected Jian'ou, what I saw was quite well done. Since the implementation of the amnesty this year, the handling of post-release matters varies from place to place. In principle, courts cooperate with charitable organizations for relief, or request assistance from the Post-War Relief Administration. The methods include issuing winter clothing or providing travel expenses, or introducing job opportunities. In addition, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has paid close attention to promoting prison labor in courts across the country in recent years, urging courts across the country to mobilize prisoners to work, striving to cultivate work habits, and adopting bonus methods to give prisoners income. On the one hand, this enables prisoners to have appropriate labor, and on the other hand, it can also cultivate skills so that they do not have to rely on relief after being released.

[Another Telegram] The situation of the implementation of the amnesty in various places: (1) Wuchang: Eighty-eight people have been released, and one hundred and seventy-one people who have already been determined and whose cases have not yet been tried have also been pardoned according to law. (2) Xi'an: The first batch of two hundred and eight pardoned prisoners in Shaanxi were released, and the military amnesty cases are being processed. (3) Beiping: The Ping Court is clearing pardoned prisoners.

They were originally sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each. The Guizhou Higher Court Prosecutor's Office appealed to the Supreme Court requesting another sentence. However, the judgment has not yet been received. Now that the state is implementing a general amnesty, it is learned that if the Supreme Court upholds the original sentence, it can be reduced to six years according to the amnesty order. If they are sentenced to life imprisonment, it will also be reduced to ten years. Moreover, Yu and He have been imprisoned for more than ten years, so no matter which of the above alternative sentences is given, they can be released immediately.

### Government Remits 400 Million Yuan for Emergency Relief to Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, French Side Principally Agrees to Compensation for Damages

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Recently, the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly serious, and the people of the country are quite concerned about the measures to protect overseas Chinese. A reporter specifically inquired with relevant government departments and was informed of the government's recent handling of this matter as follows: (1) Remittance for Relief: Two weeks ago, the government allocated and remitted 3 million Vietnamese currency (equivalent to 400 million National currency), which was handed over to our Consul General Yuan in Hanoi to handle emergency relief. The French side also voluntarily donated 5 million francs. (2) Evacuation of Overseas Chinese: Regarding the areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated, our side has proposed to the French and Vietnamese sides to establish safe zones. The French side has expressed agreement in principle. However, because the war situation is constantly changing, and the Viet Minh forces in the overseas Chinese area of Hanoi insist on holding on, although Consul General Yuan has ventured into the area eight times and actively negotiated with the Vietnamese side, there have been no results. As a last resort, we have started to evacuate the overseas Chinese first, and with the consent of the French side, houses have been vacated in the French area for accommodation. As of January 25, more than 2,000 of our overseas Chinese have been evacuated, and we are still continuing negotiations for evacuation. Yesterday, we reiterated to the French Embassy a solemn request that they should not attack the area before the overseas Chinese have been completely evacuated. (3) Supply of Food: Our side is planning to charter planes to fly from Nanning or Kunming to Hanoi or Haiphong to transport food and medicine. On the return trip, the elderly, weak, women, and children among the overseas Chinese will be evacuated in batches. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for dispatching planes, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is responsible for purchasing food and medicine, and has negotiated with the French side to allow our planes to enter and land. At the same time, as a result of our negotiations with the French side, they have issued some rice, vegetables, and salted fish rations to our overseas Chinese. (4) Damage Investigation: The losses of the overseas Chinese in this Vietnam war are very heavy. We have repeatedly requested compensation from the French side. The French side has agreed in principle, and we have instructed our consulate general in Hanoi to handle the registration and investigation of damages. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Xiao Jinfang as the consul in Haiphong and ordered him to take office as soon as possible to quickly handle the investigation of overseas Chinese in Haiphong. (5) Dispatch Personnel for Consolation and Investigation: The government has considered this several times, but because the war situation in Vietnam is very chaotic and the cities are in a state of isolation, it is difficult to visit all places even if personnel are sent. However, personnel will still be sent when necessary.

### Founder of the Peace Movement Talks About the Current Situation in Writing

[Central News Agency, This City] The founder of the peace movement recently issued a written statement on the current situation as follows:

The goal of our launching this movement is to truly lament the current warfare, which internally is enough to undermine the foundation of the country and externally is enough to invite foreign insults. Especially with the opening of the Japanese peace conference, if China cannot appear on the international stage with a state of peaceful unification, then the achievements of eight years of arduous struggle may be destroyed at once. I believe that the reason why the scourge of war has lasted for so long today is that, on the one hand, the habit of engaging in political struggles by force still exists, and on the other hand, the atmosphere of partisanship encourages the war. We believe that the less encouragement there is for prejudice, the sooner the war will end. Therefore, when launching this movement, we adhere to two principles: one is the spirit of impartiality beyond party lines, and the other is the pure spirit of no political intentions. Industrialists, businessmen, and freelancers have no need for bias or political intentions, and their desire for peace is also the most urgent. Therefore, they are the main participants. We firmly believe that once the fair opinions of the whole country are concentrated, there will be an incomparably great moral force, which is the content contained in our four covenants (see various newspapers on January 31). Since the 126 Declaration was issued, various parties have expressed attention, which is a common desire for peace, and it is also because our impartiality is sufficient for the world to see. Since the 126 Declaration was issued, we have received widespread sympathy, but there are also those who have given us advice, which can be divided into five categories: One said that we should form an organization to become a new third party. We can answer that, the word "third party" is still a polite term. We are citizens of the country, that is, the masters, and there is no such thing as a third party. Second, it is said that we should contact both parties and participate in mediation. We can also answer that if both parties can reopen negotiations, we will adopt a welcoming and observant attitude, but we have no intention of getting involved in the vortex. Our call for peace is more of a urging than a requesting attitude, which is the attitude that modern citizens should have. The third and fourth arguments either suggest that we should help A against B, or that we should help B against A. We can further answer that these are all measures to stop boiling water by adding more cold water, and they must be absolutely avoided. Because no matter which side is favored, it is enough to encourage war and is not conducive to peace. Finally, there are those who advise us to be clear about right and wrong. Now that the war is in full swing, tracing the past will only make the problem more and more divergent. What the people want is to realize peaceful, unified, and democratic as soon as possible. This is why we do not want to evaluate the various things before 126. Today, how is right and wrong? It can be said that peace is right and not peace is "wrong."

We are determined to continue to call for peace in the spirit of the 126 Declaration and the Four Covenants until peace is realized. No matter what the war situation is like, and whatever the reasons for the war are, what we hope for is only an immediate ceasefire anytime and anywhere to achieve peaceful unification and realize democracy. We firmly believe that if the people of the whole country unanimously take the position of masters and exert the power of public opinion, they will be able to promote peace at an early date. Currently, we are widely soliciting signatures from all walks of life to join the initiative. We welcome people of any profession who are not bound by partisan bias. In the future, we will carry out extensive calls for peace and signatures throughout the country, and representatives will be nominated to go to major cities such as Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, etc., to contact local industrialists, businessmen, and other people who are outside of partisan biases, and jointly engage in this movement, hoping to use the power of the public opinion of the entire organization to end the self-destructive civil war. Finally, we call on the people of the country to pay attention to a serious fact: Since the United States has withdrawn from its position as a mediator, the responsibility for the people to solve their own national affairs before the conference on the Japan issue has become even greater. We deeply regret that the mediation of the United States has failed. Today, the domestic problem lies in the people of the country solving it themselves, which has been recognized by all parties. This is also the meaning of our launching this movement. We firmly believe that when this spirit of a fair peace movement penetrates the hearts of the people throughout the country, it will be the day when peace is realized. The people must know that they are the masters of the country, and firmly believe that public opinion is the most irresistible force. They must confirm that promoting peaceful unification and democracy is the common path to self-salvation and national salvation.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 2nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce and the 59 commercial associations of Zhenjiang, believing that there can be no peace without stopping the war and no way to save the country without peace, telegraphed the whole country on the 2nd, calling for peace.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd] The Kowloon Chamber of Commerce and 14 other groups recently telegraphed the whole country, supporting the Shanghai community's declaration calling for peace.

### Chennault Flies to Guilin, Large Quantities of Relief Supplies Shipped Simultaneously, Executive Headquarters Air Transport Main Station to Be Established in Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] Flying Tiger General Chennault flew to Guilin from Guangzhou on a giant C-45 aircraft at 9:00 am on the 2nd. This was the first flight after the establishment of the Executive Headquarters Air Transport Brigade, carrying 9,000 pounds of relief medicine and other supplies. Before taking off, Chennault told reporters at Tianhe Airport here: During the war, he felt that post-war construction in China must solve the transportation problem. Only by restoring transportation can various construction and relief efforts be carried out. His ideal has been realized with the help of various Chinese officials. The purpose of establishing the Air Transport Brigade is to supply all relief materials to the rear and to pay special attention to safety, because many of the flight personnel are from the 14th Air Force, who are all wealthy and experienced, while increasing air transport. Chennault stated that he came to Guangzhou in 1937 to train the Chinese Air Force. After inspecting, he was unable to come again due to the war, but he always missed Guangzhou. After the city fell, he led a team to bomb it, so he only bombed military areas and never bombed residential areas or injured civilians. He was very happy to see that the urban area was generally intact this time, not as badly damaged as London, Paris, and other places. Later, when reporters asked whether the Air Transport Brigade was preparing to undertake other entrusted transportation and commercial transportation, Chennault said no. Chennault also denied the news that a commercial transportation company from Honolulu to Tokyo was organized by Flying Tiger personnel. According to Zhang Zixuan, director of the brigade's Guangzhou area, the brigade currently has five aircraft capable of carrying three tons each, and fourteen aircraft capable of carrying six tons each will arrive here. They are all the best aircraft from Honolulu. In the future, the main air transport station will be established in Guangzhou.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] General Chennault and his party of five arrived here by plane from Guangzhou at 2:00 pm on the 2nd. The provincial government hosted a banquet in the evening. Chennault is scheduled to return to Guangzhou by the original plane on the morning of the 3rd.

### Gui Yongqing Talks in Taiwan, Building the Navy Cannot Be Delayed

Training Institution to Be Established in Zuoying

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] Naval Acting Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Gui Yongqing met with reporters on the 2nd and stated: "Now is the best time for our country to develop the navy. Recalling the Sino-Japanese War, the fate of the country was determined by a naval battle of several hours, which illustrates the importance of the navy and that the establishment of a new navy cannot be delayed. As far as Taiwan is concerned, a history of Taiwan is a history of coastal defense. Zheng Chenggong's recovery of Taiwan and the Qing government's loss of Taiwan, the key to success or failure, lies in the superiority or inferiority of naval power. Taiwan's geographical and climatic conditions are the best naval base. A naval training institution will be established soon. The location will be selected in Zuoying to recruit naval cadets, and we especially hope that young people from Taiwan Province will participate enthusiastically." Gui also stated: "The current work focuses on the following four things: sorting out the received equipment, training talents, establishing systems, and eliminating factionalism." Speaker Chen Yiguan also invited former Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng and Gui to Caoshan, a scenic spot in the suburbs of Taipei, on the 2nd to spend a Sunday holiday together.

### Building the Yangtze River Dam and Power Plant: Mr. Bash Promotes US to Provide Electrical Equipment

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st dispatch] Mr. Bash, who previously proposed the Chinese government's initial plan in 1944 to build a massive dam and hydroelectric plant on the Yangtze River at Yichang, today urged the United States to provide all necessary electrical equipment needed in the plan to strengthen China. Mr. Bash, now in charge of economic affairs for the Gladch Trading Company, said: "The entire investment of the United States can be repaid within fifteen years, because fertilizer produced in Yichang and antimony, which the United States lacks, can both be imported from China." Mr. Bash also said that he is still researching large-scale flood control and Yellow River water management plans. "If this plan is adopted, the world's largest reclamation project can emerge at the lowest appropriate cost, which is what I enjoy doing." Mr. Bash's Yangtze River hydroelectric plan was submitted to the Chongqing government in June and November 1944, but has not yet been announced. Mr. Bash continued, "This plan is also extremely important politically. Its implementation can stabilize China's political and economic situation, because as the Chinese government improves the economic status of farmers in densely populated areas, the people can feel that the government truly cares about and helps them. In this way, the government can also obtain the greatest support. If China's economy can be properly developed, it can be as powerful as the United States within twenty years."

### Editorial: A Bird's-Eye View of the Palestine Problem

The Palestine problem, which has been the most difficult issue for Britain after the war, has finally developed to the most serious stage after two full years of turmoil, terror, and bloodshed. The atrocities of Jewish terrorists are intensifying. Last July, the British military headquarters in Jerusalem, the King David Hotel, was bombed by the Jewish underground organization Irgun. In late January of this year, two British expatriates, Judge Winterton and Major Collins, were kidnapped by Jewish terrorists. All British expatriates in Palestine felt threatened and lived in constant fear, which prompted British High Commissioner General Cunningham to take emergency security measures, on the one hand, imposing curfews and security measures in Jewish cities, and on the other hand, sentencing Galona, the Jew who attacked the headquarters, to death. This made the mood of the Jews even more tense, and acts of terrorism were seen everywhere, almost turning this holy land into a hell of terror. Therefore, in order to protect the lives and property of expatriates, the British government ordered British women and children to withdraw to their home country on the 31st of last month, and at the same time ordered government personnel to enter safe areas. After Britain took this emergency security measure, the attention of the whole world was focused on this Palestine problem.

Palestine was originally a British mandate after World War I, but how should the Jewish-Arab dispute in Palestine be arranged after World War II? In Britain's view, of course, this is also a very serious problem. At first, Britain pulled in the United States and jointly organized a joint investigation team to conduct on-the-spot investigations in Palestine. As a result, a report was issued suggesting that 100,000 Jews be transferred to Palestine first. However, in Palestine, Jews and Arabs are almost two incompatible ethnic groups because of racial discrimination and economic competition. The British and American proposal to transfer 100,000 Jews to Palestine first will naturally arouse the opposition of the Arabs. The Arabs have lived in Palestine for hundreds of years and have long regarded Palestine as their own place. How can they tolerate the entry of a large number of foreigners? What's more, Jews are superior to Arabs in terms of knowledge and wealth?

The policy adopted by Britain towards Palestine is inherently contradictory. On the one hand, Britain approves of Jews moving to Palestine, and on the other hand, it advocates supporting the unified movement of the Arab nation. In 1943, when Eden was Foreign Secretary, he declared that Britain was willing to promote the establishment of the Arab League. However, the result of Britain's adoption of this contradictory policy aroused dissatisfaction from both Jews and Arabs, which is what we call "not pleasing either side." Therefore, the British Colonial Office drafted two plans. The first plan was to ask the United States to station troops in Palestine to protect Jews entering the country; the second plan was to divide Palestine into two federations, which is what we call the Jewish-Arab partition. Regarding the former, asking the United States to station troops in Palestine is tantamount to asking the United States to pull chestnuts out of the fire. President Truman can see the gains and losses of this matter clearly. Britain's wishful thinking will naturally not be realized. As for the latter, to divide Palestine into two federations, Britain should first obtain the consent of the Arabs and Jews to implement this plan. Therefore, the British Colonial Office decided to hold a Palestine round table conference in London on September 9 last year, but on the day the conference opened, the Arab representatives first stated: "Palestine should belong to us; Palestine has nothing to do with the Jews. The Jewish refugee problem needs multilateral cooperation to solve." As for the Jews, what they want is to restore their country; what they hope for is independence. They are also not interested in Britain's partition plan, so the Jews have never sent representatives to attend. The London Conference opened in a dim atmosphere and fell into a state of stagnation in less than ten days.

When Britain could not solve the Palestine problem, President Truman suddenly issued a statement assisting the Jews, advocating that Jewish refugees should be transferred to Palestine in large numbers immediately, and supporting the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. He expressed disagreement with Britain's plan to implement the Jewish-Arab partition. Therefore, the Palestine problem became more complicated and more subtle; Britain's partition plan was not only dissatisfied by both Jews and Arabs, but also opposed by the United States. The divergence in the steps of Britain and the United States only made Britain's position more difficult and more fragile. Later, the British Colonial Office and the Foreign Office still made great efforts, hoping that this problem could be resolved satisfactorily; but they also knew that this problem was thorny and there was little chance of a satisfactory solution, so it was decided to make a final decision on this matter at the Palestine Conference at the end of January this year. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin's planned plan, if the Palestine Conference fails again, Britain plans to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for handling.

Now the London Round Table Conference has been reopened as scheduled. Not only is there no hope for a thorough solution to the Palestine problem, but also the situation in Palestine is even more serious than before, which has forced the British government to order the withdrawal of women and children; it is expected that the Palestine problem, in addition to being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by Britain until the fall, there is really no second way to find. This is the depression of British diplomacy after the war, and it is also the tragedy of the present era.

### The Spring Festival Quietly Passes; Zhenjiang's Industries Not Yet Fully Operational

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] The Spring Festival has quietly passed in the wind and snow, but the various industries have still been slow to fully start operations. The reporter believes that this matter is of great concern to all parties, and specially visited a giant in the financial world of this city to inquire whether there are any relief measures. According to him, this phenomenon is not only the case in Zhenjiang, but also in other places. Although the head office of the four joint official banks has ordered to relax industrial and commercial loans to seek relief, due to the position of each bank itself, it can only operate general loans, that is, collateral loans. Jiangsu Bank once did real estate mortgage loans, but because the bank's funds were short, it only released 60 to 70 million yuan and then stopped. Although the Central Farmer's Bank is also currently engaged in construction loan business, the head office has ordered to do less, so the restrictions are quite strict. As for the Central Bank, as the bank's bank, its lending targets seem to be only banks, so it can't help. Fortunately, there has been no major volatility in the financial market recently. If the business community can use its abilities well, its future will naturally be better.

### Requesting the Exhibition of Cultural Relics to Be Moved and Opened Elsewhere

This exhibition of anti-Japanese war cultural relics at the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road is of great significance, and various newspapers have given it high praise. I did not have time to visit it because I was preparing for a big exam, and the trams on the 1 and 2 routes were very crowded. It is very inconvenient for me, who lives in the southern district, to brave such great difficulties to visit the exhibition in the northern district. I propose that the cultural relics exhibition be moved to the central district for several days, such as the YMCA (八仙橋) and the Great New Company, so that we young people can get a glimpse of the difficult process of the Anti-Japanese War and understand the greatness of the Anti-Japanese War and the difficulty of national struggle.

### Suggestions for Academic Level Public Examinations

After the war, all industries are in urgent need of construction, especially in education, which requires extra effort. Although the education authorities have announced tuition limits, it is very difficult to find a school that meets those limits. Moreover, poor children have few opportunities to enter formal schools. However, the youth who study hard on their own are hit with unknown numbers of blows to their courage to study because they do not have the qualification certificates to obtain.

To help these people who are eager to learn reach their goals and make them all outstanding citizens, the education authorities really have a responsibility to supervise and encourage them. How can this task be completed? That is to hold academic level public examinations. The holding of academic level public examinations is for the education authorities to send personnel to examine whether the knowledge of those who study on their own is qualified, and those who pass will be given an academic level certificate, which has the same qualifications as an equivalent formal school. In the future, whether it is further education or service, it can be used as a formal certificate. The exam should of course be strict to test their true talent and make them work hard to improve. What needs to be held urgently now are three types of academic level public examinations: junior high school, high school, and university. The number of exams can be set as: once a year, or once every two years. In this way, those who study on their own or research on their own can have interest and a way out. In addition, it can also encourage students in formal schools to study hard and improve. Otherwise, their knowledge will also be distrusted. People who apply to take the exam, regardless of gender, age, or age, can take the exam. This can improve the level of national education and strengthen the border of cultural defense. (Zhou Zuolin)

### British in the Middle East Conduct Secret Activities; Outside, Jordan Deploys Troops to the Syrian Border; Attempting to Realize the "Greater Syria" Plan; In Order to Break the Stalemate of the Palestine Issue

[United Press Cairo, 1st] The Arabic-language "Yom" weekly reported today that outer Jordanian troops are currently concentrated on the Syrian border, and King Abdullah is planning to enter Syria by force. Arab figures here did not express surprise at this, saying that if this is true, there are two messages: (1) Abdullah wants to annex Syria in order to realize his ambition to establish "Greater Syria." (2) In order to facilitate the resolution of the Palestine stalemate, the Arab part of Palestine will be incorporated into Greater Syria, and a smaller Jewish Palestine will be established. The war also said that outer Jordan will generally create some kind of incident as an excuse to enter Syria. British agents have secretly encouraged Abdullah, with a long-term vision of using him to solve the Palestinian problem.

[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] According to unconfirmed reports, Outer Jordanian King Abdullah has agreed to accept as many British women and children as possible who have been evacuated from Palestine to Outer Jordan.

[Reuters London, 1st] Parties concerned say that British women, children, and non-essential civilians evacuated from Palestine will be temporarily placed in various places in the Near East and Middle East, such as Cyprus, Sudan, the Suez Canal Zone, Kenya, and South and East Africa.

[Agence France-Presse New York, 1st] American writer and Vice Chairman of the Free Palestine League Brown Field said today that the British evacuation of women and children from Palestine is reminiscent of Britain launching a real war against the Jewish people. Britain has already made big mistakes in Ireland and India, and now it is repeating them in Palestine. It is a mistake to make again and again, which is regrettable. It must be known that the will of the people is irresistible. It is also wrong for the Zionist movement to cooperate with the British to jointly suppress the Palestinian Jewish resistance movement.

### British Garrison in Palestine Deploys Iron Net, as if Facing a Great Enemy; Jewish Terrorist Group Expresses Determination to Fight

[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] Rumors here say that Gruner, the Jewish underground member sentenced to death, will be hanged next Tuesday. Today, British troops braved the rain to deploy new barbed wire everywhere, strengthening defenses, and forming patrols with the police, each team consisting of eight to ten people. Some Jewish areas in Jerusalem are divided into half-mile square enclosures by heavy barbed wire. According to reliable sources, the Palestinian government has notified Jewish community leaders that if Gruner is executed, a 24-hour curfew will be imposed in Palestine. If terrorist groups riot, martial law will be implemented in certain areas. Gruner is currently in a Jerusalem prison, and the appeal he drafted has not yet been signed. Twenty houses in the Katamon area of Jerusalem are surrounded by double-layered barbed wire, mainly for government officials ordered to move into the secure zone. Military circles held an emergency meeting, apparently to discuss maintaining public order. The Palestinian government yesterday ordered all British women and children to evacuate by next Tuesday.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 1st] Amid the active preparations for the evacuation of British women and children, leaflets and bombs from the Irgun party were found in Tel Aviv, claiming that the party will continue its fight with the British. The evacuation of 2,000 British families is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, when evacuees will be transported by land and air to port for embarkation. Senior British land and air force officers in Palestine, as well as the highest police authorities, held a highly confidential meeting lasting 45 minutes at the British motor headquarters in Jerusalem today. The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency also held an emergency meeting. General Barker, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces, left Jerusalem for Haifa tonight. Meanwhile, the deadline for the postponed execution of Jewish terrorist Gruner will expire on Sunday, and retaliatory actions by terrorists are expected to become active immediately after the execution.

### Palestine Problem: Partition Plan a Thing of the Past; Will Be Submitted to the United Nations for Handling

[Reuters London, 2nd] A Middle East correspondent for "World News" stated that the Palestine partition plan is a thing of the past, and the future of Palestine apparently lies solely in being handled by the United Nations. During last week's British-Arab delegation talks, Bevin did not express support for partition, saying that partition was not within the scope of the mandatory power. Any solution that goes beyond the scope of the mandate should be decided by the United Nations. Bevin believes that Morrison's federal plan is more logical, but it is difficult to force its implementation because both Arabs and Jews strongly oppose it. The Arab delegation still insists on the plan they proposed last October, which is to establish an Arab democratic state where Jews, who make up one-third of the residents, can enjoy full rights and one-third of the representation in the cabinet. During last week's talks, Bevin asked the Arab representatives to make further concessions, but the possibility of this happening is very small. Therefore, the Palestine issue will ultimately have to be submitted to the United Nations.

### US to Begin Broadcasting to the Soviet Union

[This newspaper reports] San Francisco, 2nd: Starting from February 17th, the US government will broadcast radio programs in Russian to the Soviet Union every day at 10 PM New York time (7 PM Moscow time).

At that time, the voice of the United States will reach the Soviet Union, 5,000 miles away, through the so-called "Iron Curtain".

### UN Investigation Team in Greece Holds Meeting; Chinese Representative Expresses Views

Advocating for the Swift Completion of Assigned Mission

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] The United Nations Fact-Finding Committee held a meeting here this morning at 11 AM to discuss the current general situation and the methods to be adopted in fulfilling its duties. The meeting lasted for a considerable time and adjourned at 1:30 PM. During the meeting, the Chinese representative, Jin Jianshi, the country's ambassador to Belgium, delivered a speech, urging the Investigation Committee to proceed swiftly with its assigned mission, saying: "The work we must complete is extremely difficult, and world opinion is focused on this committee." The Investigation Committee finally unanimously agreed that delays would provoke criticism from all parties and reduce the influence of the United Nations. The committee also decided to begin hearing statements from the representatives of the four countries concerned on the 3rd of this month. The Albanian representative will be the first to present his country's views, followed by the Greek representative. According to the Greek representative, Karaos, he has notified the Investigation Committee that he will submit two documents on the border conflict.

### US Delegation to Moscow Conference Reaches 100 People; Britain and Soviet Union to Discuss Military Alliance

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] The US State Department recently announced that the US delegation to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference will include 100 experts. The US government has notified the Soviet government of the size of the US delegation, which will be the most important delegation the United States has sent to an international conference since the war. In addition, 73 newspaper and radio reporters have requested permission from the State Department to accompany the delegation to Moscow for news coverage. The Soviet government is currently studying this matter. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican, and Senator Connally, a Democrat, will accompany Secretary of State Marshall to Moscow, but the authorities have not yet made a statement on this matter. In addition, Cohen, an advisor to the State Department, and Bohlen, an advisor on Soviet affairs, may also go to Moscow.

[United Press, London, 2nd] The diplomatic correspondent for "World News" stated today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will inform Stalin next month that Britain welcomes concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union similar to the current British-American agreement. World News disclosed this article, saying that Bevin will secretly discuss this matter with Stalin at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and will explore the "weaknesses" in the current British-Soviet agreement that Stalin opposes. It is claimed that Bevin will solemnly declare at that time that neither Britain and the Soviet Union nor Britain and the United States can conclude treaties outside the framework of the United Nations.

### Austin Drafts General Disarmament Plan

Soviet Representative Disagrees

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] According to authoritative sources, the world general disarmament plan that the United States is preparing to submit to the Security Council has been blocked due to Soviet opposition. This plan was drafted by US Representative Austin in consultation with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, combining arms and atomic restrictions into one plan. It has been secretly discussed in advance with the representatives of the other ten countries on the Security Council. When Austin met with Soviet Representative Gromyko, Gromyko immediately expressed his opposition. It is not yet known whether the United States will make concessions or insist on all the main provisions of the plan. Austin will make a final decision after informally consulting with other representatives.

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The general disarmament plan drafted by US Representative Austin includes three points: (1) The Security Council should establish an eleven-nation Disarmament Committee to make various recommendations. This committee will not discuss atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction; atomic weapons will continue to be handled by the current Atomic Energy Commission. (2) A drafting sub-group should be established to formulate special provisions for the Disarmament Committee to refer to. (3) The Security Council should begin considering the Atomic Energy Commission's first report at its next meeting.

Establish Consultation Committee

In addition, a "Information and Consultation Committee" will be formed by representatives of the four major powers and representatives of the countries concerned. This committee will work in parallel with the Foreign Ministers Conference, so that all other Allied countries will be informed of the development of preparations. For example, when discussing the issue of Germany's western borders, the committee should include representatives of the four major powers as well as representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. When discussing the eastern border, Poland and Czechoslovakia should naturally be listed as countries concerned. In the second stage, France advocated that all Allied countries should be allowed to consult various documents in the Foreign Ministers Conference related to the special interests of each country, and that all Allied countries should be allowed to attend the four Foreign Ministers' representatives meeting as observers for any point of discussion.

Maintain Contact

At the same time, during the second stage, the representatives of the four major powers may also appoint expert working groups, and other Allied countries may participate in these groups. The expert representatives of the four powers are completely equal. Therefore, when the third stage begins, all Allied countries will have already been informed of the initial discussions of the four powers, which is very different from the situation at the previous Paris Peace Conference when discussing the peace treaties with the five vassal states of Germany. In the fourth stage, the "Information and Consultation Committee" will begin to operate again to provide direct liaison between the Allies and the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers. Diplomatic observers here believe that France's procedural memorandum has corrected the shortcomings in the procedure of the Paris Peace Conference and is expected to win widespread sympathy.

Ruhr Plan

It is also learned that the French government's memorandum submitted to the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Paris today regarding the international control of the Ruhr region's industry is purely an economic document with a detailed plan for controlling Germany's major industries.

### France Proposes Procedural Issues for Drafting Peace Treaty with Germany

Divided into Four Stages

[Reuters London, 1st] The French memorandum on the preparatory procedure for the German peace treaty, submitted to the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers Conference, will be discussed at the Four Foreign Ministers Representatives Meeting next Tuesday. It is learned that the memorandum suggests that the preparation for the peace treaty should be divided into four stages: (1) The Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow in March; (2) The Foreign Ministers Representatives Meeting will submit the first draft of the German peace treaty based on the discussion results of the Moscow Conference; (3) A peace conference of 22 Allied countries will be convened to discuss the draft; (4) The Four Powers Conference will be convened again to complete the final peace treaty. In order to satisfy the desire of other Allied countries to participate in the early discussions of the peace treaty, the French memorandum suggests that a consultation mechanism should be established during the Moscow Conference, and the four foreign ministers may invite any Allied country to participate in major discussions.

### US Pacific Fleet to Hold Large-Scale Naval and Air Exercises; Deadlock in US-Philippine Base Negotiations May Be Broken

[United Press, San Diego, 2nd] Rear Admiral Mongal, Commander of the First Task Force of the US Pacific Fleet, announced today that the force will conduct exercises in the Central Pacific from the end of this month until the end of the month, with various types of ships and aircraft participating. The First Task Force was reorganized from the Fifth Fleet. This exercise will be larger in scale than the exercise held by the Fifth Fleet off the coast of California in December last year, and will have mobile supply and repair equipment participating in the naval and air exercises.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Department of the Army stated today that General Trusscott, Commanding General of the Army Ground Forces, departed today for Alaska to inspect the special forces testing winter equipment in the Arctic environment.

[United Press, Manila, 1st] Negotiations on the US-Philippine military base agreement have lasted for more than six weeks. Since US Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt suddenly proposed to the Philippine government that the US military could withdraw completely if it wished, it is now reported that the negotiations are nearing completion. Philippine President Roxas and Foreign Minister Quirino's immediate rejection of the US proposal has apparently broken the deadlock caused by the base location issue. Roxas reported to Congress this week that the United States is very willing to withdraw all troops, but at the same time solemnly declared that the United States believes it has a fundamental obligation to guarantee the security of the Philippines in accordance with the wishes of the Filipino people.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy announced today that in preparation for "global three-dimensional warfare," mixed training will be used to unify the military thinking of US Army and Navy officers. It is claimed that 900 selected officers from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are studying together at senior military academies.

### Obstacle to European Industrial Revival: Coal Shortage is the Biggest Fatal Wound

This article originally appeared in the "World Report Weekly" published in Washington, DC, and was written based on recent survey reports from London, Paris, Berlin, Washington, and other places. The conclusion of this article is that "the current coal shortage hinders the industrial production of Western Europe." Due to the lack of coal, railways, factories, power plants, and home industries are progressing slowly, and the restoration of war losses has been affected.

Western European coal production is still less than two-thirds of pre-war production. The most important supplement comes from the United States. US coal exports are stipulated to be two million tons per month, but often the amount of coal exported cannot reach this tonnage due to interruptions in production and shipping.

Last spring, the strike by US coal miners had a serious impact on Europe. Then, summer came and solved the problem. And now it is the severe winter season, and Western Europe urgently needs US coal production to drive machinery and stay warm. The current reduction in US coal production directly affects the revival of European industry.

Due to the strike of ship sailors, US coal production imported to Europe between September and October last year reached only half of what was expected. Since the cessation of the strike last spring, European security has gradually been guaranteed.

The importance of US coal exports to Western Europe can be expressed in the following statistics:

(Percentage of US coal supply to European countries out of their total coal consumption).

Italy 70%

Finland 60%

Norway 45%

Portugal 42%

Sweden 32%

Denmark 32%

Switzerland 25%

Netherlands 22%

France 13%

Belgium 8%

(Based on figures from August 1946)

Last August, when US coal exports complied with regulations, the total amount of coal in Europe that relied on the United States accounted for 21%.

The most dependent on the United States is Italy, which imports 70% of its total consumption from the United States. Several countries on the Scandinavian Peninsula (Norway, Sweden, etc.) also rely heavily on the United States. Before the US strike occurred, France and several of the Low Countries (Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium) imported more coal from the United States than from West Germany. Therefore, the delay in US mining also had a serious impact on the efficiency of coal imports into various countries.

The importance of US coal exports is enough to affect US production itself. In the first ten months of last year, the total amount of US imports into Western Europe was 15 million tons, which is equivalent to the weekly production in the United States.

Germany

Germany was originally the only coal exporting country in Western Europe. But now it has also stopped exporting to neighboring countries. The food shortage in the British-occupied zone of Germany is very serious. In recent weeks, the quantity of coal production has decreased sharply. As a result, several steel mills have closed, and the output of power plants has also decreased.

The United Kingdom decided to reduce exports from the Ruhr and Rhine areas to support industrial production. The reason for this proposal is that the United Kingdom intends to be self-sufficient. They are also quite troubled by the current internal political problems in Germany.

Coal production exports from the British zone of Germany will decrease from last July to this May by one-third of the export volume of 935,000 tons last September.

Within the French zone of Germany, including the Saar River basin, 125,000 tons are exported each month, most of which are used to supply mainland France. The output of each miner is higher than in the British zone. Its production rate is also close to pre-war standards.

France

France is greatly affected by the difficulties in the Ruhr region. The reduction in electricity production in West Germany has affected France. Currently, half of Germany's industry is in a state of stagnation.

What is directly affected is that Germany's total electricity consumption has decreased by at least 20%.

France's coal supply is in an unstable situation. French public utilities currently have only 17 days of coal reserves.

France's coal production this year is 50 million tons, exceeding the standard of 1938. Many war criminals are employed to work in the coal mines. But the efficiency is not very high. Because of the large number of people, it is enough to make up for the defects of low efficiency. However, the production volume is still far from meeting France's own needs.

Before World War II, France imported 28% of its total coal consumption. One-third of which was transported from Germany. Before the US sailors' strike, France imported US coal to supplement the supply, and the quantity reached 700,000 tons per month.

Because the import of coal from Germany has been interrupted, France is very eager to increase its purchases of US coal. Therefore, the stagnation of US transportation has seriously affected France's post-war recovery and the restoration of factories and transportation.

Italy

Most of the coal consumed in Italy is supplied by other countries. Italy's coal mining reaches 75% of the pre-war figure, but it is still only enough to offset 13% of consumption. The coal consumed in Italy is imported from the United States, and part of it is purchased with funds from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

If US coal exports are blocked and interrupted, Italy will undoubtedly face a collapse. Poland also supplies Italy with a small amount of coal. The United Kingdom may supply Italy with all its quantity, but without US coal and the funds to purchase coal, Italy will encounter a severe economic crisis and political chaos.

Belgium

Belgium can import a small part of coal from Germany, and if US coal cannot be imported, the impact will be much less than in other countries in Western Europe.

In August last year, about 8% of the coal consumed in Belgium was imported from the United States. The imported from other sources, mainly the Ruhr area, is 5%.

But the lack of coal still has a considerable impact on Belgian industry. The main thing is the mining of zinc ore, which can only be stopped without the burning of coal.

Netherlands

If the Netherlands does not have a US coal supply, its industry will be severely crippled. 22% of its total monthly coal consumption must be imported from the United Kingdom. Another 15% is supplied by Germany, but one-third of this will be cut off. The Netherlands' own coal mining is only slightly higher than half of the pre-war level.

It will be difficult for the Netherlands' industry to recover from the ruins ravaged by the war. The most serious problem at present is the lack of coal.

The countries on the Scandinavian Peninsula do not produce coal. Most of them obtain coal from the United Kingdom, West Germany, Poland, and the United States.

Compared with before the war, the United Kingdom's exports have declined. But Poland's exports are likely to increase.

The reduction in coal exports from West Germany and the United States is very serious for several Scandinavian countries, especially the steel industry in Sweden and Denmark, which will be severely hit.

Poland

Poland's progress in increasing coal production has been very rapid. Last year, it reached a record of 49 million tons. Even if the mining areas of Silesia province in eastern Germany are also included, it is still lower than the pre-war standard.

Three-quarters of Poland's coal production is seized by the Soviet Union, and most of the rest is exported to the Scandinavian Peninsula.

Now that there is an extreme shortage of coal in Western Europe, Poland has the best opportunity to control the Western European market. But because of the slow recovery of Soviet production, any large-scale exports from Poland cannot reach Western Europe.

United Kingdom

Before the war, the United Kingdom was the world's leading coal exporting country. The annual output reached 55 million tons. Compared with this year's figures, it is far behind.

Since the United Kingdom's production has fallen and domestic consumption has increased, coal exports are truly scarce and pitiful. The coal shortage in the United Kingdom is very tense. Therefore, several power plants have been forced to shut down to maintain the volume of coal. All industries must carefully plan their budgets for coal use, and the supply is 11% less than a year ago.

The entire Western Europe will suffer a sharp drop in production due to the lack of coal. If US coal mines cannot maintain an adequate and sufficient quantity to supply Western Europe, then the serious situation will turn into an emergency period. If the train transport can be kept from being disrupted, then industrial production will not be restricted. However, the coal used for taking turns is gradually becoming difficult to obtain.

### Young Diet Members of Japan Progressive Party Advocate Establishing Coalition Cabinet: Liberal Party to Decide Attitude Today

[Reconstruction News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Young Diet members of the Japan Progressive Party are dissatisfied with the recent cabinet reshuffle by the Yoshida Cabinet, and the call for the speedy establishment of a coalition cabinet is growing. Nine Diet members from the party, including Arai, Kawasaki, Hosokawa, and Kanemitsu, visited Liberal Party executives Okubo and Ono today, urging them to quickly find a way to form a coalition cabinet.

Japanese General Strike Declared Dissolved

[Reconstruction News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] In response to the tactics adopted by various labor unions after February 1, the Japanese government authorities decided to prohibit each labor union from carrying out independent strikes after the 2nd. Hasegawa, director of the Security Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, said on the 1st that if the labor unions scheduled to carry out a general strike on February 1 carry out individual strikes after the 2nd, they will be regarded as a continuation of the February 1 strike, violating MacArthur's orders, and will be dealt with according to the established policy. If each labor union wishes to strike independently in the future, it must re-apply to the authorities and conduct negotiations. If the negotiations fail, it must file a complaint with the Central Labor Relations Commission, and only after one month of unresolved issues can a strike be carried out. Furthermore, after the dissolution of the All Japan Government Employees Joint Struggle Committee following the suspension of the February 1 strike, the affiliated labor unions held a representatives meeting on the 1st and decided to establish a liaison conference. As a result of the preparatory meeting held today, it was generally agreed that since the general strike was prohibited by MacArthur's orders, it would no longer be possible to carry out strikes in a joint struggle manner. If negotiations are not backed by strikes, success is unlikely. Organizations such as the liaison conference are no longer necessary at this stage, and such organizations will restrict the individual negotiations of each labor union. Therefore, the liaison conference also decided to abolish itself. The joint struggle organization, which had mobilized 2.6 million public employees since last October to plan a historic general strike, was officially declared dissolved.

### Discovery of Six New Toxic Substances for Manufacturing Atomic Bombs: Radiation Can Easily Penetrate Bone Marrow and Kill

[United Press dispatch from New York, 1st] Dr. Hamilton of the University of California reported to the American Physical Society today that six new elements have been discovered, all derived from atomic fission and are non-gaseous metallic substances. They are the most toxic substances known to science, hence the name "Terrible Half-Dozen." Silver fission can produce these six toxic substances, and its toxicity is equal to that produced by atomic fission. Uranium fission can also produce these six toxic substances, but its toxicity is less than that of its products. These six new toxic substances are all common metals, but when produced by atomic fission, they are isotopes that emit radiation for months. The harm of this mismatch of metal atoms is that they and their mother substance settle in the inner layer of the bone, close to the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the greatest weakness of humans when subjected to radiation attacks. Radiation kills bone marrow faster than other tissues. Toxins in the inner layer of the bone can reach the bone marrow, but when eaten with food, they do not enter the bloodstream, so they cannot reach the bone and are excreted from the body without causing harm. If inhaled into the lungs by spraying or brought into contact with a wound, it can reach the bone and be fatal. These six toxic substances are isotopes of silver, strontium, yttrium, and cesium.

### Five-Person Investigation Committee Continued Inspection Yesterday: Obvious Fingerprints Photographed on Wang's Smashed Wardrobe: Criminal's Head Likely to Be Unsaved: Testimony of Clothing Store Owner Worth Noting

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ximo Road Fire Investigation Committee went to the Zhenhua Paint Company on Xinza Road yesterday afternoon to inspect the Wang family's wardrobe, which was chopped open by firefighters with axes. The interior of the wardrobe door was covered in fingerprints, clearly visible. Zhang Da, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, immediately ordered the police bureau to photograph the fingerprints for comparison with the fingerprints of the firefighters. Chief Zhang said, "This is the fairest and most effective method. The criminal's head is likely to be unsaved."

The Investigation Committee continued to interview Song Zhipeng, a military police officer from the 23rd Regiment, yesterday. He was present on the scene and contacted the US military. He witnessed the firefighters not working hard to put out the fire but gathering in the 洋房 at No. 15 to eat oranges, peanuts, etc. According to him, when he arrived at the scene of the fire, the fire had already spread to the 洋房 at No. 21. He met a Mr. Tang, a resident of No. 11, and immediately told him that the fire had not yet spread backwards, so he should rescue his belongings as soon as possible. At that time, he helped him move out a women's bicycle. He saw many firefighters chatting at No. 15. One of them asked him, "Military Police, can we have a drink of water?" They picked up bottles of boiled water from the ground and drank from them. He said, "Go put out the fire after you're done drinking," and then retreated. When he went back in a second time, he saw a short firefighter, who appeared to be a team leader, about to eat food from the cupboard and asked him, "Do you want an orange?" He said, "No," but he didn't remember the firefighter's number. He left the scene of the fire at 3:00 the next day.

### Fire Rekindled Twice: Said to Be Gasoline

Song also said that he saw many firefighters sitting and resting in Xu Shun's and Zhu Youxin's clothing stores, talking and laughing. The Investigation Committee immediately interviewed the two clothing stores, but there was no new information. However, according to Zhu Wangshi, the owner of Zhu Youxin's clothing store, she heard Wang's coachman say that he had already agreed on a price with the firefighters, but because the gold bars were locked in the safe and could not be opened, the firefighters did not put out the fire. She also heard others say that the fire rekindled the second time because the firefighters poured gasoline on it.

Prepare a Report and Submit It to the Mayor

Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, met with Mayor Wu yesterday and reported on the work of the Investigation Committee in recent days. Mayor Wu said that the reason for the fire rekindling after being extinguished must be investigated in detail, and the Wang family's rubble site must be excavated urgently. The municipal government can bear all the costs, but representatives from the police bureau, the Bao Tian Chu, and the Wang family must be present to supervise. Mayor Wu also hoped that the Investigation Committee could collect information and prepare a report to be submitted to the municipal government today. The Investigation Committee has decided to send the administrative part of the case, including the time of the fire and the time it was reported, the rescue situation, and fire-fighting equipment, based on reports from all parties, to Mayor Wu today. As for the judicial part, a statistical table will be prepared, listing the people who still need to be investigated by category, such as when the firefighters arrived at the scene of the fire, which houses they entered, what kind of work they did, and what kind of improper behavior they may have had. Based on the reports of senior officials, fire victims, and eyewitnesses at the time, it should not be difficult to get to the bottom of the matter.

Improve Facilities, Do Not Offer Opinions

Regarding how to improve fire-fighting facilities in the future, the Investigation Committee does not intend to express its opinions for the time being, but awaits the Fire Department to automatically announce its improvement plan. The scope of fire-fighting is very large, and equipment, organization, command, training, etc. are all interconnected. After the Fire Department learns from the lessons of this fire, it is deeply believed that it will have new discoveries to seek improvement.

### "What Kind of Morality Can One Speak of in Shanghai?": Purpose of Inspection from Government Officials Focuses on Maintaining Security: Police Department Drafts Unified Inspection Methods

The Songhu Garrison Command has drafted uniform inspection methods in order to improve the method of inspecting hostels in Shanghai. Commander Xuan reviewed the measures a few days ago. According to Commander Xuan, all military police investigation offices and police departments can conduct hostel inspections to the extent of their powers. In view of current suggestions, unified inspections will be implemented in the future, and the methods will be announced in the next few days. The reporter asked what the purpose of hostel inspections was.  Is it to value morality over security?  Commander Xuan smiled and answered, "What kind of morality can one speak of in Shanghai today?" He said that the purpose of hostel inspections is primarily for security. In the past, many of the lairs for bandits in Shanghai that had been raided have been found to be hostel rooms, because it is easy to hide in hostels. Likewise, those who smuggle weapons and sell opium often hide in hostels. Thus, hostel inspections are an important task in maintaining security, and the inspection's focus is not as rumoured in valuing morality.

### Extraordinary Union: Li Shizeng Appreciates Trusted Friend: White Hair Ushers in New Groom

Bride Lin Susang Has Hair Adorned with Red Flowers, with a Healthy Countenance

Childhood Friend Presides Over Wedding: Congratulations on Producing a Gifted Son; Echoes of Laughter: Door is Filled with Happiness

[Reported by this Newspaper] Party stalwart Li Shizeng and Ms. Lin Sushan held their wedding at the "World Culture Cooperation China Association" on Lin Sen Middle Road yesterday afternoon. This pair of "Eternal Youth" in matrimony commenced their extraordinary union in a simple, grand, and warm ceremony. The small auditorium was packed, and the door was adorned with a congratulatory couplet written by Cheng Zhongheng: "Swear Together to Save the World, Sincere Love Will Rebuild the Home." The words "Mutual Aid" were written in the center of the auditorium. The groom and bride arrived by flower car at 4:30PM, and were surrounded by photographers at the stone steps at the entrance. The groom, in a long robe and riding jacket, was energetic, and the bride, with a red flower hairclip and cheongsam, had a healthy bearing and was always smiling. The wedding ceremony started shortly after, with Wu Zhilao as the officiator.

Wu Zhilao's congratulatory speech cited history and talked about the significance of marital union. His witty words drew applause from the guests from time to time. When he said, "Maybe you will have a son in the future," laughter echoed throughout the auditorium, filling it with happiness.  Finally, he hoped that the newlyweds could cooperate with each other to mutually benefit society.

The groom also said a few words. He said, "This wedding ceremony was originally intended to be very simple, but the skill of the journalists is too high, and it seems that there are so many guests here today, it seems not so simple after all. However, thank you all for coming to offer your congratulations. Thank you, thank you!"

Someone among the guests shouted, "Please ask the bride, Ms. Lin, to say a few words too," but that wish was not realized. The wedding ceremony ended amidst the murmuring of refreshments and conversations.

Mr. Li is currently seventy-eight years old. His original wife, Yao Tongyi, died of illness in France during the War of Resistance Against Japan. While in the United States, Mr. Li formed a relationship with an American Jewish woman, Mrs. Rousou, with whom he bonded as a result of intellectual pursuits. Upon returning to China, because times have changed, they could not live together, and their relationship came to an end last year. Ms. Lin Sushan is currently over thirty years old. Formerly the wife of Jiao Juyin, a drama producer who studied in France, this union with Mr. Li comes with the following explanation in Mr. Li's written statement: "Ms. Lin Sushan and her former husband were both colleagues who I have known for many years.  Last year, there were domestic changes, and I attempted to mediate to no avail.  I learned much about Ms. Lin in the process, and grew to admire her.  After she terminated her marital relations, Ms. Lin and I cooperated at the "World" publication, and together researched people's philosophies. We found that our beliefs and goals matched, and I saw her as a virtuous helpmate.  I thus seek to form a new family with her, with hopes of advancing social change.  No one can do this better than Ms. Lin.  Despite my being close to my seventieth birthday, she did not forsake me. After rejecting my requests on many occasions, she eventually agreed, saying sincerely: "I see you as a mentor, and do not think of anything else." I am extremely grateful for this.  Society and friends call her "Ms. Lin," and I will likewise call her "Mr. Lin." It's not only because of English lessons. Overall, our respect and mutual aid and love will be for eternity.  I dare to disclose this most sincere sentiment."

However, some tea seed stocks were obtained by brokers before the report, and it was unknown how to handle the situation. The association asked the Enemy Property Clearing Office for an explanation.

### A Merchant Fails in Speculation, Commits Suicide by Poisoning Regardless of Wife and Children

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wan Shuzi, a native of Hangzhou, who worked for China Lianyi Products Company, was over forty years old, married Zhong Qiwen, and had six children. Recently, she became pregnant again and was about to give birth. Shuzi had recently failed in speculation and was under severe economic pressure. He had the idea of taking his own life, so he went to room 421 of the Nanjing Hotel at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, he asked the waiter to estimate the price of the wine and drank heavily. The waiter did not suspect anything else. The next day, at about 12:00 noon, Wan had not yet gotten up. The day waiter went and knocked on the door but there was no response. He managed to open the door and saw the guest lying stiffly on the bed, without any sound. He touched him and found that he had already died. A suicide note was found on the table, and an empty bottle of poisonous juice was found in the drawer. He knew that he had committed suicide by poisoning. In his suicide note to his wife, Zhong Qiwen, he claimed that it was not his intention to resort to this strategy, and said: "Don't be sad after death, because leaving me will make it impossible for the family to do anything. I hope you will support the family for the sake of the children, and the future will always be good. I am naturally clumsy and cannot escape this harsh environment. The only way is to die.

After the hotel waiter discovered the case, he reported it to the Huangpu Branch, which sent personnel to investigate. The deceased's family was still well-off, but he committed suicide due to failure in speculation. Because the deceased's wife was pregnant and about to give birth, the body was collected by his younger brother Wan Xiaozhong after the autopsy.

### A Grand Gathering of the Legal Profession, Four Hundred Advocates Show Off Their Talents, Chen Tingrui, Jiang Pingfan, etc. Elected as Directors and Supervisors

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road, which used to be deserted, suddenly became busy yesterday afternoon. Almost all the lawyers in Shanghai were mobilized to participate in the members' congress that had been interrupted for ten years since the Anti-Japanese War.

One by one, the famous lawyers who are often seen in the newspapers appeared on the signature book, shaking hands, talking, and the whole place was filled with happy laughter. There were also more than twenty female lawyers. Chen Tingrui said with emotion: "We held a members' congress in 1937, followed by the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge. Ten years have passed in a blink of an eye. Today is the first grand gathering of the legal profession since the Anti-Japanese War!" Mr. Shen Junqiao shook his elderly head and said: "I entered the gate of the Lawyers Association, as if a married daughter had returned to her parents' home." Jiang Yiping came in, shaking hands one by one, the demeanor of a famous lawyer, after all, is extraordinary. The Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road is a building built by the members themselves. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was rented to Datong University as a school building. It was recovered after the victory, but the interior was empty. The chairs used for the meeting were borrowed from the Ningbo Fellow Association.

The Number of Lawyers in Shanghai Reaches Over a Thousand The association currently has 1,074 members, and more than 400 people attended yesterday (according to regulations, one-third of the attendance is enough to meet the quorum).

The meeting started at 2:00 PM. Chairman Chen Tingrui reported: "The Constitution has been promulgated, and China is on the road to the rule of law. Therefore, our responsibility as lawyers is even greater than before. How to promote the Constitution? How to promote the rule of law? How to improve the judiciary? These are all our future tasks. We must encourage each other and urge each other to complete this mission of the times." Then, Chen Su, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech. After Chen Tingrui reported on the association's affairs, the draft of the Shanghai Lawyers Association Charter was discussed. At this point, the members expressed their fierce debates, with sharp tongues and lips, nitpicking, and all the housekeeping skills were brought out.

The first controversial issue was the dispute between 10,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan for membership fees. The original proposal stipulated that members should pay a recurring fee of 10,000 yuan per friend. Qu Cheng thought it was too much and advocated 5,000 yuan. Jiang Yiping retorted: "Now it costs at least two or three thousand yuan to take a rickshaw once, so 10,000 yuan is really not too much." Qu Cheng retorted: "Now it costs tens of thousands to eat a meal. Should the membership fee also be set at tens of thousands?" Before the dispute was resolved, Cheng Yaojin came out halfway and felt that 10,000 yuan was still too little and advocated 20,000 yuan per month. The result of the vote was still to maintain the original proposal.

Collection of Public Fees Based on Index Another controversial issue was Article 27 of Chapter 7 of the original draft, "Remuneration," which was in the interest of all members, and everyone discussed it with great concentration. Bo Zhu and Zhou Hongji both believed that the amount set in the original proposal was too low. Jiang Yiping proposed to change "Remuneration" to "Public Fees." The result of the vote was to change it to "Members who are entrusted by the parties to handle litigation cases may collect public fees, the amount of which shall be increased according to the standard ratio of the 1937 cost of living index."

Gathering more than 400 advocates in one hall, everyone spoke at once, scrambling for the "microphone" under the stage, and the presiding chairman tried his best to control the order of the venue. Outside the window, the curtain had slowly fallen, and there were no electric lights in the hall on the third floor. A large gasoline lamp was temporarily hung up.

The result of the re-election of directors and supervisors was that twenty-one directors and seven supervisors were elected. Below is a list, and I will briefly analyze the systems to which they belong:

List of Newly Elected Directors and Supervisors Directors: Chen [illegible] Rui, Jiang Yiping, Zai Jimei, Zheng Lintong, Tang Juexian, Yu Enliang (above are from the Soochow University system), Shen Junru, Zhang Qiping, Zhang Zhiguo, Feng Song, Ju Jiansheng (law school system); Shan Yinghui, Wu Xiangxian, Han Xueyi, Zhang Guangzong, Wang Shanxiang (law and political science school system), Wang Jianduo, Zhou Kun, Chen Huapeng, Yin Yong (Chih Tze College system); Yu Zhongluo (Zhejiang Law College system). Supervisors: Jiang Pingfan, Xu Zhishen (Soochow University system); Qian Zheng, Wang Peiji (law school system); Wu Bianhua (law and political science school system); Huang Jiyuan (Chih Tze College system); Xu Zuoliang (Zhejiang Law College system).

It was already dusk when the meeting ended, and the lights of thousands of homes were lit. Everyone poured out, easily embarking on the journey home, and could not forget the sentence in their hearts: "The first grand gathering of the legal profession in ten years!"

### Nostalgic Film History

Special Article in This Newspaper

Every day, 300,000 people flock in and out of dozens of cinemas throughout the city. Movies have occupied the most important place in the entertainment life of Shanghai citizens. However, the establishment of cinemas and the formal performance of movies in Shanghai only happened within the first decade of the 20th century.

The predecessor of movies—lantern slides—was performed by Mr. Yan Yongjing in the Gezhi College in October of the eleventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, and the content was roughly some "World Compilations." Because it was amateurish, it did not have much impact.

In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu (1903), a Spaniard named A. Ramos brought a semi-old movie projector and several rolls of dilapidated films to Shanghai. He showed them in the Shengping Teahouse on Fuzhou Road, with some Indians shouting loudly at the door every day, and tickets were 30 cents per person. Years later, Mr. Ramos used the profits he earned to build a sheet metal movie theater on Zhabei Road, Haining Road (now Hongkou Grand Theater). The first movie he showed was called "The Dragon Nest". Later, he built the "Victoria Movie Theater" at the intersection of North Sichuan Road, Haining Road. The decoration and furnishings were relatively luxurious. This was the beginning of Shanghai having a formal cinema.

Due to the success of Mr. Ramos's operation, a Portuguese Russian named S. G. Hertzberg founded the "Apollo Movie Theater" on North Sichuan Road in the second year of Xuantong, competing with Victoria. In addition, a Westerner named A. Runiahn reorganized the Mingsheng Liyuan at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road, into the "Allen Movie Theater" (later renamed "New Allen", which was abandoned after the January 28th Incident). The Zhonghua Grand Theater on Qiujiang Road was also reorganized by Cantonese businessman Zeng Huantang into the "Shanghai Grand Theater", and the business was very developed. In order to compete in business, Mr. Ramos tried his best to set up cinemas in the city. The original site of the current Dahua Workers' Theater was the Summer Peacock Movie Theater operated by Mr. Ramos, which was very popular at the time. In addition, Mr. Ramos successively built the Empire, Carde, and Universal in the South, Central, and East districts. Mr. Ramos's manager, B. Goldenberg, also established the China Movie Theater on Wuzhou Road and the Republic Movie Theater on Fangbang Bridge. Mr. Ramos's power became increasingly strong. Therefore, some people still call Mr. Ramos the "Shanghai Cinema King".

In 1923, the "China Movie Theater Company" of Tianjin came to Shanghai to establish the "Carlton Grand Theater". At that time, its scale was unique in Shanghai. On February 9 of that year, it opened with the famous movie "Secrets of the Louvre", and the ticket price was as high as 2 yuan. Compared with the small movie theaters at that time, where you could watch a movie for eight or nine copper coins, it was naturally remarkable. After the opening, it was praised by the audience as the "No. 1 Cinema in Shanghai".

Following the Carlton, the "Audion Grand Theater" on North Sichuan Road was built by Chen Bozhao, the general manager of the Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, with his own investment. The layout was luxurious and could compete with the Carlton. Mr. Chen also operated the "Audion Film Company" to handle film distribution. Films produced by Paramount Pictures of the United States were managed by him, and his reputation greatly increased. Later, he built the "Broadway Grand Theater" in the East District and the "New Light Grand Theater" in the Central District. In 1932, Audion was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. At the same time, because first-class cinemas such as Nanjing, Grand Theater, Cathay, and Great Shanghai had been established one after another, New Light could no longer be the most powerful, and Broadway was even less significant. The golden age of Audion Film Company became a thing of the past.

### Palace of National Films

China's film production industry lags behind the cinema industry by about ten years. Therefore, in the very early days, cinemas only showed foreign films. In fact, when Victoria and the Embankment areas were popular, about nine out of ten cinema audiences were foreigners, and very few Chinese people went to see them. In the early years of the Republic of China, when the Chinese film production industry was just starting to flourish, most of the production took place in Shanghai. However, there were no large cinemas operated by Chinese themselves to show domestically produced films, so they had to rely on the Remas circuit of cinemas. At that time, the Summer Picture Palace did become the venue for the first runs of domestically produced films.

However, the interests of Chinese film production companies in Shanghai were controlled by Remas in every way, which inevitably had an impact. The production industry collectively sought ways to remedy this. Initially, they planned to unite the powerful production companies and lease all of Remas's cinemas, but this did not materialize due to disagreements on rental prices. In 1925, the Star Film Company proposed to operate its own cinema. They consulted with the Pathé Company and purchased the Shenjiang Cooperative Stage at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Yunnan Road, converting it into the Central Grand Theatre. From then on, Star had its own theater, and the outlet for its works was naturally no longer a problem. The other production companies, such as Shanghai, Lily, Guoguang, Great Wall, Shenzhou, and China, mostly gathered at the Central Grand Theatre. They had all suffered from the pain of foreign trust monopolies, so the Central Grand Theatre replaced the Summer Picture Palace as the "Palace of National Films," which was a major turning point for the film production industry. The opening declaration of the Central Grand Theatre also stated: "There are already many cinemas in Shanghai, so why add another one? There is a need, because the cinemas in Shanghai do not consider the interests of the Chinese people enough. We do not want foreigners to control the film industry too much, so we believe it is indeed necessary to add one."

This "Palace of National Films" did promote its mission in 1925 and 1926. Furthermore, due to the May Thirtieth Incident, the public's interest in foreign films also cooled sharply. The output of domestic films increased significantly, showing improvement. In March 1926, Remas, laden with the profits of his twenty years of operating a film business in Shanghai, returned to his home country. Star Company and others jointly raised capital to lease Summer Picture Palace, Victoria, Empire, Universal, and Carlton theaters. At the same time, they organized the "Central Cinema Company." Except for Summer Picture Palace, which was subleased to Mr. Owen Bahl, the owner of the Embankment, the rest were managed independently. Victoria was renamed "New Central." Later, it absorbed the China Peace Cinema. It promoted "advocating domestic films" and used the originally established Central Grand Theatre as its flagship theater.

Unfortunately, domestic films did not strive for progress. Films featuring gods and monsters, martial arts, and farcical stories flooded the film industry. These were crudely made and destroyed their own future. In late July 1926, the Central Film Company began adding European and American films to its screenings. Furthermore, because the architecture of its cinemas could not compare with newly built theaters, its position declined daily, and the film input also decreased. The rights to first-run domestic films shifted from "Central" to "New Light," and then from "New Light" to "Golden City." In 1936, the Central Cinema Company ceased operations. The theaters under its jurisdiction were all leased out separately. From its establishment to its closure, it lasted exactly ten years.

### ### Spring Dream in the Old Capital – Highly Popular

The topic still turns to 1926. During that period, a newly emerging cinema, the Beijing Grand Theatre on Beijing Road, was founded by the Yiyi Company. It used first-class equipment to show second and third-run foreign films. Moreover, it pioneered the addition of Chinese subtitles, making it easier for Chinese people who did not understand the plot to understand. Its business was very prosperous. After its renovation in 1930, it screened the first production of the Lianhua Film Company, "Spring Dream in the Old Capital," which was very popular with the audience. After that, the first-run screening rights in Shanghai for Lianhua productions were mostly held by Beijing Grand Theatre, until the completion of the Golden City Grand Theatre, at which point this exclusive right disappeared. It was rebuilt in 1934 and renamed "Lido," affiliated with the Lianyi Company, and continued to show Western films.

Shortly before the opening of the Beijing Grand Theatre, the Donghua Cinema, which is now the Paris, was also established on Lin Sen Road. In the decisive year, it was leased to the Peacock Film Company and renamed "Peacock Donghua." In 1930, the owner changed again, and the name of the theater was changed to "Paris."

Following Beijing Donghua, the Guanglu Grand Theatre, built on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, appeared as a first-class cinema. The opening film was "The Wandering Butterfly Harvester" (Ivan Mosjukine in "Casanova"). Initially, it specialized in screening European films, and its business was unfavorable. In 1929, it was taken over by the Far East Amusement Company, which installed a sound film projector and specialized in showing Paramount sound dialogue films. Its business was so good that it was the heyday of Guanglu. Later, it was subleased to British management. After the Cathay and Grand Theatre were established one after another, Guanglu's business suddenly suffered a blow. In addition, the United Film Company acquired Paramount's top-notch films at a high price, Guanglu became increasingly unable to support itself, and eventually went bankrupt. It was later acquired by the Lyceum Theatre and reopened, focusing on screening European films. After the Lyceum ceased showing films, Guanglu specialized in showing second-run American films.

### ### Former Site of the Grand Theatre – Carlton Dance Hall

From 1928 to 1932, the growth of cinemas was surprisingly rapid. In addition to second-class cinemas such as Donghai, Penglai, Shanxi, Guanghua, Mingxing, and Xihai, which were established one after another, first-class cinemas with great scale and excellent equipment, such as Nanjing, Grand Theatre, Cathay, and Grand Shanghai, were also built at this time. (The Grand Theatre is pictured on the right)

The former site of the Grand Theatre was the Carlton Dance Hall. It was built in the winter of 1928 and was a Sino-American joint venture. At that time, its position was not enough to compete with Carlton. In 1930, the Nanjing Grand Theatre, operated by the Nanyi Company, was built on Edward Road and began to overwhelm Carlton, Odeon, and Guanglu, which was then holding a seat. Its building adopted the "Renaissance" style, and the interior was equipped with winter heating and summer cooling. At the opening, the New York Daily News called it "America's Roxy." On New Year's Day in 1932, the Cathay Grand Theatre at the corner of Xiafei Road and Meyer Road opened with Norma Shearer's "A Free Soul." Its furnishings were magnificent, and it specialized in screening MGM masterpieces, thus adding another first-class cinema.

It is necessary to mention a "our country" person who joined British nationality, named Shi Lugen. He operated cinemas in various parts of China and managed the productions of foreign film companies. In 1932, he and Chinese and foreign tycoons launched the United Film Company, planning to acquire the city's first-class cinemas. The first step was to demolish the Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road and rebuild it, investing 1.1 million taels. The entire building adopted a modern three-dimensional style, and there were three fountains inside. The equipment also included air conditioning and RCA sound film projectors. When it opened in the summer of the following year with "Hot Blood," the whole city was overwhelmed. Lugen was ambitious. He used the Grand Theatre as the main force of the United Company. In addition to striving for perfection in the construction and equipment, he also lowered the seat prices, making it impossible for other first-run theaters to resist. The first to be affected was Guanglu, which was forced to close its doors. And Cathay, Carlton, as well as Paris, Rongguang, Shanghai, Mingzhu, Huade and other small and medium-sized cinemas also joined the United Company banner.

The Lianyi Company (formerly the Nanyi Company, formerly known as the Yiyi Company) was enough to confront the United Company. In addition to the Beijing Grand Theatre and the Nanjing Grand Theatre under its jurisdiction, it also took over the Grand Shanghai Grand Theatre in 1934. The Grand Shanghai was originally founded by the Rongrong Company, and its momentum was really prominent at that time. After Beijing was rebuilt as Lido, it specialized in acquiring the second-run screening rights for the films shown by Nanjing and Grand Shanghai.

It is said that Lugen's trust dream did not last long, only because all the equity was sold to the real estate of the cinema, and the operation was not good. The debt was so high that the creditors sued, causing the United Company to almost collapse. Fortunately, the measures were taken properly, and the storm did not expand. So he abandoned many small theaters and only operated Cathay and Grand Theatre, renamed "Guoguang Company." Until June 1938, because it was considered necessary for cinemas to organize a united front, it merged with Nanjing, Grand Shanghai, Lido, etc. to form the "Asian Cinema Company."

During the isolated island period in Shanghai, due to the development of the film business, about the Dahua Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road and the Majestic Theatre on Gordon Road were newly established. In addition, Huguang on Edward Road and Jindu on Fuzhao Road also competed with Golden City and New Light for the position of first-run domestic films.

As for the existing cinemas, including Dooly, there are already seventeen showing films in sequence. Among them, the Majestic, Grand Theatre, Keyes, and Nanjing theaters show works produced by RKO, Paramount, and Columbia. Dahua specializes in MGM productions, Grand Shanghai specializes in Shidianhua works, Golden Gate Paris shows Warner MGM, Yunguang New Light sometimes shows Universal works, Lyceum sometimes shows British films, and Dooly shows a number of Soviet films. In addition to being shown in Golden City and New Light, domestic films are also regularly shown at the Queen's Grand Theatre, which was converted from a Peking Opera theater. Because the output of domestic films is not large, almost all of them are American films. Please refer to page 12 of this newspaper for the names of existing cinemas. I have said too much, please forgive me for not going into details.

### ### An Episode – American, British, and Japanese Residents Engage in a Major Brawl

When the earliest cinema in Shanghai, the Hongkou Grand Theatre, opened, the films shown were all newsreels of the Russo-Japanese War. Most of the audience were British and American residents, who sat in the front row. The back row was full of Japanese people. When those British and American residents saw the Japanese's funny movements in the film, they couldn't help but clap and laugh. The Japanese people sitting in the back row became angry, and the two sides started a dispute, tearing off the wooden chair backs and using them as weapons, fighting until their heads were broken and bleeding, and the theater was in a mess.

### ### Nine Fifteen Club

Nine fifteen is exactly the time for the evening film screening. The "Nine Fifteen Club" is also a place to show movies. There are no daytime screenings there, only evening screenings, hence the name "Nine Fifteen Club."

This is a secret organization formed by movie fans. When Shanghai became an isolated island, the pressure exerted by the Japanese invaders on the concessions increased day by day. Many stimulating American films could not be shown in theaters. So many British and American movie fans formed a group to specialize in showing films that could not be seen outside. At this time, the Japanese invaders had not yet moved into the concessions, so this secret organization was able to stand firm.

The "Nine Fifteen Club" is located on the eighth floor of the Sassoon Building on the Bund of Nanjing Road, where there is a life-or-death place that can accommodate 200 audiences. It is stipulated that it will be shown twice a week, showing many very new films. Chaplin's The Great Dictator had already been shown there. This club lasted for two years, and it was disbanded invisibly after the outbreak of the Pacific War.

Majestic Theatre

The domestic film Iron Island with aviation as the theme was produced by the Lianhua Film Company before the war.

### ### The First Sound Film

Now that the general audience is tired of black and white films and vying to watch color films, recalling the era of silent films when they were only allowed to watch but not listen cannot help but make people laugh. When I was a child, sitting in an open-air cinema, watching the "Female Knight-Errant of the Desolate River" on the screen opening and closing her mouth, but not knowing what the "protagonist" was saying, that kind of wide-eyed, tongue-tied, itchy look always made me feel uncomfortable. Scientific progress is amazing. How long has it been, the screen has become so "colorful", and the film advertisements in the newspaper have discovered the words "fantastic atomic ten colors". Soon, in addition to "colorful", it may also add "having flavor".

Twenty-one years ago, on a hot evening in New York City, the world's first successful sound film, Warner Bros.'s "Don Juan," premiered! The music accompanied the performance of the picture (but the orchestra was not seen anywhere!). Don Juan on the screen would actually speak! From then on, the screen that had been silent for a long time would never be dumb again!

And it took another five years for sound films to be introduced to China and Shanghai cinemas began to show sound films!

The first Shanghai cinema to install the Photophone sound equipment was the Summer Picture Palace, the authority of cinemas in 1929. The first sound film to meet the Shanghai audience was "Captain Swagger". Relying on the advertisement of "exclusive screening of sound films", Summer Picture Palace dominated Shanghai for half a year. Soon, Grand Theatre, Guanglu, Carlton, Odeon and other cinemas installed sound equipment, and then, except for "Paris", which was once "a crane standing among chickens" and specialized in screening silent films, small and medium-sized cinemas also uniformly installed sound machines.

In fact, before the Summer Picture Palace screened sound films, there had already been two screenings of sound films with picture-side sound in Shanghai. Once in December 1926 and once in November 1928.

In the winter of 1926, the Shanghai Baixing Grand Theatre imported several De Forest sound short films from the United States and screened them in the theater for six days. The content was mostly music and dance tunes and short plays. During the screening, American technicians tried their best to explain the principle of picture-side sound.

Mr. Shi of the Education Department brought back a special Lai film projector in November 1928 and screened it on the 11th of that month. Most of the films shown were also short musical and dance films. The highlight was "Long Island Travelogue", the content of which was wonderful. There is a record of the reporter of this newspaper as the body:

"The train came from far to near, and the sound of the wheels also rose accordingly. When we arrived at Long Island, the rural scenery of Long Island was reflected one by one; the sound of children squeezing milk, the sound of birds, the sound of ducks, the sound of cows, the sound of dogs, and a little boy was awakened by a small flower dog outside the window, rubbing his eyes and crying. Ah, it's so wonderful!"

### ### Translation Breeze

Walking into a cinema showing Western films, most of the audience can't understand the English dialogue on the screen, which is inevitable regret. For this reason, film merchants have also racked their brains to figure out how to remedy this shortcoming. The solution is to install the "translation breeze."

Now, most of the larger cinemas have the equipment for the translation breeze. Each seat is equipped with a plug. You only need to rent that "no money electric earphone" style translation breeze, put it on your ears, and then insert the wire into the plug, and you will be isolated from all the sounds in the cinema, listening to the lady in charge of the explanation speaking fluent and clear Mandarin, translating the dialogue on the screen. In this way, the audience who do not understand English can fully understand the plot and the language of the characters. This method is naturally much better than adding Chinese subtitles.

The first cinema to use the translation breeze was the Grand Theatre, which began to install it in November 1939. This equipment was specially made for the Grand Theatre by the American manufacturer. The rental price was 10 cents per set, which was very cheap. On November 4, the Grand Theatre invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers to test the "Return of the Wonderful Man" film. The first application of the translation breeze was very successful and won unanimous praise.

Most of the ladies who are in charge of the translation breeze explanation are female students from church schools. They have a very good foundation in English, translate accurately, and speak fluently. When the female character on the screen starts singing, she will tell you to take off the translation breeze, and then your ears will change to another world, enjoying the melodious singing.

Renting the translation breeze is suitable for films with complex plots and lengthy dialogues. Song and dance films such as "Bathing Beauty" and "Every Night is Springtime" do not need the translation breeze at all. Even for scripts with relatively simple plots, you can understand them even if you don't understand English, because if you wear the translation breeze, you can't enjoy the music and other things that should be "heard" on the screen. As for renting the translation breeze to watch "Fantasia", that's even worse!

### ### Small Pickups from the Film Industry in 1946

The film scene last year had the following characteristics:

A large number of color films were imported;

Thigh song and dance films such as "Bathing Beauty" are very popular with the audience;

Films based on World War II, using "espionage", "anti-aggression" and other themes are particularly numerous;

Western films flooded the film industry, and there were few domestic films;

Scalpers were rampant.

Among the biopics, "The Great Dictator", "The Story of Emile Zola", "The Light of the Nation", and "Madame Curie" are pretty good. What is worth mentioning is that cartoon master Walt Disney gave us a lot of good works: "Dumbo", "Victory Through Air Power", "Bambi", "The Three Caballeros", and "Fantasia", etc.

Among Western films, American films account for 95.1% more. British films account for only 0.4%, and the rest are Soviet films.

Among domestic films, most of them use "anti-Japanese war" as the theme. Among American films, there are also many films such as "China Shall Rise" that use "Chinese anti-Japanese prosperity" as the theme, but it is a pity that it is a bit "scratching the surface", and perhaps the actual situation in China was ignored when directing, but they just praised themselves, so in many films, I can't find a good one.

"The Dangerous Curve", "Endless Spring", "Desperately Attacking Women", "Fierce Fighting", "Aerialist", "Stereoscopic Bombing", "Nazi Tycoon Sexily Bewitched, Spring Boudoir Young Woman娇滴滴", "Dangerous Scenes More and More Ruthless", "Dazzling and Charming", etc.

Oh, how grand! Oh, how grand!

### The Authorities are Determined to Stabilize Food Prices and Sell as Much Stocked Siamese Rice as Possible

Mayor Wu's Handwritten Order to the Police and Social Bureaus: Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding and Price Manipulation

The problem of food rice is becoming serious again. The Social Bureau aimed at the opening of a red disc on the Shangxuan-Yihong board. Siamese rice was sold one after another. Up to Saturday last week, 42,550 zu were sold in a week. However, due to the rising news from the production areas such as Su, Xi, and Chang, the Taishi rice merchants took the opportunity to act, causing the long-term stable grain prices to fluctuate sharply in the past week. By the close of the market on Saturday, white japonica suddenly hit 90,000 major points, creating an unprecedented new record for rice prices. Although yesterday was Sunday and the market was closed, some retail stores privately raised the future price to 100,000 yuan, and some retailers even regarded the stored rice as a rare commodity and refused to sell it. Mayor Wu was furious when he heard the news. Yesterday, he issued an emergency handwritten order, ordering the Police and Social Bureaus to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter. If the above-mentioned situation is found, it will be punished as a crime of hoarding people's food during an emergency period and sentenced to the extreme penalty. He also sincerely expressed to reporters that the government has a major determination to stabilize food prices and stabilize people's livelihood. The recent rise in rice prices in this city is purely due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. The government has decided to focus on reality and do its best to stabilize food prices. The people of Tairen have already settled with the Shanghai Rice Storage Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. Starting today, Siamese rice will be sold without restriction. Those who illegally hoard and manipulate grain prices will be punished with the extreme penalty and will not be tolerated.

President Song is Concerned about People's Food

President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen expressed great concern about the sharp rise in rice prices in Taishi. He specially summoned Mayor Wu yesterday morning and ordered him to be responsible for suppressing the prices, and urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Food, ordering him to assist the Shanghai Municipal Government in implementing measures to stabilize food prices.

The Ministry of Food Sells Siamese Rice

In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities specially sent Section Chief Ji of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau to visit Director Ye of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food to discuss measures. It was decided to sell the third batch of 95,000 bags of food rice shipped from Siam on the 24th of last month at 65,000 yuan per stone as much as possible in the market to suppress the rising trend. It is also heard that the fourth batch of foreign rice will also arrive in Shanghai one after another.

The Social Bureau Implements Price Limits

Yesterday was Sunday, and both the North and South Rice Markets were closed. The prices of white japonica sold by rice shops varied greatly, exceeding the price limit greatly. It is reported that the grain management section of the Social Bureau has been ordered to implement the price limit order. In addition to sending personnel to the rice market today to supervise transactions, personnel will also be sent to various districts to inspect the door-to-door sales of rice shops. All rice shops should mark the rice prices uniformly. Those who do not mark the rice prices, arbitrarily raise prices, and hoard a large amount will be severely punished.

### Rationing of Cooking Oil Has Reached More Than 3,000 Piculs

As of yesterday, a total of 3,960 piculs of cooking oil had been rationed, with each household only receiving one barrel each of soybean oil and sesame oil. The price of soybean oil was 180,000 yuan per picul, and the price of sesame oil was 165,000 yuan. The office also stipulated that all retailers who fail to collect the oil after being notified twice will have their eligibility for rationing canceled.

### Suppressing the Market Price of Flour Rationing of Foreign Flour Starting the Day After Tomorrow 320,000 Bags Still Rationing Domestic Flour Today and Tomorrow

Flour is one of the main people's food. In the past few days, due to the high price of flour, various flour-made foods have also risen in price, which has greatly affected the livelihood of ordinary people. The municipal authorities have agreed with Fuxin, Maoxin, Huafeng, Fufeng, and other five major flour manufacturers that 12,000 bags will still be rationed every day at a price of 25,000 yuan per bag today and tomorrow. Starting from the day after tomorrow (i.e., the 5th of this month), the Central Trust Bureau and the Ministry of Food will ration foreign flour (i.e., Lilang flour). There will be 160,000 bags of this foreign flour, and the combined domestic flour will reach about 320,000 bags, which will be rationed to retailers and can be rationed until the end of next month. Because the black market price of flour has soared recently, in order to prevent the flour bran guilds that operate this low-priced rationed flour from taking advantage of and engaging in fraudulent activities, the authorities have decided to closely monitor the rationing situation so that the commercial firms that actually operate flour-made foods can generally purchase this rationed flour.

### China Petroleum Corporation: 80,000 Tons of Oil Ordered; Tanker Company to Send Ships Mid-Month

Due to the insufficient allocation of coal from various coal-producing regions transported to Shanghai by the Fuel Management Committee for general manufacturers in the city, gasoline is being used as a substitute to compensate for the shortfall. According to sources at the China Petroleum Corporation, the number of those applying to purchase gasoline from the company has been increasing monthly. Last month, 60,000 tons were allocated. Among the oil wells located in various regions, Gansu accounts for the largest portion, comprising 70% of the national output. The quality of the oil extracted is relatively poor. The original plan was to transport it via the Longhai Railway to Taiwan for refining. However, certain sections of the Longhai Railway are difficult to repair and have not yet been fully connected, so the plan has not been implemented. All crude oil produced is used locally. However, our country's consumption of various fuel oils is very high. If foreign merchants are allowed to freely transport and sell oil in China, not only will our rights and interests be lost, but it will also be difficult to control. In light of this, the company has decided to form the China Tanker Company to purchase oil directly from Iran. It is currently negotiating favorable terms with the British-Iranian and American-Iranian oil companies through diplomatic channels, and some progress has been made. Once the source quantity and other necessary procedures are completed, the tanker company will be notified to proceed with loading. The tanker company has a total of 22 tankers, including four of 10,000 tons each and eighteen of about 1,000 tons each, all of which were purchased from the United States last year and are being held in custody by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The tanker company will initially take over three ships, which will be refurbished before sailing to Iran. It is understood that 80,000 tons have already been ordered from the American-Iranian oil company. The three tankers taken over will make their maiden voyage and are scheduled to depart in mid-month. In the future, the company will coordinate with the Ministry of Communications regarding the domestic oil transportation, providing convenience during transportation to achieve the goal of combined water and land transport, ensuring speed and safety along the way.

### American Industry Representatives Oppose Lowering Tariffs

[United Press, New York, 1st] Representatives of various American industries have expressed their opposition to the authorities' reduction of import tariffs on certain commodities or raw materials. They have provided numerous opinions for reference when the State Department conducts trade agreement negotiations in the future. Those who oppose tax cuts fear that government officials will use the power granted by the previous Congress to allow a 50% reduction in many existing tax rates. Representatives of paper manufacturers, textile merchants, chemical raw material companies, optical glass and glass sand manufacturers, and spokespersons for various other industries have personally provided opinions to State Department officials. Merchants selling imported goods and manufacturers using imported raw materials have proposed tax cuts. Economic scholars generally dare not speculate on the outcome of these tax cut proposals in the United States Congress, but Republicans hold a majority in the United States Congress for the first time in ten years. The current power to reduce taxes was granted to the President by a majority vote in Congress by the Democratic Party.

### Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Merchants Prohibited from Selling Untaxed Tin Foil

The Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Trade Association, citing telegram No. 00596 from the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, which stated that the sale of smuggled Shaoxing tin foil by soldiers and private individuals had been repeatedly reported to the Ministry of National Defense for thorough investigation and handling. As Shanghai is a major distribution area for smuggled Shaoxing tin foil, it is necessary to strengthen inspection work and dispatch capable personnel to key smuggling routes to work with the military and police to strictly intercept smugglers. The association is also strictly instructed to prohibit foil shops in the city from purchasing smuggled goods and to manage them properly to ensure effective enforcement. The Bureau had previously received confidential reports that some cigarette, soap, and candle merchants were purchasing and selling smuggled tin foil for profit. It had requested that the association be informed that they should not privately purchase untaxed tin foil in a letter (沪税字第4167号). Therefore, in light of the previous situation, in addition to dispatching capable personnel to work with the city's military and police to strictly intercept smugglers and strengthen inspections, this letter is being sent to the association, hoping that it will strictly restrain its members to abide by the regulations, eliminate the purchase of smuggled goods, and avoid violating the law and being prosecuted. The Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Trade Association, upon receiving this instruction, immediately sent a circular to its member merchants to comply with it.

### Small Hardware Rising Steadily

Among hardware products, 于絛 [translator's note: literal translation is 'Yu Tiao', unknown hardware product] initially weakened but then rose due to new arrivals. Since the beginning of the rise in sandpaper, it has been rising steadily, about 50% to 60% better than last year. Sundry goods such as door locks and drawer locks are also very popular, but wood screws and window hooks have risen little.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Actively Restoring Pre-War Sugar Production

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is actively repairing sugar factories and railways in Taiwan in order to restore pre-war sugar production. Equipment needed to repair the railways has been ordered from the United States and is expected to be fully delivered between June and July this year. It is expected that all repairs will be completed and ready for use by November. It is understood that before the railways are repaired, sugarcane from the sugarcane-producing areas cannot be transported to the sugar factories for sugar production. Moreover, sugarcane takes two years to mature. During the Pacific War, sugarcane fields were severely damaged, resulting in a severe shortage of production. Therefore, the amount of sugar produced since the victory until the spring of last year was only 80,000 tons. The amount of sugar produced from last winter to this spring is only about 30,000 tons. Now that the fertilizer problem has been solved, the production of sugarcane is expected to gradually increase. It is estimated that after the railways are repaired by November this year, the amount of sugarcane transported will increase to 3 million tons, and the amount of sugar produced from this winter to next spring is expected to increase to 300,000 tons. If sugarcane production increases smoothly and the plan proceeds as desired, the company's annual sugar production is expected to reach 500,000 tons. According to reliable estimates, the current national consumption of sugar is 100,000 to 200,000 tons per year. If transportation is restored in the future, consumption will increase to 300,000 tons. Therefore, the sugar produced in Taiwan is sufficient to meet the national consumption and more. Currently, the company's sugar reserves in Taiwan are regularly maintained at around 120,000 tons. It is responsible for allocating 2,000 tons of sugar per month to the more than 7 million people in Taiwan Province. The company's sugar reserves in Shanghai are also regularly maintained at around 50,000 tons. Since the establishment of the Shanghai company in May last year, it has allocated about 50,000 tons of sugar. The Shanghai company allocates sugar every Thursday. Last year, a total of 29 allocations were made, and four allocations have already been made this year. The first allocation was 48,350 bags, the second was 9,050 bags, the third was 27,200 bags, and the fourth was 31,150 bags.

### Bartering Coarse Salt to Japan Will Not Affect Consumption

Opinions Expressed by Responsible Person of China Trust

[Reported by this newspaper] Chemical industry giant Li Zhuming telegraphed the Central Government on the 21st of last month, opposing the bartering of large quantities of coarse salt to Japan. He argued that Japan has always been self-sufficient in salt for its people's food, agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and mining. The current request for the supply of coarse salt is purely for the production of alkali. Providing it in large quantities would be tantamount to cultivating Japan's entire chemical industry. A reporter inquired about this matter with the Central Trust Bureau. According to a responsible person of the Bureau, while Mr. Li's opinion is not without merit, it is an exaggeration to say that providing coarse salt would cultivate Japan's entire chemical industry. We should pay attention to two points regarding this matter. First, our country barters coarse salt to Japan purely to exchange surplus salt for urgently needed goods from Japan. Therefore, supplying Japan with salt will definitely not affect our people's food and industry. Moreover, bartering must be carefully considered based on urgency and importance. Coarse salt is a surplus product in our country, while transportation equipment and industrial and mining equipment are urgently needed. Exchanging these for each other cannot be said to be ill-conceived. Second, Japan is currently under the control of the four powers, and everything is centrally planned. If the four powers do want to cultivate Japan's industry, then supplying coarse salt would also be part of the overall plan and cannot be said to be inappropriate. If the four powers do not want to cultivate Japan's industry, then this coarse salt will not be used to develop Japan's industry. Therefore, what we should pay attention to is the issue of Japanese control, and we do not need to be overly concerned about the quantity of goods bartered between China and Japan.

### Apple Orchards in the Gaiping and Xiongyue Areas Will Be Abandoned

### Local Goods Transshipped Through Hong Kong Exempted from Import Permits; Customs Adjusts Ship Tax Rate

### Asian Students' Association to Hold Conference in Mid-August; Our Representatives to the Preparatory Meeting Have Returned to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Our country's representatives to the preparatory meeting of the Asian Students' Association, Chen Yi and others, returned to Nanjing on the 30th of last month. The team leader, Ms. Li Mange, is still on her way via Hong Kong. The preparatory meeting of the Asian Students' Association was initiated by the All-India Students' Association last year.

### Private Primary and Secondary Schools Advocate Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff

75% of Tuition and Fees

The issue of tuition fees in private schools has recently attracted considerable attention from society. The person in charge of the board of directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation issued the following statement yesterday: This resolution from the principal's meeting, which passed a high tuition fee of 120,000 yuan for primary schools, 170,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 220,000 yuan for senior high schools, plus miscellaneous fees of up to 40,000 yuan for primary schools and up to 80,000 yuan for secondary schools, is truly a last resort due to the recent increase in the cost of living. It has been submitted to the Education Bureau for record-keeping. At a time when the social economy is exhausted, there are quite a few students from poor families, and the treatment of public school teachers is meager, so their children should also be given preferential treatment when enrolling. Therefore, methods for students to receive free or reduced tuition have been stipulated, the main points of which are: (1) Students applying for free or reduced tuition must have passing grades, be from poor families, and submit an application form. (2) Children of public school teachers can be exempted from half of the tuition, and those from poor families can be exempted entirely. (3) All schools must approve the applications of students in the above two categories. (4) If the number of free tuition slots exceeds 20% in primary schools and 15% in secondary schools, please request subsidies from the government. According to the third provision, all students from poor families who have passing grades can enjoy preferential treatment for reduced or free tuition. In areas with poorer economic conditions, tuition fees should be lower, and the number of free tuition slots should be more than in other areas. In order to maintain the economic balance of students, it is necessary to request subsidies from the government. Although the fourth provision has not yet been approved by the government, it is hoped that all schools will adhere to the spirit of "education for all" and expand the number of free tuition slots as much as possible, so that no student will be deprived of education due to the inability to pay tuition fees. As for students who are unable to pay tuition fees at once, the schools originally had a plan for installment payments. The allocation of school finances is in accordance with the regulations for primary and secondary schools and the orders of the Education Bureau, with 70% allocated to salaries for teachers and staff. In recent years, teachers have lived in poverty, and many schools have increased the salaries of teachers and staff to 75%, with some exceeding 80%. This semester, all schools should still adhere to the principle of 75%. Miscellaneous fees and tuition fees are combined for allocation, and finances are open to the public, which has been repeatedly resolved. Last semester, thanks to the hard work of teachers and the assistance of parents, the effectiveness of training and education in private schools in this city has improved, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide encouragement.

### School Building of Mingde Primary School Forcibly Occupied by Landlord

The private Mingde Primary School was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. It was originally located on Xietu Road. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the original site could not be used for classes. In August of the 27th year, the entire downstairs of Gu Pingfang's house at 157 Yaozhu Road was rented as a school building. At that time, a two-year contract was signed. Later, both parties agreed not to sign a contract for a fixed period, and it became an indefinite lease. Since the school opened and classes have been held there, eight and a half years have passed. All has been well. Unexpectedly, late at night on the 28th of this month, the Gu landlord took advantage of the winter vacation when teachers and staff returned home and the school workers were asleep, and led a group of people to break into the premises, forcibly throwing desks and school supplies out of the classroom, tearing up the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the national flag, and arbitrarily moving his personal furniture into the classroom. The head of the school heard the news in the morning and went to negotiate, but was met with insults due to the disparity in numbers and strength. He reported the situation to the Xujiahui Branch of the competent police station, requesting an investigation into the truth and ordering the police to protect education and maintain public order. Currently, the classrooms, etc., are still forcibly occupied by the Gu landlord, and the head of the school is appealing to all sectors of society.

### Morale is Low, Young Generals Suffer Setbacks - Jewish Team Defeats Longjie Yesterday - Jewish Team Performs a Major Revenge with a Score of Five to One

[Our newspaper] In the Group A football league, Longjie played against Jewish again at Yiyuan Stadium at 2:30 pm yesterday. There were more than 4,000 fans. It was quite lively. As a result of the battle, Jewish won Longjie with a score of five to one. In the first half, Jewish took the lead with a score of two to zero.

Jewish Team Scores Successively

Longjie attacked first, and Jin Lusheng was first thanked for being hugged by McNiti, escaping the danger. Fan Shuai You Dehua had a tacit understanding with the two wings and attacked Longjie's hinterland. Zhao Yongfang blocked the way. Zhou Yongjiu escaped for a quarter of an hour. After 18 minutes, Mai Lvxi got the ball and passed it to the center. Edward went with the flow and went straight to Longjie's door. The foot was slightly worse and was passed to the left by the goalkeeper, but Que Bisiqi flew a kick on the cold road and made a contribution. One to zero, Jewish team opened the record first. Longjie lost a city painfully and joined forces to counterattack, but Jewish defense was extremely strict and did not take advantage of it. After 28 minutes, Edward re-entered and followed suit, but Que Siqi hurried to kick it again, scoring twice, two to zero, Longjie lost another city. At this point, Longjie's formation shook, and the hinterland was allowed to be ravaged by foreign soldiers. At the end of the first half, Jewish took the lead with two to zero.

Morale is Low, Longjie Suffers Setbacks

In the second half, Longjie transferred troops and launched a large-scale attack. After seven minutes, Jin Lusheng went straight along the edge and stopped to hook. The landing point was excellent. Gu Dirong was about to rush to the goal. McNiti turned over like a pigeon and pounced on the ball. The camera was extremely exciting. Jewish Wuji Tailai saw rampant again. Edward went straight in with a single knife. Zhou Yongfang came to seize him head-on. Edward flew up his left foot and went like a meteor. Sheng Peter could not save him and dedicated another city. Three to zero, Jewish arrogance became more and more intense. Longjie's defenders were unusually hard. After 15 minutes, Gu Dirong had a chance to shoot, but it was too late. Xue Pan Siting flew to the left to clear the siege, but the ball happened to fall at the feet of Tao Tingfu, and he passed it to the center in one fell swoop. McNiti stepped forward slowly, intending to get the ball. Unexpectedly, Lin Shaojun killed him on the cold road and the top blossomed. Three to one, Longjie broke the duck egg, but the world was already set. Longjie's morale did not improve. After 20 minutes, Jewish Sitolun shot fiercely at the goal post and bounced back, but Que Bisiqi caught up with a kick and hit again, four to one. Longjie was fundamentally shaken and was taken advantage of by Baojie. As a result, it became a five-to-one situation. Longjie lost again and again. Zhou Yongfang was high-spirited and acted rudely. He deliberately fouled twice and was sent off the field. The two sides fought until the end of the game.

### Mourning the Tennis Artist Xu Chengji

— Our Newspaper Archives

Xu Chengji, the tennis master who died of illness in London a few days ago, was the first Chinese athlete to show his power overseas. Mr. Xu is an overseas Chinese in Uwa, Java, Dutch East Indies. He is only thirty-four years old this year. He has been fond of tennis since he was a child, and his skills are quite impressive. He once won the All-Java tennis championship. On National Day in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the 5th National Games was held in the capital. Mr. Xu represented Batavia's overseas Chinese and returned to China to participate in the tennis tournament. Although the team was defeated by the Shanghai team in the semi-finals, Mr. Xu became an instant hit and maintained his undefeated record in individual events. In particular, his victory over the veteran Qiu Feihai was deeply appreciated by the audience. Mr. Xu was only twenty years old at the time.

First Time Participating in the Davis Cup

After returning to the south, Mr. Xu worked tirelessly and his ball skills progressed rapidly. Because he and Zheng Zhaojia were selected at the same time as representatives of China to attend the 1935 Davis Cup tennis tournament, unexpectedly, the first battle encountered a strong enemy, the United States. The main general of the United States was Boqi, who had won the Wimbledon World Tennis Singles Championship (Note: Boqi had already switched to professional tennis). Mr. Xu met a strong enemy for the first time, but he was still able to display his superb ball skills. The score was: four-six, one-six, eight-six, two-six. Mr. Xu failed but was still glorious.

After that, Mr. Xu's technology advanced by leaps and bounds. The beauty Carson, who had held the Shanghai singles championship for several years, was determined to humiliate our country's players. Mr. Xu defeated her several times and won back honor for the Chinese people. In the 24th year, the 6th National Games was held in Shanghai. Mr. Xu still represented the Java region and attended the games. He won the National Tennis Singles Championship and cooperated with his younger brother Chengwei in doubles, winning the runner-up (Note: The champion was Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai group.), becoming China's first national player.

China participated in the 1936 Davis Cup tennis tournament, still attended by Mr. Xu and Mr. Zheng Zhaojia. As a result of the draw, they first met France, the overlord of the European region, and unfortunately lost.

In the 1937 Davis Cup tennis tournament, China's representatives were Mr. Xu and Cai Huiquan. They first met the New Zealand team. Mr. Xu won both singles games with his strength. Due to Cai's weakness, they were eventually eliminated with a score of two to three. However, international comments believed that the Chinese representatives' ball skills had improved significantly, and this was a "glorious failure." Mr. Xu was even listed as a world-class player.

Wimbledon Tennis Championships

In the same year, Mr. Xu participated in the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships for the first time and was selected as a seeded player. He won three consecutive singles games and reached the stage of the last thirty-two players. He advanced to the fourth week and lost to American master Mei Gu in a four-set drama. Mr. Xu also cooperated with Swedish player Xie Luote in doubles, and his record was not weak. In addition, Mr. Xu participated in various championships in various European countries and won nine championships in twelve games, defeating British and Italian first-class players Austin Stephen Hughes, etc. French celebrity Bulunong was also defeated by Mr. Xu twice in straight sets. Mr. Xu once participated in the Birmingham Catholic Church tennis tournament in the UK and won the championship for three consecutive years, and then was able to enjoy the championship forever.

The British Dunlop Rubber Company is a world-famous manufacturer. In addition to its car tires, which are famous internationally, the tennis balls it produces are sold overseas. The person in charge of the company, in view of Mr. Xu's widespread reputation, invited Mr. Xu to make a world tour to promote it. Mr. Xu was the first Chinese athlete to receive this honor.

The Sino-British Marriage is a Legend

On January 26th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu and Miss Qin Bao'erfu, a British tennis player, were married in London. The marriage of Chinese and British tennis celebrities was a legend for a while. Miss Bao'erfu's father once served as a judge in Ceylon.

At the beginning of the war, Mr. Xu worked for Batavia's British Dunlop Rubber Company. After the Japanese invaded, he was imprisoned and neglected to practice. Last year, he was assigned to be a Davis Cup player in China. With a score of four to one, Denmark was eliminated in the preliminary round. Mr. Xu was the main player of our team. In the finals against Belgium, Mr. Xu took both singles games with his strength. Due to the weakness of his teammate Cai Huiquan, the result was a failure with a score of two to three. In last year's Wimbledon tennis tournament, Mr. Xu reached the third week before being eliminated.

According to tennis experts, Mr. Xu is unanimously recognized as a world-class player, but due to physical limitations, he cannot create a more complete record.

Meritorious Sports Ambassador

Mr. Xu was at a young and promising age, and the Chinese people had deep expectations for him. The bad news came, and people were extremely shocked!

Last year, Mr. Xu gave a speech to a reporter from the Associated Press in London, explaining the shortcomings of the tennis world in our country. It is a lack of new talents. He said, "Our biggest need is new equipment. For many years, there has been no real grass tennis court in Shanghai. We even have to use old balls and discarded rackets for matches." This last word, at least, the person in charge of the sports authorities in our country should remember!

Mr. Xu has left us, but the glory he has earned for China will never be forgotten by every compatriot. We must use the most meaningful actions to commemorate this meritorious "sports ambassador", not tears, no wreaths, we should find ways to create and produce a second Xu Chengji!

### Tiger Head - Snow Exploration

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua

Nanjing, January 31st, Quick Report

Zhou Ni Fohai, pre-signed "Ten Years Later, Zhen Zhiwo", "and Made a Submission"

Luo Ni Junqiang, self-proclaimed as "Spokesman", talks about "Political Rest"

On the day when Chang Zhou Ni Fohai was sentenced to death, the reporter climbed onto the prison car to visit Zhou Ni when he was being escorted back to Tiger Bridge Prison. At that time, he sighed and said, "My death was destined on the day General Dai Yunong died. Today's judgment in the Great Success Hall is just a public announcement, and of course there is nothing rare." With the mood of "Fate is doomed, I don't know me", and signed the seven characters "Ten Years Later, Zhen Zhiwo", this can also be said that a person is about to die, its appropriate also "sad" bar!

### A Paper Submission in Illness - Lamenting That Wangdao Cannot be Separated from Human Feelings

One afternoon, with clear weather and the sun about to set, stepping on the muddy road after the melting snow, I walked into the Tiger Bridge High Court Detention Center, took out the card, and met Director Wan, explaining the intention of visiting Zhou Ni Fohai. After Director Wan asked Zhao Dean for instructions, he agreed in general. When the reporter entered the detention center, the prison doctor Wen Fengnian was diagnosing Zhou Ni's illness, using a 100CC syringe to inject a special injection for heart failure. After half an hour, the medicine was completely injected into the muscles. According to Dr. Wen told the reporter: Zhou's life is difficult to preserve, and death is possible at any time. Ordinary people breathe 26 to 32 times, and the pulse has reached a maximum of 132 times, and a minimum of 98 times, with "stoppages" sooner or later. The current injection is just to maintain the status quo. Since the disease is so serious, it is impossible to meet and talk. Instead, he was seen crouching in the quilt from that narrow rectangular hole, looking very desolate.

A prison officer told the reporter: Yesterday morning, Zhou Ni used Western-style letter paper to personally write a submission, saying: "I have been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court, and the execution will be sooner or later. I have long put my personal life and death aside, but I cannot but comfort my family. Wangdao is nothing more than human feelings, and I beg you not to limit the date and number of meetings with my family, I am very grateful." The following signed "Zhou Fohai" three characters, which was personally presented by himself. After the reporter inquired, this request for "Wang these are nothing more than human feelings" is still placed under the glass plate of the director's desk. Although it has not been officially promised, it always gives him more convenience. So these days, his wife Yang Shu is certainly going to meet him one after another. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00, his wife and his daughter Hai went to meet him again, but Zhou unexpectedly complained a lot. "What are you doing here? What else can you talk about? Hurry back for me, I know everything myself, you don't need to worry!" His wife heard the scolding and cried non-stop. Hai was also crying bitterly beside him. Zhou Ni quickly said, "What's the use of crying? I don't care about dying, you go!" Speaking of this, "Although Zhou Ni was calm, he could not help but show his love for his children and shed two lines of tears." Chen, the prison officer, also told the reporter that when he was first taken in, his temper was extremely presumptuous, and no one could suppress him, but recently he has been much more peaceful.

### Luo Junqiang Self-Proclaimed as Spokesman - Peanuts Treat Reporters

Since Zhou Ni is already in a terminal illness, and the visit is useless, did the reporter come here for nothing? Then, visiting the next Ding Ni Mocun Luo Ni Junqiang is naturally the goal of the visit. The reporter stood in front of Gate No. 4, Zhou Fohai's shop was on the right, Luo Junqiang's shop was on the left, and Mo Cun's shop was facing the gate. When Ding Ni spoke, he always let out a treacherous laugh of "Haha". Luo Junqiang stated in a clownish posture: "You want to see Zhou Fohai, I can represent him. If you have anything to ask, ask me. I used to be Mr. Zhou's Secretary-General, and now I am still the Secretary-General. We have been together for more than a year, and we have talked about everything we want to talk about. And I can guarantee that there is no secret at all. I am the spokesman of No. 4, every sentence is loyal and will never lie." Seeing that the reporter had not had time to ask, he said a preface first: "We spend the whole day here chatting and reading books. Mr. Zhou mostly reads foreign magazines." Luo Ni also said that being in prison is a "pleasant" thing. After using "political brains" for decades, it is good to have a chance to "rest" at this time. However, it seems "sad" in spirit. Speaking of this, he also took a square tea iron can of Taipingchun from the side of the shop, poured out a pile of Qingdao peanuts and said to the reporter: "Today is my very simple execution, next time you come, I will execute you in the same way." He laughed very proudly, and he also told the reporter: "My wife sends me food every day, so life is not hard." The reporter took the opportunity to ridicule and said: "Husband and wife were originally birds in the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes." Then, your wife is very good: "That is "disaster strikes in a pile". He laughed, and the reporter chased after him and said, "The three words in a pile are not very good!" He was busy adding the two words "spirit".

### Ding Mocun Feels He Has Nothing to Say: "Already Lost Gambling Capital"

At this moment, Ding Di approached, bringing with him a tone of "repentance," saying, "I am indeed a character who has lost his gambling capital. What is there to say now?"

Finally, the traitor Luo wrote two poems: "Fallen blossoms are not heartless things; they turn into spring mud to nourish the flowers," and "Renouncing worldly affairs and finding fame in the mountains is fortunately achieved early; what other method could I leave for this life?" In the letter slot near the bed where the traitor Zhou slept, the reporter discovered a string of one hundred and eight Buddhist beads, and immediately asked, "Does Zhou Fohai recite Buddhist scriptures?" The traitor Luo said, "His wife gave them to him." At the same time, there was also a copy of the "Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra" in the letter slot. The conversation lasted for quite some time, about forty-five minutes. Walking out of the detention center, the electric lights on both sides of the road had already lit up, and the cold wind was still blowing fiercely.

### Land of Ziyang

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Yu Ning Po

Wuyuan, 18th Day

Encroaching on three hundred miles of Hui and Rao, equally dividing the sources of Wu and Chu;

White clouds have feet, uniting heaven and earth; distant waters are waveless, reflecting the sun and moon.

Ming Dynasty Wang Xun's poem on Zhang Mountain

The above poem expresses the height and greatness of Zhang Mountain, straddling the Wu and Chu dynasties. It not only serves as an outer barrier for southern Anhui but also nurtures many specialties and the scholarly atmosphere of Ziyang culture.

Perhaps many people are unfamiliar with the name Wuyuan County. Today, the reporter might as well provide a detailed introduction to this place's mountains, waters, people, products, transportation, and other aspects:

Wuyuan is located on the border of southern Anhui and northern Jiangxi. It is the hometown of Zhu Xi, the master of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism, and the late railway engineering master Zhan Tianyou (styled Chuncheng). It used to be under the jurisdiction of the old Huizhou Prefecture in Anhui Province. In the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], it was placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province to facilitate bandit suppression. Surrounded by towering mountains, both the county seat and the villages and towns are tightly embraced by green mountains. The Suhang area has many water towns, but this place is the opposite, with more mountains than water, fully demonstrating the characteristics of benevolence and longevity. Residents mostly engage in farming and trade. The houses in the villages are mostly built of brick, rich in splendor and antiquity. Each village, surrounded by green water and green mountains, has extremely secluded and beautiful scenery. However, each village inevitably shares its space with farmers. The houses of farmers, merchants, and gentry are like a mixture of three-part soil. Therefore, it does not lack the same elements of beauty and ugliness as other places.

Mountainous Transportation, More Land than Water

Wuyuan is located in the upper reaches of the Poyang Le River and is also the source of the Qianpei and Xin'an Rivers. These are all waterfalls from Zhelong in the north of the county, dividing into north and south streams. Therefore, this mountain is also called Zheyuan Mountain, which is historical proof that the Zhe River originates here.

The entire territory has only two major rivers in the northeast. One originates from Tan Gongling in the eastern township, passes through Jiangwan, Wangkou, Cikeng, and reaches Wukou, a total length of sixty-five li. The other originates from Zheyuan Mountain and Dadu Mountain in the northern township, passes through Shicun, Mangguan, Fengshan, Luowen, Qinghua, Longteng, Sikou, and reaches Wukou, a total length of one hundred li. From Wukou, the two northeastern rivers converge, pass through the county seat, Taibai, and Xincun, and enter Dexing, with a total length of more than one hundred li. This is the main route for Wuyuan to directly reach the Le River and Poyang, facilitating water transportation. Boats can pass through both rivers; the northern river reaches Qinghua from the county seat, and the eastern river reaches Jiangwan from the county seat. The southwestern regions are mostly creeks that can be crossed with a single reed.

The land and water transportation in all four directions is connected to Xiuning and Qimen in Anhui to the north, Kaihua and Changshan in Zhejiang to the east, Dexing and Leping in Jiangxi to the south, and Fuliang and Jingdezhen to the west. Except for the Dexing-Leping route, which is navigable, all other routes are dry roads. The thoroughfares within the territory are all paved with complete bluestone, exceptionally wide and flat. The famous educator Huang Yanpei once visited this place and praised it as a great road construction project, rarely seen in the country.

After the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the highways built in this county and neighboring areas include the Jing (Dezhen) Wuyuan Hua (Bu) in Zhejiang Province, the Wuyuan Shuai, and the Xing (Guo) Wuyuan Tun (Xi) (Anhui Province), and the (Xi) Wuyuan. During the War of Resistance against Japan, these lines were dismantled due to military reasons. In the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], because many goods from the inland of Jiangxi Province were transferred through Hekou and Tunxi, a handcart toll of one cent was charged from Hekou directly to Tunxi through this area. However, this route has never been used by vehicles after its opening. Now, it is overgrown with weeds and covered with sand and stones, becoming a slippery and difficult shortcut.

### Beautiful Mountains and Waters, Endless Artistic Inspiration

There is no place in Wuyuan without green mountains. This statement accurately reflects Wuyuan's identity. Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, and the scenery here is similar. The mountains in Sichuan are numerous, tall, and sturdy, with dangerous and rugged shapes. The mountains here are not as high but more gentle and beautiful, with mist-covered peaks and endless artistic inspiration. Moreover, there are green mountains everywhere, with green water surrounding them. The joy of benevolence and wisdom is available for appreciation. In spring, the pines are verdant, and the mountain flowers bloom vividly. In summer, the halls open to the green fields, and a cool breeze arises. In autumn, the green streams and red trees are perfect for setting a small boat adrift. In winter, there are wax-like elephants and silver snakes, and solitary fishing on the cold river. The scenery is different in the four seasons, and the joy is endless.

The above four seasons are the general scenery of this place. The most prominent and outstanding scenery includes the clouds covering the sea at Gaohu Mountain, the view of Poyang Lake from Zhang Mountain, the wondrous scenery and fairy traces in Lingyan Cave, the Shao She Terrace in Fengshuitan, the Immortal Cow gazing at the moon in Dongbin Temple, the auspicious clouds over Hongbing in Zhu Zi's hometown, the jade belt waterfall in Zheyuan Mountain, the embroidered water and autumn waves in Xitouxi, the Longxi Pavilion in Changtan Village, the arrowhead cliff in Hongyuan Village, the mirror reflection in Furong Peak, the high pool of Shixia, the snow appreciation in Tianxiang Pavilion, the cloud viewing in Shi'erguan, the nine bends of Yanyuan, and the hundred-li flower bridge. These are all scenic lines of Wuyuan, either famous for their people, secluded, or shaped like objects, or outstanding and supernatural, containing wonders and beauty, each with its own natural beauty.

The Qingguang of the Current Affairs Daily News, which carries people to travel in Guangxi, brings all beautiful mountains and rivers, making people fascinated. If Mr. Wang Jiyuan were to travel here, the reporter would expect that what he brings back would be no less than what he gained in western Guangdong.

### Three Treasures of Local Products: Tea, Fish, Inkstone

A product called a treasure naturally has differences from products of the same kind. I will write about them below to show the advantages of the word "treasure."

Zhang Mountain Cloud Mist Tea

The name of the tea is Cloud Mist, so its value is known. About seventy li from the county seat in the vicinity of Jihe Township in the north of the county, there is a great mountain called Da Zhang Mountain, which surrounds several tens of li, spanning the three counties of Fuliang, Xiuning, and Wuyuan. The broad and lush greenery is as high as the clouds. Tea trees are planted on the plains on the top of the mountain and on the slopes, and the annual output is huge, which is a major source of income for mountain farmers. The tea produced in the mountains is very different from the tea in other places. The leaf surface is pure green, and the back is light yellow. One leaf clearly shows two colors. Each leaf is covered with small holes like transparent gauze, but none of them are pierced through. When drinking, use boiling water to brew it. The tea infusion is slow to come out. Although the color is clear and not green, the taste is especially sweet, rich, and mellow. Taking one leaf of Zhang tea and comparing it with a pinch of tea from other places, the taste can be slightly better with less. Compared with Longjing in Zhejiang and Wuyi in Fujian, it is no less. The most precious of the Zhang Mountain tea is the Cloud Mist Tea on the cliffs of Bagua Peak. Because the mountain peaks are like Lushan, whose true faces are not seen for years, and are often shrouded in clouds and mist, the tea industry is full of the fresh air of dew and mist, so the leaf body is thick and white, showing silver hairs, and the taste is bitter and deep with a faint fragrance. When brewing in a teapot with boiling water, cover it for a while. When opened, a stream of white air rises, circling like clouds. The tea is named Cloud Mist, hence the name. This tea is very rare in production, and only a few are grown on the cliff waist. Mountain people picking tea leaves are like the people of Borneo picking swallow nests. They use long ropes to tie wooden chairs, and two people pull the ropes from the ends. People sit on the chairs and are slowly lowered from the top of the cliff. At the tea spot, they pick and prune the branches, and after harvesting and roasting the leaves, they only get about a catty of tea. They pack it carefully and give it to good friends. The rarity of the material makes it precious and worthy of respect.

Longxi Peach Blossom Fish

The fish is named Peach Blossom, which can be as endearing as the vegetable name "red in snow." This fish is produced in the Longteng River in the northern township of this place. The fish is less than an inch long, with a large head and a round body. Because it has several red lines on its belly, resembling peach blossoms, it is named Peach Blossom Fish. Every year in early spring, when the apricots bloom and the peach blossoms are budding but not yet in bloom, the fish gather in groups in the shallow waters between the sand and rocks, scattering and hatching with the waves. Because of its small body, it is invisible when viewed from afar. At this time, fishermen tie grass nets and drag them along the sand. They fish all day long and get at most a few ounces of fish. Then, they bake them dry with gentle heat and store them in tin utensils. After a certain number of days, wait for the heat to subside and soften, take it and soak it in a little soy sauce, and the taste is surprisingly fresh and delicious. It can eliminate food and stimulate the appetite.

There are two places where Peach Blossom fish are produced: one is Longteng in the northern township, and the other is Wangkou in the eastern township. Both villages belong to the Yu family, but Longteng is superior to Wangkou. The most peculiar thing is that the fishing period for this fish is at most ten days. After this, there will be no harvest. This is because the fish gather in groups when the peach blossoms are budding. When the flowers bloom, they scatter when they see people.

Wuxi Longwei Inkstone

The inkstone is a kind of mineral. The Yellow Emperor used jade as an inkstone sea, which is well known to the world. There is not just one kind of inkstone material. There are crystal inkstones, iron inkstones, copper inkstones, magnetic inkstones, bamboo inkstones, and other kinds of names. Among the inkstone materials in our country, the Duan stone from Zhaoqing, the She stone from Huizhou, and the Cheng mud from Haozhou are the most suitable. Since then, the Duan, She, and Cheng inkstones have become popular in the world, especially the Longwei stone of the She inkstone is the most precious.

The world only knows that She inkstone is produced in She County, Huizhou, but they don't know that it is produced in Longwei Mountain in Wuxi, eastern township of Wuyuan. The hermit Ougeng, a native of Xin'an, said in his bamboo branch poem: "The inkstone is named She, but She does not have it. The Longwei Mountain source is in Wuxi. The mountain originally belongs to Zheng Prefecture and governs She. The inkstone is still named She: the name is confusing." Looking at this poem, it is enough to prove the origin of the inkstone. Su Dongpo's Song of Longwei Inkstone said: "Yellow jade and white amber, heaven does not cherish, but fears that greedy men will die with a piece of jade in their arms. Look at Longwei, isn't it an inkstone material? Jade listens to the golden sound, dwelling in stone. Making stone with heaven has not been long, making inkstone with man has not been long. What does Bao and Xie's poetry have to do with stone? The pen drops, and Zhong and Wang's inkstone knows nothing. The brocade fungus and jade box are covered with dirt. What about the practice of supporting the bed with a branch? Moreover, how can Su Zi's Phoenix Pearl inscription be compared to the playful words made after the cow? The blue sky shines on the water, and the wind blows the clouds. The bright window and large desk are clean and free of dust. I was born between heaven and earth as an idle object. Su Zi is also a shattered person. Grouped words and fine words are not chosen. Spring worms and autumn snakes are painted at will. I wish to follow Su Zi to old Dongpo. The benevolent do not need to create distinctions." Old Su's song again proves the preciousness of She inkstone. Wuyuan produces inkstone in fourteen pits: (1) Longwei Mountain, (2) Luowen Mountain, (3) Meizi Pit, (4) Jinxing Pit, (5) Bili Pit, (6) Shuixian Pit, (7) Shui Jue Pit, (8) Xitou Pit, (9) Ye Jiu Pit, (10) Lu Pit, (11) Jiyuan Pit, (12) Lingyan Pit, (13) Mashi, (14) Zaoxin. There are three grades of inkstone stone: (1) Longwei, (2) Luowen, (3) Meizi. The stone quality of these three kinds of inkstones is generally strong, lustrous, and good at producing ink. It is more expensive if it has gold stars and the spots are bright and distinct, shining like gold powder. The best is shaped like a dragon's tail, called the Longwei Jinxing. The next best is scattered like flowers and plants. Inkstones with gold stars are generally green. In addition to the gold stars, other patterns are like reed flowers, or like woven silk, or like eyebrows, or like brush threads. The patterns are all white, vaguely like silver. The above inkstones are all moist, clean, and delicate, can store water without losing it, produce ink like oil without sound, stop the ink and float, protect the brush and increase its beauty, and the sharpness does not dull after long use. Scholars all cherish it.

The Longwei inkstone was opened in the Southern Tang Dynasty and closed in the Northern Song Dynasty. According to ancient legends: When opening the pit to take the inkstone, the county magistrate diverted the stream to absorb all the water to take it. Most of the ones that were harvested were of the highest quality. The magistrate ordered the villagers to confuse the wind forever and then directed the stream back to its original path, so the water was too deep to recover. After many years, the mines have disappeared. In the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], Chen Diaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the five-province preparatory army for bandit suppression, was stationed in Wuyuan. Hearing that the local area produced inkstones, he searched for the oldest people in the village, inquired about the source of the inkstones, and offered 2,000 yuan in cash, ordering them to explore the source. In the end, they found nothing.

A worldly rare treasure of civilization has been buried underground for a long time, not for the use of the world, which makes people feel the same way as Li Guang!

### Modern Gold Rush: Special Plane Crashes in Hong Kong, Gold Scattered All Over the Mountain

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zi Jian

Hong Kong, January 26th Air News

Over the past month, the "disaster star" of aviation has appeared above major airports around the world. As this "disaster star" circled the earth, it passed over Hong Kong several times. Shanghai station had an accident first, and the Philippine station had an accident later. Hong Kong people were full of the thought that "luck" was on their side and they might be able to escape the great calamity. Unexpectedly, the "disaster star" came again and again, and the Hong Kong airport was inevitably listed as one of the disaster-stricken places in the world: a special plane carrying gold worth one and a half million US dollars came to Hong Kong from the Philippines on the 25th. When it was only separated by a high mountain and could see the Kai Tak Airport, the clouds and fog obscured the vision, so it crashed into the mountain. As a result, gold coins flew with the sky, the plane caught fire, and the crew died. The "disaster star" left Hong Kong with a contented smile.

In today's world where the world is plunged into "aviation disasters," another plane crash naturally deepens the stimulation of human nerves. It just so happens that this plane was not carrying passengers, but weighed two and a half tons and was divided into more than fifty boxes of golden and white objects. In a society where human life is like grass, it seems to be even more shocking. The deaths of those four crew members can truly be considered "dying for gold"!

That was a C-47 transport plane. Before coming to Hong Kong, it had already had an accident in northern Philippines, but luckily it landed safely. However, those gold coins seemed to attract heaven's jealousy. A special "disaster star" was sent to follow it, determined to "get it" and then be happy. Therefore, when it approached its final destination, it was difficult to escape the calamity. The weather on the 25th was clear and bright in the morning, and the air was clear. It happened to be the fourth day of the first lunar month, and there were many tourists in Hong Kong, which was very lively. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, dark clouds blew in from outside the sky, and the air pressure dropped suddenly. Before long, clouds and fog piled up on the mountain, and drizzle fell. At this time, the "disaster star" appeared over Hong Kong. The gold-carrying plane of the Philippine Airlines just happened to fly near Shau Kei Wan in eastern Hong Kong. The "disaster star" cast its spell, and the smoke and fog were hazy. The pilot's vision was lost. In the blink of an eye, (2:02 p.m.) the plane crashed straight into the mountain, which was 1,734 feet above sea level! The point where the plane collided was only 50 feet away from the mountain peak. If it had been flying a little higher at the time, this misfortune might have been avoided.

After the plane crashed, it was impossible to find out where it fell that night due to the bad weather. It was not discovered until about 9 a.m. on the 26th. Therefore, police officers and bank magnates rushed to the accident site by car. The gold carried by the plane was worth 15 million US dollars, valued at 60 million Hong Kong dollars. However, one said it was only worth 20 million French currency. According to the investigation, it is known that it belonged to the Shanghai HSBC Bank, Belgian Bank, Chase Bank, American Express Bank, Bank of East Asia, Salt Industry Bank, and Bank of Communications. In addition, a part belonged to a few merchants. After a close search by the police, two-thirds of the gold has been recovered. It is said that some of the gold coins were scattered in the sky when the plane exploded, and some of the gold bars were melted by the fire. Continuing the search may lead to further discoveries. Readers, close your eyes and imagine: a mountain is covered with gold coins, some people are concentrating on digging beside it, some people are holding short guns and watching beside it, some people are worried about calculating the search results, and outside of the living, there are half of the wreckage of the plane, four unfortunate "dying for gold" people burned black. What a scene that is! That is "gold" and not "people." Why did they "send their lives" to Hong Kong in such bad weather? That explanation reveals a corner of the irrational phenomenon of this society! On the same day, the China Airlines plane flying from Hong Kong to Chongqing had another accident, but it was carrying "people," not "gold," so the public's reaction to it seemed much fainter!

### WEEKLY FORUM MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE XISHA ISLANDS

— Huang Qiang

Recently, newspapers have reported that the Chinese and French authorities are in dispute over the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands. After our country recovered them from the Japanese, French warships sent troops to land, which is both bizarre and serious. I served in Qiongyai three times in the years 1921, 1928-29, and 1936-37, and I know a lot about the situation of these islands. I will outline it below to inform the people of our country:

(1) The History of the Xisha Islands and the Japanese Management: The islands are our country's southernmost territory, and they are recorded in history books and annals. They have long been a place for fishermen from Hainan Island to fish. There is a lonely soul temple on Wushang Island, which was built by them, and its age cannot be determined. In 1921, Ikeda, the director of the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau, and others, used He Ruinian in the name of the Xisha Islands Industrial Company to secretly request the government to handle various matters such as reclamation, mining, and fisheries on the Xisha Islands, and ordered the Yai County to issue a land reclamation certificate. At the same time, they also applied for Fushui Island outside Changjiang Port to start fishing and reclamation. In fact, the operator was the Nanxing Industrial Company organized by the Japanese. Due to opposition from all parties, the original case was revoked in the spring of 1928. At that time, I was the Chief of Staff of the Guangdong Southern District Rehabilitation Office. Because the case had been revoked, it was urgent to continue the operation, so in May, I submitted a request to the provincial government to send the Hairui warship to conduct an investigation, and the county prepared all the business. In addition to sending several surveyors from the Rehabilitation Office, the Guangdong Construction Department sent a technician, and Zhongshan University sent a professor, etc., a total of more than 20 people, to the islands to conduct investigations and designs. According to their subsequent investigation, a Japanese diary was found on Lin Island, which showed that Taiwanese and Ryukyuans had died on the island as early as 1919. The company had laid wreaths to commemorate them on July 14, 1925, which clearly recorded the matter. It can be seen that the Japanese had been managing Xisha Islands for a total of nine years. In addition to the lonely soul temple built by Hainan fishermen on the island, which is six feet high, there are also buildings built by the Japanese, including an office and living room for managers in the southwest corner of Lin Island, which is 63 feet wide and 18 feet deep. Behind the office is a food and sundries storage room, which is 66 feet wide and 24 feet deep. To the left of the office is a small shop, which is 24 feet wide and 12 feet deep. To the left of the small shop are two workers' dormitories, which are L-shaped, each 90 feet long and 15 feet wide. In front of the dormitory is a workers' dining hall, which is 48 feet long and 15 feet wide. In front of the small shop is a cooking room, which is 30 feet long and 18 feet deep. Nearby is a kitchen, which is 20 feet long and 12 feet deep. Next to it is a well, with a water pump installed next to the well, and a huge water pipe connecting to the water storage pool behind the office and the pump in front. There are four water storage pools of different sizes for storing rainwater. The small pools are made of old iron plates, about four or five square feet. The large pools are made of cement, each 12 feet long and wide, and 6 feet high. When it rains, the water from the roofs of all the houses flows into the pools. The distiller is installed on the beach, and behind the machine is an iron workshop, which is 24 feet wide and 12 feet deep. The roofs and walls of the buildings are made of zinc sheets, and some are made of wood or branches. In addition, there is a chicken farm on the left side of the storage room, and a warehouse on the right side, which is 228 feet long and 48 feet wide. There are still 1,500 tons of island guano stored in it. There are also several cans of machine oil stored in the forest dozens of feet away. In addition to the factory buildings, there is also a light railway five miles long, with several branches along the southeast coast into the forest. The main line passes through the warehouse to the iron bridge of the dock. The length of the iron bridge is more than 1,250 feet, the width is 10 feet, and the height is about 17-18 feet. The horizontal wooden beams of the bridge deck are all made of American redwood, a total of 629 pieces. As for the items left on the island, there are two electric boats, two large and small barges each. Stored in the storage room and workers' dormitory, there are dozens of hoes, more than 100 bundles of bamboo baskets, dozens of large-mesh iron sieves, dozens of trolleys, dozens of large rattan baskets, dozens of bamboo hats, more than 100 pairs of straw sandals, about 100 bags of cement, and several cans of carbonized fuel. The blacksmith's tools and kitchen utensils are generally in good condition. It can be said that the Japanese worked hard to manage Lin Island, and all kinds of facilities are very complete, such as offices, storage rooms, dormitories, dining halls, warehouses, railways, freight yards, bridges, wooden boats, electric boats, trolleys, rattan baskets for transportation, hoes, baskets, nets and sieves for mining, all are complete. There are water storage pools, distilleries, wells and springs to supply drinking water, food storage rooms, pigsties, chicken coops, fishing boats and vegetable gardens for food, a small shop to supply daily necessities, and a doctor to treat diseases, so they can operate safely for several years and pack up and leave.

(2) The Value of Island Products: Our country's territory in the tropics is only this small area of more than ten miles. It is known that guano fossils must be produced in the tropics, so the phosphate ore in the Xisha Islands can be said to be the only product in our country's territory. Our country is based on agriculture, and this natural fertilizer is of great benefit. In addition, coral reef stones can be used as lime and transported to the mainland for construction and soil improvement, which is widely used, and the rich marine products are gathered in one place, which should have great business value.

(3) The Situation After 1928: After this investigation, a plan was drawn up to operate mining and fishing, and it was decided to set up a meteorological station and a lighthouse as soon as possible. Later, due to the Guangdong coup, the central government could not intervene, and Guangdong Province had no time to take care of it, so it was abandoned. In 1936, after the unification of the southwest, the French government, fearing that the South Pacific would be occupied by the Japanese due to the rampant encroachment of Japan in Northeast and North China, used the "Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi" in the history of Annam as an excuse, which stated that a certain emperor had sent people to Huangsha Island to establish successors and fish, and demanded that our country cede the islands to them. Our government naturally refused according to reason. In 1939, when China and Japan were in the midst of a fierce battle, France sent troops to occupy them. When the European war broke out, France was defeated, and Japan took over. It is not necessary to discuss whether Huangsha Island is the Xisha Islands, and how can a few words be considered Annam territory? The Japanese applied to our government for mining, reclamation, and fishing on the island, instead of applying to the Vietnamese authorities, which is ironclad evidence in the international community that it belongs to our country's territory. Moreover, before and after the Japanese undertook the project, the French government did not say a word. It was not until 1936 that they proposed it to our government. It is speculated that their initial intention was, as mentioned above, due to the South Pacific security issue, knowing that our country could not defend it, so their occupation could make Japan afraid to act rashly and prevent it from taking it by force. However, when the European war broke out, they could not protect it either, and it was finally taken away by the Japanese. Today, we have recovered our original land from the Japanese, which is really a matter of course. The French's unwarranted contention is something we never dreamed of.

(4) The Xisha Islands and Our National Defense: Our country's rejuvenated navy must of course use Yulin Port on Hainan Island as one of its naval ports. The Xisha Islands are a barrier to Yulin, and can also be said to be the outpost of the navy. In the event of a Pacific war, they can also be used as a base for submarines. The sea area at the eastern end of the islands is also an important route for ships traveling between China, Japan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia.

(5) The Location and Topography of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are located between 15 degrees 46 minutes and 17 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, and 110 degrees 14 minutes and 112 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, about 145 miles southeast of Yulin Port in Hainan. They are the southernmost territory of our country, starting from Beisha Island in the north, ending at Nanji Island in the south, bounded by Linkang Island in the east, and connected to the Qizhou Ocean in the west. There are more than 20 islands, reefs, and beaches of various sizes, scattered on the sea surface, covering an area of about 200 square miles. They are a group of low islands formed by coral reefs, which the Westerners collectively call Paracels. The eastern area is called Amphitrite by Westerners, and the western area is called Chroissant. The islands are mostly ring-shaped or elliptical. The larger ones are dozens of square miles, and the smaller ones are less than one-tenth of a square mile. The area of Lin Island is 1,500,100 square meters, Shidao Island is smaller, with an area of 68,750 square meters, Dengjinyu Island has an area of 432,500 square meters, and the area of Qundao Island is also small, with an area of 76,250 square meters. Among the famous islands, Shidao Island is the highest above sea level, about 15 meters high, and the others are only a few meters high. The tops of the islands are all relics of coral and other animals. The edges are higher, and the middle is lower, like the inner basin of ordinary coral reefs. There is also a small lake in Dengjin Island. These are the conditions that have been surveyed on each island.

(6) The Geology and Soil of the Xisha Islands: The Dingsha Islands are composed of coral polyps and other animal remains. In the past, the sea level was higher, and corals formed ring-shaped reefs in the water. As the sea level dropped, the reefs were exposed to the sea surface, and the corals died away from the water, thus forming the shape of today's islands. Other various mollusks, such as cephalopods, gastropods, and bivalves, as well as echinoderms such as sea cucumbers and sea lilies, and crustaceans, are all part of the composition of the islands. In addition to the hard coral remains and various shells, there are only guano and guano fossils accumulated on the islands, which are gray on the surface and millet-colored inside. This is the so-called phosphate ore. The soil in the islands is all formed by the weathering of coral and shells, so it is mostly fine sandy soil and gravelly sandy soil. At first glance, it looks like quartz, but it is actually the debris of coral and shells weathered. It contains a lot of lime and is rich in salt. For example, the water in the small lake in the eastern part of Tangwu and the well water under the coconut trees in the south are salty. The pineapples and coconuts on Lin Island also have little sweetness, which are all proofs that the soil contains salt. Lin Island is a gathering place for birds, and the soil contains the most bird droppings. Generally speaking, the trees and forests on each island have been growing for many years, and their roots, stems, branches and leaves have rotted into humus everywhere. Therefore, the soil on Gu Island, except for the barren white sand accumulated by the sea, is dark brown and black between the forest land and grassland, and is unusually soft and fertile.

(7) The Climate and Sea Currents of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are located in the middle of the tropics, with a hot climate. The lowest temperature on the thermometer is above 70 degrees. It is generally a marine climate, with no severe cold or heat throughout the year. However, the direct sunlight at noon makes the temperature higher. There are often showers throughout the year, with mostly southerly winds. The temperature difference between 6:00 am and 2:00 pm in a day is often more than ten degrees. The average temperature in January, the coldest period of the year, is above 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average temperature in summer, the hottest period, is between 80 and 90 degrees. The air pressure is high and the wind is strong in winter, and the air pressure is low and the wind is gentle in summer and autumn. This is based on observations on Lin Island. The rest is not very detailed, but it can also be known in general. The sea currents along the coast of the South China Sea cannot be uniform due to the depth of the ocean, changes in air pressure, and differences in wind direction. The frequency of their occurrence is also quite different. The sea currents in the Xisha Islands are irregular and often change with the wind direction. The southwest water flow caused by the northeast wind from October to the end of April is larger and more constant than the northeast water flow caused by the southwest wind from May to October. The speed of the water flow is the fastest in December and January, with a speed of one nautical mile to one and a half nautical miles. The water flow in the middle of the islands is also different from the east and west sides. Near Lin Island and Shiwu on the east side, there is often a water flow from west to northwest, with a speed of two nautical miles, and there is also a very slow water flow from the east. Near Ganquan Island and Jinyin Island on the west side, there is also often a water flow from west or northwest, and there is also a northeast water flow from time to time. The complexity of this is due to the location relationship and the uncertain wind direction, which causes this irregular phenomenon.

(8) Transportation and Products of the Xisha Islands: The Xisha Islands are still in the South China Sea. The area east of Linkang Island is an important defense line for navigation between Hong Kong and the South Seas Islands. The area west of Jinyin Island is a thoroughfare for transportation between Annam and Hong Kong, and it is also a route for travel between Europe and Asia. Its position is very important and can be used as a base for our country's deep-sea fishing industry. Because the island has no residents and is full of reefs, there are no harbors to dock ships, and no high mountains to shield against wind and waves. There are hidden reefs around the coast, which are too shallow close to the shore and too deep far away. It is impossible to find a suitable anchoring position. The island surface is very low and difficult to see from a distance. The wind direction is uncertain, and the water flow is changeable. Sometimes there are hurricanes. Without buoys, lighthouses, meteorological stations, and radio stations, it is extremely dangerous to navigate near the island during the spring mist or bad weather. Looking around, the sea and sky are boundless, but only a few fishing boats from Sanya and Yulin are lonely wandering among the islands. It is about 240 miles from Shuwu Island to Haikou, about 9 miles from Shuwu Island to Lin Island, about 24 miles from Lin Island to Linkang Island, about 40 miles from Lin Island to Dengjinyu Island, about 13 miles from Dengjinyu Island to Jinyin Island, and 145 miles from Jinyin Island to Yulin Island. The islands have many products. They are classified and described as follows:

(1) Animals: The Xisha Islands are famous for producing guano. These guanos are excreted by white-bellied boobies, a species of booby family. White-bellied boobies mostly grow on tropical bird islands and live in flocks. Their eggs are slightly smaller than chicken eggs, with mottled brown color. The chicks have pure white feathers, and the adult birds have gray-black feathers with white bellies, green beaks and red feet. Their meat tastes inferior and is not for consumption. Lin Island and Xiao Lin Island are the most inhabited, and they are also often seen in Jinyin Island. In addition, there is a kind of petrel, which is very small in number. Among the mammals, only Lin Island has many rats. There is a kind of lizard among the reptiles, which can be found on Lin Island and all the islands. There are also many insects such as butterflies and moths, but there are no poisonous snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, ants, flies, etc.

(2) Plants: There are not many kinds of plants on Gu Island. Generally, they are common in Sanya and Yulin on Hainan Island. There is a kind of Sanya tree among the trees, which is three or four feet high. They are very lush on Lin Island and Yu Island. Shrubs belonging to the Euphorbiaceae and Moraceae families are all available, as well as Abrus precatorius. Among the weeds, there is a kind of Dentate class and a kind of Gramineae class, and two kinds of Portulacaceae class. There are several coconut trees on Lin Island and Zhang Island, and three palm trees on Coral Island, all about ten feet high, which are enough to be the symbols of the island. The growth of plants on the other islands is roughly the same, but Nanji Sand Island is still mining.

(3) Minerals: Since the Xisha Islands are composed of coral, there are no other minerals except sand and gravel and sea island guano. The phosphate ore formed by guano and guano fossils has two colors and shapes. The powdered ones are millet-colored, and the ones that are solidified into blocks are millet-colored inside and gray outside. The distribution status is that on Lin Island, it forms a layer covering the surface, with an average thickness of 25 centimeters. Each block weighs about several catties to dozens of catties, and there are rarely very large blocks. Underneath is white sand. This kind of bird droppings layer is the most abundant in Yaolin Island, followed by Shidao Island. The rest of Dengjin Island, Zhang Island, Jinyin Island, Coral Island, Linmen Island, Shuwu Island, etc., also have a small amount, but there is no mining value. According to the measurement results, the storage amount on Lin Island is that the area occupied by island guano and fossils is 1,291,600 square meters. Since the average thickness of the ore is 25 centimeters, its volume is 322,900 cubic meters. Among this volume, the volume occupied by plant roots is about one-tenth, so the volume of phosphorus ore is actually 290,610 cubic meters. According to the capacity of the ore-loading handcart on the island, the volume of each cart is 0.065 cubic meters, and the ore-loading weight is half a ton. In this way, the total amount of ore on the island is 223,550 tons. The area that has been mined by the Japanese accounts for about 280,000 square meters. Calculated by the same method, the amount of ore mined is 48,500 tons. Then the amount of ore on the island, excluding the mined ones, is still 175,050 tons. This is the current storage amount of Lin Island alone. The use of phosphate ore is mainly as a soil cultivation material, because the phosphorus, potassium, etc. contained in it are all needed by farmland. If new chemical methods are used to separate and package the phosphorus content, the benefits will be even greater. When the Japanese recruited workers to mine, each person mined one ton of island guano per day and was given two yuan, and transported it to Osaka. After dissolving and mixing, each dan was worth more than 20 yuan, so you can know its benefits. The following is a copy of the composition of the two types of fertilizers A and B published by the Osaka Fertilizer Manufacturing Plant in Japan for reference: (1) Main components in the percentage of type A dissolved and mixed method: total nitrogen content, 6.00, ammonia, 4.00, total phosphoric acid content, 8.30, water-soluble phosphoric acid, 5.50. (2) Main components in the percentage of type B dissolved and mixed method: total nitrogen content, 3.00, ammonia, 2.60, total phosphoric acid content, 15.00, water-soluble phosphoric acid, 11.00, total potash content, 1.00.

(4) Aquatic Products: In the shallow sea around each island, there are seaweed, kelp, seagrass, sea sponges, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, corals, butterfly snails, clams, cuttlefish, coconut crabs, sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, fish, shrimp, grouper shellfish, etc. Fishermen from Hainan mostly catch and pick up shellfish, and they get a lot. The large ones are three or four feet in diameter and weigh more than 100 catties. Shellfish are extremely beautiful, and their shells are about two or three inches long. Fishermen dry them and regard them as scallops. There are also many fish and cuttlefish produced. Fishermen cannot dry them on the spot and it is inconvenient to transport them, so they only take a small amount for daily consumption. Each Hainan fishing boat can hold more than 20 fishermen, and they come and go twice a year. Those who come in early spring return in early summer, and those who come in late autumn return in late winter. Those who come in spring mostly catch turtles, and those who come in autumn mostly pick up shellfish. Sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and shellfish are all available on each island, and sea cucumbers are particularly abundant on Dengjin Island.

The abundance of fisheries and phosphate ore in the Xisha Islands and their importance in national defense have been described above. It is hoped that our country's government and people will urgently seek development and defense, otherwise, it is a shame for the residents to have such a huge abandoned object beside their door.

Production and Construction

### INSPECTION OF FINISHED PRODUCTS

— Bai Gao

In the column on November 16, I have already talked about industrial standardization. I think you readers must have realized it. But what is the maintenance of the standard? That is inspection. Now I will briefly explain it below:

Establishing various standards does not seem very difficult, but it is very difficult to fully realize these standards, because in fact absolute precision is almost impossible. Furthermore, even if the tools are extremely sophisticated, the workers are extremely careful, and extremely skilled, it is difficult to produce a replica whose size and form are absolutely consistent with the standard. Therefore, in practical terms, the theoretical standard must be replaced by the practical standard. The so-called practical standard means indicating to what extent the product can differ from the theoretical standard and still be perfect. The allowable difference of the theoretical standard varies with the nature of the work. Generally, for rough work, the range of difference in terms of the nature of work, craftsmanship, and sophisticated workmanship can be slightly larger. For fine work, if the degree of perfection required in terms of partial interchangeability, such as with carbine rifles, is very important, then the range of difference in the size of its parts must be extremely small, and it is not easy to obtain perfect results unless the work is very careful. The experience recently gained by factories in the United States that manufacture carbine rifles and other military supplies can illustrate this principle.

The so-called inspection is a technique of comparing various materials, products, and actions with the established standards. Therefore, without precise standards, there is absolutely no perfect inspection. When carrying out inspections, some of the things to be inspected are beyond the already generous difference limit, some are within the difference limit, and some are very close to the set standard. Inspection is a technique to find the one that is most suitable for the work at hand from these three types of products. Therefore, if the difference limit of the standard is slightly smaller, the inspection work must be very precise. In addition, we should also pay attention to the fact that inspection is not always purely mechanical work, and also requires the inspector's good judgment. Indeed, in general production industries, there is really no work like inspection that requires sharp judgment and deep knowledge of the work. This situation is especially obvious for work with extremely small difference limits, such as mass production of precision products.

Sometimes the standard of the work cannot be accurately written on paper, so we have to resort to samples. Because the color of the product and the finishing touch after completion, which cannot be written down, can be indicated by samples. Also, in chemical factories, we can often get 100% pure products and can pay the standard explanation. Therefore, the problem of similarity between work standards and theoretical standards really varies with the nature of the industry and the work. Personnel engaged in inspection, if they do not have a clear understanding of these limitations, will definitely not have perfect inspection.

The necessary conditions for inspecting materials can be based on any one or several of the following characteristics:

(1) Quantitative; that is, about the quantity or number of pieces of the material. (2) Qualitative; that is, about the material's physical or chemical properties. (3) Dimensional; that is, about the material's form and the condition after completion. (4) Sales-related; that is, about the question of whether the material is suitable for its original purpose. Generally speaking, it is always inconvenient and inappropriate for all inspection work to be handled by one department or a group of people, so most factories always divide them into three separate parts, although the work of each part can sometimes overlap. Raw materials are generally inspected by the inventory department under the jurisdiction of the inventory director; dimensions and other manufacturing methods are inspected by the workshop inspectors under the jurisdiction of the general foreman; and completed products can be inspected by other personnel to assume the final inspection. In engineering factories and other factories that use scientific methods of manufacturing, the final inspection and action test are generally carried out by the engineering department or the design department.

### Everyone Be a Salesperson

— Editor

One of the most important tasks this year can be said to be the issue of sales promotion. This is because it is closely related to the production increase plan. According to theory, a production increase plan must be based on sales as the target. And the pure profit of an industry or business should be obtained from the actual sales of goods.

During the time when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, due to currency devaluation and lack of goods, no one cared about the sales of goods, nor did they need to care about sales. They only needed to hoard raw materials or finished products to make profits. Therefore, the art of sales promotion, which has always been ignored, was even more put aside and not applied.

But the situation is different now. Goods stored will only lose interest and will not help production. Only by expanding sales with high-quality goods can we make ourselves prosperous and lay the foundation for the future.

A person who is good at using sales promotion techniques can sell goods at higher prices, in larger quantities, in wider areas, and gain more and more satisfied customers.

In general, people really have a situation of knowing something about the sales of goods but not understanding why. This situation is partly due to a lack of talent, and at the same time, it is not easy to conduct market research or market analysis in China. But for the current plan, we must use more power, time, and energy to carry out sales promotion work in a scientific way. This is because, on the one hand, producers themselves urgently need to expand sales, and at the same time, when purchasing power is weak, there is an even greater need to use scientific sales promotion techniques to solve difficulties and overcome obstacles.

I believe that starting this year, everyone in every organization should be trained to become an excellent salesperson. The salesperson mentioned here is general rather than narrow.

A salesperson in the narrow sense sells a product and completes the sales work. A salesperson in the broad sense creates a good impression in society and gains social sympathy. The act of purchasing may not happen immediately, but some basic work has already been done in advance, and it will lead to the act of purchasing at an appropriate time.

To put this broad sense of sales promotion more clearly, the spirit of shop and factory employees and pleasant customer reception, and the hard work of supervisors day and night, can generate goodwill internally and externally, and the emotional result of mutual sincerity between capital and labor can achieve labor-capital coordination. All of these can be said to be the effects of sales promotion in a broad sense.

Originally, Salesmanship is the most practical academic discipline, and individuals, factories, and countries can all apply it and achieve success. According to the current situation, everyone becoming a salesperson may be a very appropriate proposal.

### Key Points for Agricultural Improvement

— Fan Xi

(1) Seed Improvement: To increase agricultural production, it is necessary to improve seeds. Imagine, without good seeds, how can you breed excellent offspring? Regarding seed improvement, it is best to set up breeding farms to cultivate excellent purebred varieties, and then distribute them to farmers. After the victory, the establishment of breeding farms is still pitifully small!

(2) Disease and Insect Control: Agricultural crop diseases and insect pests are common in our country. For example, locusts, rice stem borers, and rust diseases always occur on rice and wheat every year. Because of years of war, the prevention and control of agricultural crop diseases and insect pests has almost been neglected. How worrying is the future of agricultural production!

(3) Agricultural Product Processing: To preserve agricultural products for a long time, they must be processed. Rice, cotton, vegetables, and fruits all need processing. The technology of processing is also in urgent need of research and improvement!

(4) Improve Transportation

### Introduction to Business Administration

Implementation of Personnel Management (5) How to Make Employees Work

Because enabling employees to serve an enterprise organization or factory for a long time can be said to be an important principle of personnel management. Therefore, when recruiting and selecting employees, we must be strict. After they are employed, we must find ways to make them serve for a long time. Because repeated transfers of employees are detrimental to the enterprise organization or factory. In this place, especially specialized technical talents, cannot be allowed to transfer freely. There are usually several ways to make employees serve the enterprise organization or factory for a long time:

1. Trade Association Agreement

No matter what kind of goods are manufactured, or what kind of business is operated, there are always fellow businesses on the market. For example, if we open a pharmaceutical factory, there are many other pharmaceutical factories on the market. If our factory staff resign and go to another manufacturing factory, they will inevitably reveal our factory's secrets or manufacturing methods. This is unfavorable to us. Conversely, if employees from other factories come to our factory, then that manufacturing factory will have an unfavorable situation. Indeed, sometimes for business reasons, we inevitably try to outwit each other, using all means to recruit employees from other factories. However, if we can compete for employees from other factories, other manufacturers can also compete for our employees in the same way. For the sake of mutual interests, there is a method of trade association agreement, that is, several relatively close fellow businesses make an agreement, stating that they will never hire each other's employees, that is, Factory A will never hire Factory B's employees, nor will they use any other means to recruit factory employees. This method can provide protection for both Factory A and Factory B at the same time. However, this method still belongs to the negative aspect. In addition to negative prevention, we also need to do positive work, that is, consider the issue of employee treatment. We must make them feel at ease to work. If they can feel at ease to work, then they will definitely not want to seek development outside.

### Agricultural Output Declines Daily A Crisis Urgently Needs to Be Saved

— Ying Dai

China is a country based on agriculture. In the midst of the production increase movement, how to increase agricultural production is of course a very important issue. However, to our disappointment, the rural economy has been deteriorating recently. Since the victory, not only has agricultural production not increased, but on the contrary, it has been decreasing. I have observed and investigated this issue, and based on my research, I will briefly express my humble opinion as follows.

My hometown, Songjiang, is a rice-producing area. Among the residents of the whole county, more than a certain percentage are engaged in agriculture. According to the survey results, in normal years, if the weather is good and there are no sudden changes, one mu of rice paddy can produce three dan of white rice. Even if the year is slightly worse, it can still produce more than two dan. But in recent years, it has been decreasing. Especially this year, the weather is quite good, and insect pests are not found. However, the average farmland only produces two dan of rice at best, and the worse ones produce less than two dan. Otherwise, in such a year, there is always hope for three dan.

Why is this? The main point is of course that the rural economy has felt exhausted. Many farmers live on loans, borrowing rice and money, and are oppressed by high interest rates. The monthly interest rate for borrowing money is more than two cents, and the monthly interest rate for borrowing rice is one dou per dan. To increase field production, sufficient fertilization is an important matter. However, under the circumstances of excessively low rice prices and expensive fertilizers, most farmers cannot apply sufficient fertilizer. With less fertilizer, it will naturally affect the production effect. Year after year, after two or three years of oppression and poor harvests, some farmers are already struggling to farm and are forced to leave Chen Village to find work in the city. However, the city is in a recession, making it impossible to advance or retreat, and they are trapped in a desperate situation. The number of abandoned fields that have not been cultivated for two or three years is gradually increasing. If this continues, rice production will inevitably decrease rather than increase, and the harm will become increasingly serious!

In response to the above points, it is necessary to first relieve farmers from the oppression of high interest rates. Therefore, rural loans from banks cannot be delayed any longer, and must be widespread, so that poor farmers in each village can obtain low-interest loans from banks, so that they can have the strength to purchase more fertilizer when fertilizing. It is also important to reduce the selling price of various fertilizers. Moreover, as mentioned above, the yield of three dan of rice per mu has not yet reached the highest yield in most fields. In other words, if more fertilizer is applied, the rice yield can reach more than three dan. Therefore, the authorities must encourage farmers to apply more fertilizer than before the war. Finally, the ratio of rice prices to various other prices should also be averaged. Otherwise, if all goods are expensive and only rice is cheap, it will also force farmers to reduce fertilization and leave the fields, affecting agricultural production. The so-called low prices harm farmers. On a small scale, it affects the lives of farmers and the rural economy. On a large scale, it is related to the country's production effect. The harm to the future is greater than this, and it must be prevented!

Spring and Autumn

### Literature and Progress

— Li Jinming

Literature is crucial for promoting society. Although writers in the Victorian era temporarily favored departures from reality, leaning towards embellishment, they fostered sound political customs. Since symbolism and neo-idealism replaced realism, and psychology and natural sciences entered the ivory tower, it has also supported science. Philology has also become globalized in the past ten years. People like Schatterwell have simply regarded literary research as science, inheriting the pace of Taine, and have another non-purely literary pace.

Ultimately, when making literature effective or giving it the function of promoting society, what elements should it carry in terms of expression? There are different opinions and positions on this point. And what can make it have existential value in the future must be inseparable from novelty. No matter how the past styles, content, and ideas are evaluated, they cannot be considered to have timeliness. With the new conditions, and then seek other suitable conditions that can be called promoting society.

We need some writers like Defoe but more skillful than him; we need Rabelais and France to make us laugh easily; we need Sherwood Anderson to write ordinary stories from the countryside; we need Alexei Tolstoy to write about the historical national heroes; we need Wells to write scientific fantasies, enough to indicate future prophetic reports; we need Hankin's hazy dreamlike legends; we need Maeterlinck's symbolic techniques to inspire bright ideals.

There is no need to say more about the cultivation and supplementary revision outside of literature, and the life observation and adventure outside of life. These methods contribute to new content, which is something that even a student knows. Reality is scientific, but everyone easily feels troubled by it. Idealism is philosophically unified, but it easily escapes and stumbles. It seems that without it at all, one cannot help but feel the emptiness of art itself.

Forgetting reality has been almost the same trend in the past ten years and at present. From 1943 to 1944, the literary world in the Southwest almost took removing the reality of that time as a means of seeking comfort. Isn't it the same today? Seeking non-realistic comfort and enjoyment, forgetting the light and wounds of last night, this has become a general psychological trend, and it cannot be said that it is not excessive. But we hope to require artisticization in this trend, and to require adapting to a path of promoting society. There are nine Muses in ancient Greece, each in charge of a part. Can it be said that lyric poetry is poetry, and expression plays are drama? 27, 12, Republic 36,

### Scraps of Paper

— Zhongyuan

Counting on my fingers, it's exactly a year.

A year! If a wisp of unextinguished memory remains in your soul in heaven, perhaps you will think the same as me. Of course, I absolutely don't want you to think like this, nor do I want myself to think like this. Under the separation of life and death, we must never allow ourselves to think like this. But on the edge of this snowy and windy first month, in this desolate and lonely cold winter night, under this dim and silent lamplight, I finally remembered you again. Remembered you, although I no longer sob and weep like before, I still can't hold back a painful heart, knowing that you can't hear, but I still want to tell you foolishly.

Tell you that I left that small town five months ago. That small town, didn't I tell you long ago that I was going to leave? I said I was a fledgling bird, waiting for the opportunity to mature, rushing to the sky, never to return. I also said that I was a fallen flower under the fence, expecting the heroic storm to take me to the free ocean and blue sky. I also said that at the latest when the apricot blossoms bloom in April, I will definitely be on the journey. But who would have thought that the day I left the small town with a small package, the apricot blossoms in April had already bloomed, the roses in May had also withered, the withered petals of wild attacks in June had fallen all over the fields of the small town, and the scorching sun in July had already lazily slanted to the west.

Of course, I dare not deceive you and say that everything is for you. I also dare not deceive you and say that I have always been thinking of you in those days. But I will never deceive you: on that stormy night, when my toes stepped on that prosperous city, there was only one thing in my heart, and that was you!

Don't think this is a child's play, thinking that the most burning emotions of young people are nothing more than a strange firework. Even if it has released amazing and gorgeous brilliance in the dark night, it will eventually be extinguished in the silent torrent of time. What's more, we have gone through the struggle of life, the tempering of death, countless stormy waves and countless hardships, and finally like two tattered leaves in the storm, accidentally falling together and occasionally separating, what is so strange about this? What is worth recalling and sighing about?

Our life is the dewdrop on the tip of the grass, rolling in and rolling out, destroying ourselves! Just let the withered grass be resurrected! I remember a poet once said this, and I also admit it. Therefore, when you first raised that cup to me with pleading eyes, I knew that what was in that cup was not fragrant nectar, but a difficult bitter liquid, but I finally took it resolutely and swallowed it with tears. You heard my happy voice: "I am willing." But you didn't hear a sentence in my heart: "For you!"

I have regretted it thousands of times, and complained ten thousand times: why couldn't I have known you before that misty day; in the spring when our young lives were as bright as flowers; when the heads of life, the chains of death, thousands of hardships and ten thousand threats had not weighed on our shoulders? Couldn't we have put on hard armor together to resist the oncoming wind and waves and thunderbolts?

When I met you, it was not only misty, but also in a storm, in a chaotic world, almost at the time of destruction!

How could I not know my own weakness, how could I not know that you live on the bright horizon, and I live in the dark corner of the sea. Unless the mountains and seas are turned upside down, unless living things are destroyed, unless one day the flame of truth burns down this evil era, even if we struggle to break our bones and tear our flesh, we will never be able to eliminate the distance that separates us.

However, even across immeasurable distances, we finally disregarded everything and resolutely offered our lives and souls to the altar of truth at the same time!

You sacrificed yourself on that altar of truth; you left me forever; you said goodbye forever to the bright sky and the beautiful world!

A year! I left that small town alone and walked into the prosperous city alone. I searched for your footprints on the streets of the city, searched for your voice, appearance, and smile, searched for your bright red blood and dry white bones. I was almost like a crazy madman, running around in the crowds of cars and horses and the dazzling lights. Four months of work is better than a long four years. My black and bright hair withered and turned yellow, my round face became pointed and thin, and those big, round, bright eyes, which you used to be proud of, were about to lose the brilliance of living people. I even shouted your name at the head of the Huangpu River in the deep night, bitterly shouting your name...

But I can't shout to you. Your worms, your bones, your voice, appearance, and your footprints have long been stepped on and ruthlessly trampled by many huge feet, hard feet, feet nailed with iron hammers...

I left the prosperous city in disappointment, on a drizzly day a month ago. I boarded a crowded train, took out a blue handkerchief and wiped the tears from the corners of my eyes. On the corner of that handkerchief, there was still your handwritten name.

A year! In this desolate and lonely strange little place, I can't even find a small flower. Only two lines of bitter tears and an unchanging heart are respectfully offered to you on the anniversary of your death today. (Reviewed in Yunjian in February of the 36th year).

### Gao Zhi's Character

— Mingchun

In the Chinese literary world, there is someone who has devoted himself to translation for ten years, enduring the blows of life, but always sticking to his post, silently content; when his translation is published, others are surprised by its voluminousness and secretly sigh "Good guy, it is not easy to read it once, thanks to his patience in translating it." Gao Zhi is this kind of person.

If someone has paid attention to publications such as Crescent Moon, Big Dipper, Eastern Miscellany, Shen Bao Monthly, New China, Guowen Weekly, and Ta Kung Pao before the war, the name Gao Zhi is not unfamiliar, is it?

When he was in college, he was still the most interesting big child in the class. When listening to lectures, he often drew some funny pictures of little people and dogs on the request for meaning, or distributed a few peanuts to the students sitting next to him. His coat pocket was often filled with snacks.

He is very smart, his English is very good, and his novels and essays are also pretty good. Mr. Lin Yutang has extremely praised his proposition to transform Chinese characters.

After ten years of separation, he not only became a professor, but also became an expert in the study of Tolstoy, almost the only expert in China. If you have read his article "The Accompaniment Method of Tolstoy's Description of Psychological Transformation" published in Ta Kung Pao's Sunday Literary Cocoon (35, 12, 15), you will not doubt my conclusion. People who do not have a full understanding of Tolstoy's works cannot write a single word in that kind of article.

He has translated all of Tolstoy's important works, such as "War and Peace", "Anna Karenina", "Resurrection", "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth".

It is said that there is a famous scholar in Shanghai who is famous for translating Russian social science books. When translating, he deliberately placed the Russian original on his desk, but put the Japanese translation in the drawer. When someone visited him, they only saw the Russian original placed on the desk, which shocked people with his linguistic talent.

Gao Zhi does not seek to shock people. He believes that translating Russian directly is not a big deal.

Because his English is good and his Russian is also good, many people ask him which country he studied in or whether he has returned from Moscow. But he is a genuine student of the Republic of China who has been from Nanjing to Chongqing and is now back from Chongqing to Nanjing.

He loves translation work as much as he loves his life. He also yearns for the prospects of life and the world. He wants to ferry himself and others to the other side full of sunshine and flowers.

He has a purpose, confidence, no worries, less loneliness in life, adheres to the cultural post, and stubbornly strives for progress. He does not know what failure is, and failure will never come to a person full of vitality.

I believe that in today's world where human desires are rampant and people are eager for quick success and instant benefits, and the literary world can still reveal some brilliance, people like Gao Zhi are worthy of respect.

### Plum Blossom Ancient Monk—One of the Xin'an School Painters

— Xu Shiqi

The Buddhist monk Hongren, whose style name was Jianjiang, was from Shexian. He loved plum blossoms and was known as the Plum Blossom Ancient Monk; his secular surname was Jiang, his given name was Tao, his style name was Liuqi, and his pseudonym was Oumeng. He was orphaned at a young age and was extremely filial to his mother; he was a Ming Dynasty student. After his mother passed away, he did not marry or take office. He entered Fujian and traveled to Wuyi, relying on the Buddhist monk Guhang as a teacher. He once lived in Huangshan Qiyun. His landscape paintings learned from Song people in his early years, and later learned from Yunlin, obtaining the interest of Xiao Shu Dan Yi, and was as famous as Hongcan Daoji, but he was able to create his own style.

The Buddhist monk Jianjiang's brushwork is exquisite and wonderful. Together with Xiu Ning Wang Zhirui, Haiyang Cha Shibiao, and Huizhou Sun Wuyi, they are collectively known as the Four Masters of the Xin'an School. Wang, Cha, and Sun have lofty sentiments and extraordinary character.

Outside the West Gate of Shexian County, cross the Taiping Bridge and pass through the Taibai Tower to enter the Xigan Scenic Area. The flowing water is gurgling and the tall trees shade the sky. Ascend the steps to build the Plum Blossom Ancient Monk's Abode. Plum blossoms are planted everywhere along the road, with transverse and sparse shadows, and the environment is extremely secluded. Above is the Former Residence of the Buddhist monk Jianjiang. Before the Anti-Japanese War, County Speaker Jiang Tonghou discussed rebuilding it with great care. The Changqing Pagoda and Piyun Peak are arranged in front and back. The tomb of Mr. Wang Caibai, the recluse of Xitong, was newly built across the hill. The county people publicly buried him here. Two generations of artists stand in the east and west, and will be immortal with the rivers, mountains, sun, and stars!

### Inscription on the Painting of Pine Trees on Cliffs by Duo Ci

— Xu Shaodi

The cliffs are jagged with thousands upon thousands of thorns,
The twisting branches soar like celestial gates;
The pines whisper, generating sorrowful winds,
The mists and clouds conjure fantastical tales before my eyes;
The peach and willow trees of the human world are all delicate and exquisite,
But they mock the bearded elder for his noble purity;
Do you not see the mountains cracking in the freezing cold,
Ten thousand trees withered and broken together;
Only the pines of the Qiongtai,
Defy frost and snow, their scales like iron.

Looking at Xigan from Taiping Bridge, Changqing Pagoda and Piyun Peak are arranged on the left and right. Above are the Former Residence of the Buddhist monk Jianjiang and the tomb of the recluse of Xitong, which are the best places for Xin'an scenic spots. (Note by Shiqi)

### Welcoming Spring Grass

— Hu Ne

In the severe winter, the earth seems to be covered with a layer of gray gauze, and the sky is always floating with gray clouds, either raining or snowing, making people almost unable to breathe, and it feels like a heavy lead block is pressing down in the pottery.

Fortunately, spring may follow closely behind winter, and the gloom of the earth will be swept away, bringing vigor, freshness, beauty, and lively days.

As the English poet Shelley said well: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?"

Isn't it? At that time, the earth is full of vitality, the farmers in the fields sing simple and lovely harvest songs, the grass and trees grow a new green, welcoming the sunshine of the new spring, and a vibrant vigor is scattered throughout the natural world.

Latent and dead things are all reborn in spring.

Spring symbolizes promising young people, aspiring ambitions, and a bright future. How many promising philosophers and scholars have not laid their immortal foundation in their youth, letting the glorious and bright light forever shine on the world!

Spring! We sing your praises, you bring so much new hope to the world!

### Two Essays

— Zhuang Ran

Lamp

After the electric light went out, I lit a candle.

Struggling out of the reign of darkness, I cast a kind and passionate gaze upon everything familiar around me.

From now on, ignoring those gloomy, hideous faces in the darkness, all chaos and emptiness. A little light brings us warmth and confidence.

It reminds me of the cold stars in the sky outside the window, sparkling and emitting their beautiful light, bringing noble comfort to so many sleepless people in the chilling night! And facing the dome of the sky, thinking of the magnificent universe, the light of each star will weave into thousands of cosmic meridians and parallels.

And mankind, after all, has lamps, with lamps there is light, and in the darkness, a magnificent universe of mankind is woven.

"Well, you old fool, don't let the lamp be blown out by the cold wind outside the window!" We have to finish a piece of work under the lamp, the night outside the window is darker, raindrops beat on the window panes, and the lamplight flickers precariously.

"Hey! Look, there's a light approaching in the distance." And then the gong sounded.

We are heading towards dawn.

Rain

It's raining, do you feel annoyed?

The muddy road, coupled with the cold wind, the umbrella can hardly hold. If you are not careful, you will slip and fall into the mud, or perhaps fall into the ditch beside the road full of dirty water - and there is still a long way to go ahead.

What should I do?

Thinking that the raindrops of spring will make the green grass grow luxuriantly, thinking that the raindrops of summer will wash away the dust in the sky and bring endless freshness:

Thinking that the raindrops will wash away the dirt on the ground; thinking that the raindrops will converge into the torrent of the Yangtze River, rushing and flowing towards the sea...

Thinking of the people struggling in the bleak wind and bitter rain, a group of suffering people, for their ideals; also thinking of the lighthouse keepers lighting that star of light in the night of storms, pointing the way for so many lost souls...

Thinking of the tranquility after the storm; thinking of a beautiful sunny day after the rain. Then, let the rain continue to fall

And I should get up from where I fell and continue on the road.

Tomorrow should be a clear day.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 157

— Ye Jingfeng

Chapter Seven: The Secret of "Eight"

"So, Pingzi has also come here (Beiping)?"

After Hejian and I met, he vividly recounted all the details from joining the Black Dragon Society in Japan to failing to search for the "Seven Sealed Secrets" and being ordered to fly back to the mainland. He spoke in both Beijing dialect and Japanese, emptying his heart, and told me everything. I recorded the outline, program, and key points of the story he told me. Although there were a few unclear points, I didn't have time to ask about them now. I was anxious to know the whereabouts of this mysterious Miss Pingzi. I couldn't calm down until I finished listening to his story, and then I asked this question.

"I came by plane," Hejian told me, "Pingzi, and the 'Manchurian Bitch' in Pingzi's mouth, are all settled in the Shenyang headquarters. The big one still has some tricks...but!" Hejian stopped here, as if thinking of a very difficult problem that needed careful consideration, and then relit a cigarette and paced back and forth in the room. This was his old habit, so I had to not disturb him, just sat aside and organized my diary, filling in the missing days, times, locations, etc.

The place where we are meeting now is the only safe and secret place in Beiping - "Beiping ×× Hotel" (Readers, please forgive me, until today, this place has the need for external secrecy, and it is still difficult to announce without the consent of a certain confidential agency). After I returned from Tongzhou with Miss Yaoqun and Little Tiger, thanks to Mr. W's kindness, he kept a few of us together and entertained us as much as possible. Except for important matters that required going out, we all stayed on this fifth floor. "No. 〇 Haosi" and a few elite subordinates are also here, and secret telegrams are also received and sent here. There are also Mr. W's communication equipment upstairs, which is very convenient. So as soon as Hejian arrived in Beiping, we picked him up so that he could rest quietly.

Hejian walked back and forth in the room a few times, then suddenly stopped and looked at me, "Old brother, what do you think this 'eight' character means?"

"August 1st? I was confused for a moment and asked him back.

Hejian laughed when he heard my question, as if he found my dazed look a bit funny.

"Old brother, you're not necessarily very smart, maybe your brain is overworked and a little unresponsive? Hurry up... have a cigarette, no matter how sophisticated the machine is, it always needs oil." As he spoke and laughed, he threw me a military-grade cigarette.

"You're wrong," I said, smoking the cigarette, "I'm asking about Pingzi's affairs. You didn't answer the question completely, and suddenly you brought up the question of 'eight'; but my mind is still thinking about Pingzi."

"This 'eight' is exactly Pingzi's business," Hejian suddenly stopped smiling, his face full of worries, "I predict that she is undertaking a very important mission for Tokyo. She always seemed a little distracted when using her fingers to tap out telegrams. This is a sign that she has something on her mind. Ordinary small problems would never bother her like that; what makes her distracted must be a very big problem. I also asked her a few times, but she always hid it and changed the subject with small talk. It wasn't until she saw me off at the airport in Shenyang that she blurted out a sentence - telling me to pay attention to the secret of 'eight'. I think the secret of 'eight' is not difficult to explain, but I can't predict which aspect it is."

### Athletes Never Return! Xu Chengji Dies in London A Great Loss to Chinese Sports

— Zheng Fan

This is an immeasurable and significant loss to the Chinese sports world! Tennis player Xu Chengji died in London on the 31st of last month, acute pneumonia destroyed this superstar who once shone on the world sports stage. From now on, I don't know how many years we will have to wait to realize the dream of an initial Davis Cup victory!

Chengji was a tennis genius. China's sports achievements are inferior to those of Western countries in everything, and the only glory is Xu's various championships won in tennis tournaments in various European countries. He has won the All England Hard Court Tennis Championship and championships in Berlin, Germany, Birmingham, England, and was a player in the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships and a Chinese representative in the Davis Cup for many years. For ten years, he has shown his power overseas, and has really earned a lot of face for Chinese sports.

When the Second National Games were held in the capital in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, remote provinces and overseas Chinese compatriots traveled long distances to participate. Xu Chengji, as a tennis player from Batavia, participated in a formal competition in China for the first time and defeated a Shanghai player. The report of the National Games has a paragraph describing Xu's skills:

"Xu uses special and superb techniques, left and right, omnipotent, serving like artillery shells. Rapid draws like arrows, shooting straight to the baseline, or gently picking the edge of the net, or blocking the net and intercepting, sometimes using high balls to press and strike, slamming over the net, with wonderful performances, applause and thunder, Xu's technique is a magical performance, and is indeed the only one in China."

He stunned the country at the age of twenty

At that time, Xu was only a twenty-year-old youth, and he had already caused a sensation across the country. In the twenty-fourth year, he was assigned by the government to go to the United States with Zheng Zhaojia to participate in the Davis Cup. Xu and Zheng each won a match, which was the first harvest for our country in the three years of participating in the Davis Cup. In the twenty-fifth year, our country changed to participate in the European League, and Xu still participated. After the competition, he stayed in Europe and concentrated on practicing. In half a year, he participated in twelve competitions and won a total of nine championships, six in Southern Europe, two in Greece, and one in Birmingham, England. In the twenty-sixth year, Xu's tennis skills were even more superb in the Davis Cup. The British Daily Herald praised him as "the masterpiece of China's first master", but unfortunately, his partner was not good and suffered an unjust defeat.

He reached the last eight of Wimbledon and defeated two Austin, almost entering the ranks of the world's first-class tennis players. In the French International Tennis Championships, he defeated Lesueur, the third-ranked French player, causing a sensation throughout Paris and being hailed as the reincarnation of Lacoste.

He grew up in the South and looked like a scholar

Looking at the tennis court, Chengji is not a burly person, he is a typical southerner. The posture of hitting the ball still carries some "scholar" air, without overly violent movements, but when the ball he hits falls on the opponent's side, everyone will feel its weight. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he gave speeches in various parts of Southeast Asia and donated money to the government. Later, the flames of the enemy became more intense. After the Pacific War, he lived in seclusion in his hometown of Batavia (his health may have been damaged at that time). Last year, he reappeared to participate in the Davis Cup, and his power was even greater than in those days. Although the result was a failure, Chengji's singles were always a must-win.

He does not smoke or drink. Since he started learning tennis at the age of thirteen, he has always worked hard and practiced without the slightest slack. Apart from tennis, he has no other hobbies. On the outside, he is a frail scholar, but on the tennis court, he is a brave general who can fight hard for five sets. He also has good sportsmanship. Although he does not hide his joy of winning, he does not bury other people's strengths, and does not have the arrogance of bad athletes. He is a Minnan overseas Chinese. In addition to his native dialect, he can speak some Mandarin. During his stay in Europe, he can also speak English and Dutch, and can also cope with German and French. In January of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, he married Miss Bowulf, a British tennis player, in London, but divorced in March of last year. His brother's tennis skills are also excellent, and they can be called unparalleled.

Such a serious and hardworking Chinese youth died of illness at the age of only thirty-four. In the international sports world, who else will be the second Xu Chengji?

Old News on the Inside Story of World War II

### A Small Village in Czechoslovakia Receives a Windfall (Part 1)

Six Million U.S. Dollars Distributed Universally

Suppose a group of new people suddenly came to the small village where you live and distributed six million U.S. dollars to the residents of the city, and everyone could get an unimaginable sum of money. Do you think this is possible? You would definitely say that this is a daydream, right?

However, things are unpredictable. About a year and a half ago, the village of Sastin in the northeast corner of Czechoslovakia did receive a windfall.

The incident occurred at the end of April 1945. At that time, the German army was still occupying the small village of Sastin, which was located on the Czech-Austrian border. There were only a few thousand farmers in the area, and it was a deserted village. After the news that the Soviet army was approaching the village spread, the local German garrison was in a state of panic. They were preparing to retreat north into Austria.

In the Sastin Town Hall, which was then used as a command post, the Nazi commander's eyes were fixed on several boxes lying in disarray, which were filled with Czech banknotes. The money was originally looted by the Nazis from the vaults of the Czech National Bank in Bratislava.

Now that the Red Army was in pursuit, the distraught Nazi commander decided to abandon the staggering sum of money. Outside the command post, a car was waiting to take him to safety. Of course, the car could not fit such large objects as banknote boxes, so he locked the boxes, put the key in his pocket, and then called in two young Slovak farmers who had been conscripted by the German war machine.

German troops fled in embarrassment, leaving behind a large amount of banknotes "I will leave these boxes to you for safekeeping, hide them well. You two are fully responsible. If I come back in the future - our army will definitely come back - you can get a reward, understand?"

The soldiers nodded dumbly. After a while, the Nazi officer left. The two frightened Slovaks quickly took off their German uniforms, put on civilian clothes, jumped on their bicycles, and fled to the countryside. As for the boxes, they remained in the old place.

The next morning, a battalion of Soviet troops occupied Sastin. Of course, the first target of the Soviet troops' search was undoubtedly the former Nazi command post, and the most eye-catching thing was these boxes. The battalion commander opened one of them and picked up a few bundles of banknotes. What to do with them? That was a difficult question.

In order to understand the Soviet officer's actions, we must remember that these Soviet troops belonged to General Konev's command, and they had advanced from Stalingrad. They fought continuously, week after week, month after month, with only one thought in their minds: "Invade Berlin or die."

Mirror

You bow to it, it also bows to you, you punch and kick it, it also punches and kicks you, you smile at it, it will never cry at you, you cry at it, it will never smile at you. This is a treasure book for dealing with people.

Light bulb

When the current you receive exceeds the limit of the fixed number, although it will emit a stronger light, it is only temporary. Your weak heartstrings cannot withstand the shock and explode, and you immediately declare darkness, never to restore the original light.

Train

The people sitting in the train see all the scenery outside the car window only receding backward, but the wheels are still advancing rapidly. This proves the feeling of life. Sometimes the feeling does not match the expression of the facts.

Movie

The darker the movie, the clearer it is. Watching a movie in the sunlight, although the screen is also showing stories of joys and sorrows, it is vague and unclear. Isn't the social stage the same?

### Welcoming Spring (To the tune of "West River Moon")

— Sui

Last night I frequently heard cats meowing, I hope spring returns to the earth,

Tomorrow is the Beginning of Spring again. Gold is not worth a penny.

Spring comes and winter goes, most heart-wrenching, all old habits are changed in one morning,

How much has white rice risen? Never again will the ground be dark and the sky be dim!

Don't rush,

Just climb up the high-rise and climb into the window;

The boxes and cages are split open and the purse is full,

First ask for the password "What place?"

### Lamenting the Xisha Islands!

— Gao Wuhong

After the victory, China was listed as one of the "Four Powers," and France was not included because it was still waiting for domestic consolidation. Later, the "Four Powers" were changed to the "Five Powers," and one power was added to fill China's position with France, and China was relegated to the bottom. We watched other countries quickly recover their international status, while we had just stepped onto the stage and then retreated, and we really felt endless shame. Recently, French troops once again landed on the Xisha Islands under the pretext of "recovering sovereignty on behalf of Annam," infringing on our country's sovereignty and causing regret in Sino-French relations. When France was occupied, China extended great sympathy and called for assistance. China and France are both countries seeking freedom and peace, but now France is taking advantage of our country's unstable domestic situation to occupy the Xisha Islands by force, which is deeply regrettable.

Even if the "sovereignty" of the Xisha Islands belongs to Annam, France should "recover" it on behalf of Annam through diplomatic means, and should not rush to station troops there. Moreover, according to the White Paper's statement: "History proves that the islands have always belonged to China, and France's actions are of course an occupation. What is the basis for claiming sovereignty?" It also suggests submitting this issue to international arbitration. We believe that the Xisha Islands incident is purely a diplomatic issue between China and France and can be resolved by China and France themselves without troubling the international community, if the French side is sincere. "International arbitration" is like two children quarreling and pulling an adult out to "mediate," saying a fair word. The adult listens to both sides, each with its own argument, and does not know which side to help, so it will not have much effect.

The "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident" both called for international arbitration. What was the result? Unexpectedly, today's France is playing the same trick again. Looking back on the past, I feel deeply emotional and cannot help but sigh!

### Chinese People Can Also Lead Americans

— Gao Wuhong

Mr. Xiao (transliteration), a famous Chinese doctor born in Honolulu, USA, graduated from the University of Hawaii, and is currently 30 years old. He was originally the director of the Biological Laboratory of the Quartermaster Depot in Philadelphia. He is now leading a group of American scientists in researching methods to eliminate bacteria. This type of bacteria caused great damage to military equipment and clothing during the Pacific War. Although the medical community has invented several bactericides and can eliminate 400,000 types of bacteria, there are still some that cannot be killed. According to the Department of the Army, "The current research is led by Mr. Xiao, and many famous American bacteriologists, mycologists, and biologists are assisting. Significant progress has been made...."

A foreign scholar once said: "Chinese people have clever minds and extraordinary wit, but most people cannot make good use of them, or are limited by economics. No matter what they study, they learn some superficial knowledge and give up halfway, without further study. If they can strive for perfection, carefully ponder, and add economic support, their achievements can surpass others."

The fact that Mr. Xiao is leading American scientists in researching methods to kill bacteria proves that this statement is not wrong. I hope that everyone will take this news as a warning and do their best, so as not to betray the talent and hands that nature has given us!

### If Roosevelt Had Not Died

— Jia

January 30th was the birthday of the late President Roosevelt of the United States. Bells were rung across the United States to commemorate and remember one of the greatest presidents in American history. During his lifetime, Roosevelt had many political enemies, but few people spoke ill of him after his death. Roosevelt's great personality can be seen from this. After Roosevelt's death, the world situation has been contradictory and complicated, unlike the unity during the war. On President Roosevelt's birthday, I think every American, and even people in any country in the world, have a question in their hearts: If Roosevelt were still alive today, what would the world situation be like?

### Japanese Workers Have "Progressed"!

— Yuan

In the past week, Japan has been brewing a major strike, scheduled to launch nationwide on February 1st. It is said that the total number of striking workers across the country, including those participating in sympathy strikes, will reach 8.6 million, which can be said to be the largest labor movement in history. If the Japanese labor community really ignores MacArthur's ban and holds the strike as scheduled, it will be a "spectacle"! What is strange is that these Japanese workers, who have served the Japanese warlords for so long and assisted in the war of aggression, have suddenly become so "progressive" and so "democratic," as if they are more radical than the workers in advanced democratic countries. Have the Japanese really "awakened"?

### Britain and the Soviet Union

— Jiayuan

Since Montgomery's visit to Moscow, the evolution of British-Soviet relations has once again attracted worldwide attention. Some say that the Anglo-Soviet alliance is not only continuing to be effective but will also be extended. Others say that Britain and the Soviet Union have signed a secret agreement to divide the spheres of influence in the Near East and the Balkans... But on the other hand, the Soviet Union is still criticizing Britain, saying that it has signed a secret agreement with the United States to jointly resist the Soviet Union, while Britain is also coldly mocking and blaming the Soviet Union for its faults. In fact, today's British-Soviet relations are no different from what they were before Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union. The world has paid too much attention to this episode of Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union!
