### Personnel Selection for Our Delegation to Japan for Investigation to be Decided at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Views Diverge Between the US and the Soviet Union on the Issue

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] After the government decided to open private trade with Japan, the delegation to Japan for investigation is about to be formed and will depart on a regular basis. The personnel selection issue was discussed by the heads of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Economy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance, convened by Secretary-General Gan Naiguang of the Executive Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 4th. A general decision was made and will be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting on the 5th for a decision.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] Wu Yunchu, Chairman of the National Association of Industries, told reporters regarding the representation of the private industrial sector in the business delegation to Japan: Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the private industrial sector has already formed a small research group, which is conducting detailed research. Before a resolution is reached, the consideration of representatives to Japan will be temporarily suspended. However, since the government decided to open trade with Japan, it has not had any contact with the private industrial sector. If the government selects him for the delegation to Japan this time, he does not wish to participate either.

[Associated Press Moscow, 3rd] The "Pravda" newspaper reiterated today to Western countries that the Soviet Union will adopt a tough policy on the Japanese peace treaty. The political commentator, Leontiev, wrote that before the peace treaty, the four major powers must convene themselves to draft the treaty and exercise full veto power over the entire issue. Leontiev continued, stating that the voting system of the Paris Peace Conference must be adopted to prevent the United States from exercising its power politics in voting. The Soviet Union should be responsible for insisting on this procedure because the Soviet Union's participation in the war forced Japan to surrender. The authority of the Far Eastern Commission is strictly limited to occupation policies and general principles, and drafting the peace treaty cannot be included. It must also be remembered that in addition to the countries of the Far Eastern Commission, there are many other countries that believe they have a great relationship with the Japanese peace treaty, and their reasons for participating in the drafting of the peace treaty are even more sufficient than those of some countries of the Far Eastern Commission. He continued: The various conditions of the European peace treaty must be insisted upon by the four major powers, and the resolutions in the Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam declarations must be implemented. The newspaper then listed the reasons why the Soviet Union should have equal say with the United States, Britain, and China: (1) The Soviet Union defeated Japan's strongest and most elite army—the Kwantung Army; (2) The Soviet Union completely defeated Germany, thereby accelerating the Allied victory over Japan; (3) The decisive final blow against Japan came from the Soviet army (Note: Pravda did not elaborate on this point); (4) During the war, the Soviet army kept Japan's most elite troops stationed in Northeast China from beginning to end, preventing them from being deployed elsewhere; (5) The Soviet Union fulfilled its responsibility to the Allied nations and declared war on Japan on time, according to the historical agreement reached by the major powers.

[Associated Press Washington, 3rd] Well-informed sources here stated: The statement in "Pravda" that the Soviet Union does not intend to relinquish its veto power over drafting the Japanese peace treaty is probably a trial balloon to determine whether the United States is willing to compromise on its position. The United States has already clarified its position to the Soviet Union and other countries of the Far Eastern Commission, that is, all member states have equal say, and resolutions are passed by a two-thirds majority vote, and no veto power can be exercised. Well-informed sources also said: The United States insists that veto power should not be allowed when drafting the peace treaty.

[United Press Washington, 3rd] It is learned that the State Department has decided to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to transfer the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty to the Council of Foreign Ministers for handling. If the Soviet Union insists, the United States government may take steps within the week to independently draft the peace treaty.

[United Press Washington, 3rd] Australian Ambassador to the United States Makin declared today that Australia insists on extracting reparations from Japanese industrial equipment in order to deprive Japan of its ability to manufacture war again. Australia will also request that the Japanese peace treaty stipulate that the Allied countries protect and supervise the Japanese way of life to ensure that it remains a peaceful country forever. The duration of the Allied supervision was not specified, but it was stated that the Australian government believes that control should continue until Japan's industrial and psychological war potential is completely eliminated.

### First Meeting of the Resources Commission; Various Units Report on Association Affairs; Weng Wenhao Encourages Colleagues to Distinguish Between Public and Private Interests

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] The Resources Commission held its first meeting after the reorganization at 9:30 AM on the 4th. Chairman Weng Wenhao presided over the meeting, attended by Sun Yueqi, Wu Yunchu, Huo Baoshu, Zhao Dihua, Yang Jizeng, Tan Boyu, Shen Yi, Wang Chongzhi, Chen Bozhuang, Sun Zheng, Yang Gongzhao, Cheng Yifa, Wu Zhaohong, and with Dong Xian Guang, Chen Zhongxi, Jin Kaiying, Xu Junli, and Zhang Jun as observers. First, Weng Wenhao and Sun Yueqi delivered speeches. Then, the association affairs reports were conducted: Chen Zhongxi for electricity, Sun Yueqi for coal and steel, Jin Kaiying for oil, and Yang Gongzhao for export mining. Xu Junli for electrical engineering, Wu Zhaohong for sugar industry, Zhang Jun for cement, and Wu Zhaohong for financial situation. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon. Starting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, a review of the association affairs was held, divided into three major areas: (1) Review of the direction of basic business construction, (2) Review of the area of basic business, (3) Review of the connection and cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises.

[Another Dispatch] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Commission, reported on the historical overview of the commission at the first committee meeting on the morning of the 4th, stating that the purpose of the commission is to establish national capital in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. The construction goal indicated by the Chairman should make "capital nationalized and enjoyment popularized," which is the meaning of this. He pointed out that the construction of economic enterprises in various countries also has the same trend. Then, regarding the relationship between the commission and private enterprises, he said that the commission is assisting private enterprises in the following ways: (1) Incorporating private shares into the established business organizations to form limited companies, (2) Investing capital in private enterprises that have achieved results but urgently need to expand their capital, (3) Supplying private enterprises with power and urgently needed equipment. Next, he described the planned goals of the commission, stating that the commission's goal is not only to focus on daily profits and losses but also to focus on the construction and development of national industrialization. The focus is on establishing power sources, fuel production, steel smelting, manufacturing of major machinery and electrical equipment, and large-scale production of cement, fertilizers, sugar, and basic chemicals. Since these types of businesses require too much capital and are difficult for individuals to undertake, the commission has an unshirkable responsibility to establish a modern nation and should take on the arduous task with national strength. In the Northeast, the emphasis is on repairing damage and maintaining production. The Taiwan takeover of various enterprises has been effective, and new construction is also underway. Finally, the service creed of the colleagues in the association is listed as follows, and colleagues should encourage each other: (1) All work should aim to benefit the nation, the people, and the future of the Chinese economy, distinguishing between public and private interests, and never harming the public for private gain; (2) Colleagues in the service industry should not engage in private business of the same type, neither as shareholders nor in any related business; (3) Serve solely for the public good, not for private profit.

### Improving Coal Mine Production; Promoting Work Competition

Measures Approved by the Coal Conference

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 4th] The National Coal Production Increase Conference believes that to improve production, it is necessary to promote work competition to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The conference unanimously approved the Measures for Coal Mine Work Competition. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Resources Commission will invite the Central Work Competition Promotion Committee, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other relevant agencies to form a Coal Mine Work Competition Committee to preside over the coal mine work competition. Each mine will also organize its own mine work competition committee to handle the mine's internal work competition. The competition standard will be based on each mine's planned output. Those who exceed the standard will be commended by the competent authority. The incentive measures include low-interest loans, facilitating the addition of equipment, bonuses, and certificates. As for the personnel who vigorously preside over the work competition and the personnel who win the competition with outstanding achievements, in addition to the separate rewards from each mine, they may be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Resources Commission for verification and forwarded to the Central Work Competition Promotion Committee for reward.

Finally, the preparatory meeting for the establishment of Guyuan Middle School was approved to raise funds.

### British Parliament Sends Another Delegation to China; Our Government Has Agreed; List of Six Delegation Members Not Yet Finalized

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] The British Parliament previously decided to send another delegation to China for exchanges. It is learned that this proposal has been approved by our government and has been formally notified to the British side.

### Soviet Union's Newly Produced Map Changes the Border of Mongolia and Xinjiang Without Authorization; Luo Jialun Discusses the Significance of the Soviet Action

[Central News Agency New Delhi, 2nd] "The mysterious changes made to the borders of Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang in the newly produced Soviet map can serve as a major clue to understanding the entire issue of Outer Mongolia's encroachment on our Xinjiang." Luo Jialun, the former Xinjiang District Inspector and currently our ambassador to India, told a Central News Agency reporter today. Ambassador Luo said that when he was responsible for conducting scientific surveys in Xinjiang, he noticed differences between two maps drawn by the Soviet Union in 1928 and 1940, especially in the significant discrepancies in the borders of Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia. For this reason, he also studied dozens of different maps. According to all the maps, it is proved that the entire Alpha area is a part of Xinjiang, and Bushan is within Xinjiang, about 200 kilometers away from the border of Outer Mongolia. However, in the map drawn by the Soviet Union in 1940, this area of 88,000 square kilometers was划 out of the border of Xinjiang Province. Ambassador Luo explained this matter, saying that when the Soviet Union drew the map in 1928, the Soviet Union and Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, maintained a friendly relationship, so there was no possibility of border disputes between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia at that time. It seemed that both Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia were under the control of the Soviet Union at that time. The change in the border on the Soviet map began when Sheng Shicai's pro-Soviet attitude was questioned. The Soviet Union's request for this 86,000-kilometer land in Xinjiang through Outer Mongolia seems to be aimed at cutting off the entire Xinjiang from the interior of China. Luo also pointed out that between the Altai Mountains and Hami, there is only a desert of Gobi Desert. Hami and Qitai are both on the edge of the desert. Therefore, if the strategic stronghold of Beitashan, where the Xinjiang authorities regularly stationed heavy troops and civil officials, and other important mountain passes in the Altai Mountains are lost, the six cities will not be able to hold. Since Hami and Qitai have no natural defenses, the eastern gateway of Xinjiang, which is rich in oil and gold deposits, can be closed off and isolated from the interior of China at any time.

### US and Canadian Ambassadors Arrive in Jinan; Give Public Speeches This Morning and Return to Nanjing in the Afternoon; Envoy Says US Aid to China is Only a Matter of Form

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] US Ambassador Stuart Leighten and Canadian Ambassador Davis arrived in Jinan by special plane at 11:40 AM on the 4th. Provincial leaders such as Pang Jingtang went to the airport to welcome them. The ambassadors stayed at the British Consulate. At 4:30 PM, the envoy was invited to give a lecture to the educational circles of Shandong. At 6:00 PM, there was a tea party for American and Canadian expatriates in Jinan. At 7:30 PM, people from all walks of life hosted a banquet. It is scheduled that the ambassadors will be invited to give public speeches to people from all walks of life in Jinan on the morning of May 5th, visit various leaders, schools, factories, and hospitals here, and return to Nanjing in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] Ambassador Stuart answered questions from the Jinan press on the afternoon of the 4th. The main points are as follows: (1) China's current difficulties are internal, especially the need for knowledgeable youth and enlightened liberal elements to actively lead the new revolutionary construction movement, using construction to replace destruction. The efforts of the Chinese people can solve all problems. (2) The US attitude towards China and defeated Japan is that the US hopes that Japan will be strong, but it hopes that China will be even stronger. If Japan's economy cannot recover, it will inevitably be the root of future world peace crisis. (3) The ambassador deeply sympathizes with China's current difficulties, especially the suffering of the people. However, China's future, due to its long history, vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, as long as the people unite and make progress, everything is hopeful, and there is no need to be pessimistic and disappointed. (4) US aid to China is not a matter of principle, but a matter of form. It is believed that after Special Envoy Wedemeyer's investigation is completed this time, he will be able to provide the US government with reliable information and provide effective assistance to the Chinese government.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] Chairman Wang Yaowu returned to Jinan from the Tai'an Command Post at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. He met with Ambassadors Stuart and Davis for a long time that night, and the guests and hosts enjoyed a pleasant conversation.

### Stability in Various Banners in the Sui Border Region; Qi Junfeng and Shi Wang Buried Together

[Our Newspaper Gui Sui, 3rd] The Sui Security Division Commander, E You San, recently went to Bailing Temple to inspect the defense. His Chief of Staff, Zhao Shupu, arrived in the province from Sui Bei on the 3rd. According to reports: Bailing Temple is 300 li away from Outer Mongolia.

### Grain Collection Quota in Yunnan Province; Central Government Has Agreed to Reduce It

[Our Newspaper Kunming, 4th] The grain collection quota for Yunnan Province in 1947 has not been clearly decided. Provincial Chairman Guan Han, who is in Nanjing, has requested the central government to reduce it to 750,000 dan, and the request has been approved.

### Tanggu New Port Issue; Wedemeyer Mission to Discuss in Tianjin

[Associated Press Tianjin, 4th] General Wedemeyer flew here this morning from Peiping, and then met with Chinese military and political leaders and American business leaders, and is scheduled to meet with the Director of the "Tanggu New Port Construction Bureau" on the 5th. A semi-official Chinese source frankly stated that it hopes the United States can assist in completing China's only artificial port. It is reported that Tanggu New Port was secretly built by the Japanese during the tense war period, and was half completed by the end of the war. It is said that many Chinese workers who built the port were killed by the Japanese due to maintaining secrecy. It was only after the end of the war that the existence of the port was known. A semi-official source said: The new port is comparable to Qingdao's naval base. After completion, it can strengthen the control over the transportation of the Communist Party from Dalian to North China, and can also increase the convenience of transferring troops from South China to the Northeast war zone.

In commercial terms, after the completion of the new port, the largest transport ships can directly reach Tianjin. Currently, ships over 3,000 tons can only anchor outside the Tanggu port.

According to the plan, the embankment of the port is 17 kilometers long, making it the longest embankment in the world. In 1945, Thurman, the envoy of the Truman, inspected the new port, and he hoped that the United States could assist China in completing the port. Chinese officials said: China itself lacks funds and experienced engineers and cannot complete the port alone. Whether Wedemeyer will recommend that the United States assist is a problem.

First, Tianjin is a war zone and was threatened by the Communist army two months ago. If the Communist army launches an offensive in the Northeast in the fall, Tianjin will be severely threatened.

Second, at this time of overall trade stagnation, improving the port of Tianjin does not have much commercial significance unless Wedemeyer can bring a new policy to American commerce in China.

However, in military terms, because the port can be used as a naval port, it has great significance at present. Japan sent 700 technicians and thousands of Chinese workers under strict supervision to rush to build for three years, while the citizens of Tianjin knew nothing about it at the time. US planes never bombed the area. The iron and iron ore needed by Japan's war industry were transported back to Japan through this port. The Japanese Navy Department also planned that if the United States invaded Japan, the Japanese Navy would use this port and Qingdao to control the waters of North China.

### Closing of the National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party; Zhang Junmai Reelected as Chairman; Opposition Faction to Hold National Congress on a Regular Basis

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party closed yesterday. When the congress was held yesterday morning, 142 representatives attended and carried out election work. Zhang Junmai was re-elected as the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party with an absolute majority of 139 votes. The position of vice chairman was postponed for the time being due to various reasons. A total of 115 central executive committee members were elected, of which 85 were from domestic and 30 were from overseas. A total of 15 supervisory committee members were elected. After the election results were tallied in the afternoon, the chairman delivered a speech to close the meeting. A declaration was issued after the meeting, with five points: (1) Hope that the government and the Chinese Communist Party will disarm and release soldiers, and work together to build the country. (2) Implement democratic constitutionalism. (3) Participate in the general election, hoping for harmonious competition and realizing the spirit of Tao. (4) Implement major political reforms. (5) Promote the determination of national self-reliance.

[Another Report] The overseas general branch of the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to unite the reformists and convene a national congress on the 15th of this month, and believes that Zhang Junmai is surrounded by subordinates and can no longer exercise the power of the party leader. Therefore, Vice Chairman Wu Xianzi was appointed to act as the chairman. According to relevant sources, the total number of overseas party members of the reformists has exceeded the number of party members led by Zhang Junmai.

They presented a written report to Wedemeyer, explaining that the trade of overseas Chinese merchants in Tianjin had almost come to a standstill due to difficult transportation in the Chinese mainland, making it impossible to concentrate export goods, and foreign exchange controls, which made it inconvenient to import goods. Wedemeyer offered his encouragement. After the meeting, at 5:10 PM, he inspected the 7th Service Company of the US Marine Corps and held talks with acting commander Hoskins.

Although I cannot fulfill the previous appointment now, I can provide consultation on hometown affairs. What I talked about with Wedemeyer in Beijing and Beiping can be said to include everything from top to bottom, past and present.

### Adjusting Civil Servant Salaries; This Time, the Focus is on Regional Level Adjustments; The Basic Amount Will Increase, but the Multiplier Will Not

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The method for adjusting civil servant salaries was brought up again for discussion at the Budget Committee of the Executive Yuan on the 4th. Because the method for adjusting the salaries of military personnel has not been determined, the discussion today did not reach a conclusion. After the standard for military personnel salaries is determined by the Ministry of National Defense and submitted to the Budget Committee for discussion, it can be passed by the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday. It is reported that this adjustment focuses on regional level adjustments. For example, the Wuhan area was originally second-class and will be upgraded to first-class this time. The general adjustment principle is that the multiplier will not be increased, only the basic amount will be adjusted. For example, the base amount of the first-class is 340,000, which will be increased to 440,000. This method will be implemented from August as soon as it is passed by the Executive Yuan meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The method of distributing rations to public officials in the Beijing-Shanghai area was originally said to be extended to other areas, but there are some technical difficulties in implementing this. Some people suggested issuing cash allowances in other areas. The authorities are considering this matter and will discuss it at a recent Executive Yuan meeting.

### National Army in Shandong Suddenly Enters Yidu; Bandits Along the Yellow River Also Unable to Flee; National Army Intensifies Pursuit, Bandits Fall into Despair

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] Yidu is currently the next target of the National Army's attack in central Shandong. The bandit army secretly dispatched two columns to the area. It is reported that the National Army suddenly entered Yidu at 8:00 PM last night. Battles are taking place at various foreign strongholds outside Linqu, which are of the nature of clearing the battlefield.

### UNRRA Configures Generators in Guilin and Liuzhou, Transfers to Power Plants After Successful Testing

[Report from Our Newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Medical Unit recently announced that the testing and installation of UNRRA generators in Liuzhou and Guilin have been completed by UNRRA's power experts. The two places were the most severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and their power plants often failed during air raids. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, they were so damaged that they could not be repaired. Therefore, both places obtained priority in UNRRA's power plant restoration plan. Liuzhou obtained a 500-kilowatt steam generator, and Guilin obtained two sets. At the beginning of this year, it was conducted under the guidance of UNRRA power experts Keber and Williams. When the two engineers measured the installation situation last week, they believed that it had reached the standard, so they handed it over to the local municipal power plant for acceptance. According to UNRRA's plan, it plans to provide China with 69 sets of generators, with a total power generation capacity of 58,000 kilowatts. It was originally planned to provide 12 sets of generators to the government areas and Communist areas in North China, with power generation ranging from 500 kilowatts to 2,000 kilowatts. Now, because UNRRA has banned the transportation of materials to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude, the generators have also been temporarily suspended.

### Editorial: Our Country's Foreign Trade Problem

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the government's implementation of trade control policies, people both at home and abroad have focused their attention on the various forms of so-called "discriminatory treatment" and "powerful family capital." General Wedemeyer's recent visit to Shanghai reportedly prompted American businessmen in Shanghai to question these two points. At the same time, the Central Daily News in Nanjing published an investigative report on "Fuchong" and "Yangzi" and other "powerful family capital," with staggering figures that shocked the nation. This newspaper once published an article urging calm thinking and detailed investigation, suggesting that the aforementioned report had omitted decimal points, leading to misunderstanding and further fueling the public's outrage over "powerful family capital." In reality, the power of "powerful family capital" was not as great as imagined, as they only obtained 0.87% of the total foreign exchange, less than 1%. The so-called "power" was truly pitiful. The Central Daily News later issued a statement admitting the error and making corrections. Simultaneously, the government authorities released information on the import and foreign exchange settlement situations of Fuchong, Yangzi, and other companies, confirming that the total amount of foreign exchange settled by these two companies accounted for approximately 0.0038 of the total foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank during the same period—which also included their export earnings. The true nature of "powerful family capital" was thus revealed to the world. As the general foreign public is now focusing on China's trade situation, we would like to offer some brief comments here.

First, we must point out that given the current situation in China, the government has no choice but to implement trade controls and manage imports. We have previously commented on China's current situation, particularly regarding the economic situation, stating: "The economic difficulties currently facing China are inextricably linked to the evolution of the political situation. The existence of the Communist bandits makes a thorough reform of China's economy, including a thorough reform of the currency system, impossible... However, the government, within its power, should do its utmost to salvage the current economic decline and cannot abandon this responsibility. This is why we see various economic controls, including import and export controls. Since there are controls, there are also restrictions on freedom..." The "discriminatory treatment" that is generally perceived is, in essence, largely due to the restrictions on "free trade." The Chinese government's policy has expressed welcome for foreign investment, and it would certainly not discriminate against Chinese and foreign businessmen. We have no discriminatory legislation, so there is no basis for talking about discrimination in China's foreign trade. This is a point we should emphasize.

Because there are controls, there are agencies, which inevitably lead to personnel issues. Delays in official documents and emotional biases may undoubtedly be irritating, but this is not a matter of law or policy. Such phenomena can occur anywhere in the world and are not unique to China. The Chinese government does not believe that the current control measures are beyond modification. As long as there is sufficient reason, we firmly believe that the Chinese government is prepared to accept suggestions and revise them at any time. As for delays in procedures and the occasional lack of dedication among minor officials, the government is also paying attention to these issues and seeking to improve them. China is currently in an extraordinary period, and we should have great patience.

We must also point out that the entire world has not yet returned to a state of tranquility, and world trade has not yet returned to normal. Under these circumstances, our foreign trade cannot be an exception. Only when the entire world returns to peace can world trade return to its normal track. Those engaged in trade should not focus solely on money but should take a longer-term perspective. We must understand why the world has not yet returned to peace and solve this major problem before international business and trade relations can develop normally. Similarly, those engaged in Chinese business and trade must understand why China has not yet returned to peace. Only after this problem is solved can China's foreign trade have normal development.

### Spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice Discusses Prison Reform: Number of Inmate Workers Reaches Over 140,000

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice and Administration, regarding the reform of Chinese prisons, stated: Since the abolition of consular jurisdiction, the Ministry has made prison reform a central task for the high courts of each province and their subordinate courts and prisons. The improvements and their effects are briefly described as follows:

(1) Improving Prison Construction: The Ministry has instructed each province, according to health standards, to first improve the construction of prison cells and workshops. The capacity of each prison cell and workshop must be based on adequate lighting and ventilation, and an appropriate number of inmates must be stipulated. Separate infirmaries must be established for sick inmates. Other facilities for inmate education, exercise, and recreation must be appropriately arranged. As of the end of June this year, the provinces and cities have improved 121 new prisons and 595 new-style detention centers.

(2) Improving Prison Hygiene: In June of the 30th year [1941], the Ministry issued six articles of "Prison Hygiene Precautions" and ordered them to be followed. In August of the 32nd year [1943], "Cleaning Items for Each Prison" were established and the prisons in each region were ordered to implement them conscientiously, and each prison was required to submit monthly reports on the implementation. Regarding the nutrition of inmates, based on the principles of righteousness and science, the Ministry studied the required amount of staple and non-staple food for each inmate per day, and drafted "Methods for Checking Prison Rations," stipulating that each inmate must be provided with the prescribed amount of staple and non-staple food daily, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and then ordered to be implemented in each province. Foreign inmates were given appropriate food based on their dietary habits and nutritional standards.

(3) Expanding Prison Labor: In the rear area, 86-87% of prisons have already established workshops. In the recovered area, from January of the 35th year [1946] to the end of May of the 36th year [1947], over 46% of prisons have been equipped with workshops. As of the end of May of the 36th year [1947], the number of workers has reached 144,867, accounting for over 78% of the actual number of inmates.

(4) Other: In order to align with the penal systems of other countries, the Ministry has reorganized the "Prison Regulations" and the "Provisional Regulations for Detention Centers," and drafted the "Prison Sentencing Law," "Detention Law," "Prison Regulations," "Detention Center Regulations," and "Progressive Treatment Regulations for Execution," which were promulgated by the National Government and implemented on June 10 of the 36th year [1947].

### American Soldiers' Homicide in Nanjing Fully Proven: Case Closed and Trial to Begin; U.S. Advisory Group Invites Chinese Observers to Attend Trial

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] All parties are paying close attention to the development of the tragic case of American soldiers throwing a Chinese air force soldier into the water outside Guangfengmen, resulting in his death. According to Captain Bauwar, the head of the military police of the U.S. Advisory Group, the entire case has been investigated and sufficient evidence of the crimes of Adori, Shuang Fanni, and others has been obtained. A spokesperson for the Advisory Group stated: Preliminary investigation work has been completed, and various trial steps are being prepared. The presiding judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney will be designated and announced shortly, and Chinese parties involved will be invited to send observers to attend the trial, with notices being issued soon. Tu Zhonghai, who witnessed the tragic deaths of the two victims, and Cheng Chaozong, the Chinese military police officer who identified the suspects, will both testify at the trial.

### A Jurist Discusses Crime and Punishment with Reporters

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] On the 4th, a reporter inquired with a jurist regarding Captain Bauwar of the U.S. Military Police Corps' statement that the maximum punishment for the perpetrators in the case would be five to ten years in prison. The jurist explained that Bauwar's statement was based on two assumptions: First, although the perpetrators were military police, they were not on duty at the time of the crime and therefore could not be treated as military police; second, the perpetrators committed the crime while intoxicated. Of the two, the first assumption is particularly important. Whether being off duty affects their status as military police is a matter that can be studied. If the first assumption cannot be established, the second assumption would only aggravate their crime. We hope that the U.S. military will handle the matter with caution and not distort its own laws in order to reduce the guilt of its soldiers. Although this case is being handled by the U.S. military in accordance with the "Regulations for Handling Criminal Cases Involving U.S. Military Personnel in China," our observers may reserve their opinions when necessary and raise concerns through diplomatic channels.

### Security Council Achieves Unprecedented Success: India and the Netherlands Both Issue Ceasefire Orders; Indonesia Insists Dutch Troops Withdraw to Original Defense Lines

[Reported by This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th Radio: A State Department spokesperson stated that the United States has not yet proposed mediation in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to Indonesia. Whether to propose directly to Indonesia later has not been decided.

[United Press, Batavia, 4th] The Indonesian Republic issued a ceasefire order today and requested the United Nations Security Council to appoint an arbitration committee to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire by both sides. This is the first major victory for the United Nations organization in striving for peace since its establishment. The ceasefire order was broadcast by Radio Yogyakarta at 1:00 PM today (10:00 PM Shanghai time). President Sukarno will deliver a broadcast speech as the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces this afternoon. The Dutch ceasefire order was announced yesterday and took effect at midnight today. According to a Dutch spokesperson, most Dutch troops had already stopped advancing, and there was little activity in the area of Semarang today.

[United Press, Batavia, 4th] According to Indonesian sources, Prime Minister Sjahrir and Deputy Prime Minister Setiadjit met with government officials this afternoon and then departed for Batavia and Yogyakarta, respectively, with undisclosed destinations. Before the Prime Minister returns to office, the Indonesian government will not issue any further statements regarding the United Nations Security Council's instructions. The Security Council's note directly addressed Sjahrir as "Prime Minister of the Government of the Indonesian Republic," which Indonesian officials particularly emphasized, believing that it demonstrated that the United Nations organization has already recognized the Government of the Indonesian Republic.

[Reuters, Bombay, 4th] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir departed from Bombay for Lake Success today. At the airport, Sjahrir told reporters: The purpose of going to New York is to find out what the Security Council can do. If the United Nations organization allows the Dutch to occupy the land they have seized in the past two weeks, then a mere ceasefire would only benefit the Dutch. This measure is insufficient to solve the Indonesian problem and is not what Indonesia wants. The Dutch must withdraw to their original defense lines before negotiations can begin. Sjahrir is expected to arrive in New York within three or four days.

[Reuters, The Hague, 3rd] The Dutch government announced that after the Netherlands issues a ceasefire order in Indonesia, Dutch troops will temporarily remain in the territory of the Republic that they have occupied since the outbreak of the war.

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] The Indonesian government issued an important statement tonight, demanding that the Netherlands abandon the gains of the past thirteen days as a prerequisite for a ceasefire, and requesting that the Security Council designate several countries, with the consent of both Indonesia and the Netherlands, to organize an arbitration committee to mediate.

[United Press, Batavia, 4th] A Dutch military spokesperson announced approximately twelve hours before the ceasefire deadline that Dutch troops had landed on the island of Madura, off the east coast of Java, and were transporting large quantities of rice to supply the island's more than one million residents.

### Indonesian Hostility Towards Overseas Chinese: Legacy of Japanese Poison

[Central Press, Batavia, 4th] The reasons for the large-scale looting and burning of overseas Chinese property by Indonesian troops and mobs are summarized as follows: (1) Jealousy of the deeply entrenched economic power of the overseas Chinese, because Indonesian youths were poisoned by Japanese propaganda during the war; (2) Although Indonesia is rich in resources, the people are extremely poor, ignorant, and unable to distinguish right from wrong. During disturbances, they always believe that they can burn and loot without being punished; (3) Overseas Chinese have not expressed enthusiastic sympathy for the Indonesian independence movement, because overseas Chinese are in a very difficult position in the Dutch-Indonesian political dispute. Pleasing one side will inevitably offend the other; (4) Most Indonesian youths join the army to make a living, initially not considering the interests of the country and nation. They know very well that joining any combat group, whether equipped with weapons or bamboo spears, can provide them with a living; (5) Indonesian officials lack the ability to maintain law and order, especially in outlying areas; (6) Indonesian officials, including the police, lack a sense of responsibility. Once something happens, officials and police pack up and flee; (7) The decline in general living standards has led to illegal activities. Except for a small number who can receive salaries, other combat units must find their own means of support.

### Overseas Chinese Defend Themselves: Organize Volunteer Security Teams

[United Press, Medan, Sumatra, 4th] A Chinese volunteer security team of 700 people, including some who participated in the Chinese army before the war, is now protecting overseas Chinese in newly occupied areas by the Dutch army to prevent Indonesian attacks. The security team is patrolling before the Dutch ceasefire deadline. If the Indonesian army does not cease hostilities, they are prepared to continue patrolling. The backbone of the security team is former captured Chinese soldiers dispatched by the Japanese army to serve as labor battalions here. The reporter visited Padangsidimpuan, the Indonesian deputy capital of Sumatra, which was occupied by the Dutch army on July 30th, and saw several trucks of overseas Chinese arriving.

### Security Council to Discuss Egyptian Complaint Against Britain Today

### Jewish Terrorists Vow Revenge for the Dead

Their secret radio station also said, "The hanged British sergeants Martin and Price were spies. We executed them as our duty to our frontline fighters."

### Churchill Delivers Speech: Admits Severity of British Economic Crisis; British Government May Abandon Socialist Experiment

[Our Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): Churchill delivered an important speech today, admitting that Britain is currently in a deep crisis and declining daily. He reportedly said: "Britain is now relying on foreign aid to survive, a situation more bleak than during the war." Churchill emphasized that the United States must increase its aid to Britain, otherwise the sacrifices made by the United States for Britain during the war will have been in vain.

[United Press London, 3rd] Most London newspapers today speculated that the Labour government, given the urgency of the economic crisis, may have to postpone or even abandon the major industrial nationalization bills currently being implemented. Most Britons are on weekend vacation, while the authorities are busy drafting emergency measures to address the economic crisis, leaving them no time to comment on the reports. Therefore, the future of the Labour government's socialist policies remains a mystery for the time being.

The "London Observer," known for its reliable sources, reported that the steel industry nationalization bill, originally planned to be submitted for discussion after Parliament reconvenes in October, now appears to be abandoned. The cabinet discussed this issue during the past week, and although no final decision has been made, cabinet members strongly believe that this is not the right time. However, the suspension of nationalization plans for steel, gas, and electricity will also draw severe criticism from most supporters, who believe that socialism must be implemented quickly if the British economy is to be placed on a solid foundation once and for all. The Conservative Party will naturally be pleased with the voluntary abandonment of socialist experiments, as it has strongly opposed the steel nationalization plan.

### London to Host Negotiations to Revise Anglo-Iraqi Treaty

[Reuters Baghdad, 3rd] Well-informed sources say that negotiations to revise the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty will begin in London this week or early next week. The Iraqi delegation will be led by Prime Minister Jabr himself, and will include the ambassador to London, Senate Speaker Saeed, Foreign Minister Jamali, and others. It is understood that discussions will be limited to the following four points: (1) the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq, including the Royal Air Force units guarding the Habbaniyah and Shaibah bases; (2) the appointment of British advisors and military missions; (3) economic and trade relations; and (4) the future of the Port of Basra and the Iraqi State Railways. The 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which expires in 1957, is an alliance treaty that stipulates that the Iraqi government shall allow British troops to be stationed in Iraq, cooperate with Britain in defense matters, and provide airbase facilities to Britain.

### US Army, Navy, and Air Force Unified Command: Forrestal Drafts Detailed Plan; Greater Power Can Be Unleashed in Case of Emergency

[United Press Washington, 4th] According to military sources: US Secretary of Defense Forrestal is currently considering a plan to completely reorganize the armed forces in order to unify the command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on the US mainland. This plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The plan stipulates the establishment of a supreme commander, with a staff composed of Army, Navy, and Air Force generals, directly under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will then command the US border defense matters.

The plan also stipulates that the country will be divided into major military regions, each with a commander-in-chief who will command all three services in that region. This commander will be responsible for actual combat strategy, but not for supply and military administration. Military authorities believe that Forrestal can implement this plan through an executive order without the need for congressional approval. In fact, similar plans already exist overseas. For example, MacArthur commands all three services in the Far East, and Brigadier General Craig commands the three services in Alaska. Under this organization, the Air Force Commander, strategically important, will likely retain its military power as a self-contained system for long-range attacks on enemy countries with atomic weapons. On the US mainland, each theater commander is responsible for the unified national defense plan and, in the event of an emergency, is responsible for directing operations. The routine administrative activities of each department of the plan will not be changed, but its advantage is that the Army, Navy, and Air Force can jointly strike against an enemy attempting to attack the United States.

### Japan Still Actively Preparing for Antarctic Whaling

[United Press Tokyo, 4th] A Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry spokesman said: Preparations for whaling in Antarctica in early November are in full swing.

The government's finances are indeed difficult, but due to the severity of the food situation, the government will definitely send a whaling fleet to Antarctica.

### Soviets Celebrate Aviation Day: Hold Large-Scale Aircraft Display

[Reuters Moscow, 3rd] Today is Soviet Aviation Day, and Moscow held a large-scale aviation display. Radio stations emphasized the Soviet Union's ambition to become a world aviation leader. Soviet Air Force Chief of Staff General Shtupov broadcasted: Marshal Stalin has stipulated the task of the Russian people as "to fly more, fly faster, and fly higher than anyone else." The Soviet Union already holds 65 of the 170 international aviation distance and altitude records. Marshal Astapov, Director of the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, wrote in the newspaper that the cargo capacity of Soviet civil aviation aircraft has increased five and a half times compared to before the war, and the number of passengers carried in 1947 is expected to increase five times compared to 1940. Moscow also announced that aircraft designers Yakovlev and Ilyushin are designing a civil aviation aircraft that can complete the 1,600-kilometer journey to East Island Ral in four hours, and it will only take one day to fly from Moscow to the southernmost city in Central Asia. Marshal Stalin and senior government leaders today visited the aircraft display at the Moscow airfield. Six different types of jet-propelled aircraft, including the Yakovlev fighter, made their first public appearance. "Reaction Assisted" (i.e., rocket-assisted propulsion) aircraft also participated in the performance. Jet fighters painted red formed various formations and soared in the blue sky, with extremely beautiful postures.

### Soviets Expand German-Polish Trade Relations: Form Eastern Economic Group; Polish Deputy Prime Minister Explains Economic Policy

[United Press Berlin, 3rd] According to reliable sources: Representatives of the German Central Government and the Polish Government in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany have begun negotiations to expand trade relations, with the aim of consolidating the economic relations between the Soviet occupation zone and Poland, and concentrating the Eastern Economic Group. It is heard that the main negotiators are Morysi, Polish State Councilor and current head of the delegation, and Olerup, Minister of Foreign Trade of the German Central Government, and Selman, Minister of Economy of Saxony. The starting point of the negotiations is based on the agreement signed by the two parties in April of this year, which stipulates that the exchanged goods are standardized at US$28 million. The new agreement will expand the items and quantities of exchanged goods in order to lay the foundation for the economic integrity of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and form an Eastern Group of Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other countries.

[Reuters Pi Langerdinia City, 3rd] Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the International Trade Fair here, stating that Poland cannot accept economic cooperation with other countries under the conditions determined by monopoly capitalism, but Poland will continue to pursue its commercial exchange policy with various countries. Gomulka also protested against the United States' decision to stop providing relief to Poland.

### Allied Control Council to Meet on Thursday to Discuss Japan's Foreign Trade Issues; Soviet Representative Raises Three Questions

[United Press Tokyo, 4th] The 38th meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan will be held on Thursday of this week to discuss the future prospects for the development of Japan's export trade in 1947-1948 after the opening of private trade in Japan. This issue was raised by Soviet representative Major General Kislenko, who will represent Treffyanko, who is on leave returning to Moscow, at the Control Council.

### Far East Tribunal Resumes Trial

Japanese Lawyer Makes Absurd Remarks

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 4th] The Far East Military Tribunal resumed its trial work on the 4th, and the defendant's defense lawyers made a joint defense presentation on the part of Japan's launch of the Pacific War. Lawyer Takahashi first defended, saying: "The Pacific War was Japan's means of self-defense, not a war of aggression, so all the defendants are engaged in self-defense struggles." The reasons he cited were even more absurd and outrageous: (1) Japan's industrial economy developed in response to the needs of the people, so in the final stage, it transformed its necessary parts into war use; (2) Japan's population increased and land was insufficient, so the only result was to seek industrialization, but due to the scarcity of resources, it was bound to rely on foreign trade, but since 1931, high tariffs and import restrictions from various countries have hindered Japan's trade, and Japan's economy has been oppressed by this, so there was a sudden counterattack on December 8, 1941; (3) European and American countries promoted economic encirclement against Japan on one hand, and actively prepared for war against Japan on the other hand, and there was no fact that Japan had a joint conspiracy between the army and navy to launch a war of aggression. The views and thoughts of the army and navy at that time were opposed to each other.

### Jindu Bloodshed Case Enters Legal Stage; Chief Chen Orders Resolution Within a Week; Bao Qihuang Ordered to Arrive in Shanghai to Preside Over Trial

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, who was ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the Jindu massacre, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 4th and immediately reported the investigation process to Chief Chen Yi, who forwarded it to the Chairman. The investigation has been completed, and the next step will be to enter the legal stage to seek a resolution. After listening to Deputy Minister Qin's report, Chief Chen immediately instructed several points of handling and limited the solution to within a week. On the evening of the 4th, Deputy Minister Qin met with our reporter and said about the training and investigation opinions: Both sides lacked sincerity, and they shirked each other in the pursuit of the first shot. In fact, both sides were at fault. If one side had made concessions, the fight would not have broken out. Qin also expressed regret over the fact that soldiers enforcing the law violated the law. It is said that the task of the police is to crack down on people who do not abide by the law, and the task of the military police is to crack down on soldiers who do not abide by the law. Both sides are responsible for maintaining local order. It is deeply regrettable that this kind of incident disrupted the order and that law enforcement violated the law. As for future handling, it will be resolved according to the law. First, it will be handed over to the military law for handling. Police officers without military status will be handed over to the judiciary for trial again. Qin said that the investigation work has been completed. He will no longer go to Shanghai, and the Ministry of National Defense will send responsible personnel from the military law department to Shanghai to assist in the resolution.

According to Bao, he will continue to investigate before the trial begins. On the morning of the 4th, Bao visited Tao Yishan, director of the Investigation Office, and Zeng Zhaoyi, director of the Military Law Office, to discuss the matter. In the evening, Wu Guangyun, commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, visited Bao at the Ministry of National Defense guest house on Yu Yuan Road. Bao is scheduled to go to Jindu tomorrow to conduct an on-site inspection. In the afternoon, he will interrogate relevant witnesses and some officers and soldiers of the Military Police Regiment.

### Zijiang Wheel Case Continues; Company Says Unable to Salvage; Civil Claim Seeks Nearly 500 Million Yuan; Court Orders Continued Mediation

[Our Dispatch] The Zijiang Wheel sinking tragedy continued to be heard in the first criminal court of the District Court yesterday. Only Xin Chengfang, captain of the Zijiang Wheel, and Li Qianyu, manager of the Tongji Steamship Company, and Zhou Naimeng, representative, attended the trial. According to Zhou Naihao, "Li Qianyu has gone to Tianjin and entrusted me to represent him. As for the company's recovery of corpses and sunken ships, according to the port law, if a ship sinks in a port due to an accident, the port director must be responsible if the shipowner is unable to salvage it. However, the port director said that Li already owed 5 million yuan in salvage fees and told Li that if the port authority was required to be responsible for the salvage, he should submit a written request, which Li had done. According to estimates, the cost of salvaging everything on the Zijiang Wheel is more than 450 million yuan, but the ship is only worth more than 100 million yuan after it is salvaged. The company cannot afford this loss." Then the witness Zhang Kunsheng, acting police chief of the Wusong Branch of the Port Police Department, was summoned. It is said that "Wang Hai, the port affairs section of the Customs Office, successively salvaged twelve corpses on March 1, 7, and April 2, six of whom had Zijiang Wheel tickets and six did not. Whether there are still corpses in the ship now can only be known after it is salvaged." Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, representing 33 families of the victims, requested an incidental civil claim of 490.1 million yuan (not the total amount), and stated the difficult living conditions of the family members of each victim, and asked the court to order the company to compensate a part first to be used to maintain living expenses. The court adjourned the trial to August 18 because Zhang Jinsheng, the captain of the Huatong Wheel, an important defendant in the case, had not arrived. The civil part ordered both parties to continue to attempt reconciliation out of court. Also, Zhou Haigen, a relative of the victims of the Zijiang Wheel, sued Li Qianyu, the manager of Tongji Company, for repeatedly delaying the recovery of corpses and attempting to destroy evidence. He filed a complaint with the court, and the District Prosecutor's Office has prosecuted him. The trial will begin in the second criminal court on the 7th of this month.

### Over Two Hundred Businesses Accuse a Local Thug of Eight Dramatic Crimes; Military Commander Orders Thorough Investigation

Yesterday, over two hundred merchants from eleven roads including Ying Shi Road, Huang Pi Road, West Gate Road, and Xing Ye Road in the former French Concession jointly filed a complaint with the Garrison Headquarters, accusing Yang Bu You, a local thug residing at No. 111 Wang Zhi Road, and listing eight "dramatic" charges. Commander Xuan was enraged upon reading the complaint and issued a hand order to the Investigation Department to conduct a thorough investigation. A reporter from the Hua Jing News Agency has excerpted the original text of the eight major charges as follows: There are a great many unemployed vagrants in the former French Concession. This has become a common practice. Although there has been a crackdown in the past, these people do not till the land but eat, do not weave but wear clothes, and are always capable of extortion and theft. Those who have suffered directly from them are countless. Yang Bu You is the leader of these hooligans. Before the war, he faced criminal charges in the Huaiyin Commissioner's Office, and during the occupation, he was imprisoned in the "Wang Jingwei Regime" for two and a half years. He is truly guilty of heinous crimes and deserves to be killed. His most serious crimes include: (1)

Little Cowherd: Yang Bu You has recruited about a hundred petty thieves and rascals as his disciples, forming the Little Yellow Gang. They specialize in helping to push tricycles and rickshaws on the Suzhou Creek, extorting money from customers. Every night, they divide the spoils on the spot. Even children with no income are temporarily lent money by Yang. Another part of his gang specializes in staging injuries and picking pockets. They divide the spoils every three days, feasting on wine and meat in the style of Liangshan Marsh. (2)

Joyful Arrival: South of Linsen Road and north of Xujiahui, when shops open, it is customary for a group of beggar-like people to come to congratulate them, demanding money by force; otherwise, they will occupy and disturb the premises until their demands are met. The former French Concession is said to be divided into seven areas, and Yang Bu You's territory includes West Gate Road, Chongde Road, Ying Shi Road, Huang Pi Road, and Shunchang Road. When new stores open in this area, he must handle everything, sending people to solicit payments, with the highest amount reaching seven million. Moreover, the signature on the shop sign is Yang Bu You, which is clear evidence that he is handling everything, hoping to scare off other competitors. (3)

Demanding Jingzhou: In addition to handling the expenses for newly opened businesses, Yang Bu You also demands goods, such as toothbrushes and water bottles from department stores, and wool and tweed from silk shops. The same applies to other businesses. Looking at the furniture and decorations in Yang Bu You's home, their origin is all free. He "forcibly seizes Jingzhou" without considering the cost to others. (4)

Capturing and Releasing Cao Cao: In the lower social circles of the Nanshi area, when there are quarrels and fights, they often ask Yang to mediate. After paying a certain amount for transportation, Yang has people capture the other party and scold them at tea houses and restaurants. The justification depends on the amount of money paid. Whichever party prepares the preliminary conditions first can go home. Those without money must be detained for one or two days until their greed is satisfied before being released. (5)

Gathering of Heroes: The practice of forming mutual aid societies has become a thing of the past because every society will eventually dissolve, and many people are deterred. Yang has a novel idea: he invites people to contribute to a society of 100,000 or 200,000, feasts everyone on a selected date, and has each person pay their contribution. Those who draw the lucky number will have their principal returned in installments, while the weak are like meat buns thrown to dogs, with no return. A group of wandering thugs are truly pitiful. (6)

Copper Net Formation: Sending out invitations and playing music has long been banned. Most hooligans have disappeared, but Yang blatantly ignores this. At least twice a year, either for birthdays or anniversaries, he distributes red scarves to shops, demanding 30,000 or 50,000, trying to get as much money as possible. He held one event on April 14th this year, reportedly earning one or two million. It is rare to see such a rogue sending out invitations. (7)

Powder Chamber: Yang is also involved in drug trafficking. He was reported last year, and he fled upon hearing the news. Nineteen small packets of heroin were found in his residence at No. 111 Wang Zhi Road. He still dares not surrender to the local court. (8)

Severing the Sutra Hall: Yang Bu You's first wife was a Wang from Huai'an. They were married for three years but had no affection. Her father was hypocritical and resembled Wang Mang, unaware of his son-in-law's behavior and wanting to report him to the authorities. Yang preemptively killed his concubine and fled to Shanghai, where he married Wang. During the victory two years ago, the Youth League arrested hooligans, and Yang escaped while his wife secretly left and has not returned. Yang used the case to frame his enemy, Lu Pengfei, causing the Lu family to be ruined. Now Yang is cohabiting with a concubine of a traitor and concealing a large number of counterfeit assets. He is incredibly bold.

### Zheng Hong Nian's Sham Trial Concludes; Admits Only Being "Nominally" Employed at "Central China Railway"; Lin Kang Hou and Tang Chou Min Have Nothing to Say

[Our Reporter] Zheng Hong Nian, former president of National Jinan University and president of the puppet Central China Railway Company, was accused of being a suspected traitor. The High Court originally sentenced him to eight years in prison, but Zheng appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The case concluded yesterday at the High Court, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 11th. During yesterday's hearing, the High Court summoned Lin Kang Hou and Tang Shou Min to testify. Zheng, wearing a beige silk robe, looked old and frail. He testified, "I originally did not want to come out and work and repeatedly refused, but I had no choice but to take the position of president of the puppet Central China Railway Company. I am old and cannot handle practical responsibilities, only holding a nominal position at the puppet Central China Railway Company. The actual responsibility was borne by the Japanese vice president." When questioning the witnesses, Lin Kang Hou and Tang Shou Min testified, "Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the three of us were in Hong Kong. After Hong Kong fell, the enemy threatened us to take puppet positions, which we refused. Later, we were escorted to Shanghai by the Japanese. As for Zheng's rescue of underground workers during his tenure in the puppet position, you must ask Wu Shao Shu. Regarding the preservation of the railway, you must ask Shi Yu Shou. We are not aware of the situation." After the prosecutor's arguments and the defendant's lawyer's defense, the court scheduled a date for the verdict, and the defendant and witnesses were returned to custody.

### Deadline for Exemption Applications; District Reviews Begin Tomorrow

Urging Citizens Not to Request Transfers Temporarily

[Our Reporter] The city's extended deadline for applying for exemption from military service for eligible draftees (including technical workers) expires today. The Civil Affairs Bureau announced that it will no longer accept further applications. At the same time, the work of investigating applications for exemption from military service in each Bao has ended today. Opinions have been signed in the investigation results column of each Bao, serial numbers have been assigned, and the documents have been bound into volumes. Three copies of the name list of draftees exempt from military service have been prepared and sent to the district office. The district review period will be from tomorrow to the 15th.

[Additional News] On the eve of the start of military service conscription, many citizens in each district are requesting to move out of the area.

### Fifteen Lives Lost in Qingpu; Township Head of Xiaoyin Denies Involvement

[Our Reporter] Zou Bao Xian, the puppet Township Head of Xianyuan Township in Qingpu County, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court for the bloodbath in which fifteen lives were tragically lost during the enemy puppet period. Yu Kesheng, the puppet Township Head of Xiaoyin Township and a suspect in the same case, fled while charged with a serious crime. The High Prosecutor's Office sent a document to the Qingpu County Government requesting his arrest. After the Qingpu County arrested Yu, he was escorted to the High Prosecutor's Office on the 24th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, the High Prosecutor's Office transferred Yu to the Special Criminal Court of the High Court for legal action. Judge Qiu Huan Ying immediately interrogated Yu. Yu was thin and short, wearing a blue cotton short shirt and white cotton shorts. He testified, "I became the Township Head of Xiaoyin Township in August of the 33rd year. I was not involved in the case of the fifteen lives. Xianyuan Township and Xiaoyin Township are more than five Li apart. I did not go to the meeting they summoned. On the night of the incident, I only heard the sound of gongs. Later, I heard people say that a dozen bandits were killed by the guerrillas. I do not know the other details." The court ordered the legal clerk to take Yu into custody because the case still required a substantive confrontation with Zou.

### A Citizen in His Fifties Volunteers for Military Service

[Our Reporter] Mayor Wu recently received a petition from citizen Cao Xianglin, stating that he was willing to comply with national laws and volunteer for military service, requesting to be enlisted as a volunteer soldier. Cao is currently employed at the British Tramway Company in the city, residing in the B household, No. 10 Jia, No. 69 Bao, 5th District. He is fifty years old.

After receiving the petition, Mayor Wu ordered him to consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau since the citizen was fifty years old, which was not in accordance with the provisions of the military service law.

### A Glorious Old Barber Talks About the Past by the Mirror; Many Party and State Elders Had Their Hair Done by Him

Began Cutting Braids for Revolutionary Comrades; Thirty-Six Years of Barbering

[Special Report] Time is a cruel tide, and history is forever churning in its giant waves. While the waves are full of floods, there are also bubbles. Cherishing and collecting some bubbles may be helpful for future historical records! We visited a person who has experienced the vicissitudes of life with this in mind. This is a barber who has spent thirty-six years with a razor in his hand. (See attached photo, taken by this newspaper)

We met this barber on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Association. His name is Luo Boli, from Shunde, Guangdong. He is fifty-two years old this year. When he said his first sentence: "I joined the Tongmenghui in Manila when I was eighteen," I was surprised. It turned out that he was a veteran of the revolution! His barbering career began in the first year of Xuantong because he had a special task at that time, which was to cut braids for revolutionary comrades. So from the Philippines to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, he officially picked up the razor and became a barber at "Yi Le Ye".

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Haircut Never Exceeded Ten Minutes

"Yi Le Ye" was on the bottom floor next to the Daxin Company at the time, and it was the only barber shop of its size in Shanghai. Because he had that past connection, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen came to Shanghai, he was always in charge of cutting his hair. Dr. Sun Yat-sen lived at No. 14 Muliduoa Road (a road near Fuxing Park now). The furnishings in his home were extremely simple. The only people living with him were two adjutants and Mr. Hu Hanmin. Due to his busy state affairs, he had his hair cut only twice a month, and each time never exceeded ten minutes. He said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was very simple when it came to grooming. His hair was stiff and he never used oil. When shaving his face, he often inquired about the organization of the Shanghai labor union, urging him to set an example and be responsible for unifying the barber union, having these six companies pay dues to lay the foundation for the revolutionary work. After the haircut, Dr. Sun Yat-sen ordered the adjutant to pay two yuan and said to him: "Any industry is equal in front of revolutionary work."

Iron Lao Paid Attention to Shaving; Ambassador Guo Loved to Dye His Hair

Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, state affairs were chaotic. Warlords occupied the land, and many party and state leaders stayed in Shanghai to plan. Wu Tiecheng, Guo Taiqi, Ye Chuyi, and Zhang Ji took rickshaws to "Yi Le Ye" to have their hair cut. Iron Lao paid the most attention to shaving. After the shave, he had to use an electric face grinder again, and the haircut had to be slow and methodical. In the sound of the scissors, Iron Lao always closed his eyes and quietly appreciated the moment of comfort and tenderness under the shadows of the knife and soap. Ambassador Guo was young and handsome, so he naturally paid special attention to grooming. When he sat upright and handsome in the "easy chair" in clean clothes, Luo Boli carefully and habitually protected the two tufts of soft hair on his temples. Because this was the forbidden area that the ambassador cherished most, no white hair could be exposed above the ears. In the photos of Ambassador Guo from that year, wasn't there a shining head of hair that was combined inside and out? This was Luo Boli's proud masterpiece from more than twenty years ago!

At that time, Wang Jingwei, Deng Shaokun, and Chen Jie were also Luo Boli's regular customers. When Wang Jingwei had his hair cut, he was different from others. Before and after cutting his hair, he had to compare the beauty of his entire head and face. If he felt that the haircut did not add to his original "young man" appearance, then he would only pay two dimes at most. His posing mentality often made him put money and face on an equal footing to deal with everything. This was completely different from Ambassador Guo, although the ambassador also wanted to be beautiful, he did not use money to support his likes and dislikes. He always paid regularly: four dimes for a haircut and two dimes for a shave, with no tip.

Soong Tzu-wen Urged Speed; Finished in Two or Three Minutes

When Ji Boli cut Soong Tzu-wen's hair in his residence on Qiqi Road around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he was most worried that his cutting speed would not meet Soong's sudden requests. Soong would urge him to "hurry up!" and everything had to be finished completely in two or three minutes, without oiling or arranging, the payment was always the same, five yuan in silver dollars. Sometimes Soong's wife's sideburns at the back of her neck also had to be trimmed, but that was not common.

The generosity and sincerity that Dr. Kong Xiangxi showed during his haircut always made Luo Boli feel grateful in his memory. Every time after having his hair cut, he would sign the bill and then slowly and calmly reach into a "wallet" to grope for money, constantly saying to Luo Boli in a humble manner: "I haven't given you a tip yet!" As a result, four dimes in silver dollars were groped out under Luo Boli's half-pushing and half-accepting. Luo Boli said: "Although the actions of the old-fashioned figures are not in line with the times and are not bright enough, their hearts are very good."

The Hero Suddenly Became Shy; Cai Tingkai Became a Regular

The most interesting thing was General Cai Tingkai. His haircut was originally a scattered line strategy, without a fixed place, sitting down and cutting his hair anytime, anywhere. Later, for some reason, this hero who charged into battle suddenly became shy and felt uncomfortable because there were many onlookers in the store who treated him as a target for evaluation. At that time, "Yi Ye Ye" had already closed down, and Luo Boli had moved to the Bankers' Association. So, after being introduced, General Cai entrusted Luo Boli to be responsible for his grooming in a small room in the association.

Luo Boli also incidentally told the reporter that in the past, "Yi Le Ye" had a specially made "brushing head device", the form of which was like a disc used for perming hair now, suspended in mid-air, slightly cylindrical below, specially used to replace soap to wash and grind the head to make it clean. People used to happily put their heads into this cylinder to enjoy the comfort of grasping, brushing, washing, and scraping. This "brushing head device" was later dismantled and sold as scrap iron by the descendants of the store owner Shi Dezhi, and no second one has appeared in Shanghai to this day. He said very emotionally, as if there was infinite desolation in the luxurious memories.

Wang Xiaolai Loved to Talk About Peking Opera; Dong Xian Guang Came Every Three Weeks

Now, Li Fuxun, Zhang Jiaao, Bei Songsun, Wang Xiaolai, Dong Xian Guang, and others are regular customers of Luo Boli in the Bankers' Association. Wang Xiaolai is healthy and strong with a beard around his cheeks. When he is shaving his face, he often talks to Luo Boli about his love for Peking Opera. Luo Boli used his hands to simulate Wang's facial outline and said: "Good skills, truly a typical giant hammer face"!

Dong Xianguang comes to Shanghai once every three weeks and must have his hair cut. When he is half-lying and reclining in the "easy chair", he always likes to chat with Luo Boli about his family life, in a gentle and detailed manner. The situation is probably very cordial and warm. Unfortunately, one day was missed. On the eve of the reporter's visit, Dong happened to be grooming. It is said that he paid a tip of 5,000 yuan when he left and shook hands with Luo Boli to say goodbye.

The weather was too hot, so I shook hands with him to say goodbye. He said at the end: "The monthly salary at 'Yi Le Ye' used to be fifty yuan, but now he earns two million a month in the association. A haircut used to cost only two dimes, but now it costs more than ten thousand!" Looking at his slightly lamenting back, these 36 years of barbering are telling us how we have survived a difficult era!

### The City's Largest Pumping Station Completed After More Than a Year and Over 500 Million Spent; Can Pump 60,000 Gallons Per Minute

[Our Reporter] The Municipal Public Works Bureau hosted the city's press at 3:00 PM yesterday to visit the recently completed giant sluice gate and pumping station in Rihui Port. This project took more than a year and cost 560 million yuan and is the city's largest pumping station. Its purpose is to alleviate waterlogging in the western district of the former French Concession. According to the drainage system of the former French Concession, except for the eastern part that directly exits into the Huangpu River, most of the drainage pipes discharge water into the Panjiabang River in the south, which then exits into the Huangpu River through Rihui Port. Therefore, after the dam and pumping station are built at the northern end of Rihui Port, the water flow can be controlled. According to the engineer yesterday, the function of the dam is to prevent high tides from flowing backward, the function of the gate is to facilitate the discharge of rainwater during low tide, and the function of the pumping station is to pump the rain water in the Panjiabang and discharge it into the Rihui Port, so that the ebb and flow of the tide will have no effect on the former French Concession, and waterlogging can be improved.

When the reporter went to observe, the pumping machine was running at full power, drawing the stinking water from the Jiangjiabang into the Rihui Port. Vortices appeared from time to time, and the speed was very fast. The station has two 70-horsepower motors and one 85-horsepower motor, pumping a total of 60,000 gallons of water per minute. According to Director Zhao, it is estimated that the entire amount of water in Zhaojiabang can be pumped out in half a day.

### Thief Visits Brothel, Joy Turns to Sorrow, Broker Changes Stolen Goods, Implicating Madam

[Our Reporter] At 2:30 PM on July 30, Wang Songling, representative of the Gongxing Glass Company at No. 233 Zhizhi Road, reported to the Hongkou Police Precinct that between noon on the 29th and 10:00 AM on the 30th, the door lock of the company's warehouse at No. 75 Haining Road was pried open by thieves, and 24 boxes of glass, worth about 13.9 million yuan, were stolen. At 6:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, Xu Jixian, the owner of Gongxing Company, reported to the police station that a broker was carrying glass samples to his store for sale, which were very similar to the stolen glass, and requested that the police be dispatched to No. 2333 Zhili Road for investigation. Officer Ying Rumo, Gu Zhonghai, police chief Zhao Bingyue, and police officer Chen Youshan, accompanied by the reporter, went to investigate and found that the glass had been purchased by broker Chen Agui and stored in the Xietai Rice Store at No. 12 Xiamen Road. The words printed on the stolen glass box boards matched. The stolen goods receiver Chen Agui was taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, he purchased the glass from Jiang Ting, the madam of the Chunyang Copper and Tin Store at No. 219 Qipu Road, for 9.2 million national currency. Jiang Ting was introduced by a friend from Tanggu Road to Zhu the Monk, who lived in a shed at No. 197 Donghan Bili Road, and obtained the glass for 6.32 million and ten yuan. The police were dispatched to arrest Zhu, who confessed that he had an accomplice named Fan Xueping. That night, Fan was arrested in the Yuanchangli brothel on Yuanchang Road and confessed to participating in the transportation of the stolen goods, and also confessed the two main culprits, Xiao Jiangbei and Ye Huicheng, but they were both at large and not apprehended. In addition to returning the stolen goods to the owner, the police station sent the thieves and the stolen goods receivers to the local court for prosecution.

### American Woman's Gold Watch Stolen, Returned Intact, Almost Implicating an Innocent Friend

[Our Reporter] American woman Mrs. Shi Ni Neng, residing in Room 815, Broadway Mansion, No. 81 Huimin Road, was passing the intersection of Huangpu Road and Wuchang Road at about 9:00 AM the day before yesterday when she was suddenly robbed by a gangster of a precious gold watch (worth 200 US dollars) of the Prime Minister brand. The watch had a gold chain and two small diamonds inlaid on the side. Afterwards, the American military police detained a suspect named Fang Linhu and sent him to the Hongkou Police Precinct for interrogation, but Fang categorically denied it. After the police learned that Fang was indeed just a small worker and had nothing to do with the case, they ordered him to be released on bail. According to a tip-off, the original stolen goods were found in the Hecheng Pawnshop at No. 183 Tiantong Road. Officers were dispatched to investigate and found a Prime Minister gold watch. According to the person in charge of the pawnshop, at about 10:00 AM on the 3rd, a man in his thirties, wearing a suit and shirt, short in stature, speaking with a Shanghai accent, came to the store to pawn the watch, claiming that it belonged to his wife and that the chain was accidentally broken. The watch was taken back and returned to the owner. The robber has not yet been caught and is currently being pursued.

### Pawn Shops Changed to Buying Pledged Items, Identification Cards Should be Recorded

The City Chamber of Commerce previously believed that the measures formulated by the Police Bureau, restricting pawnshops and second-hand stores from redeeming pawned items and selling goods within ten days, were too strict and could not be followed in practice. Based on the request of the Dianzhou Pawnbrokers Association, the City Chamber of Commerce forwarded the request to the Municipal Government, requesting that the original order of the Police Bureau be revoked. The association received a reply from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the case had been resolved at the 86th Municipal Conference, and the original measures were revised. All pawnshops should record the name, address, and national identification card number of the pledge when purchasing pledged items. If they do not have a national identification card, the pledged items cannot be redeemed within ten days. If redemption is necessary, a shop guarantee or a person with a similar occupation is required to guarantee it.

### Xi'an City, Under the Jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, Takes the First Step

[Report from our newspaper in Xi'an] The Xi'an Municipal Government, which has been changed to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, was officially established today (the 1st). The first mayor, Wang Youzhi, only yesterday resigned as the head of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education. This afternoon, at his first press conference, he firmly stated his long-term policy goals: "Xi'an City, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, should be built into a modern cultural city that meets modern standards and serves as the center of cultural activities in the Northwest." In another written statement, he also solemnly cautioned the 600,000 citizens: "Although Xi'an is the ancient capital of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties and the cradle of Chinese culture, it seems to have succumbed to the pain of cultural decline in modern times..."

According to the new mayor's explanation, the significance of Xi'an's elevation from a provincial city to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan lies in emphasizing the importance of Xi'an to the national defense, politics, economy, and culture of the Northwest.

However, the "first step" towards this goal has encountered difficulties. Because in this time of upgrading, there are no more than 600,000 people; tax revenue is also minimal, less than 1 billion yuan per month. With such manpower and financial resources, it is certainly impossible to support a large administrative organization, nor is it easy to rely solely on local forces to implement large-scale construction plans. This is a realistic problem, and we can illustrate it with numbers.

In order to save administrative expenses, the new municipal government's organization may adopt a simpler plan, with only six bureaus within the municipal government. In this way, the monthly administrative budget is 1.7 billion yuan, which is 40% less than the 2.9 billion yuan budget for a plan with eight bureaus. Which way to go will be decided in the short term. Currently, the municipal government's revenue is 1 billion yuan per month. After 30% is allocated to the central government, 70% is allocated to the local government. Even if a simpler structure is adopted, the monthly expenses will still be short by about 800 to 900 million yuan.

The new municipal government's start-up cost is 10 billion yuan, which Nanjing believes is a bit high. The exact amount of the subsidy is still under review. The construction budget totals 120 billion yuan, divided into three items: water supply, drainage, and road construction, each with 40 billion yuan. Nanjing is currently reviewing these together with the construction costs of the other three cities under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan.

### Xi'an Waterworks Project to Begin Immediately, Decides New City Government

The most urgent project to be built in Xi'an is the waterworks project. If the central government's subsidy is insufficient, even if there are 10 billion yuan, the new municipal government has decided to start preliminary work immediately. For the rest, it plans to attract private capital and convert it into a joint government-business venture or a government-supervised business venture.

The four main crossroads in the city center are planned to be converted into cement roads to achieve a permanent solution and, in fact, save on future road repair costs.

Sewage and public toilets are also planned to be built gradually to improve public health. In addition, strengthening household registration, improving people's welfare... these are all blueprints in the new mayor's mind.

"We will not do things that the citizens do not want; we will do things that the citizens want." The new mayor repeatedly emphasized this to the 600,000 citizens at several gatherings today.

### The City Government Spends One Penny to Achieve the Effect of One Penny

Since the announcement of Xi'an's conversion to a city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the 600,000 citizens are concerned less about the anticipation of a beautiful future than about whether the current and future burdens will increase. Regarding this point, the new mayor explained it in two aspects: "In the future, we will never increase the citizens' extra burdens, but citizens have the obligation to shoulder their due burdens." He believes that it is the citizens' obligation to share municipal expenses, and that the current burden on Xi'an citizens is much lighter compared to the citizens of other counties. He hopes to increase the city government's revenue by reorganizing tax sources, eliminating tax evasion, and striving for effective expenditures, spending one penny and seeing the effect of one penny.

### Ladybugs in Quzhou Devour Citrus Scale Insects

[Report from our newspaper in Quzhou] The western townships of this county, such as Hangbu, are rich in oranges, with vast orchards and abundant yields, which are the main secondary product for local farmers. In recent years, insect pests have occurred, with a type commonly known as "white shell insects" being particularly harmful, resulting in low quality and reduced yields. Year after year, there has been a risk of extinction. Scientific or traditional methods of prevention and control have been repeatedly applied, but to no avail, greatly affecting the local economy. According to visitors from the township, a type of ladybug has recently been found in large numbers near Hangbu, specializing in preying on the aforementioned white shell insects. The insect pests, which had been ineffective in control for many years, were unknowingly wiped out. The farmers in the township are immensely grateful. (August 1)

### Another Tragedy at Heishi Pass: Soldiers Drove Away the Ferrymen and Sailed The Boat Themselves; The Boat Crashed Violently into Bridge Piers, Suddenly Breaking Apart; Twenty-Eight People Rescued, Thirty-One Drowned, Bridge Difficult to Repair

[Report from our newspaper in Kaifeng] Continuous heavy rains in western Henan have caused the Luo River at Heishi Pass on the Longhai Railway to rise sharply. The bridge there was destroyed by the water on the 27th. All trains on the east-west lines were stopped at the bridgehead, and wooden boats were used to ferry passengers to maintain traffic. Unexpectedly, a boat capsizing tragedy occurred at Heishi Pass on the 28th, drowning thirty-one elderly, weak, women, and children. Twenty-eight people were rescued. The details are as follows:

On that day, there were nine wooden boats at the ferry. The boat involved in the accident was the last one crossing from the west bank to the east bank (passengers on the No. 3 train of the Longhai Railway). At that time, soldiers from a certain unit, Shi Yufang and Yang Chaohua, and others were helping each other to cross. They insisted on sailing, but the boat owner saw that there were too many people on board, exceeding the weight limit, and that the water was turbulent. He informed them of the danger and refused to sail. Shi and Yang not only did not listen but also drove away the ferrymen. The road bureau's car affairs, engineering section chiefs, stationmasters, supervisors, and guards stepped forward to dissuade them, explaining the dangers, but Shi and Yang insisted on not listening and started sailing themselves.

At this time, another boat arrived, and about half of the passengers were transferred to that boat. Unexpectedly, Shi and Yang did not know how to swim. When the boat reached the center of the river, because the water was extremely strong, they could not steer it and were at a loss. The boat went down with the rapid current and crashed into the bridge pier of the Heishi Pass Bridge with a loud crash. The wooden boat immediately broke apart, and all the passengers were submerged. The road police at the bridgehead saw the situation and shouted urgently. Twenty-eight people were rescued, most of whom were elderly, weak, women, and children, in addition to the soldiers. There were several children aged one to three. Finally, an old woman and a girl in her teens were also retrieved, along with fifteen pieces of luggage. A total of thirty-one people were killed in the accident, which is truly tragic.

To comfort the affected passengers, the road authorities not only prepared coffins for the deceased and waited for their relatives to claim them, but also gave each family 100,000 yuan to be collected by their relatives. Those who were rescued were provided with food for one day and given 50,000 yuan for travel expenses. At the same time, the perpetrators, Shi Yufang and Yang Chaohua, were escorted to the Zhengzhou Investigation Office for legal action.

When the reporter asked the road bureau负责人 about the bridge construction situation, they said that the water level is now too high, reaching over 99.75 meters, and it will be difficult to repair it in the short term. Work can only begin when the water level drops to 92.00 meters or below. During the unrepaired period, wooden boats will still be used for ferrying. (August 1)

### Where to Watch the Zhejiang Tide? This Year It Should Be at Nansha: Hidden Sands Rise Near Haining

[Report from our newspaper in Xiaoshan] Recently, a stretch of hidden sand about ten miles long has risen near Haining on the north bank of the Qiantang River, causing the river flow to shift southward, with rapid currents eroding the Nansha sandbar, leading to increasingly severe collapse. At the same time, as a result of the southward shift of the waterway, the world-famous "Qiantang River Tide" will be less spectacular in Haining. This year, the tide should be watched at Nansha in this county.

The Jin-Qu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has reached Longyou, and the railway authorities have scheduled the official opening for the 5th. It is expected that the entire section will be completed within three weeks, and direct access from Hangzhou to Shangrao will be possible. In addition, the Zhousheng Highway was also opened to Jieshi on the 1st. (August 2)

### Suzhou Prisoners Riot: Drug Traffickers Lead a Crowd of Inmates to Storm the Gate; Fortunately, the Youth Army Was Deployed to Suppress Them

[Report from our newspaper in Suzhou, 4th] A prison riot occurred at the No. 1 Prison in Shizikou, Suzhou, at around 9:00 AM on the 4th. The drug trafficker Wang Yong, who was sentenced to seven years and is currently serving his sentence, is known for his recalcitrant character. Even in prison, he widely recruits followers. Recently, he wanted to share food and utensils with other inmates but was unsuccessful. Harboring resentment, and coinciding with the replacement of the warden in charge of inmates in the Second Division, Wang feared that restrictions would be tightened. Therefore, he took the initiative and gathered more than 30 inmates from his cell this morning, rushing towards the printing workshop inside the prison. At that time, the iron gate of the workshop aisle was destroyed, and the workshop instructor Zhou Qingping was injured in his left arm. Fortunately, soldiers from the Second Division of the Youth Army stationed in the prison were deployed to suppress the riot, preventing it from escalating. The Suzhou judicial authorities are now investigating the incident and will severely punish the ringleaders.

### Hong Kong Charity Swimming Gala; Five National Records; Liu Diding and Huang Wanzhen are Male and Female Stars

[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Station] The sound of disaster relief is everywhere, and the charity swimming gala finally took place at the Hong Kong Swimming Pool. The time was the evenings of July 29th and 30th, starting after 7 pm.

After the great war, Hong Kong's swimming pools, facilities, and buildings are still very poor. The few slightly satisfactory swimming pools are either privately owned or military restricted areas. Therefore, public swimming sheds are mostly built by the sea.

The Chung Sing Swimming Shed in Sai Wan, Kennedy Town, is directly accessible by tram and is considered to be one of the more complete swimming sheds! The lighting is also pretty good. Because of the wonderful programs and the participation of the Victoria Recreation Club, the situation on both nights can be described as lively.

In terms of results, the meeting was very rewarding, with five events breaking national records.

The most intense competition was in the 100-meter freestyle. Wu Nian was still closely following Liu Diding in the first 80 meters, but Diding then overtook him in the final stage.

In the women's group: Huang Wanzhen retained the championships in the 50-meter and 200-meter events. I think: It is currently difficult for anyone in Hong Kong to compete with her for these spots. Wanzhen's swimming style is also very beautiful.

The five national records broken were: Liu Diding's 100-meter freestyle, Chen Zhennan's 400-meter freestyle, and Huang Wanzhen's 50-meter freestyle in the women's group. The other two events were relay races. The Victoria Recreation Club, Chung Sing, and Lai Chun teams in the men's 4x100-meter freestyle relay all broke the national record, and the Lai Chun team also broke the national record in the women's 4x50-meter freestyle relay. The overall champions for men's and women's teams was the Lai Chun team (98 points), and the runner-up was the Victoria Recreation Club (47 points).

Referees Chen Jimao, Li Longbiao, and Shen Bohong, Jingwu's strength was originally better than Lianxing, but in this battle, they did not dare to fight hard, which led to the wrong selection of the roster, almost suffering a defeat at the hands of Lianli. Fortunately, the second defensive player Shuijiu Gao rose above the critical moment and forcefully defeated Lianxing's defensive player Jiang Quan, allowing Jingwu to turn the tide. Jingwu finally won with a score of five to two, creating a great record of six wins in six matches, and will be scheduled to compete with the defending champion Hushing team for the overall championship in this competition.

### Announcement of New Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices

20-count yarn at 9.8 million yuan per piece

[Our Report] The new negotiated prices for cotton yarn were officially announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday morning. 20-count yarn is priced at 9.8 million yuan per piece, an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the negotiated price on the 1st of last month. The negotiated prices announced for other counts of yarn are: 10-count yarn at 6.82 million yuan, 16-count yarn at 8.62 million yuan, 32-count yarn at 13 million yuan, and 42-count yarn at 15 million yuan. According to the announcement by the Textile Adjustment Committee, all of the above negotiated prices are the highest selling prices at the factory level. Yarn merchants may add a profit of 5% based on the factory price. Retail prices may add another 10%. As for various other counts of yarn and cotton yarn of various brands and trademarks not listed above, they should be priced with reference to the above prices according to market customs, provided that the price of the same count of cotton yarn does not exceed the highest negotiated price agreed above, otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed.

It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs contacted the Textile Adjustment Committee by telephone yesterday morning, with the intention of approving the new negotiated price of 20-count yarn at 9.6 million yuan. However, after considering the negotiated price of 9.8 million yuan proposed by the Shanghai factories, they reluctantly approved it. However, national and private yarn factories were instructed to provide at least 1,500 pieces of each count of cotton yarn for allocation and sale yesterday to avoid fluctuations in the yarn market due to the initial implementation of the new negotiated price. However, yesterday, only the China Textile Construction Corporation opened 1,500 pieces of each count of yarn, and the private Shenxin Yarn Factory opened approximately 600 pieces of each count of yarn. No other factories opened any.

According to the opinion of a leader of a private factory, the price ratio of the fine yarn prices announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday did not follow the original ratio calculation of the former Textile Control Committee, so they were all insufficient, and many factories hesitated to open. However, it is heard that the factories have decided to continue opening today. The quota of yarn to be opened by the private factories is calculated as: Shenxin 600 pieces, Yongsha 300 pieces, Xinyu 200 pieces, Tongyi, Zhongfang, Chongxin, Baofeng, Anda, Rongfeng, and Xinhe 100 pieces each.

According to another aspect, yesterday's negotiated price was decided at the negotiation group meeting last Saturday. If the fine yarn price is calculated according to the original ratio, it will exceed the current market price. The Textile Adjustment Committee's negotiation is based on the principle of not exceeding the market price. Therefore, the market situation was temporarily observed, and a slightly lower price was negotiated. Furthermore, the market's appetite for fine yarn has been very small recently, and sales to foreign countries are not smooth, so the market price is weak.

When the negotiation group meeting was held last Saturday, it was decided to organize a factory yarn opening inspection team, consisting of Gao Bingtai from the Textile Adjustment Committee, Zhang Fangzuo from the Textile Construction Corporation, and Zhang Wenqian from the private factories. Their responsibility is to go to each factory to inspect the yarn opening situation, the amount and price of yarn opened, etc. It was originally planned to depart for inspection yesterday, but because the private factories said that the cotton yarn would continue to be opened today, the date was temporarily changed to today, and then they will go to each factory for inspection.

[Another Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee's negotiation group meeting will be held again at 4 pm today, where the negotiated prices will be discussed. In the future, negotiated prices will be set every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and yarn will be sold at listed prices on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

### Cotton Yarn Sales Slow

The initial cotton yarn market yesterday was slightly promising, with manufacturers making sporadic purchases, but actual demand remained sluggish. By the close of the market, Shenxin Factory had yarn open, and the allocation price of yarn opened by the Textile Construction Corporation was raised again. The listed price of 20-count Heavenly Girl was raised to 9.8 million yuan, and the price of 42-count Lima was 16.6 million yuan, and the opening was extremely flat. Although there was an increase in negotiated prices, buyers did not pay attention to it, and the market atmosphere was rather weak.

As a result, the fine yarn 42-count Blue Phoenix rebounded by 100,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 17.25 million yuan. Shuiyuehao rose by 50,000 yuan to 17.15 million yuan. 20-count Qing Shuangma fell by 50,000 yuan to 10.85 million yuan. The prices of other Heavenly Girl, Zhongshuang Earth, and 16-count Guangming Hongfeng Benteng, 10-count Zidi Jun Jinbaoxing fine yarns of 40-count and 32-count, etc., all fell, ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Lifeless

The cotton cloth market yesterday initially showed signs of resilience, as the Textile Construction Corporation, in accordance with the resolution of the Textile Adjustment Committee, raised yarn prices, and insiders thought that the prices would be firm. The leading fine cloth even rose to 438,000 yuan. Later, due to little activity from foreign merchants, the intention to enter the market slackened. Shops and merchants in the street also lacked initiative. Finally, the market price of 12-pound cage head fine cloth fell by 3,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 432,000 yuan. The prices of various fine cloths such as Five Gu Blue Chicken Color Ball also fell by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. The market prices of other white grey cloth, serge-colored cloth, and shilin cloth were all flat and soft.

### Stable Cotton Market

The spot cotton market yesterday was stable due to yarn factories absorbing supply, and prices did not fluctuate, but the number of transactions was still not high. L.S.S factory price was 2.2 million, Huoji 1.725 million, stack delivery price was 2.12 million for Xuefei, 2.2 million to 2.25 million, Shashi 1.965 million, Hankou fine fluff 1.96 million to 2 million, Chong Tongzhou 1.995 million, Huo 1.72 million, and Puzi flower 335,000.

### Woolen Fabric Sales Slightly Recover

For the past ten days, woolen products have been affected by the slack season of hot weather and various environmental factors, such as the obvious influx of woolen gabardines from Hankou to Nanjing and Shanghai, resulting in a nominally flat but realistically fatigued market, with extremely sluggish actual transactions. Yesterday, on Qipan Street and at the Changle Tea House, overcoats and Yuanzhigong fabrics showed signs of recovery, as sales to foreign merchants have gradually started, and merchants from Chongqing and Chengdu have been searching for supplies, while merchants from Xi'an and Changsha have also been requesting samples. This has also boosted the popularity of other woolen products.

### Strong Buying Intentions in the Chinese Stock Market

Chinese stocks remained strong yesterday amid ample liquidity, with strong buying interest from various parties, and high prices were seen across the board. China Silk opened up and immediately rose to the limit, while Yongsheng rose by 10%, a rare occurrence recently. Bullish investors rushed in, and the market briefly fell back in the middle of the session, but buyers still added to their positions near the close, and the market recovered its strength. Lianan once rose to the limit (without successful trades), while Xinhuo Firecrackers and Zhonghua were relatively strong during the half-day session, due to the former's capital increase and the latter's generous bonus share offerings.

The market opened higher in the morning, continuing the momentum from last Saturday, with China Silk rising to the limit from 117 to 142. After opening at 252 yuan, Yongsheng saw gains at 73, 4, 60, 231, and 85, rising to 256 yuan. Bankers sold at 207 and 45, while bullish investors also sold at 235, 154, 179, 223, and 76, and short sellers at 232 and 224 increased their positions and supplied Yongsheng, pushing the price down to 245 yuan and 247 yuan for spot and forward deliveries, respectively. 231 took advantage of the low price to buy Yongsheng, and 94, 155, 185, and 85 also bought, pushing the price up to 252 yuan. 154, 186, 76, 157, 235, 232, and 207 still supplied and sold, and 97 resold Yongsheng, pulling back to 243 yuan and 245 yuan. The price of Meiya was also sharply lowered to 428 yuan and 433 yuan due to supply from 117.

After fluctuating until 11 o'clock, 73, 223, and 177 briefly pulled the price up to around 250 yuan. Retail investors gradually felt unsupported, and 160 and 8 both sold, while 218 also supplied Yongsheng. After 11:30, the price fell again to 241 yuan and 243 yuan. 223 strongly supported spot and forward deliveries, and 116, 177, and 129 still bought. At 11:40, Fengan Association hung up at the limit at 156, and Changhe bought at 152, also showing strong profits. Yongsheng's noon close also rose to 247 yuan and 249 yuan.

After the close, bids initially fell back and then recovered. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Xinhuo rose by more than 50%, Meiya, Yongsheng, Xinguang, and Yonggong rose slightly, Jingfu, Zhongfa, and Xinhua remained flat, Huafeng and Dongxing fell slightly, Lianan and Rongfeng also remained flat, the price of Firecrackers and underwear rose by about 50%, and China Silk rebounded after rising to the limit, gaining over 50%. There was limited trading volume in Lianglun, and although it rose by 10%, it was insignificant. Although other stocks rose, the increases were not significant. In forward deliveries, Xinhuo rose by over 50%, Yongsheng, Meiya, and Xinguang rose slightly, the volume was flat, and Rongfeng fell slightly. Various old stocks in the over-the-counter market were generally flat.

### Uniform Prices Rebound, Foreign Stocks Remain Stable

Government bonds rebounded yesterday, with the uniform price of C opening slightly lower at 12,600 yuan, starting from 12,800 yuan, and being sold to 10,800 yuan by 555 and 552, while 230 and 360 made purchases. It finally struggled outside of 11,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B each fell by 2,200, silk C fell by 2,000 yuan, and D and E also fell by 2,200. The trading volume was approximately 6 million.

Foreign stocks also rebounded after being strong yesterday, but the process was uneven. Yi Yarn once jumped to over 100,000 yuan in the morning, but was pressured lower to below 95,000 yuan due to profit-taking by Guangdong merchants and securities firms. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British United, Industry, and Guangdong rose slightly, while Yi Yarn, Paper, and Yi Beer fell slightly. Jardine Matheson Steel remained flat, and Shipping fell by 50%.

### The Central Trust Bureau Resumes Rationing Rayon Yesterday; Allots Half of Each Manufacturer's Requested Amount

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Trust Bureau resumed rationing rayon yesterday, allotting half of each manufacturer's requested amount. Prices have been adjusted upwards, with 120 Tianqiao, Jin San Ma, Zao Ri, Kongque, and Diqiu brands all priced at 22.6 million yuan per case. 120 Dong Yang Da Fugui is priced at 22.7 million yuan per case. Going forward, the Bureau's rayon rationing prices will be adjusted dynamically based on market conditions.

According to a Bureau spokesperson, the Bureau has a sufficient amount of rayon arriving this year, and therefore has a definite assurance of fully supplying rayon.

Furthermore, the rayon market was relatively stable yesterday. 120 count Tianqiao brand new goods were sold for 25 million yuan in the morning, and Gao Shan brand was sold for 25.1 million yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 20 yuan compared to the end of last week.

The secondary market was slightly more active yesterday, with transaction prices rising by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. C-grade was traded at 28.9 million yuan for ten packages, and better quality goods were traded at 29.3 million yuan for five packages. D-grade was also traded at 28.6 million yuan, and high-grade material was traded at 28.3 million yuan. AB-grade and dry spun yarn lacked transactions, and asking prices remained unchanged.

The raw silk quilt cover market was very calm at the opening yesterday. Huaqiang brand was at 10.456 million yuan. After 9 o'clock, it was reported that stocks were rising, people's confidence improved, and prices rose sharply, with transactions at 7.723 million yuan. Later, due to a lack of high-price selling, it declined. The final closing price was 600,000 yuan for spot and 640,000 yuan for deferred delivery. Dacheng quilt covers opened between 10.478 million yuan, with the highest asking price reaching 750,000 yuan, and the closing price was 630,000 yuan for spot and 670,000 yuan for deferred delivery.

### Mostly Indica Rice Arrives; Food Grains Tighten Initially, Then Relax

Yesterday, a total of over 52,000 shi of rice arrived in both the North and South markets. The majority of arrivals were still indica rice. In the South market, japonica rice and small-volume sales were still lively, rising by 3,500 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice temporarily lacked activity, and Bai Yin Yuan remained firm. New Pudong japonica rice continued to arrive in small quantities, with the market initially tight but later relaxed. The situation was similar. Given the clear weather, the volume of rice coming out gradually increased. The North market was initially weak but later stabilized, with no significant changes.

Flour prices varied slightly. Factory flour rose by 1,200 yuan due to firm sellers. Foreign flour supply was insufficient to meet demand, and sales were exceptionally strong, continuing to surge by 10,000 yuan. However, mixed-brand flour prices were stable as small flour mills in Jiangwan Dachang Nanxiang and other locations continued to supply Shanghai, and transactions were generally around 112,000 to 113,000 yuan. Kunshan Wufeng Factory also shipped Lion and Horse brand flour to Shanghai, with good quality, and sales opened at 113,500 yuan, market sentiment was stable. Overall flour prices also remained unchanged, and bran increased slightly by 300 to 500 yuan.

Soybean cake fertilizer sales were ordinary, weak, and depressed. Yingkou cake fell by 3,500 yuan. New soybeans continued to arrive from the Yangtze River, and Zhejiang continued to ship to Shanghai. New crops were seen along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line in Danyang and Lingkou. Sales were flat, prices remained unchanged, and there were few transactions in old soybeans.

### Registration of Trade Names: Consent Required for Certificate Issuance

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received submissions from the Cigarette, Soap, and Match Trade Associations, stating that for trade names that are identical and of long standing, please order them to be additionally registered and uniformly registered, etc. After forwarding this to the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs issued an instruction stating that adding separate registrations for trade names is inconsistent with the law and therefore cannot be approved. If the establishment was established before a registered trade name with the same name and has valid certificates, it may be registered. If two or more trade names with the same name simultaneously apply for registration or are established after a registered trade name with the same name, consent must be obtained before a registration certificate can be approved. Such handling will have no impact on trade names with a long history, and both laws and ministerial interpretations can be taken into account.

### Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendment of Guangzhou Import Control Laws to Protect Domestic Raw Material Supply and Demand and the Interests of Overseas Chinese

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Executive Yuan promulgated import control laws and the Guangzhou transshipment ban, Hong Kong's commerce has been severely impacted. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in order to maintain the lifeline of overseas Chinese merchants, resolved to submit petitions to the Executive Yuan Import Control Committee, the Guangdong Office of the Suspension Control Committee, and the South China Import and Export Management Committee, requesting the revocation or improvement of the said laws. The original petition stated roughly that since the implementation of the import management laws and Guangzhou transshipment ban promulgated by the Provisional Import Management Committee of the Executive Yuan of our country, the business of overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong has been severely impacted. The Chamber convened a meeting and decided that under the principle of not harming national economic facilities, the original proposal should be revoked or the method improved, because: (1) Industrial raw materials and transportation and construction materials are urgently needed by our country at present, therefore, in order to adjust reasonable supply and demand, even in times of economic hardship, it seems appropriate to allow a moderate amount of imports. (2) The supply of food is essential to people's livelihood, and those dependent on imports are mostly in a state of insufficiency. Moderate imports seem difficult to avoid temporarily. (3) Other goods such as foreign paper, field materials, and hardware are of great importance to agriculture, industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings, which are lacking in the country. Therefore, during the reconstruction, while alleviating economic difficulties, we must also relax imports to seek urgent supplies. (4) Guangzhou does not directly trade with foreign countries, and its dependence on Hong Kong's transshipment is a geographical fact. Now, according to control laws, Hong Kong merchants have no business to operate, Guangzhou's supply is insufficient, and under the transshipment ban, various parts of South China are affected. In terms of enriching people's livelihood and fostering people's wealth, and measures to cultivate the assets of overseas Chinese, the implementation of the import ban seems to require reconsideration. (5) Furthermore, since the promulgation of the new control regulations, according to reports in the news, customs revenue has decreased significantly, and smuggling has flourished. Based on this situation, it is contrary to economic facilities, only allowing smugglers to be active, while legitimate merchants have no business to operate, which is not the government's intention to protect industry and commerce, etc.

### Import Control Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss How to Allocate Industrial Raw Materials

Find Ways to Overcome Difficulties Technically

The issue of allocating import quotas for industrial raw materials has been heavily contested by industrial associations and importers. Yesterday, according to a person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, the Transport Management Committee has fulfilled its responsibility by allocating the import quota approved by the Transport Management Committee to the importers according to legal provisions. However, in order to avoid hoarding and cheating by importers, it is specifically stipulated that each importer must submit a "sales contract" before receiving the import permit, proving that the quota they imported has been sold to industrial factories and has not been hoarded and not sold by themselves. However, the industrial sector believes that this allocation is still inappropriate. The Transport Management Committee immediately requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to jointly agree on a sound allocation method, how to determine the allocation ratio, but so far the two sides have not compromised. The industrial sector still firmly demands that all imported raw materials be allocated to the industrial sector. The Transport Management Committee believes that there are two difficulties: (1) Scattered users and irregular users cannot obtain raw materials without going through merchants. (2) There are many members in the industrial sector, and it is also extremely difficult in terms of allocation technology. The wheel control committee also has no right to restrict an importer's import quota, which must be sold to a certain factory. However, the Transport Management Committee is currently renegotiating a new method, opening up new paths to solve the problem, so that both parties can obtain a reasonable allocation ratio. It is also said that so far, among all approved imported materials, the four major categories of chemical products, oils and waxes, pigments, and hardware are due to complicated and fragmented users, and the first and second phases of import quotas have not been fully allocated.

It is also learned that the Executive Committee of the Transport Management Committee will hold a meeting in the coming days to thoroughly discuss the allocation method of industrial raw materials, find ways to overcome difficulties technically, and make rigid regulations.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Clarification

Lawsuit Involving Debtors and Creditors Settled; Relatives Mediate Withdrawal of Appeal

To the Editor: I was previously involved in a lawsuit with someone over a debt and was ordered by the court to pay a bail bond of 10 million yuan. However, the other party was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Now, through the mediation of relatives, a settlement has been reached, and the other party voluntarily withdraws the lawsuit. I have several legal questions. Please advise: (1) If the other party still does not withdraw their appeal after the agreement is signed, is the settlement agreement still valid? (2) If the other party withdraws the appeal, what procedures should be followed to reclaim the funds provided as security?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) The establishment of a settlement has the same effect as a final judgment (see Article 380 of the Civil Procedure Law). Even if the settlement is out of court and not a settlement in court, if there is a witness to prove that the settlement was established, even if the other party does not withdraw the appeal, it is still valid unless there is a reason for the settlement to be invalid or revocable. (2) When the other party withdraws the appeal and the case file is returned to the first instance court, a written request can be submitted to the first instance court to reclaim the bail bond paid.

As for tutoring night schools, the municipal ones include the vocational tutoring schools set up within Gezhi Middle School on Guangxi Road and Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Guan Road. There are many private ones, and there is no so-called "night middle school."

To Ms. Jin Huilin of Shanghai: I have read your letter. Shanghai Hujiang University offers a special English program with a duration of two years, aimed at training English teachers for secondary schools. Graduates must work before being able to pursue further studies. The admission requirement is the completion of a six-year new-system middle school curriculum and the possession of a formal diploma or certificate.

To Mr. Wang Heming of Shanghai: I have read your letter. (1) Students of the Shanghai Middle School Continuing Education Class organized by the former Ministry of Education's Shanghai Resumption of Study and Employment Guidance Office can transfer to the original grade of study with their certificates.

Although self-study is possible, it is definitely more difficult and less effective. There are no correspondence schools for mathematics or Japanese in Shanghai.

### Tuberculosis Treatment (Part 2)

— Wu Shaoqing

(E) Things to Do

(1) Understanding Contagiousness The easiest way to spread tuberculosis is through sputum and saliva. Tuberculosis bacteria are transmitted to others through this medium. Therefore, people with good hygiene habits never spit everywhere. The best method is to spit sputum into a paper handkerchief and then burn it to destroy the tuberculosis bacteria completely. When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth with a handkerchief to prevent saliva from spreading.

(2) Daily Life and Diet Should be separated from others, especially pay attention to children in the family, and isolation should be implemented. Live alone, the room should be ventilated with air and sunlight. Tableware such as cups, chopsticks, bowls, and plates must be boiled in boiling water after each meal to prevent tuberculosis bacteria from surviving.

The above methods to avoid infection are easy to do, but to implement them faithfully, you must realize the danger of infection and have a public spirit of caring for others. Otherwise, you may not want to take so much trouble. If there is anything you don't understand, your doctor or public health nurse is willing to sincerely explain and assist in guidance.

(3) Maintain a Happy Spirit and Bed Rest For patients with active tuberculosis, no matter what treatment method they take, they must "rest" in bed. This is the basic condition for treatment, not just "rest," just not working. In order for bed rest to be effective, you must be happy in spirit and open-minded in mind, and then you can be calm and peaceful and maintain the joy of the sickbed. This is easy to say but difficult to do, but it is indeed the secret to treating tuberculosis.

(4) Nourishing Diet Milk, eggs, cod liver oil, fish, vegetables, and fresh fruits are all nutritious foods. They should be combined and balanced, and should not be neglected. There is no so-called "triggering food," and no "dietary restrictions" are needed, as long as digestion is appropriate.

Finally, one more thing to say is that your tuberculosis must have been contracted from someone else. Conversely, your tuberculosis may have unknowingly infected others. Regarding the former, if you suspect that you have had contact with someone who is sick, you must advise them to be checked to prevent the source of infection. Regarding the latter, you have even more responsibility and obligation to have your family members or roommates checked. If they are sick, they can be treated halfway, and if they are not sick, they can rest assured. If this is not done, the latent growth of tuberculosis will never end. During this initial tuberculosis prevention period in our country, we must find ways to break this vicious cycle. Every patient can understand this intention and work together to achieve significant results. (The End)

Spring and Autumn

### Weariness

— Li Baifeng

Living in such an era that cannot be described with language and words, a minority of intellectuals confined to their own realm of awakening feel an immense sense of weariness.

It's like a faint sunlight, evasive footsteps, a hazy mist. I trudge on, drowsy and heavy-headed.

Endless oceans, deep forests, mountains and valleys piled high with heavy vehicles, boundless prairies, dry, boring deserts… I walk on, in such a complex environment, unable to distinguish whether I'm stepping on ocean waves or scorching grains of sand. In any case, I walk on like this—walking with extreme weariness.

Why do I walk this way?

Originally, I also had a purpose and direction, and naturally that hasn't changed now. However, due to the weariness arising from aversion to the reality before my eyes, I've finally become lost in such a state of mind that is neither deep forest nor ocean, much less desert. I, the weakest among the weak (I don't know what to call myself), can't help but resent my own cowardice. Why can't I choose a path I should take and stride forward like others? Why can't I be like those seers, clearing brambles in the wilderness, exhausting my strength clearing a way through the mountains? Instead, I allow my feet to move me, treading on ground I myself cannot make out, tottering and stumbling forward?

I can't see light, I am blind; I can't hear sound, I am deaf; I cannot speak the words in my heart, I am mute… only my heart has not died. Pitiful me, I can only follow the dictates of my heart and walk forward.

Is the direction I'm going in right after all? In my consciousness, I believe it is, because from the silent contemplation of my heart, I know those seers are not far ahead.

It is with this bit of solace that I strive to walk on tirelessly. If it is ocean, I will swim; if it is high mountain, I will climb; if it is desert, I will trek; if it is deep forest, I will pass through… I am bitten by rats, stung by insects, my body torn by thorns, yet I still move forward unceasingly—

I walk on, acting like a fool. I am mocked by friends who are not deaf, not mute, not blind; I am looked down upon by friends who know shortcuts and how to utilize every means of transport; I am slandered by clamorous friends… I do not bother to justify myself, nor do I want to justify myself. I only act as my conscience directs me, walking alone on my lonely, desolate road.

When I am lonely, I sing my own tuneless, guttural song; when I am perplexed, I open the books I carry on my back, in which are imprinted the footprints of seers. I grope through the leaves, reading with my heart. I believe in these raised, boundless words.

I admit that I am a weakling, good-for-nothing save for a kind heart. I don't want to defend myself, like those foxes who feign goodness, hanging out a sign of a philanthropist.

I just walk on, day and night.

I am hungry, exhausted, yet I do not hesitate; I am weary, enervated, yet I constantly rouse myself and encourage myself forward. I am a collection of contradictions, yet amid the turmoil of my heart, I constantly strive for unity of action, thought, and word.

In such an era that cannot be described with language and words, I am truly a fig tree, with all the forms and substance of a tree, with fruit, and even with an inner flower; however, I hope that my blossoms bloom in my heart, because I have no desire to be frolicked by bees and butterflies.

The fig tree is weary of the long, hot summer. It does not use flowers to indicate the changing of the seasons. I hope I am a fig tree. May my fruit ripen in silence. From the soil, I draw nourishment at every moment. I believe that only in the soil is there nourishment that makes me grow and mature. I don't want to borrow the fragrance of others to adorn myself, nor do I want to emulate dodder, relying on a large tree to reach the clouds. I am just myself—a fig tree without sound, color, or scent.

I endure the weariness of life; I bear the wounds of wind and rain; though I cannot shelter tiny birds, I also do not rely on the support of forceful heroes.

I am good for nothing, yet I have no regrets. I produce fruit, simply transforming the sights of this human world I have witnessed into a bittersweet juice for the world to consume. Perhaps there is a traveler who cannot find a water source, cannot find melons or fruits. Then, I will not hesitate to offer a plate of bittersweet juice.

Though I feel weariness toward life, I have not expressed any aversion. From my evergreen leaves, it can be seen that the source of my life has not yet dried up. From the small fruit I offer, it is proven that I still have a red heart.

In any case, I will not adorn this world. Let the optimistic trees use colorful blossoms to adorn spring, use rich fragrance to boast of the world's beauty existing in the hopes of the future. I am just a weary fig tree that does not give up on itself. With the responsibility for survival that life has bestowed upon me, I bear fruit—

Yes, I currently feel deeply weary toward the state of the world. I also know that I should be like those seers of old, clearing brambles in the forest, clearing paths for those who come after. They are brave pioneers, and I admire them deeply.

Let me be a cautionary tale. Young friends, you should choose the road you take, the widest and most open road. You should be raindrops, gathering from streams to become a great river, breaking through dikes and flowing toward the sea…

Do not stop to think, and do not worry about the things around you. Remember:

"There was originally no road, only when someone has walked it does it become a road."

Remember, this is the prophecy of a seer, this is the declaration of the mystery of the bright, open path by those of great courage and wisdom.

### Gold and Jade Bracelets

— Zhu Wen

Sincere Words: "On the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the second year of the Jin Shengping era, E Lü Hua descended to the home of Yang Quan, presenting a poem, along with a strip of fire-washed cloth and a gold and jade bracelet each." Li Shangyin's Mid-Autumn Festival poem: "Though Yang Quan obtained a gold bracelet, Wen Jiao vainly longed for a jade mirror stand." Lu Guimeng's poem: "Cherishing the pair of jade bracelets, relying entirely on the three islands to send to Lord Yang," all use this event. According to the Complete Tang Poetry Talk: "Emperor Wenzong asked his ministers, 'An old poem says, "Light shirt sets off bracelets; what are bracelets?" The ministers did not answer, and the emperor said, "They are what we now call wrist ornaments.'"

### Random Notes by the Window

— Dong Liu

"Gengzi Waiji" by Pierre Loti

The French novelist Pierre Loti (P. Loti) is famous in China for books such as "An Iceland Fisherman" and "Madame Chrysanthème." The former was translated by Li Liewen and included in the World Literature Library edited by Zheng Zhenduo, while the latter was translated by Xu Zhimo and published by the Commercial Press. Loti's writing style is subtle and winding, and he excels at depicting landscapes and characters. Furthermore, a unique exoticism pervades his prose-poetry-like novels. People generally know that Loti was a French naval officer who, in his spare time, engaged in literature and achieved such accomplishments, which is commendable. I once saw a photograph of him, impressively wearing a sword and sporting a Wilhelm-style mustache. His appearance was that of a proper military man, which formed a striking contrast with his beautiful writing style.

Loti came to China, visited Beijing, and was an officer in the Eight-Nation Alliance, also serving as a French correspondent. "Gengzi Waiji," a collection of his dispatches, is a record of his observations of Beijing in those years.

He witnessed the Boxer Rebellion and adopted, to some extent, a conqueror's stance, holding some reservations about the German commander Waldersee. His book "Gengzi Waiji" contains many noteworthy historical materials. The following is a short passage in which he recorded the chaotic situation inside and outside Beijing:

'On the pergola of a garden, morning glories were still blooming, and beneath it lay the corpse of a woman. Dusk had already arrived, but the flowers on the pergola still reflected the woman's corpse, thoroughly but elegantly decayed.'

'On the floor lay a wooden bucket, and something seemed to be extending out of it. As I approached it, I was startled and jumped back. It turned out to be the thigh of a woman, the flesh stripped away. Where was the rest of the body? Who knows what people had done with it? Ah, yes, the head was in the house, rolling together with a child's toy under a chair, completely blackened. Amidst the long, disheveled hair, we could only see the white teeth protruding from the mouth.'

This can be said to be the most poetic realism. Who would have thought that the great tragedy of the Chinese people, once in the hands of a foreign novelist, would become excellent material for prose poems? —"Thoroughly but elegantly decayed"—reading this sentence cannot help but make one feel a bit nauseous.

Wang Guowei and the Sandwich

Wang Guowei can be considered a scholar of his generation. According to Guo Moruo, his tragic suicide by drowning was bestowed upon him by his benefactor and enemy, Luo Zhenyu. Lu Xun mentioned Wang Guowei in his essay "On the So-Called Archives of the Great Within," using a very clever metaphor:

'Wang Guowei had already ended his reclusive life in the water, an honest man, but his sighs often echoed those of Luo Zhenyu, although there was a distinction between truth and falsehood in what they said. Therefore, it was common for him to be made into a sandwich filled with advertisements, because he was always so full of burning passions.'

To say that Wang Guowei was the filling of an advertising sandwich is indeed thought-provoking, but once you understand it, it feels very apt. The exaggeration of the jewel-like quality of the "Archives of the Great Within" by people like Luo Zhenyu was aimed at making more money. Wang Guowei, unaware of the details, followed Luo Zhenyu's tune. Since the academic community still had some faith in Wang Guowei, it was natural, in the eyes of Luo Zhenyu and his ilk, for him to become a "sandwich" in their advertisements.

Half Hermit, Half Traitor

I saw a short article mentioning old stories about Zhou Zuoren:

Zhou Zuoren once said: "Life is not an easy thing. Living like an animal, naturally and simply, is one way; treating life as an art, living subtly and beautifully, is another way; there is no other path besides these two. What exists otherwise is a chaotic life below that of animals." ("The Art of Living")

He advocated living subtly: "Half hermit, half traitor."

Rebel when you can rebel; hide when you can hide. When rebelling, carry the seeds of hiding; when hiding, carry the fruits of rebellion. Before a traitor, he is a hermit; before a hermit, he is a traitor. Hiding and rebelling are done in moderation, rebelling and hiding are mutually supportive.

For whom do you rebel? For whom do you hide? Answer: the master.

——This passage is truly a good piece that touches upon Zhou Zuoren's inner secrets.

And I am reminded of the "goat with bells" mentioned by Lu Xun, and also of that terrifying beast that is "a sheep among wolves, and a wolf among sheep."

### Summer Night Sketches

— Shi Bei

Rainy Night

The night in the suburbs is lonely and melancholy.

Here, there are no dazzling neon lights, no cars rushing like dragons; the hustle and bustle of the city cannot reach this place. Everything seems to have subsided after a sound of disappointment after excessive fatigue. It is so desolate and sad!

In the past, I loved watching the summer dusk, going alone to the wheat fields, wandering aimlessly around the narrow paths; sometimes standing on a dirt pile in the field, gazing at the twilight colors that adorned the sky. Although the sunset glow was fleeting, was not this momentary brilliance a beautiful embroidery in a land full of disasters?

When dusk reached its end, and shadows ruled this open space, I would return from outside, passing through a dark road. The light in front of the gate was lit, and I looked down at my cold, clear shadow and walked into the house.

Tonight, it is raining heavily outside, and I cannot go to the fields again. The rain, carried by the wild wind, unleashed its power wantonly. The downpour struck my window, the ceaseless cracking and slapping sounds as if to shatter the peace of my small room. In fact, our simple, small house has never had peace, as news of sudden changes arrives at any time. Just now, after a companion came for a chat, the sounds of sighing and lamenting still lingered around, like a series of incessant painful groans, frightening and making me tremble… These shapeless feelings have never allowed me a moment of peace!

The rain is getting heavier and heavier! Outside the house is a mass of darkness, with terror following behind. Several flying insects, driven by the wind and rain, fluttered in through the broken window. I stared blankly at their wings covered in raindrops, flying around the light. These small lives must be struggling towards the light in the midst of hardship, right?

A fierce burst of heavy rain swept over from the foreign wheat fields; I was still watching the flying insects, and my momentarily dazed and silent heart, struck by this burst of heavy rain, suddenly jumped up again.

The electric light went out suddenly for some reason. It was already very late, but I did not want to go to sleep. I lit a small white candle, its flickering flame increasing the atmosphere of terror in the room. Yet what was I still afraid of? Since suffering has already struck, I want to see clearly this terrifying rainy night, so that when it clears up tomorrow, I can better appreciate the clouds in the distant sky.

### Landscape

— Zhou Huaimin

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 366

— Ye Jingfeng

To be fair, Yaoqun's misunderstanding was not entirely a misunderstanding. Only I could see this most clearly, and besides me, Mr. W, with his discerning eyes, could also see eight or nine parts of it. To allow himself and Yaoqun to concentrate on their work, Tsurumi tried his best to suppress his emotions. Furthermore, fearing that his emotions might not be so easily suppressed, he used a clumsy, Japanese-education-style method, adopting a current-insulation approach, avoiding working with Yaoqun as much as possible.

However, Yaoqun, this daughter of the Northeast, had a straightforward and honest personality. In her letter to Tsurumi, she made it clear: work is work, emotions are emotions, and everything should develop naturally. One cannot neglect food because of choking, thus delaying the work. However, Tsurumi stubbornly stuck to his position.

But no matter how straightforward and honest Yaoqun was, she was not a superhuman. She could not completely eliminate the original nature of a daughter and the small or large weakness inherent in women—jealousy—to zero. Therefore, as soon as Pingzi appeared, and as soon as she saw Tsurumi obediently (?), at Pingzi's command, even if Yaoqun were a superhuman, she would probably feel some resentment. Especially since she originally felt grateful and understood by Tsurumi.

Excessively suppressing emotions is not a good thing. The result is either extreme negativity, or a great and cunning person hiding evil, playing tricks, or being artificially pretentious; or it can trigger a formula of reversal, allowing the emotion that has been suppressed beyond measure to burst forth like the Yellow River breaching its banks, gushing and flowing freely, to the point of becoming cynical.

Fortunately, Yaoqun was able to control herself. She did not choose these vulgar paths; on the contrary, she concentrated on expanding the original work plan. Then, after Tsurumi and Pingzi set off, she and Little Tiger, taking the "Military Permit" that I had obtained for them, suddenly departed for the outside of Shanhaiguan.

At this time, transportation out of Shanhaiguan was certainly not as smooth as usual, but with someone as intelligent and resourceful as Yaoqun, and with a great purpose in mind, they naturally traveled safely along the way. They did not cause trouble, nor did anything happen to them. As for Little Tiger, with Yaoqun restraining him along the way, it was not easy to meddle in other people's affairs, even if he wanted to.

Moreover, Little Tiger also harbored a great idea of gratification on this trip back to his old stronghold. He thought, he left Shanhaiguan as a commoner, just a small potato of an ordinary big-eared peasant; he didn't even have the qualification of a "peasant" in the broad sense, because he was only twelve or thirteen years old, still a long way from adulthood. But this time he was returning to his old stronghold, and in just two or three weeks, he had officially received the rank of second lieutenant, albeit half-baked. But he was still an official, no matter how small. Being an official, in his imagination, there had to be some concrete glimpses of "returning home in glory" during the process of returning to his old stronghold, floating around in the front or back of his mind.

If you were with Little Tiger at this time, sitting in that improved second-class passenger car (actually, it was a fourth-class "stuffy" car—the true top three classes were not for "Chinese" people), you would see that Little Tiger was particularly polite, surprisingly well-behaved, and always had a smiling face when he spoke. The temper of glaring at people was nowhere to be seen at this time. The pair of skinny hands with special magic, which could cause death upon contact, now extended out, were also particularly gentle and soft, like the paws of a cat hiding its steel claws. Walking a few steps, he was no longer so reckless, but rather very gentle and refined. In short, he realized that he was an "official," and could not be so wild and rash.

### Living Education

— Shilang

If school is dead education, then society is living education. A student who throws away textbooks and opens the first page of "society" must find it difficult and bitter, much harder than school.

Many people who leave school often feel very resentful. The gatekeeper style and bureaucratic airs of those institutions often shatter their "vigorous spirit."

Those who are good at flattery may not think "adulation" is a big deal, and they will slowly get on the road, understand hypocrisy, learn to be "slick and round," learn to read faces and change color, and learn all the bad habits of society.

Only those who have been baptized in society for a long time can earn the reputation of being "experienced." These two words include a lot of boasting, and also include the "devaluation" of a lot of "private morality."

"Pure innocence" is often dismissed as "ignorance" in this society, while a person who knows how to follow the lead of those in power is considered "sophisticated" and "experienced."

This colorful society leads you by the nose, takes you to the abyss, and leads you to evil.

A college student and a middle school student degenerate into bandits (see the August 3rd edition of this newspaper). This is a common occurrence.

But how can this "living education" not lead pure and innocent students astray, not lead them into the abyss, and not lead them to evil?

This responsibility lies in the society itself, which applies "living education."

### "Flying Saucers" and Kite Reflectors - This Is Not a Mystery

— Xu Mingmo

The "flying saucer mystery" has ended without a resolution, leaving only a faint echo. "Ignore the strange, and the strange will disappear." All the unease and terror were merely the worries of common people. Many people, after their nerves returned to normal, cannot help but smile wryly.

However, what exactly are flying saucers? This mystery has never been solved. The existence of flying saucers is undeniable. People all over the world have seen them with their own eyes, and it cannot be dismissed as unfounded rumor. To deny this fact outright is tantamount to trying to cover up the truth with one hand, and the result is futile. We also do not advocate closing our ears and eyes, ignoring everything, like ostriches burying their heads in the sand. After the flying saucers have passed, we stick our heads out again, look at the sky, and feel very comforted.

What exactly are flying saucers? This question does not cease to exist with the disappearance of the flying saucer scare. The spirit of science lies in "pursuing knowledge through investigation." We must "investigate" even the smallest things, such as a speck of dust, or invisible things, such as a bacterium. How much more should we investigate these flying monsters in the sky? If the flying saucer mystery is not solved, we cannot rest easy. The so-called "shame of not knowing one thing" cannot tolerate the existence of "monsters" in today's scientific age. This is a disgrace to science.

Driven by curiosity, this reporter has put in a lot of thought into flying saucers, but has never been able to get a satisfactory explanation. Recently, I accidentally found some clues in an American magazine called "Science News Letter." This is a short news item with the title:

Aluminum Kite Reflector is used for Radar Target

"Aluminum kite reflector used as radar test target."

The news says that the research department of the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States has recently invented an aluminum kite-style reflector, which is used as a test target for anti-aircraft artillery radar sights. This is a box-shaped "kite," attached to a small balloon with a rope, and then the balloon is raised to a height of five hundred feet in the air, and fixed with a cable. This kind of kite target is then used for anti-aircraft artillery aiming and shooting tests. If the test is successful, it will be replaced by a real aircraft. Aluminum is the best reflective material for radar microwaves...

This short news item is enough to help us solve the mysterious mystery of flying saucers—flying saucers are not mysterious things, flying saucers are exactly this kind of "aluminum kite reflector." Let's imagine this: in a large-scale radar aiming test in the United States (or the Soviet Union, or the United Kingdom) (not necessarily for anti-aircraft artillery shooting, perhaps other secret special tests, because radar has many wonderful uses, and can now be used to detect rain clouds in the distant sky, or even a flock of birds), one or several balloons suddenly break their tethers and fly away with the wind. They gradually rise into the high altitude (hundreds or thousands of miles high), dragging a large group of aluminum kite reflectors. Finally, due to the air being too thin outside, they burst. Then, this batch of "kites" float down, drifting to every corner of the world...

This explanation is reasonable and rational. From this, it can be seen that "flying saucers" are actually ordinary things; although novel, they are not mysterious. As for why no responsible authority made a concrete statement after the flying saucers were discovered, this is due to military secrets. Anything related to military secrets, no matter how big or small, they never want to publicize it. If this secret is Soviet, separated by an Iron Curtain, not a single word will be revealed. General LeMay of the United States broadcast that flying saucers are a kind of high-altitude measuring meteorological instrument, which is obviously just deception. (According to Chengdu Telegraph, "flying saucers" were discovered in the suburbs of Chengdu, and were identified by professors of Sichuan University as high-altitude meteorological instruments. From what is described in the telegram, we can determine that these "flying saucers" are not the flying saucers that people have reportedly seen.)

Perhaps curious people will be disappointed when the secret of "flying saucers" is revealed. However, "science" truly tells us that flying saucers cannot become terrifying weapons. It must be known that although science can create great miracles, science can never create something out of nothing, nor can it create "monsters" that no one can guess. The most powerful weapons used by modern people, such as poison gas, bacteria, and atomic bombs, are not "monsters" created out of nothing. Humans have been using poison gas in warfare for at least five hundred years, and research on biological warfare has been going on for at least twenty years. The atomic bomb began to be manufactured five years before it exploded, and people foresaw it ten years ago. Within an hour after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, the Japanese government knew what it was. Now, a "flying saucer" has been flying for more than ten days, and we still cannot figure out what kind of terrifying possibility it has, which shows that "flying saucers" are not to be feared.

Since the appearance of this aerial monster "flying saucer," I do not know how many people's mental peace has been disturbed, and how much unnecessary fear and anxiety has been aroused. It is truly a cursed nightmare of the era! The mischief played by this disaster-causing balloon is enough for the world. We now hope to fully publicize the truth about "flying saucers," so that this over-stressed and exhausted world can regain—freedom from fear.

### What is One US Dollar Worth?

— Wu Zheng

According to the latest regulations of various governments, one US dollar can be exchanged for four shillings in the UK, 107 francs in France, 2.6 guilders in the Netherlands, 4.77 Danish krone in Denmark, 3.2 Indian rupees in India, 25 Egyptian pounds in Egypt, 5,000 drachmas in Greece, and 600 lira in Italy. It is even more valuable in China, with an official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan.

### Soviet Atomic City (Part 1)

— Translated by Binzhi

— Tannu Uriankhai

The study of atomic energy has aroused the interest of scientists all over the world. Of course, Soviet scientists are no exception. But this large-scale research requires precise laboratories, centralized factories, and even an entire city to be used for atomic energy research. Where is the Soviet atomic energy research center? This is a mysterious riddle. Because Soviet magazines and newspapers are strictly censored, and government reports never mention any information about atomic energy, even the word "uranium" cannot be seen in geological survey reports.

Based on various facts, Tannu Uriankhai is very likely to have become the Soviet atomic city. Tannu Uriankhai was originally a piece of land on the border of China's Outer Mongolia. In 1921, it declared independence from China and immediately joined the embrace of the Soviet Union. Later, the Soviet Union openly annexed it. Although China made a weak protest, what was the use?

There are reasons why Tannu Uriankhai was chosen as an atomic city. It is a vast valley located between two high mountains, which ordinary aircraft cannot fly over. The neighboring areas are also separated by a dozen large and small peaks, forming an isolated zone. The terrain there is not simple, which is a good place to build fortresses. At the same time, the continuous forests and deep rock caves can avoid enemy aircraft's reconnaissance vision.

The climate there does not change much with the seasons, and the soil is suitable for planting, which can produce a large number of crops. Countless cattle, sheep, horses, camels, etc. live on the vast grasslands. Although it is a desert area, the water source is very abundant. The lakes are full of游魚, and the rivers are navigable, and hydroelectric stations can be established everywhere. The high cliffs on both sides are natural hiding places. Countless minerals are buried underground: gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, platinum, tin, radium, manganese, asbestos, lingmu stone, yang lead, diamonds, clay, etc. Coalfields exposed on the surface are everywhere. These are indispensable materials for the research of atomic energy. Tannu Uriankhai has such rich resources, which not only can be self-sufficient, but also can supply a large number of troops, so it can be isolated from the outside world and secretly engage in atomic research.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shutuan

American Military Police and Police

Although military police and police are armed comrades, their duties are completely different. They respect each other and do not infringe on each other's jurisdiction. Because military police only manage military discipline, the police have a very large scope of authority, maintaining public order and security. Therefore, there are military police where there are soldiers in the United States, and soldiers are not allowed to leave the camp without a pass. Soldiers with passes are not allowed to carry weapons outside the camp. Military police on duty are issued handguns by the government, but they do not easily use them. In my five years in the United States, I have not read about military police or police practicing target shooting in the downtown area, nor have I heard of the strange story of accidental firing. Weapons simply do not have such a thing as accidental firing. The so-called accidental firing refers to a malfunction in the machine gun mechanism, where the bullets cannot be controlled when firing, and what was originally intended to be a short burst of three rounds ends up firing all the rounds. American military police are not an independent branch of the military, but are attached to each branch of the military. For example, at an Air Force officer school, officers and soldiers take turns serving as military police. Each person on duty is issued a handgun and an armband with MP written on it (SP for the Navy). Soldiers wear white steel helmets and khaki leggings, while officers do not. They specialize in inspecting whether soldiers of their own army are drunk and causing trouble in nightclubs and bars, mostly by means of persuasion, and there is no need to use force at all. Military police do not inspect theaters. There is no such thing as watching free shows in the United States. This does not mean that American soldiers do not watch plays, but rather that they never watch free shows. Because there are ready-made theaters in the military camps, and each ticket costs only 15 cents. Even if a lowly Private gets a monthly salary of $50 and watches a movie every day, it only costs $4.50 a month, which is negligible. Civilian-run cinemas in the city have two types of prices, regardless of seating. There is one price for adults, averaging 70 cents, and a discounted price for children and soldiers, about 75% off. Officers are not entitled to this kind of discount. In order to maintain their status, officers will definitely not infringe on the rights of soldiers, and would rather buy a full-price ticket or simply not watch. Military personnel receive discounts on trains and buses, but not on trams. The number of police is extremely small. In small cities, you simply cannot see police, because traffic is controlled by automatic traffic lights. Moreover, most police wear plain clothes, and their handguns are mostly hidden in their clothes, never hanging on their bodies for show. But when they open fire, they are always accurate. They cannot become police without practicing target shooting thousands of times. When they arrest thieves, they never shoot them dead, but are only allowed to hit non-lethal areas such as the legs, only to prevent their escape. When capturing major thieves, at most four or five people are dispatched, and there is no need for a large number of people. The strength lies in quality, not quantity. If the educational level of the police and military police can be improved, the number of people reduced, and the treatment adjusted, the efficiency of protecting the country and the people can definitely be increased, and the common people can also be threatened less.
