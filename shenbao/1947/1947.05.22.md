### The Council Holds Its First General Assembly; Zhang Qun Attends and Reports on Politics, Providing a Detailed Explanation of the Domestic and International Situation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan attended the first general assembly of the Political Council on the morning of the 21st to deliver a political report. His speech lasted eighty-five minutes. He received enthusiastic applause both when he stepped onto the podium and after he concluded his report. The assembly began at 9:00 AM with 204 council members in attendance. Fifty-nine written inquiries were submitted to Premier Zhang, along with numerous oral inquiries. The number of attendees who raised inquiries reached two-fifths of the total, demonstrating the council members' high level of concern for current political issues. Zhang Boling chaired the assembly, and the Secretariat reported on: (1) the current actual number of council members in this session, which is 362; (2) the fact that council members Chen Yuan, Xu Wending, Ma Tengyun, Ma Yi, Chen Xuanzhen, Dan Maoxin, Hu Shuhua, Liu Zhenru, Laming Yixi Chuchen, Situ Meitang, Zhou Suyuan, and Zhu Zhihong had requested leave due to personal matters or illness. Following this, the Standing Committee reported on its work and reviewed the government's implementation of various suggestions from the second general assembly of the fourth session. Secretary-General Shao Lizi gave a temporary report on the situation of meeting with student petitioners at 4:00 PM on the 20th. Zhang Qun began his report at 9:55 AM and concluded at 11:20 AM. Afterward, the 59 written inquiries were read aloud, taking a full hour. This concluded at 12:20 PM, and the 30 oral inquiries were rescheduled for the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Political Council held its second general assembly on the afternoon of the 21st. The enthusiastic oral questioning of Premier Zhang's political report by the council members was an unprecedented phenomenon in the Council's general assembly. The assembly started at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 7:30 PM, lasting four and a half hours. The entire time was almost entirely devoted to oral inquiries. Premier Zhang listened attentively and then gave a general response on the spot, which took fifteen minutes.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Due to the political questioning, the agenda of the second general assembly of the Political Council on the afternoon of the 21st, originally scheduled for social and judicial administration reports, was changed to the afternoon of the 22nd. The morning of the 22nd was still reserved for foreign affairs reports.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In his political report to the Political Council, Premier Zhang first introduced the domestic and international situation and diplomatic policies since the victory. He then detailed the past negotiations for peace, stating that, up to the present day, the question was not whether or not to resume peace talks. If the Chinese Communists were willing to seek peace, the government was ready to negotiate at any time, but he hoped that the council members would contribute their ideas on how to make the Chinese Communists change their minds. Zhang also provided a detailed explanation of the current economic problems and declared that the Executive Yuan was currently studying an economic reform plan, hoping that the council members would contribute valuable opinions so that it could be implemented smoothly once adopted. Finally, Premier Zhang specifically raised the issue of the recent student protests, expressing the government's deep concern for the future of education and encouraging students to uphold the spirit of law-abidingness while enjoying the right to freedom, so as to cultivate a constitutional atmosphere. Zhang declared in his concluding remarks: "I am not a genius. At this difficult time, assuming the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, there is no possibility of a miracle appearing. I deeply feel the concern of failure, and I am determined to devote myself to the utmost and encourage myself together with the people of the country."

### Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The original text of the political report delivered by Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan at the first meeting of the National Political Council on the morning of the 21st is as follows: Chairman, esteemed council members: The opening of this assembly coincides with the dawn of a new era for the nation, the end of the period of political tutelage, and the entry into the preparatory stage for constitutional government. After the National Assembly, which drafted the constitution, has completed its mission, and before the National Assembly implementing the constitution is formed, the National Political Council is currently the most representative body of public opinion. At this time, it is truly a great mission for your council to hold this assembly. The content of my report today is the process of the government reorganization and the focus of the government's administration in the future. I invite the esteemed council members to offer your unreserved guidance.

Domestic Politics

Before reporting on domestic politics, let us first review the international situation after the war. All countries in the world desire world peace and their own security after the war. However, because of the different levels of trust among the various parties in the world's peace-keeping mechanisms, the methods that each country adopts to safeguard its own security also differ. This difference in understanding and methods has given rise to contention between the victorious nations. The shared sentiment of the victorious countries, no matter how much they detest war, is the reason why successive international conferences have consistently failed to achieve harmony and unity. China is in this world environment. Our diplomatic policy is consistent: China is willing to live in harmony with all countries in the world. Even for countries that were enemies of ours during the war, we harbor no thoughts of revenge. In particular, we hope to strengthen our friendship and cooperation with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, which joined hands with China during the war, to jointly safeguard world peace. We are willing to follow diplomatic channels to seek fair and reasonable solutions to all outstanding international issues. China upholds the UN Charter, faithfully fulfills treaty obligations, and respects the legitimate rights and interests of friendly countries. At the same time, it also has the firmest determination to maintain its own national sovereignty, independence, and international status. Furthermore, China's diplomatic policy not only seeks harmony and cooperation between China and friendly countries, but also seeks harmony and cooperation between friendly countries. From the standpoint of international morality, this is the case; from China's own interests, it should also be the case. However, the international influence that China's diplomatic policy can exert is entirely determined by the extent to which we rely on our own efforts. If we cannot establish ourselves, then China will not only be unable to proactively control the environment, but will instead be controlled by the environment. Therefore, the most important tasks for China after the end of the war are unification, democracy, peace, and reconstruction. In order to achieve these goals, the National Assembly formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China last December. After the assembly adjourned, the government immediately consulted with the parties participating in the National Assembly to reorganize the government and jointly prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. The method of reorganizing the government is still based on the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions. The Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction remains the guiding principle for the administration of the reorganized government. However, because the Chinese Communist issue has not been resolved, the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, in fact, needs to be supplemented. The China Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Kuomintang, and social elites have all put forward their opinions. The result is that, based on the spirit of the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, twelve articles of the new government's administrative guidelines were jointly agreed upon (the articles are omitted). According to these guidelines, the National Government was reorganized last month, and the Executive Yuan was also reorganized accordingly. The foundation of the government has been expanded, and various parties participating in the National Assembly, as well as social elites, have jointly participated in the National Government Committee, becoming the highest decision-making body of the state. Its meetings are called the State Affairs Conference, and the Executive Yuan is responsible for executing the decisions of the National Government Committee. The new government's administrative guidelines that I have reported above have already been submitted to the Standing Committee of the government. Due to the situation at the time, they were implemented without being submitted to your council for discussion, which is regrettable. I hope that the assembly will understand and accept them.

Military Conflicts

Today's domestic military conflict can be said to be a problem that everyone is anxious about, but it has not been resolved to this day. During the past eight years of war in China, because we fought the strong with the weak, we had to concentrate all our strength to support the war. Although we did not completely ignore construction, these wartime constructions obviously could not compensate for the alarming consumption. The results of the eight-year war are obvious and everyone can say that there were economic and financial losses. What is relatively difficult to see, or what people are generally unwilling to openly admit, are the cultural and moral losses. From the government to the villages, the losses are equally serious.

The hope of the entire nation is that after the end of the war, we can have a longer period of rest and recuperation, so that we can recover from exhaustion and create a new life. Unfortunately, immediately after the end of the war, there was the unrest caused by the Communist Party, which has been continuing for a year and eight months now. Under such circumstances, all construction is out of the question. Chairman Chiang saw this point early on. As early as when Japan surrendered, he invited the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to Chongqing to discuss the grand plan for peaceful national reconstruction. The Shuang Shi (Double Tenth) Agreement summary resulted in a political consultative conference with the participation of all parties, which agreed on the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction. This can be said to be an important turning point in China's postwar situation. Regarding the process of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shao Lizi gave a detailed report at the fourth session of the fourth session of your council last March. The spirit of the agreement is: first, the nationalization of the military, the implementation of military reorganization, in order to unify the military organization and military orders; second, the democratization of politics, the implementation of separation of party and military and separation of military and civilian affairs, and the expansion of the government's foundation, the convening of the National Assembly, and the drafting of the Constitution. After the conference adjourned, the government immediately negotiated on the two issues of "restoring transportation" and "reorganizing the military." Last February, an agreement was reached on the rapid restoration of transportation in North and Central China and a plan on the reorganization of the military and the unified incorporation of the Chinese Communist forces into the National Army, stipulating implementation within eighteen months. Unexpectedly, the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference was first frustrated by the outbreak of war in the Northeast. Regarding this point, when the three-person conference negotiated and issued the order to cease conflict on January 10 last year, the government and the Chinese Communist Party had a written understanding, the original text of which was: "Section 2 of the aforementioned order to cease conflict does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine provinces of the Northeast or being transferred within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore Chinese sovereignty." However, when government troops were transported to the Northeast by rail or sea, the Chinese Communist troops obstructed them and, in mid-March, occupied various places in Liaobei that had already been taken over by the government, and attacked Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar, all important cities. As for military reorganization, the government made efforts to downsize the military after the military reorganization plan was established, while the Chinese Communist Party expanded its military in the Northeast.

Before the government returned to Nanjing last May, the government was eager for the negotiation on expanding the government's foundation and the convening of the National Assembly to succeed as soon as possible. Because the Chinese Communist Party insisted on excessive demands, the negotiation did not yield results. After the government returned to Nanjing, negotiation was stalled for a time, but the government still spared no effort to continue to work with the greatest patience to break the deadlock. The National Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on May 5, was also postponed to accommodate the Chinese Communist Party. On June 7, the government again ordered the troops in the Northeast to cease fire for nearly ten days, hoping to give the Chinese Communist Party another opportunity to change course and fulfill the agreement, and then negotiated with the Chinese Communist Party on the three issues of completely stopping the conflict in the Northeast, restoring domestic transportation, and implementing the military reorganization plan. The government's plan was very specific, while the Chinese Communist Party adopted a vague and evasive attitude, creating extraneous complications, making it impossible for the negotiation to proceed. Therefore, the ceasefire order was extended for another eight days. During this second ceasefire period, the Chinese Communist Party took the opportunity to launch a full-scale offensive on the Shandong, Jinpu, and Jiaoji lines, and places such as Dezhou and Tai'an were successively captured. Under such circumstances, peaceful negotiation was naturally unable to progress, but instead fell into a very serious deadlock. (To be continued)

### Election of Political Council Chairman to be Held Today; Wang Yunwu and Wang Shijie's Resignations Approved by the Assembly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The presidium of the National Political Council has accepted the resignations of Chairmen Wang Yunwu and Wang Shijie.

Furthermore, according to the regulations of the Political Council's organization, candidates for the presidium are not limited to Council members, and incumbent officials who are not Council members can also be elected.

### Shao Lizi Reports to the Political Council on the Meeting with Student Representatives

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Political Council reported at the Political Council on the morning of the 21st regarding the meeting at the Political Council on the afternoon of the 20th with student representatives from the Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou areas who had come to petition. Shao said: At the time, he and Deputy Secretary-General Lei met with the representatives, and there were also personnel from the General Affairs and Security Groups of the Council present. He accepted the students' written opinions. They had a total of five demands. He explained and interpreted one of them, namely that all schools above the vocational level should uniformly enjoy publicly funded treatment. He believed that this demand was not only difficult to achieve, but also unreasonable. Regarding the student petition, he told them that if students petitioned with reasonable demands, the government would consider them. However, he hoped that yesterday's unfortunate incident would be the last. At the same time, he hoped that lessons could be learned from the unfortunate incident, but not that the petition should be the last time. Finally, the student representatives stated that the military police were preventing them from advancing or retreating, and requested that a way be found to resolve the route back to school. He replied that the military police were preventing the students from advancing, but if the students were willing to return to school, there would be no reason to prevent them. After negotiations, they withdrew. Regarding the injured students, Shao also presented an investigation report, stating that only Sun Aoqun was seriously injured, with a broken leg, but there was no danger to his life, and doctors were trying to save his entire leg. More than ten other people had minor injuries.

### Canadian Ambassador Davis Presents Credentials to the Chairman

### Political Council Jottings

— Our Reporter, Zhang Ming

When Premier Zhang finished his report on the morning of the 21st, he said, "I am not a genius and cannot create miracles." Xu Deheng also mentioned during his questioning in the afternoon that "Premier Zhang is not a god." It seems that national affairs cannot be solved without creating miracles, but "everything depends on human effort." In Huang Yuren's questioning, he mentioned, "Our Premier also serves as the Vice Chairman of the Four United Relief Agencies. Why does a Premier have to serve as a vice chairman?" Huang Yuren was the first to stand up during the oral questioning. Those in the audience said, "The cannon has fired its first shot."

The chairman in the afternoon was Dr. Wu Yifang. Wu wore a black coat and a white scarf, looking like a judge.

Throughout the afternoon, Kong Geng sat on the presidium dais firing volleys of questions. He didn't care and only came down at the end to listen to Premier Zhang's reply.

Han Zhaoyu's call for his allies in the Democratic League was undoubtedly tinged with grief and indignation.

There was a burst of warm applause in the meeting to pay tribute to the Taiwanese council members who were attending the Political Council for the first time.

Liang Shuming's voice and vocabulary undoubtedly resembled a preacher, repeatedly saying "confession" and "reflection." On the stage was the black-clad Dr. Wu, and below the stage was Bishop Yu Bin. Wouldn't you want to shout "Amen" when you heard them?

The student petition was naturally a matter of concern, and Shao Lizi's report was usually welcomed, but it was not timely. Because everyone was eager to hear the political report, Pan Tongru issued an urging order, hoping to speed it up. Shao said, "I'll be done soon," with a great attitude.

Zhang Qun reported on the government reorganization and the military conflict for a long time, and Liang Shuming and others listened with their eyes closed.

Xiao Tongzi and Xu Xiaoyan sat in the last row of the press gallery, looking very friendly.

Chuan Laosian, who is about to go abroad to treat his high blood pressure, arrived late today and walked around all the seats with flickering eyes, unable to find his seat. Finally, the meeting affairs staff led him in a large circle before he sat down.

When Zhang Qun's report reached the financial and economic sections, many people perked up, but what they heard were "serious stage," "budget exceeded," "economic crisis," "can only set an example," "prices will rise again"… "How can this be?" problems.

One gentleman mentioned in his written questioning, "What are the standards for social elites? What can one do to become a social elite?" Everyone couldn't help but laugh. Written inquiries were being sent up one after another. There were two readers, one reading ten inquiries each, taking turns. Each change of readers startled the people below. When the fiftieth inquiry was read, there was a commotion in the audience, who thought it was necessary to end the reading of written inquiries and proceed with oral inquiries. However, Shao explained that the written inquiries had to be read because they were originally written inquiries to temporarily replace oral ones in order to save time. If they were not read, they would be repeated.

### Government Carefully Studying Outstanding Military, Political, Economic, and Educational Issues; Premier Zhang Answers Inquiries at the Second Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At the second general assembly of the Political Council on the afternoon of the 21st, a total of 197 council members were in attendance. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yifang. After the meeting began, oral inquiries on the political report began. After a break, a total of 36 council members spoke, with the focus of their inquiries being on calling for peace and reviewing the implementation of the new government's administrative guidelines. In addition, there were also inquiries about the conflict between students and military police.

Zhang replied briefly: At present, whether in military affairs, politics, economics, or education, there are countless problems waiting to be solved. The government is carefully studying them. I have only been in office for four weeks, and I have not yet fully understood some specific issues. I am very grateful to the gentlemen for informing me. As for the temporary measures for maintaining social order passed by the State Council on the 18th, they are based on Article 23 of the Constitution being implemented, which stipulates that emergency measures may be taken to maintain social order and in times of economic crisis. At the same time, martial law can be implemented for student petitions. However, in order to avoid the use of force, the procedures and legal formalities for petitions are first stipulated. Before the measures were announced, student petitions had already occurred in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and there were incidents of obstructing traffic and interfering with official duties. The government must carefully consider how to handle the unfortunate incident that occurred in the capital yesterday. Zhang then responded to the issue of peace, saying: "I believe that the questions asked by the gentlemen, 'When can we have peace, and what methods can be used to achieve peace?' are very important. We can consider them carefully, but due to time constraints, can we hold a forum at a later date to discuss and decide together?" Zhang also said: He sets aside an hour and a half each day to work at the Political Council, exchange opinions with Council members from various places who come to Nanjing, and prepare to answer questions.

Enthusiastic Inquiries by Council Members Unseen in Previous Assemblies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After Premier Zhang Qun delivered a political report at the first general assembly of the Political Council on the morning of the 21st, the council members began to raise written and oral inquiries, reaching a total of 102, taking up more than five hours in total. This situation was unprecedented in previous sessions of the Political Council. Among the inquiries made by the council members, the most concerning issues were peace and unification, student unrest, labor unrest, corrupt officials, requisition and purchase of goods, bureaucratic capitalism, the current economic crisis, the new government's administrative guidelines, subsidy policies, balancing the budget, protecting human rights, separation of military and civilian affairs, and border areas. Council members from the north provided detailed descriptions of the current suffering of the people in the northern provinces, hoping to find a solution as soon as possible. Council members from the Northeast believed that the government should quickly seek to improve the method of purchasing soybeans at low prices and selling cloth at high prices in the Northeast. Regarding the issue of peace and unification, many council members spoke on this topic, with most believing that the current situation has reached a most critical juncture, and that peace and unification are desired by all the people. However, the methods to achieve peace and unification should be carefully discussed to ensure effectiveness. Liang Shuming believed that the government and the Communist Party should both reflect on their actions and discuss them in good faith to seek a path to peace. Those who spoke today included Wang Yaming, Han Hanshen, Pan Chaoying, Xiao Yishan, Huang Yanpei, Xu Deheng, Kong Geng, Shen Zhijing, Gu Gengye, Liang Shuming, He Baoren, etc. After Taiwanese council member Lin Zhong spoke, all the council members applauded to welcome him. After the inquiries were completed, Premier Zhang gave a comprehensive reply.

### People Have the Right to Petition, but Cannot Disrupt Order; Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The News Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 21st. Director Dong Xiangguang answered the reporters' questions as follows: Question: Can the freedom of the people stipulated in the Constitution be considered to have been implemented in this transitional period in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution? Do the Constitution and other laws implementing the Constitution have provisions to protect the right of the people to demonstrate?

Answer: The Constitution will be formally implemented on December 25th of this year. During this transitional stage in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution, the government has repeatedly stated that it will earnestly protect the various freedoms of the people. Article 10 of the government's administrative guidelines promulgated by the National Government on April 18 stipulates strict protection of the people's freedom of body, freedom of speech and publication, and freedom of assembly and association, and strictly prohibits illegal arrests and interference. Any restrictions that must be imposed in order to maintain social order and avoid emergency dangers must be approved by the National Government Committee. The Constitution and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage only stipulate that the people have the right to petition, but only if it does not harm the people's freedom, social order, and public interest.

Question: Can the order announced by the government on the 19th be interpreted as prohibiting any demonstrations and parades by students, or only those that disrupt public order?

Answer: The recent student movement has unfortunately been exploited by those with political intentions, leading to the disruption of social order and public interest. The government specially promulgated measures to maintain social order on May 19 in accordance with Article 10 of the administrative guidelines. When people's organizations petition, they should send representatives to the competent authorities to express their opinions. The number of representatives is limited to ten. There must be no gathering of crowds to threaten, march, demonstrate, or other acts that disturb public safety.

### Publication of the Cost of Living Index Resumed in Various Places

Question: Has a decision been made to resume the monthly publication of the cost of living index?

Answer: The cost of living index in various places is now being continuously compiled and publicly published by the competent authorities in various places on a monthly basis.

Question: Are there any plans to change the value of the national currency? Is the government's policy to maintain the current exchange rate of 12,000 yuan of legal tender to one US dollar?

Answer: As far as I know, the government has no plans to change the current exchange rate.

Question: Is it in accordance with Chinese law for foreign enterprises in China to demand payment in US dollars? Are there exceptional preferential provisions in the law for semi-military American enterprises such as ATC (Air Transport Command)?

Answer: According to Article 5 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency in the Economic Emergency Measures Program, (foreign nationals or institutions shall not use their foreign currency to pay salaries or for other purposes), there are no exceptions.

This news was announced by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, during a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 21st in response to questions.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Yan Ping, and Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Jianfei, arrived in Shenyang from Beiping on the morning of the 21st.

### US Economic Aid to China Seeks a Reasonable Path: Marshall's Remarks to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall discussed the situation in China and the proposed US $500 million loan at a press conference today. He made the comments when a reporter from the Communist newspaper "Daily Worker" asked whether the State Department was considering an early disbursement of the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China. Secretary Marshall said: The State Department is paying close attention to the situation in China. The US government is striving to find a path that both Congress and the American people consider reasonable to aid China. He said that we expect the reorganization of the Chinese government, and the reorganization of the Chinese government has already been announced. Marshall pointed out in a serious tone that the United States sincerely wishes to assist China on a practical basis, but he could not specify what actions could be taken to make this assistance reasonable. Marshall consistently avoided directly answering the $500 million loan question first raised by the "Daily Worker" reporter when discussing matters concerning China. He finally stated that he could not reveal what actions the US government might take but reiterated that the government is very concerned with finding ways to help stabilize the situation in the Far East.

### National Army in Changchun Launches Outward Attacks; Actively Preparing for Defensive Warfare in the City; Xiong Shihui and Wang Shuming Fly to Shenyang

[Our Changchun Dispatch of the 21st] The National Army in Changchun launched attacks this morning, searching for Communist troops in the surrounding areas. To the south, they have reached Yinjia Youfang, 30 li from the city, and to the west, they have cleared the area west of the airfield. To expand the battle results, they are currently waiting to join forces with the National Army advancing from the north. It was previously reported that Gongzhuling was recovered yesterday, but the military has not yet confirmed it. (Another Dispatch) Preparations for the defensive battle in Changchun are actively underway. In addition to strict deployment of posts in all important locations in the city, several fortifications have been constructed. Compared to the defensive battle in Changchun last year, the defenses are now much more stringent. Foreign diplomats from the US, Britain, and other countries have all designated safe areas for concentration. From last night until noon, the general situation was much quieter than the previous night. There are no Communist troops within ten li of the city. However, it is believed that this may be brewing a new situation, but it will not affect the safety of Changchun because the defending troops have strong confidence, and many young citizens have voluntarily organized groups to protect their homeland.

[Another Dispatch] The battle situation in Changchun is temporarily easing. Communist troops fleeing into the suburbs are still harassing from time to time, but their range is now limited to the west and southwest, with traces of Communist troops in those directions only. The rest have retreated. There has only been contact between outposts in the past twelve hours. Whether there will be a major battle in the future will depend on the direction of the Communist troops' main force. Reinforcements from the National Army have indeed advanced north from Siping, so the decisive battle location may also be on the north bank of the Dongliao River and near Gongzhuling.

[Another Dispatch] More than 10,000 troops from Zhou Baozhong's Communist forces captured Wulajie north of Jilin City at 2 AM on the 20th. They also crossed the river and harassed the Jilin-Changchun line, having intruded into areas near Hezitou and Huapichang. However, the National Army is heavily fortified, and passenger trains on the Jilin-Changchun line were temporarily suspended yesterday but have resumed today. Meihekou is under siege and appealing for help. The Yunhe train station between Siping and Meihekou was invaded by Communist troops yesterday. Traffic on the Shenyang-Jilin line has been interrupted for two weeks, and fighting along the line has not stopped.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 21st] The Communist forces who launched a heavy attack on Gongzhuling on the 19th are now being surrounded and annihilated by the National Army advancing from the north, south, and west. Another National Army force briefly entered the city of Huaide County on the 20th. The National Army is now approaching the Fanjia Tun train station in the northern part of Gongzhuling along the Chaoyangpo (25 li west of Gongzhuling) and Helinzi (40 li northwest of Gongzhuling) highways, forming a fan-shaped encirclement of the Communist-occupied Daling. (Another Dispatch) At around 2 AM this morning, the Jingshui Chang area in the southern suburbs was harassed by a few hundred Communist troops, who were then driven back by the National Army. Other than that, the four suburbs are peaceful, and the atmosphere in the city has also eased. The streetcars, which had been temporarily suspended yesterday, have now resumed operation.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 21st] The siege of Faku has been lifted, and the Communist troops have retreated to the Kangping area, but telecommunications between Shenyang and Faku have not yet been restored. The weather cleared today, and the air force here has been operating all day, greatly assisting the National Army.

[Another Dispatch] Xiong Shihui flew back to Shenyang from Nanjing at 4 PM on the 21st. Wang Shuming also flew in. Liao Yaoxiang rushed to Liaoyang from Qingyuan on the 18th and discussed the current situation at Du Yuming's former residence at noon on the 19th. Zhao Jiaxiang and others attended. Liao returned to Qingyuan in the afternoon to oversee operations.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi flew to Beiping from Nanjing via Xuzhou and Jinan today.

### National Army Launches Large-Scale Sweep in the Yi Meng Mountain Area of Central Shandong

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 1st] The Communist forces in Shandong gathered ten columns of troops this time, launching an all-out assault on the area east of the Xintai-Mengyin-Qingtuosi highway in the Yi Meng Mountain area. After a strong counterattack by the National Army and seven days and nights of bloody fighting, the Communist forces were defeated again on the 19th due to heavy casualties and retreated in various directions towards Ju County, Yishui, and Tanbu. The National Army is currently pursuing and annihilating them.

### Schools in Beiping and Tianjin Resume Classes One After Another; Hu Shi and Mei Yiqi Give Lectures to Students

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 21st] The high tide of the student movement in Beiping has passed. Chaoyang, Sino-French, Teachers' College, Art College, First Midwifery School, and other schools resumed classes yesterday. Huiwen and other middle schools have resumed classes today. Beiyang Beiping and the Railway Academy have not yet resumed classes because the Ministry of Education has not responded to the demands of "Fuda" or relocation.

There are three different opinions among the students: one faction advocates not resuming classes until a satisfactory response is received from the authorities regarding the protests; another faction advocates resuming classes immediately; and a third faction advocates striking for one or three more days. The last one is the majority. Tsinghua President Mei Yiqi went to the city yesterday to meet with Hu Shi and, after returning to the school, summoned student representatives to lecture them, telling them that classes should resume immediately. The students asked for another day of rest because they were too tired, so the resumption of classes at Tsinghua will be on the 23rd.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 21st] Hu Shi summoned student representatives from Peking University today to lecture them, telling them that the march is over and that what they wanted to express is already known to the world, and they should fulfill their promises and resume classes starting tomorrow. The student representatives promised to inform all the students and stated that the authorities should arrest the murderers and compensate and release Du Bingwen, the representative of the Tangshan Institute of Technology who went missing yesterday, before classes resume. Hu Shi promised to negotiate on their behalf.

Hu Shi also spoke about his feelings regarding the recent student movement in Beiping today. He said that after yesterday's march, the students' purpose has been achieved, and they must not do it again. They should resume classes immediately.

### Half of National Central University Students Resume Classes
Decide to Form a "May 20th" Incident Handling Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] More than half of the students at National Central University attended classes on the 21st. The campus was calm, and it is expected that the number of students attending classes tomorrow will continue to increase. The Student Representatives Conference of each department held a meeting at 3 PM this afternoon and resolved to pass: (1) Organize a May 20th Bloodshed Incident Handling Committee. (2) Request that the Garrison Headquarters be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured students, the government provide compensation for the deceased students, and the relevant authorities investigate and release the arrested students within five hours. (Note from the reporter: The Garrison Headquarters has accepted the request to be responsible for medical expenses. As for the compensation, as there were no deaths, the request is not valid. According to the person in charge of the National Central University President's Office, all arrested students have been bailed out by the school. There are still two staff members and two students detained in the court, and the school is currently processing bail procedures and can take them back.) (3) Continue to demand an increase in food allowances. If the goal is not achieved, classes will not be resumed. Issue a circular to the compatriots of the nation, a circular to the students of the nation, a circular to the people of the world, and a letter to the National Political Council for the "May 20th" incident, and refute the remarks of the Deputy Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Zhen.

### Jinling University Students Continue to Strike

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Student Union of Jinling University held a general meeting on the morning of the 21st, attended by more than 600 people, accounting for about half of the total number of students in the school, and decided to continue the strike, demanding an increase in the number of publicly funded students and expressing condolences to the injured students of National Central University. The Student Union of the College of Arts and Sciences of the private Jinling University held a general meeting on the morning of the 21st, attended by more than 180 people. The total number of students in the school is more than 300. It was decided to strike for one day on the 22nd to express sympathy for the National Central University students who were injured in the sympathy march on the 20th. Most of the students who did not attend the meeting were seniors, who did not agree with the strike. In addition, the President of the College, Wu Yifang, did not oppose the students expressing sympathy for the injured students of National Central University, but believed that the method of strike was unnecessary, so it is not yet certain whether the school will strike today.

### Communist Conspiracy Becomes Overt; Plotting to Organize a Suicide Squad to Expand the Student Movement

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the student movement has surged, causing social unrest. The situation has evolved to the point that the instigation by the Communist Party and its periphery has become overt. It is learned that the Communist Party is now launching the so-called "June 2nd National General Strike, General Work Strike, and General School Strike" movement, attempting to take advantage of this student movement to expand it and create a bloody tragedy, intentionally creating a state of social chaos and unrest. Of the thirty student representatives from Shanghai who went to Nanjing to petition, eight returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the remaining representatives will return within two or three days. It is learned that after receiving this news, the Communist Party will prepare to launch another conspiracy, that is, they plan to take advantage of the return of the student representatives to Shanghai and secretly use the students again, under the pretext of "welcoming" them to the North Station. At the same time, there will be an organization of a "suicide squad" preparing to mix in among them, deliberately causing bloodshed incidents to expand the situation and achieve their political conspiracy. It is learned that most students in various schools have adopted a cautious attitude, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices, because they realize that this student movement has been altered.

### Those Who Orchestrate the Beiping Student Movement Have "Capital" and Spent Two Billion Yuan to Call for "Anti-Hunger"

An Episode of the Beiping Student Movement

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] A portion of the universities here were incited to hold their so-called "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War" march. Fortunately, due to the effective defense of the police officers in charge of security, no major unfortunate incidents occurred. According to observers familiar with the inside story: the student movement here may come to an end. Here are a few excerpts of the episodes related to the march: (1) The marching column was largely advocating "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War." More than 2,000 students participated, most of them from Tsinghua University, about 400. More than 300 students from the school who participated in this student movement went to the city a few days ago and stayed in Peking University to plan the relevant work. After yesterday's march, Peking University hired more than ten cars to send this group of "guests" out of the city to fulfill the "host's" friendship. (2) Before marching into the city today, students from outside the city went to Fu Jen Catholic University to ask for helpers. The students of the school did not agree, so there was a conflict inside and outside the school. As a result, 30 students were forcibly pulled away to participate in the march. (3) Several people from Sino-French University participated in the march. President Li Linyu did not know about it beforehand. (4) While the students were marching, the reporter met with Xu Peikun, the president of the Railway Institute, in the morning and asked for his opinion on this student movement. Xu said: If the authorities and faculty of the schools have a unanimous opinion, the student movement can be resolved. Xu continued: Taking the Railway Institute as an example, issues such as the relocation of the Air Force Factory and the restoration of the name of Jiaotong University are not problematic, so they will not be the cause of the strike. The reporter then asked whether the opinions of the authorities of the schools could be unanimous. Xu was silent. (5) The scenic area of Beiping is the area around the Three Gates in front of Tiananmen, where red walls and green tiles reflect each other. The prosperous area of Beiping is the Dongsi and Xidan Archways. When the marching students passed through these places today, they used tar brushes to smear many glaring and reactionary slogans and cartoons on the red walls. The shops and walls were most painted where there was beauty. Some students even climbed onto the Dongsi Archway with their ability to fly up walls and smear tar slogans, a step further than writing slogans with chalk on the street the other day. Because the tar is difficult to wash off, passersby lamented, and an old man admired this kind of work at the Three Gates and sighed, saying: The former Cultural Relics Committee spent 600 million to renovate, and today the students, with tar brushes, destroyed its neat beauty in a moment. In the future, it will be renovated again and money will be spent again. Anyway, the common people are unlucky! (6) According to people familiar with the inside story of the student movement: The planners of this student movement have complete plans and strong capital. In terms of propaganda, excluding the temporary smearing of slogans on the street: the number of various propaganda materials printed is very large, and the paper is exquisite. Even the street wall newspapers, each costing 10,000, require several million. The organization that manages the propaganda department prints and distributes news releases and other temporary notices every day. The number of mimeograph machines dedicated to this purpose is as many as eight. In terms of transportation costs, the number of cars used for meetings everywhere every day, together with the cars used for the march today, and the cars used by Tsinghua and Yenching students to travel back and forth, is alarming. The 300 students of Tsinghua who live in Peking University spend more than 10 million on three meals a day for three days. According to incomplete estimates: the capital invested by the conspirators in this Beiping student movement is more than 200 million yuan. No wonder a reader of a wall newspaper shook his head and sighed: It's ridiculous to spend so much money and still call oneself hungry. (7) The organizers of the march pulled students from middle schools. The principal of Mu Bei Girls' High School said to the students in the school: It is a fact that people are eating the worst now, but there is no fundamental hunger problem. One goes, one is expelled, all go, the school closes, don't be fooled by them. The students suddenly realized and attended class safely.

### The Supervisory Yuan Dispatches Personnel to Investigate and Handle the Student Movement

The Supervisory Yuan immediately sent Gu Fengxiang, Wang Shuzeng, and Yang Nairu to the relevant agencies to investigate and handle the process of the student march and petition and the handling of the situation.

### All Sectors of Beiping Hold a Purge-the-Traitors Movement Rally
Petition the Northwest Headquarters to Quickly End the Civil War

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] All sectors of the city held a Purge-the-Traitors Movement to Restore Peace Rally at Taihe Palace at 3 PM on the 20th. More than 20,000 people attended, chaired by the four organizations of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, and Education Association. They separately lectured on the true meaning of purging the traitors, announced the ironclad evidence of the Communist Party's disaster to the country and the people, and passed a declaration of the conference on the spot.

### Severe Food Shortage in Suiyuan Province; Launching a Production Increase Campaign

[Our Guihua Dispatch of the 21st] Not many counties in Suiyuan Province planted crops this spring. It is now time to plant autumn crops, but it is difficult for the people to plant a lot due to the lack of manpower and livestock. The grain-producing area in western Suiyuan has suffered a severe food shortage, and the Suiyuan Provincial Government is actively launching an expanded production increase campaign.

### The Far Eastern Commission Passes a Policy on the Distribution of Reparations: Based on the Extent of Devastation by Japan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The reporter learned today: The Far Eastern Commission has adopted the following policy on the distribution of reparations from Japan, that is, this distribution should be based on the extent of devastation suffered by each country due to Japan's ravages and the extent of its contribution to defeating Japan. The Commission passed a policy on May 8th, deciding that the amount of reparations from Japan received by individual countries should be determined by a "broad political basis", that is, in addition to the above two considerations, the scope and time of the country's resistance to Japanese aggression should also be considered. The Commission also passed various policies related to Japan's imports and exports. Japan's export goods may only be approved under the following circumstances, that is, the importing country must agree to exchange them for Japan's needed imports or agree to pay for the export goods in useful or convertible foreign exchange. In deciding on the source of Japan's imports, the Commission also agreed that the basic goal should be to minimize the cost and difficulty of handling these imports, while also considering the price conditions at the time of purchase and the various guarantees that the goods must be delivered to Japan in a timely manner. However, under any circumstances, the Allied Commercial Commission may propose individual handling of various import and export goods.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission is seeking to reconcile the differences in distribution ratios. It is said that the United States requires the largest share, but not for its own use, but to cede it to countries such as Korea and the Philippines. China requires 40% of the Japanese assets allocated for reparations, and the Philippines requires about 15%, while other countries require smaller amounts. The decisions of the Far Eastern Commission have instructed MacArthur to handle the matter as he sees fit.

### Guangdong Provincial Assemblyman Zou Wu Assassinated

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch of the 20th] While the second congress of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly was in progress, an assassination of a provincial assemblyman occurred suddenly on the morning of the 20th.

Editorial

### Stability and Suppression of Rebellion

Social phenomena are becoming increasingly turbulent, and the people of the entire nation feel a growing need for stability. This is like a patient who is about to go mad with fever; the doctor must first use medication to reduce the heat and stop the agitation. Today, China's political situation and social phenomena are so chaotic and turbulent that they are almost impossible to unravel, but precisely because of this, voices calling for stability are coming from all directions.

Chairman Chiang said in his speech to the National Political Council the day before yesterday, "...in order to seek stability for the nation and society..." Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan also advised students, "...in today's situation where the government urgently needs stability..." These are all expressions of the government's pursuit of stability.

The Shanghai Municipal Council and various legal entities jointly sent a telegram yesterday, advising students to "seek educational progress through stability." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also advised university students to "stabilize society by stabilizing schools." Various circles in Peiping even held a major rally to eliminate traitors, petitioning for the swift suppression of internal disorder to secure the people's livelihood. These are all appeals from the people for stability.

Stability, stability, in today's China, seems to be the most fundamental prerequisite for all construction and all work. Instability only leads to more chaos, and if the turmoil continues, there will be a day of great disorder. The people's path to survival today is becoming increasingly narrow, almost to the point of despair. How can we allow the country to sink further into the abyss of turmoil? Therefore, today's situation in China, although seemingly difficult and confusing, is actually very simple if we grasp the key point: that is, whoever can quickly bring the country into a state of stability at this time, the people will certainly welcome them with food and drink and pray for them with incense. Whoever still intends to undermine the overall situation, causing the country to move from instability to even greater chaos, the people will surely detest and abhor them.

So, how can we achieve stability today? Those who only scratch the surface will inevitably raise the issue of "opposing civil war" as the answer, meaning that if the civil war is stopped, peace and stability can be immediately achieved. In reality, if we think deeply, even if the term "civil war" is valid, we should ask why there is a civil war in the first place. The government certainly spends national funds on military operations, but if there were no Communists who betray the nation, deny the constitution, and resist the government, relying on their troops to create trouble, then how could the "civil war" arise? Therefore, the civil war is caused by the Communists, and the illegal activities of the Communists in China are the yeast of instability today. Because the Communists, in the process of seizing power, use the destruction of social order and the creation of chaotic phenomena as their only means, it is impossible to achieve the reasonable desire for stability with the illegal activities of the Communists. Once we recognize this point, if we truly want to achieve stability, it will not be difficult to prescribe the right medicine.

We believe that to achieve stability, we must first establish order before we can achieve peace. How can we establish order? The Great Learning says, "Knowing where to stop, then one can be composed"; Mencius said, "Being one with principle." There is absolutely no way that something without a central anchor, swaying and moving, hesitating and pacing, delaying and considering, can be expected to be "composed"! As the ancients said well: "Indecision leads to disorder." Why does indecision occur? It is because one cannot be composed, because one cannot "transform" into "one." The so-called "stopping" and the so-called "one," in simple terms, mean that the person in charge should first have a clear belief, a firm belief, never turning back in the face of difficulties, sacrificing life for it, preferring to seek right and wrong, merits and demerits, in the eyes of future generations, and not be swayed by the clamor of temporary public opinion. Here, we dare to represent the people in respectfully asking the government authorities and members of the National Political Council a question: "What attitude do you take towards the Communists who resist the constitution and create disorder, and their troops?" Please give a decisive answer, and not an ambiguous or evasive one. If you believe that the Communist Party's style of denying the constitution, denying agreements with the National Government, and even resorting to armed rebellion is correct, then you should simply and happily cease fighting, voluntarily hand over power, and let the Communist Party do whatever it wants. Why continue to let the soldiers on the front lines fight? If you still claim to respect the constitution, still do not want to overthrow the government, and still think of the people who have suffered from the Communist Party's long-term disorder and want to relieve them, then the way to seek stability at this time is definitely not to repeat the old tune of "peace talks," but to repent of the past, thoroughly correct previous mistakes, and concentrate all efforts on suppressing the rebellion. Only by quickly suppressing the rebellion can we stabilize the overall situation. If we still engage in suppressing bandits on one hand and singing the praises of peace talks on the other, profess the rule of law on one hand and condone evil on the other, hesitating and doubting, unable to make up our minds, still leaving the people and the soldiers on the front lines confused, then even our own spirit will lack composure. How can we stabilize the overall situation and reassure the people? "If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the disease will not be cured"; today, it seems that the time is approaching when we must take the dizzying medicine.

### Purchase Policy for Export Commodities

It has recently been reported that the government has established a purchase plan for export goods, to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. If this is true, it can be said to be a new economic measure with some significance.

Since the promulgation of the emergency economic measures on February 17, and the subsequent extension of the US dollar exchange rate to 12,000 yuan, the export market has temporarily shown signs of activity. However, due to excessive speculation, market prices have risen higher and higher, with most rising above the overseas selling prices. This has rendered the exchange rate adjustment ineffective, and the export of domestic products remains blocked. The situation of import surplus has not changed either. Consequently, the depletion of foreign exchange funds, the difficulties of exporters, and the suffering of producers and processors are deepening day by day. Even if the government tries to promote exports, the situation does not improve. As for the stagnation of funds, the high interest rates, warehouse rent, insurance, labor, and other increased costs, they are even more of a concern. If these situations continue for a long time without timely remedy, not only will producers and processors reduce their interest in continuing production due to blocked sales channels, but also all middlemen such as transporters, vendors, exporters, and even speculators will lose interest due to stagnant funds and lack of profit. Under these circumstances, how can production be increased? How can foreign exchange be earned? How can the unemployed population be reduced? At the beginning of the implementation of the measures to promote exports, this newspaper once wrote an article pointing out the need to implement purchases simultaneously. The viewpoint lies precisely in this.

Although starting to purchase now is generally less favorable due to higher prices and slower sales channels, it is still not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We sincerely hope that the report is true and that it will quickly become a reality.

However, the government's purchase of export goods is certainly not for temporary profits, but to save export trade. In terms of its nature, it is more like relief than profit-seeking. Even if there is an intention to profit, it is to seek long-term overall benefits, not temporary partial small benefits. In other words, this move is based on the overall national economy and is definitely not to seek temporary small benefits in finance or business. Therefore, the vision must be far-sighted, and the plan must be broad. Before and after the war, there were many similar cases in various countries, such as Japan's purchase of raw silk, Brazil's purchase of coffee, and the United States' purchase of wheat. Not only did they buy high and sell low, clearly losing money, but sometimes they even threw the purchased materials into the water to alleviate the surplus phenomenon. This kind of boldness and strength is not easily achieved by the current government in our country, which is facing difficulties both privately and publicly, but its principles and spirit are indeed what should be strictly observed when handling purchases and controlling the economy. If someone without this vision and boldness presides over the purchase, only knowing how to make small calculations, it will not benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood!

Because simple profit-seeking is not the goal of the government's purchase, the price, quantity, and types of purchases should be determined according to an appropriate plan to conform to the original intention. We believe that the goods purchased should first be major export goods, second, goods that are not easily exported by private individuals, and third, export goods with particularly difficult funding. In terms of quantity, it should not be restricted too strictly, but it is also not necessary to involve any coercion, so as not to create suspicion of competing with the people for profit. In other words, those who are unwilling to sell at the set price can be free to buy and sell as they please. As for the purchase price, this is the most difficult problem to solve. In principle, it seems most fair to barely cover the cost and be sufficient to maintain production. This should be the main purpose of the government's purchase, and it is also the key to saving export trade. If it is higher than this number, it may be more difficult to sell, and the government may not be able to bear it; if it is lower than this number, vendors and producers will still have no way to continue, and the purpose of relief will not be achieved. However, there are various kinds of costs: (1) the cost of direct producers, (2) the cost of processors, (3) the cost of operators who transport or sell, and (4) the cost of those who repeatedly buy and sell, forming speculators. Among these, items (1, 2, and 3) are the most reasonable and should naturally be taken into account. If the overseas market price is higher than the domestic price, but private individuals are unable to sell due to difficulties in transportation, foreign exchange, and import restrictions, they should be purchased at the market price and should not be overly suppressed to show consideration.

Controlled economy is praised by people at the time; according to the facts, it has both advantages and disadvantages, and often does not meet expectations. As far as the current situation is concerned, apart from foreign exchange, we still believe that only export trade has the value and necessity of implementing a control policy. Although the advocacy of free trade and the elimination of tariff barriers is very loud, there are still few who have thoroughly implemented them. When overseas sales are difficult and international trade cannot be balanced, no matter from which perspective, it is probably very difficult in reality to rely solely on private forces to promote the export of local goods and restore overseas markets. In defeated Japan, its export trade has already been proceeding steadily under the protection of the Allied forces. Therefore, even if it is not for the sake of temporary relief, it seems necessary to catch up quickly on this work. Therefore, we hope that the government's purchase of export goods will be launched quickly and promoted on a large scale, so as to make a fundamental and effective remedy to the common goal of increasing production. Do not get bogged down in trivial details, making sporadic decorations, satisfying only the relief of some exporters. As for the domestic sales restrictions on yarn and cloth, the partial control of coal, and the official transportation and sales of certain specific goods in the Northeast and Taiwan, although they each have their special role at present, they do not have much significance in the national economy. The real unified purchase and sales should start with export trade.

### US-Soviet Joint Commission Resumes Negotiations to Resolve the Korean Issue; Hodge and Shtykov Deliver Speeches, Urging the Early Establishment of a Korean Provisional Government

[Hapsong News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The US-Soviet Joint Commission officially opened at 2:02 PM on the 21st at the historic Deoksugung Palace. Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in Korea, presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, calling for US-Soviet cooperation and the early establishment of a Korean provisional government. Subsequently, Soviet Chief Representative Shtykov and US Chief Representative Major General Brown successively rose to deliver speeches. All three emphasized in unison that the establishment of a Korean provisional government was the initial task of the commission. In his speech, Shtykov commented on the "political enthusiasm" of the Korean people in welcoming the resumption of the Joint Commission, stating: "After the collapse of Japanese imperialism, North Korea was placed under the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army. Since then, the region has made significant progress in the development of democratic culture and the national economy. We firmly believe that based on the implementation of the Moscow Agreement, Korea will develop into an independent country along the democratic path and will be able to participate in the camp of peace-loving countries as an equal member. We are deeply aware of the responsibility of the Joint Commission. The Soviet delegation will do its utmost to promote the rapid and successful implementation of the Moscow Agreement." General Hodge's speech stated: "I personally, on behalf of the US government and the Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in Korea, pay tribute to the Soviet delegation. We are here to fulfill the promise of the great powers, which is to re-establish an autonomous and independent Korean government. This promise is encapsulated in the 1945 Moscow Agreement, which also stipulated the method of fulfilling the promise. The US and Soviet sides have agreed in their correspondence to have the Joint Commission fulfill the provisions of the Moscow Agreement based on the democratic principles of freedom of thought and freedom of speech. The US delegation, led by Major General Brown, has been instructed by the government to make the establishment of a Korean provisional government, composed entirely of Koreans, the first and most urgent task of the Joint Commission. The eyes of the world are focused on the Joint Commission, and the Korean people are also looking forward to the arrival of this government. The US and its commander-in-chief earnestly hope that the Joint Commission can carry out its work smoothly and rapidly in a spirit of mutual understanding. This kind of mutual understanding is generated by mutual understanding between great powers. The Joint Commission will fully meet the needs and desires of Korea." The list of US representatives attending the Joint Commission is as follows:

Chief Representative: Major General Brown (a famous general who commanded the landing on Attu Island in May 1943); Major General Weckling (US representative to the previous Joint Commission); Dr. Bens (economic advisor, former American businessman in Korea); Jonna (director of the Department of Commerce's consultant). The list of alternate representatives is as follows: Landon (US Consul General in Korea), Claydi (political advisor). The list of Soviet representatives has not yet been announced.

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] The US-Soviet Joint Commission officially resumed its meeting here today, lasting 45 minutes. Observers say that the atmosphere of this meeting was more harmonious than the last meeting in February of this year. Shtykov pointed out that the Korean people are eagerly awaiting the results of the meeting. Although the US representative requested that journalists be allowed to attend as observers, the Soviet side did not agree.

### The Soviet Attitude on the Korean Issue Seems to Have Become Slightly More Compromising

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 20th] The fate of Korea will be decided by the US-Soviet Joint Commission. It is expected that before the commission reaches an agreement on the unification and political democratization of Korea, it will go through a long period of negotiations. According to US observers, the main difficulty to be overcome by the US-Soviet Joint Commission is the definition of the advisory power to be granted to Korean political groups, as well as the organization of the Korean provisional government. The Soviet Union originally did not want to grant advisory power to political parties in the US-occupied zone, most of which represent the landlord class. The Soviet Union believes that they have a tendency to be politically omnipotent and have cooperated with Japan in the past. It was not until last month that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov wrote to US Secretary of State Marshal, expressing his agreement to grant advisory power to these political parties. The fact that both the US and the Soviet Union now want to quickly resolve the Korean issue is indeed a symbol of hope. The Korean people in both the US and Soviet occupied zones also demand the swift withdrawal of foreign troops. The economic situation in Korea is currently deteriorating, especially in the Soviet occupied zone. The US occupied zone lacks coal, while the Soviet occupied zone lacks grain. The people are deeply dissatisfied with the current political situation, resulting in political demonstrations in the US occupied zone. At the same time, refugees from the Soviet occupied zone are fleeing to the US occupied zone in an endless stream.

### US Senior Naval Admiral Visits the Capitals of Iran and Turkey; Believed to Be on an Important Mission

[Reuters, Ankara, 20th] Admiral Conolly, Commander of the US Mediterranean Fleet, who just completed important talks in Delhi, arrived here today and will meet with the Turkish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, and Chief of Staff. He was accompanied by 11 US naval officers. Conolly insisted that his mission was not related to the $100 million loan to Turkey. While in Tehran, Conolly met with the King of Iran and also met with Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh and Chief of Staff Amadi.

[Reuters, London, 20th] London diplomatic circles believe that US Mediterranean Fleet Commander Conolly's visit to Tehran and Ankara should only be a ceremonial visit. The official explanation from the US Navy is that Admiral Conolly's trip is to inspect the US fleet currently making goodwill visits to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean. The British government believes that it is not surprising for a senior naval admiral to visit the prime minister and minister of defense of a foreign country when visiting that country. However, political circles believe that Conolly's trip, which comes at a time when Congress has just approved aid to Greece and Turkey, may have the importance of formulating a local defense plan. Conolly's trip to Tehran has also raised the question of whether the US will provide Iran with a loan similar to the aid to Greece and Turkey. If so, Washington will clearly express its interest in the defense of Iran and the Persian Gulf.

### Indians Scramble to See US Warship; A Dispute Occurs

[Reuters, Bombay, 21st] When the visiting US cruiser "Toledo" was opened for viewing yesterday afternoon, the crowd was too large, and the police had to be called in to maintain order and prevent later arrivals from boarding the ship. This aroused the anger of some people, who shouted "Go back, Yankee!" The ship has been closed to the public today. The "Free Press Journal" titled its report on yesterday's incident "The Cruiser-Crazy Crowd Tasted the Marines" and stated, "Shining bayonets and rifles served as a response to the enthusiastic people of Bombay." US officials denied that US soldiers had fixed bayonets at the time. The "Toledo" is scheduled to sail to Japan tomorrow morning.

### British and American Fleets Arrive in Trieste

### Greece Accepts US Recommendations on Amnesty Issue

[Hapsong News Agency, Athens, 20th] The Greek government today announced that it accepted the US recommendation that Greece grant amnesty to guerrillas, and also invited one or more countries to Greece to observe whether it was implementing "fair treatment for anyone requesting leniency." The Greek government's decision represents a preliminary success of the new US policy toward Greece. Previously, the US made various recommendations to Greece to be implemented by Greece. Now, Greece has the opportunity to implement them first.

### Kurdish Tribes Attempt to Rebel; Tension in Northwestern Iran; Government Dispatches Large Army for Reinforcement

[Our Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: Northwestern Iran is currently extremely tense. The Kurdish tribes in the area are unwilling to disarm and have threatened to rebel soon. War is imminent. The number of government troops has increased sharply, and women and children have been evacuated. Observers say that the Kurdish unrest is clearly instigated by the Soviet Union, which has promised to provide them with ammunition. According to government newspapers, the Soviet Union is using various means of transportation to send a large number of Soviet personnel into northern Iran.

[United Press, Tehran, 21st] Iran today dispatched a large army to reinforce the garrisons in the four cities of Mako, Shapour, Khoy, and Rezaiyeh in the northwest. Officials said that the Kurdish people are strongly resentful of the government's order to disarm, and a rebellion is feared. It is reported that there are at least 20,000 Kurdish armed elements who are deploying defenses in the villages, evacuating women and children, leaving only armed men, riding horses back and forth.

### Wallace Discusses the Third Party Issue in San Francisco

[Hapsong News Agency, San Francisco, 20th] Wallace declared here today that unless the Democratic Party turns to liberalism, a third party will definitely emerge in the next election. Wallace, after arriving here on his nationwide speaking tour, said that no third party can exist without the unified support of the three major labor groups, namely the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Independent Labor Alliance. However, he hinted that the labor movement is increasingly alienated from the Democratic Party. He said that labor now supports the liberal movement, does not advocate class warfare, and its platform is "universal welfareism."

### Next Foreign Ministers Conference to Preserve Freedom of the Press

Marshall Responds to Bevin's Proposal

[Hapsong News Agency, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall today received reporters and firmly opposed the proposal of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to control the amount of information released to the press at future Four Power Foreign Ministers conferences. Marshall made it clear that he does not agree with Bevin's proposal to only release news at future foreign ministers meetings that all foreign ministers unanimously agree to disclose.

### Marshall Discusses Current Affairs: State Department Pays Attention to World Political and Economic Issues

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall announced the following at a press conference today: (1) Apart from the approximately $78 million in aid to Korea, there are no plans to continue foreign aid expenditures at this time. (2) Of the current $350 million in foreign relief funds, I advocate for immediate allocation to Italy to meet urgent needs. (3) I do not agree with London's claim that developments in the Mediterranean situation will cause Britain to cede military responsibility to the United States. (4) The War Department will soon apply for funding for occupied territories abroad, including $78 million to assist in the reconstruction of industry and transportation in Korea. Washington officials believe that the War Department's request for routine occupation expenses for the next year will include approximately $135 million for Korea. However, President Truman has not yet approved the aid plan for Korea. (5) The agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to resume negotiations in Seoul to unify the Korean government is encouraging, but the outcome is unpredictable. (6) Regarding the implementation of the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey, the current issue is personnel, so that the funds will not become merely a pipe dream. Mr. Marshall declined to explain the funding plan, but Republican Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, stated that the bill is still awaiting President Truman's signature, and its use must be explained before the committee votes to allocate the funds.

### Oleno Agrees to Attempt Forming an Italian Cabinet; Nitti's Cabinet Formation Declared a Failure

[This Newspaper Report] London, 21st Broadcast: Former Italian Prime Minister Nitti, after meeting with President Nicola to report his failure to form a cabinet, issued a statement saying that the hope for the formation of a new political power in Italy after his failure is no greater than when Gasperi resigned. Nitti had attempted to form a cabinet for five days, but failed because he could not reconcile the opinions of the various parties.

[Additional Report] Former Italian Prime Minister Oleno agreed today to try again to form a cabinet.

[United Press International, Rome, 21st] The 79-year-old Nitti told reporters after meeting with President Nicola today, "I have resigned my appointment to form a cabinet to the President, because I cannot obtain the coordination of the various parties. A detailed statement will be issued later." It is reported that Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party and two other small parties opposed Nitti's attempt to form a cabinet, fearing that the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party would exploit Nitti for their own purposes. The right-wing Socialist Party and the Republican Party also refused to participate. The Catholic Party initially verbally supported Nitti, but in reality, it was the most strongly opposed.

### U.S. House Passes Navy Budget Bill

Totaling Over $3.4 Billion

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] The U.S. House of Representatives today unanimously approved the House Appropriations Committee's proposed 10 percent reduction in Navy military spending and passed the Navy Department Appropriations Act for 1948, and then sent the bill to the Senate. The bill allocates $3,467,776,100 for Navy military spending for the twelve months from July 1st. On the House floor, there was an attempt to cancel the 10 percent reduction, but it ultimately failed. Democratic House Majority Leader McCormack subsequently expressed hope that a vote could be taken in the Senate on Navy military spending to provide a larger amount. Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber argued that the reduction in military spending would force the Navy to reduce personnel by 70,000 and the Marine Corps by 12,000.

### Rumors of U.S. Beginning to Consider Economic Aid to Japan

[United Press International, New York, 20th] Dow Jones Financial News Agency reported today that the State Department is considering a plan to financially aid Japan through private channels, but it cannot be finalized within two months. It is understood that the method will generally involve Japan borrowing from private U.S. banks. The State Department will not apply to Congress for approval of the aid plan, nor will the Export-Import Bank formally provide loans. A State Department official commented on the matter, saying that if Congress is willing to discuss this type of aid plan, then we will naturally apply to it. The possibility of a $1 billion loan to Japan is not currently being considered.

### Future Japanese Government Documents to Remove the Term "Imperial"

### Stars Seen in Daylight, Earth Without Light: Scientists Observe Solar Eclipse; Landlord Asks to Get Rid of Bad Neighbor

[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 20th] American and Brazilian scientists observing the total solar eclipse in Bucarein, Brazil, observed the evolution of the total solar eclipse in perfect conditions, while scientists from the Soviet Union, Sweden, Finland, and Canada observing in Araxa, Brazil, were only able to make two minutes of perfect observation during the four minutes of totality. The head of the American observation team stated that they achieved 93 percent success. The Soviet observation team was unwilling to announce the results of the observation. However, Canadian scientists observing in the same environment as the Soviet observation team said that they achieved most of the success. According to American scientists, this observation shows that Einstein's theory of relativity is 95 percent consistent with the facts. After detailed study upon their return home, they will thoroughly review Einstein's theory of relativity again. During the solar eclipse, even in the afternoon, the earth was shrouded in darkness, and only the stars twinkled in the sky, and the street lights were also turned on. Superstitious farmers knelt and prayed. The locals never believed the scientific explanation of the cause of the solar eclipse, believing that the Americans were here in connection with the atomic bomb test. A landlord wrote to the head of the American team, saying, "I know you are going to test the atomic bomb. You can use my land. I have a bad neighbor, and I hope the first atomic bomb can be dropped on his land." As the solar eclipse gradually receded, it was like dawn, and the roosters crowed in unison to announce the daybreak.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party on the 20th resolved that it absolutely could not agree to the Liberal Party's demand to exclude the left-wing, indicating a large divide between the Liberal and Socialist parties.

Intense Competition for the Speaker of the House

In the four-party representative meeting convened at 7:20 p.m. on the 20th, the Liberal and Democratic parties engaged in a fierce battle over the issue of the selection of the speaker. The Liberal Party immediately demanded the speakership, while the Democratic Party said that since the Liberal Party had become the opposition party, it could not be held by the Liberal Party, and firmly demanded that the speakership be held by the Democratic Party, which is the de facto second party. The Liberal Party believed that if the Democratic Party was not allowed to have it, it should be held by the Socialist Party, which is the first party. At this point, the Liberal and Democratic parties, which had friendly relations, had reached the point of rupture.

Matsudaira Elected Speaker of the House of Councillors

The House of Councillors reopened its plenary session at 9 p.m. on the 20th. Because the negotiations of the various factions were unsuccessful, the Ryokufu-kai nominated Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Socialist Party nominated Jiichiro Matsumoto, the Democratic Party nominated Tatsuo Sakurauchi, and the Shinsei Club nominated Hideo Kuroda as candidates for speaker, and immediately began voting. As a result, none of them received a majority of the votes. Another vote was held, and as a result, Matsudaira was elected Speaker with 129 votes, and Jiichiro Matsumoto was elected Deputy Speaker with 128 votes. The meeting then adjourned after speeches by Matsudaira and Matsumoto.

### British and American Investigation Representatives Confirm: South Aids Greek Guerrillas; Various Parties Collect Evidence Without Reaching a Unified Conclusion

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 21st] British and American representatives of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee have gathered a great deal of evidence regarding Yugoslavia's aid to Greek guerrillas. This is one part of the conclusions in the report to be submitted to the Security Council by the committee secretariat. British and American representatives have now confirmed the evidence of Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria's aid to the guerrillas, as alleged by the Greek government, which the three countries have failed to deny. Conversely, Soviet representatives believe that most of the statements made by Greek witnesses are fabrications and point out that Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria did not invade Greek territory. Given the differing opinions on the evidence listed by the Investigation Committee, it is unlikely that a collective conclusion will be reached.

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 20th] At a meeting of the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Mission today, the Yugoslav representative refuted the Greek condemnation of Yugoslavia's interference in the Greek war against the guerrillas, saying that the Greek war against the guerrillas was caused by the policies of the Greek government, which relied entirely on British aid to exist, and that British troops also participated in the war against the guerrillas.

### Greek External Representative Responds to Soviet Statement

[This Newspaper Report] London Broadcast: Greek External Representative Krou stated to the United Nations Investigation Committee: "The Greek Communist Party is currently working for the expansion goals of the Balkan bloc. Greece's neighboring countries are creating border incidents, using external forces, and conducting psychological warfare." Krou's remarks were in response to a statement by the Soviet Union. According to the Soviet authorities, Greece's neighboring countries did not create border incidents, but rather the incidents were created by Greek border personnel.

### Efficacy of Chinese Acupuncture Treatment Proven by American Medical Scientists

We tentatively propose the following theory: "The persistent pain after a sprain is due to the pressure generated by the accumulation of fluid inside the ligament structure. During acupuncture, this pressure is mechanically relieved, and the pain ceases."

### General Gillen's New Position

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Former U.S. Representative of the Peiping Military Mediation Department, Lieutenant General Gillen, will assume the position of Commander of the Third Army on June 15th, with headquarters located in Fort Benning, Georgia.

[United Press International, London, 20th] A British government spokesperson announced today that the partition of India appears inevitable. Governor-General Mountbatten met twice today with Prime Minister Attlee and three cabinet members and is said to have presented a plan for the partition of India.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The rumor that the British government is considering inviting the leaders of various new Indian political parties to London to attend a round table conference to replace the conference to be held in New Delhi soon has been denied by British officials.

### Large Quantity of Opium Seized in Air Transport Case: Hidden in Nineteen Fan Motors; Principal Offender Lu Hegao Arrested

[This Newspaper Report] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau cracked another major air transport drug trafficking case the day before yesterday, seizing two magnetic barrels of opium, weighing approximately several hundred taels. The principal offender, Lu Hegao, 35 years old, from Shanghai, was arrested at 4 Xingfu Lane, Chongqing South Road. At the same time, an accomplice, Chi Shunfu (42 years old, from Shanghai), was also apprehended at 60 Baoyu Lane, Zhengdong East Road. Due to the complexity of the case, the police bureau has requested the prosecutor's office to detain them for ten days for detailed investigation. According to confidential reports received recently by the head of the Criminal Investigation Division, Zheng Junhou, someone entrusted Central Aviation to air transport nineteen electric fan motors from Kunming, which arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month. The cores of these motors contained a large quantity of opium, which are currently stored at 60 Baoyu Lane, Zhengdong East Road, and are being sold successively. After Chief Zheng reported to his superiors, he dispatched section chief Chen Jinsheng, officers Li Xiqing, Ye Kui, Hua Zhiru, and others, disguised as customers, to the location at 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. However, they were refused by Chi Shunfu, a resident of the premises (currently a teahouse attendant at the Huizhong Hotel). Seeing his flustered expression, the police officers immediately conducted a search, and as a result, they found two magnetic barrels in the side room, with the seal of a certain organization affixed to the outside. After opening the magnetic barrels, they found that they contained raw opium. At this point, Chi was dumbfounded. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed that they were deposited by his friend Lu Hegao, who lived at 4 Xingfu Lane, Chongqing South Road. The police immediately went to the address and arrested the principal offender. Lu also confessed that after the motors arrived in Shanghai, they were transported to the Chifu Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Plant on Feihong Road, Hongzhen, where the cores were dismantled, the opium was taken out, and all the motors were sold to the factory. Based on the confession, the bureau completely hoisted the motors to the bureau yesterday for research, and learned that the case involves many people, who are currently being closely pursued.

### City Center Land Occupied: Former Municipal Government Colleagues Request Return

[This Newspaper Report] In the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], former colleagues of the municipal government, in order to realize the Greater Shanghai construction plan, legally contracted land in the city center area from the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. At that time, under government encouragement, they actively constructed and built, and the scale was quite large. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the Japanese army and designated as a military zone, and the Japanese Army 157th Convalescent Hospital was built, occupying a total of 452 mu of public and private land, and causing damage to 99 households.

After the victory, representatives such as Li Dachao requested the return of all certificates, but the site has now been converted into an Army Medical School. Although the victory has been nearly two years, it has not yet been returned. Recently, the landowners gathered to publicly elect Speaker Pan to present a petition to the Executive Yuan for approval for the return of the land, and proposed four measures: (1) Order the military and police schools currently located there to move and merge as soon as possible. (2) All the enemy-built bungalows and courtyards on the land in the area, except for those buildings on public land that must be retained, should be demolished and restored to their original state. (3) The value of all materials should be auctioned off and the proceeds deposited into the national treasury, and the situation of the buildings at the time of the victims should be compensated separately by the Compensation Committee. (4) The land should be returned to the original contracting parties. This petition has been submitted to the Yuan for approval. The municipal government is handling the matter under the leadership of Zhou Minggang. Those who are former municipal government colleagues and own land can send their most recent mailing address so that they can gather to discuss the matter together.

### Huang Yuqi Suspected of Being a Traitor: High Prosecutor's Office Initiates Public Prosecution

[This Newspaper Report] The case of Huang Yuqi, suspected of being a traitor, has been publicly prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. According to the indictment, Huang is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, 39 years old, and lives at 504 Wuding Road. In September of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], he partnered with others to open the Huizhong Silver Bank, and the business gradually developed. In May of the 28th year [1939], the capital was increased and reorganized into a limited company. After the 33rd year [1944], the capital was increased and reorganized into Huizhong Bank. Huang Yuqi, because he served as a manager before and after, and was slightly famous in the financial world, was able to successively serve as a supervisor of the pseudo-Shanghai Bankers Association, a commissioner of the pseudo-Shanghai Baobao Guidance Committee, and a supplementary director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce during the fall of Shanghai. Moreover, in the 32nd year [1943], he used his superior position in the enemy and puppet sides to obtain a license from the pseudo-educational palace to establish the Zhejiang Industrial Promotion Bank, serving as chairman of the board and engaging in deposit business, depositing part of the deposits in the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank as a reserve fund for its use, helping to disrupt finance. Until after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the KMT Bureau of Investigation and Statistics submitted the case to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and he confessed without hesitation, and there were letters of proof from the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Office, the Shanghai Commodity Industry Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc. Apart from the part of the defendant being sued for shooting Wang Zifen, which is Wang Donghai, it was found that it was not done by the defendant and should be exempted from investigation. The aforementioned behaviors constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Among them, one pistol has a Shanghai police license, but the remaining firearms and ammunition are unlicensed. I intended to apply for licenses after arriving in Shanghai and then sell them, but unexpectedly, I was discovered by the police upon arriving at Longhua Airport." Subsequently, the court inquired, "Are you a pilot for the Executive Yuan Air Transport Corps?" He replied, "I used to be a pilot for the Executive Yuan Air Transport Corps. I flew the section from Manila to Guangzhou, and someone else flew the section from Guangzhou to Shanghai. I was a passenger. I also worked as a pilot for China National Aviation Corporation before." The court informed him that the local prosecutor's office was prosecuting him under Article 186 of the Criminal Law for "transporting military firearms and ammunition without permission," and asked the defendant if he had any comments. Younger said, "I don't understand Chinese law." After deliberation, the court ordered that the case be pronounced on the 28th at 2:00 PM.

### 黃牛黨內幕 獨包全場球賽門票 資本雄厚神通廣大 黨魁就擒暴露秘密

[Inside Story of Ticket Scalpers: Solely Purchasing Tickets for All Stadium Games, Vast Capital and Powerful Connections, Leader Arrested Reveals Secrets]

Wang Zhaohuai, Director of the Railway Bureau Police Department, ordered his subordinates to investigate and arrest the ticket scalpers who have been harming the railway station recently. Ying Guoguang, a patrol officer of the Eighth Section of the Third Section of the Xihu Section of the department, discovered a suspicious young man at the first and second class ticket office at the North Station at 8:00 PM on the 20th of this month. Upon closer inspection, he knew that he was the leader of the ticket scalpers, Zhang Acai. At that time, for fear of alarming the snake, he did not reveal his identity and secretly monitored him. At 8:00 PM, he saw Zhang Acai take out a stack of tickets and tout them to passengers, selling them for 15,000 yuan each. Just as he was about to collect the money, Officer Ying saw that the evidence was true and stepped forward to arrest him. On the spot, he found five Wuxi second-class tickets and more than 830,000 yuan in cash. According to his confession, there are two sources of tickets. Ding instructed small ticket scalpers to purchase tickets at the station's business office and travel agencies, and after purchasing them, they were collected by him, with each ticket scalper receiving 1,000 yuan for each ticket. Then he distributed them for sale. He also said that recently, because the station's prevention was too strict, the risk was too great, and it was easy to be caught, so he had changed his position to various cinemas and football stadiums. At the beginning of this month, in the game between Seoul and Xingdong, the Football Association sold a total of 60,000 tickets. More than 15,000 of them were purchased by him directly and indirectly, and then resold. Each ticket scalper made more than 700,000 yuan that day. He also said that there are many times to make money, but there are also times to lose money. In the inter-city match between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the match between Hualian and Xilian, they purchased all 4,500 football tickets at that time, but only 2,500 tickets were sold, and the rest could not be sold, resulting in a loss of 10 million yuan. The criminal finally confessed that recently, due to the off-season for train tickets and football tickets, the interest is very thin, and the target has been shifted to cinemas. On average, each ticket scalper can get 2 million yuan for each film. The "Number One in the World" film is always full, so each ticket scalper actually earns more than 4 million yuan. Director Wang, seeing that the truth has been revealed, is scheduled to transfer him to the local prosecutor's office for legal action within days.

As a result, it was found that the truck used to transport the American cigarettes was No. 35483, which belonged to Shi Jinji Transportation Company on Yunnan Road. The original case handlers went to the company to investigate and learned that the truck was actually owned by Zhu Donggeng, who lived at 479 Weihawei Road, and the truck was registered with the company and rented out daily for business. The driver, Tong Wengrong, lived at No. 15 Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road. Police were dispatched there, but Tong had already fled. Later, his wife was seen going out, and disguised police officers followed her to the entrance of Mingde Lane, Dongweizhi Road, where she was seen talking to Miao Zubi.

Twenty-three boxes were recovered. Eight boxes were found at a certain number in Ziyou Lane, Guangdong Road, and nine boxes were recovered from Qiaojiazhai in Nanshi.

### City Chamber of Commerce Appeals to University Students in This City to Resume Classes, Pursue Studies, and Stabilize Society

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued an "Appeal to University Students of This City," saying: "To all university students in Shanghai: Recently, you gentlemen have been making demands to the government due to school reforms and living issues. This motivation is originally pure, and the government has already provided satisfactory solutions to the demands. It is now appropriate to promptly resume classes, restore normalcy, and demonstrate the resilience of our youth movement to be able to advance and withdraw. However, there are still a few malicious elements who are coercing and manipulating the situation, leading to large-scale strikes, petitions, and parades in places like Beijing and Shanghai. This is even turning a simple youth movement into an uncontrollable situation. The impact is not only that your studies are wasted and your precious time is squandered, but also that residents in the city are alarmed, and social order is disrupted. The National Government, in order to maintain social order, has already issued a clear decree promulgating temporary measures. The Chairman, amidst his busy schedule, has also issued a statement, clearly indicating the essential meaning of rectifying academic atmosphere and upholding law and discipline, with sincere and earnest words that are thought-provoking. You gentlemen are all outstanding youths and cadres for national reconstruction. You should restrain yourselves to follow the Chairman's clear instructions, protect the schools and resume classes, in order to avoid wasting time. You should no longer make excessive demands or take inappropriate actions that would affect the reputation of youth among social figures, causing pain to your loved ones and joy to your enemies. We sincerely hope that you will restrain your emotions, display rationality, and voluntarily stop any excessive actions, thereby stabilizing society through stabilizing schools, and promoting the future construction of the country through your own resumption of classes and pursuit of studies. The Chamber of Commerce, representing all merchants and residents of the city, extends our sincere condolences and earnest advice to you. We hope you will take it into consideration."

The original text is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, and all newspapers, legal organizations, and colleges and universities across the country: In recent weeks, labor strikes and student movements have successively arisen in Beijing and Shanghai. Recently, students from various schools have been engaging in actions that exceed normal boundaries under the name of collective petitions, disrupting traffic and obstructing public affairs.

Considering the future, how can we not be apprehensive! Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, with deep consideration and planning, recently issued a statement earnestly advising young people across the country to value reason and abide by the law. At the same time, the State Council meeting passed six temporary measures to maintain social order, which are indeed essential measures for the present situation. In addition to representing all citizens of Shanghai in wholeheartedly supporting these measures, we also hope that the lovable young people across the country will restrain their emotions, strongly advocate reason, recognize that democracy prioritizes abiding by the law, that strikes are a suicidal act, and that if there are requests, they can send representatives to make suggestions to the authorities through legal procedures. They must not disregard discipline and resort to marches and gatherings to coerce and threaten, causing noise and violence, plunging society into turmoil, and leaving the country with endless sorrow. The wise young people across the country, who bear the heavy responsibility of inheriting the national destiny, should be able to understand this intention. We hope they will resolutely and immediately stop strikes and petitioning, restore normalcy, work hard in their studies to secure peace, seek educational progress, and complete their tasks by abiding by the law. We hereby express our sincere concerns, hoping for your wise consideration."

### Demobilized Youth Army Students Oppose Suspension of Teaching and Classes

Yesterday Released a Letter to Students Nationwide

[Our Newspaper's Report] The demobilized youth army students of Shanghai's colleges and universities yesterday released a "Letter to Students Nationwide," stating: "We support increasing public funds and raising education funding through reasonable means, and oppose destructive behaviors such as the suspension of teaching and classes. Education is the foundation of a country, and education funding must be increased in order to cultivate talents and build the nation. Students should focus on studying at school. Strikes and parades sacrifice education, which is unfair to oneself, one's parents, and the country. Moreover, today's student movements are full of conspiracies and deceptions, and pure students are unknowingly being used as political tools. Regarding school issues, we should put forward specific opinions and demand that the government resolve them reasonably."

### Students Want to Attend Classes But Cannot

Jinan University Student Union Reported to Reporters Yesterday

[Central News Agency Report] The Jinan University Student Union, regarding the kidnapping of Wang Shihua and Yu Huanrong, the newly elected executive directors and directors of the union, by the organizers of the previous student union, held a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the Xinli Restaurant in Yokohama Bridge at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the incident and appeal to the press to uphold justice and protect the basic rights of personal freedom. According to reports, the reason for the kidnapping was related to the promotion of the "Eat All" movement. Our view on this movement is that we absolutely demand that the Ministry of Education increase the amount of public funds and the number of public-funded places (our union has already sent a telegram in response to Central University and the Ministry of Education), but we do not support "Eat All" because most of the students at our school are self-funded, and "Eat All" only benefits a small number of people. Currently, the school is completely shrouded in a climate of terror. Students want to attend classes but cannot, and the president has resigned, leaving the school administration in a state of anarchy. All of this is caused by the armed control of a small number of people. At a time when the democratic trend is rising, such a phenomenon that disregards legal principles is truly regrettable. We urge all those who advocate rationality to do their best to stop it.

### City Government to Send Police to Protect Datong School Property

[Our Newspaper's Report] Datong University students demanded reform of the school administration and began a strike on the 16th. The school has not yet formally come forward to seek a solution. Until yesterday, the situation became increasingly deadlocked. Principal Hu, considering the激ang情绪 of the students and feeling unable to resolve the situation, wrote to Mayor Wu yesterday requesting that police be sent to protect the school property. Mayor Wu immediately sent Ge Kexin, a counselor of the municipal government, to the school at 2:00 PM to investigate. After the person in charge of the student union explained in detail to Ge, they sent three representatives to visit Mayor Wu at the municipal government, where they were received. Mayor Wu stated that in order to protect the school property, the students should immediately vacate the classrooms, otherwise, police officers would be sent to the school to intervene.

### Student Brawl at Shanghai Law College

### Guangzhou Student Union Issues Letter to Students Nationwide

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] In view of the recent student movements in various places, where students have often exceeded the scope of national morality and national law, the City Student Union has issued a letter to students nationwide, stating that the actions of student movements in various places have exceeded the boundaries of education and youth and have fallen into political whirlpools. They are obviously being manipulated by communist elements, turning schools into arenas for political disputes and students into political tools. The letter also specifically pointed out that the Communist Party should be held responsible for the war as they used troops to invade and plunder. However, some students shift the blame for the war to the government and do not say a word about the Communist Party. If they say they are not being directed by others, who will believe them? The letter concludes by urging students nationwide to consider the country's difficulties and the importance of their own responsibilities, and not to act blindly.

### Hangzhou Normal School Not on Strike

Even the representatives of the normal school who previously came to the province for a joint petition have already left Hangzhou and returned to continue their classes because the petition was resolved.

### Zheng University Students Petitioned Yesterday, Clash with Military Police, Jiangxi Provincial Government Discusses Effective Measures to Deal with the Zheng University Student Movement

[Our Newspaper's Nanchang, 21st] On the morning of the 21st, thousands of students from Zhongzheng University entered the city to petition the provincial government, demanding that Provincial Chairman Wang Lingji distribute student public funds.

### The Fifth Expedition of the Expeditionary Basketball Team, Will Fight Encas Today at 7:00 PM at the City Stadium

The Expeditionary Basketball Team came to Shanghai, won four games and gained great fame. Tonight at 7:00 PM, they will play their fifth game, meeting with foreign soldiers for the first time. The opponent is the Western Youth League's strong team, Encas. Tickets are 5,000 upstairs and 8,000 downstairs. Please still ask the Siwei Boy Scouts to maintain order at the venue. The referees are Qu Honglu and Xuan He Gao. In addition, the Group B Basketball League has been rescheduled for today.

The Expeditionary Basketball Team's past four games have fully demonstrated its bravery and good fighting skills, and its characteristics of sufficient energy and strength. Captain Cai Yirui Zhang Liu Zhengjun has excellent performances in every game, and Tu Wenlong's shooting is accurate, which can be compared to the Qunsheng team. In addition, Wang Binghuan and newcomer Cheng Fei are relatively weak, but they are also up to standard, and after four games, they are very accustomed to the floor lighting. It is natural to expect a more skilled performance. Last year, when the team first came to Shanghai, they lost to Encas. After a year, their desire for revenge has never been relieved. This time they meet again, and the generals will definitely work together to defeat the foreign soldiers and avenge their previous shame. Encas and Giant are the two strongest teams in the Western Youth League, guided by Mutuals Kaijiemi Luofu, and have the potential to surpass the blue and surpass the basket. The Boleikai Luosiji brothers and Ao Chai Liao are all outstanding in ball skills and brave in battle. The team's style is to fight hard. This time, they will meet with the Expeditionary Army, and there will be a fierce battle. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:

[Expeditionary] Wu Jian (leader), Cai Zhongqiang (captain), Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gengsheng, Ji Dezang, Wang Binghuan, Chen Baoshu, Ma Xilin, Cheng Fei.

[Encas] Kaijiemi Luofu (coach), Ge Pengqi Gufu, E Kai Luosiji, V Kai Luosiji, Ma Han, Bolei, Ao Chai Liao, Fu Lan Ke.

### Table Tennis League: Siming Jia vs Qingdao

In the second Table Tennis League, there were ten matches the night before last. The Qingniao team, taking advantage of their victory over Dongchang, fought against the strong team Siming Jia. Qingniao once took the lead with a score of three to one, but unfortunately, they declined after reaching their peak and lost three consecutive cities, and were defeated by Siming Jia with a score of three to four. In this game, Siming Jia had to replace the strong player Pian Fushun, who was disqualified from the competition, with the retired veteran Gui Weimin to help out. Although Gui was exhausted and lost to Qingniao's good player Qian Yunqing, his skills were still outstanding. The other three new Red Star teams consecutively defeated the Nanxing and Lingyun teams, which shows the misfortune of their initial defeat to the music team.

### Yong Shas's Price Ceilings are Still Being Raised Due to Concentrated Gains by Large Investors

Yesterday on the Huagu market, Yong Sha's price ceilings were still being raised due to concentrated gains by large investors, and follow-up price increases will still be necessary. However, rumors of profit-taking were unfavorable to buyers, and although the market was brisk in the afternoon, it appeared uncertain. Small and medium-sized stocks and miscellaneous brands still lagged far behind due to profit-taking.

In the early morning, following the remaining momentum from previous closings, the market opened relatively high, and deferred Yong Sha even reached its price limit. After the opening, the impact of the limit became apparent. Those exceeding the limit rushed to close their positions, and in addition, overnight long positions were also sold, leading to sales of Nos. 22, 204, 219, and 31, and the price fell to 6,900 yuan. Nos. 218, 85, 89, 76, 154, and 108 took the opportunity to buy at low prices. Deferred Yong Sha was listed by No. 173 at a high price, reaching the price limit, and recovered to 7,200 yuan. Nos. 42, 31, 153, 129, 152, 68, 190, 36, 23, 224, 61, and 183 sold off, and No. 117, after entering the market, immediately exited, pushing deferred Yong Sha down to 6,850 yuan. Mei Ya also fell to its price limit, and Nos. 94, 99, 89, and 14 took the opportunity to buy at low prices, raising the price to 7,000 yuan. No. 152 continued to sell, and the price fell back to within 6,900 yuan.

Nos. 73, 83, 65, 219, and 218 were still in good spirits, and the Reuters report that the US had rejected a loan request caused the price to recover to above 7,100 yuan. Nos. 117, 57, and 223 were still selling off, slightly decreasing the price to within 7,000 yuan. Nos. 60, 77, 36, 106, 82, 225, 42, 143, 97, 89, and 190 became increasingly aggressive in buying, and finally, near noon, they pulled the deferred Yong Sha up to its price ceiling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha reached its price ceiling, and Mei Ya fell to its price limit, with some recovery, falling by half a percent. Xin He rose by half a percent, and Xin Guang, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing each fell by about half a percent. Xin Hua fell by one percent, and Yong Gong rose by less than half a percent. For deferred transactions, Yong Sha reached its price ceiling, and Mei Ya fell to its price limit, with some recovery, falling by a little more than half a percent. Xin He rose slightly, and Yong Gong rose by half a percent. Xin Guang remained the same, Jing Fu fell by half a percent. Qin Xing fell by one percent. Among the less actively traded stocks, Li An reached its price ceiling, with some recovery, still rising by half a percent. Da Tong, Zhong Si, and Jing Lun each fell by a little more than one percent, Xin Ya rose slightly, and the remaining stocks ranged from slightly decreasing to falling by half a percent.

Afternoon: Immediate delivery transactions were made, and it was heard that the over-the-counter market was already offering 100-200 yuan higher. Therefore, immediate delivery Yong Sha, after reaching its price ceiling, was again purchased by Nos. 60, 76, 180, 8, and 157, and the black market price was offered as high as over 7,400 yuan. Xin He was also advanced by Nos. 180, 4, and 311 to around 3,700 yuan. Yong Gong quickly fell back after reaching its price ceiling.

### Bai Geng Slightly Declining - Rice Market Trading Brisk - More Cooking Oil Arriving, Price Slightly Declining

[This newspaper's report] The rice market was affected by the storm last night, resulting in fewer arrivals. A total of 3,663 shi arrived at the South Market and 3,859 shi at the North Market. The market momentum carried over from the previous day's price increases and remained very firm, with brisk trading. The upper-grade Bai Geng was quoted at 330,000 yuan at the North Market the previous day and 318,000 yuan at the South Market. Yesterday, the South Market rose, while the North Market declined slightly, and the two markets leveled out at 325,000 yuan. Medium-grade Bai Geng was traded at 310,000 to 320,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 295,000 to 313,000 yuan. Upper-grade Bo Dao was traded at 315,000 to 325,000 yuan, medium-grade at 305,000 to 320,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 300,000 to 315,000 yuan.

Upper-grade Early Rice was traded at 300,000 to 318,000 yuan, medium-grade at 290,000 to 310,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 285,000 to 305,000 yuan.

Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that President Chiang had previously telegraphed orders to military units in various regions not to arbitrarily purchase military grain locally and that the Food Ministry should handle the matter in a unified manner. This measure would greatly help to suppress grain prices in the producing areas. Currently, the price of Sichuan Xian rice is only 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per shi. Even with the high cost of transporting goods due to the Yangtze River's rising water levels, profits can still be made after arriving in Shanghai. Rice can also be transported from Wuhu and Jiangxi, and with the addition of foreign rice as a supplement, it is hoped that the lean season can be navigated.

Also, news: Yesterday, flour fell by 1,000 yuan due to declines in the inland areas. Wheat bran sales were sluggish, with prices decreasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were quiet, with some arrivals from the Northeast, resulting in a flat and weak trend, initially firm but later flat, falling by 300 to 500 yuan.

For the oil market, arrivals continued from the Yangtze River and the Northeast, and factory supplies were uninterrupted, but trading was slow. Soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, refined oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and sesame oil each fell by 10,000 yuan.

Northeast soybeans were actively digested, maintaining a firm position, with upper-grade beans increasing slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Other Du Huang and Han Huang soybeans were generally flat. Mung bean digestion was sluggish, falling by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red beans were flat and steady, and red sorghum sales to distilleries remained strong, increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Sesame arrivals and sales were both slow, and the market was stable. Raw peanuts were flat, with no price changes. Corn from Qingdao and Tianjin was actively bought, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan, creating a volatile situation.

Also, news: Canadian flour arrived yesterday. The "Lan Ke" of the Jardine Matheson & Co., managed by Mr. Lanke, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver yesterday morning, carrying over 130,000 bags of flour and 500 pieces of sleepers.

### Bonds Slightly Increase

Yesterday, government bonds slightly increased again, but the process was still mediocre. Tong Bing opened at 14,000 yuan, rising from 13,600 yuan as Rooms 503 and 550 moved to close the transaction around 14,700 yuan. Rund De and Room 326 exited. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi increased by 1,000 yuan, Bing rose by 900 yuan, and Ding and Wu each increased by 800 yuan. About 5 million in transactions were made.

### Foreign Stocks See Only Ken Zhi Rise

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw Guangzhou and North brokerages sell, and some carried goods from the port back to sell, so despite securities brokerages buying, supply still exceeded demand. Yi Sha opened in the morning at 74,000 yuan, and lowered from 75,000 yuan to 71,000 yuan, before noon closing at 72,500 yuan. In the afternoon, from 74,000 yuan, it was forced down to closing near the 70,000 yuan level. Only Ken Zhi showed signs of stability. As a result, compared to the previous calculation, Ken Zhi rose half a percent, British Steel Union fell one percent, and the remaining stocks decreased about half a percent.

### Cigarette Supply Exceeds Demand

The cigarette market yesterday, starting at the opening, saw some sporadic new orders still flowing, and the market was holding firm. "Great Britain" brand cigarettes hovered around 7.55 million per crate, before pulling back to 7.5 million. Many transactions were opened and the noon closing was similar. Towards afternoon the market turned sluggish, and it was heard that Da Dong Nan company would assign 20 branches of Brandy cigarettes, stipulating the special grade be assigned 30,000 branches, at an assigned price of 3.24 million. Level A was 20,000 branches, at 2.16 million. There was also Yong Tai He assigning 10 branches of Qian Men cigarettes, with a notice posted stipulating level A was assigned 35 units at a price of 1.4875 million. Level B was assigned 23 units, at 977,500. That caused the industry’s money flow to tighten, and buyer entry interest waned and the market quickly retreated. The Great Britain brand in the middle once briefly broke into the 7 million benchmark, falling to a low of 6.8 million, and the Old Knife saw a low of 6.5 million, until the end when the price of the Great Britain brand was 7.29 million, and the Old Knife was 6.63 million. Other Chinese brand cigarettes also fell considerably, but there were takers for Ting Tou and Jia Li Ke and 3-5 brands, and the prices remained steady.

### Second-Quarter Foreign Cotton Allotment Completed Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The foreign cotton allotment committee held a meeting at the Limited Amount Allotment location at 5PM yesterday, with main director Li Gan, committee member Rong Yixin, and Guo Dihuo and Liu Wenteng attending. They discussed until 6 o’clock before adjourning. At that time, the limited amount of foreign cotton for the second quarter, at US$20 million, adding up to about 100,000 foreign cotton bales, was completely allotted. The allotted method was based on each yarn factory’s spindle count as the standard.

Also, it is learned: Regarding the first quarter foreign cotton amount of US$40 million, adding up to about 230,000 foreign cotton bales, one third has already arrived at the port, one third is on the way, and one third is awaiting shipment. It is estimated that by the end of June, all can be transported to China. Currently each factory’s average cotton reserves is three months, so after the first quarter foreign cotton quota arrives, the reserves can sustain until the end of October. If the second quarter quota foreign cotton can be shipped before the end of October, then the year’s cotton supply volume will be sufficient. National cotton can roughly be sold in September or October, but due to transport issues, the earliest it can be shipped for sale will be next year.

### New Minister of Economic Affairs To Come to Shanghai - Negotiate Solutions to Current Difficulties for Textile Construction

[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction’s vice general manager Wu Weijing was recently called to Beijing by the former and current Ministers of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Chen Qitian, and Mr. Wu made requests regarding Textile Construction’s current and future business policies and their development. Mr. Wu returned to Shanghai that evening, and told our reporter: He proposed several points: (1) Textile Construction Company is a vast business structure, so it is hoped that all affairs will not be overly formalized, so as to avoid affecting the company’s production and business development. (2) Business policies must be defined. The government’s control of yarn prices must be done consistently, to avoid the company’s sales prices differing too greatly from the market price, which will make the company’s business management become increasingly difficult. (3) Company colleagues with proficient skills and ample experience should be given better compensation to encourage them. Mr. Chen expressed: The Qingnian party is participating in the national government to serve the country. Textile Construction is a specialized and technical business structure, which differs from ordinary political structures. He sincerely hopes that the company’s existing colleagues, under the direction of Manager Dong, continue to work hard. He definitely does not hope for any changes. Mr. Chen is scheduled to take office this Saturday as Minister of Economic Affairs, and come to Shanghai to discuss with Mr. Dong solutions for various difficulties currently facing the company.

Also, news: Six representatives from the company’s branch technical personnel have gone to Beijing yesterday, and plan to present several opinions to the company’s chairman Wang Yunwu for his consideration, with the following main points: (1) Company profits should be used to develop cotton spinning and related businesses. (2) The company should be changed into an ordinary commercial structure. (3) Adjust colleagues’ compensation.

### Gunny Sack Amount Allotment Issues - Shipping and Transport Association Calls Related Industries to Discuss

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shipping and Transport Committee’s limited amount allotment office yesterday morning called together the cement, alkali manufacturing, refined salt, flour, and Central Trust Bureau industries to discuss gunny sack amount allotment issues. Each industry discussed the need for gunny sacks in great detail. A final decision: the Association should task each industry with sending definite numbers for the need of the second quarter for review by the end of the month, and then reconvene the related industries for a meeting, to determine the percentage amount that each industry should receive. After each industry’s percentage amount is formally decided, the department will allocate the limited amount to each industry’s public association, and the report on allocation based on national practical volume will be reviewed.

Also, news: The National Cement Industry Trade Association yesterday afternoon held a meeting of the standing directors, personally presided over by the chairman of the association Yan Huiqing. During the meeting, in addition to reporting the association’s representative, the meeting also touched on the process of going to Beijing to handle the demolition of Japanese cement factories, and requesting the import of gypsum, and discussing important proposals, such as national adoption of unified cement manufacturing standards, and establishing a joint test location, specializing in training test personnel for members. Finally, regarding gunny sack allocation, for thoroughness and close review, the Association further decided to create a sub-committee specializing in handling the gunny sack allocation matters for each factory.

### Fran Rong Sales Brisk

Lately, Fran Rong sales have been brisk. Street customer brokerages continue to have demand, plain light gray and medium gray, retail and bulk transactions are managed well. Every factory’s goods can all be sold between 110,000-120,000, to 150,000-160,000. American goods are sold at 140,000-150,000, British goods sell for between 180,000 and 270,000-280,000.

### Price Even with Previous Day - Rayon Market Steady - Factory Owners and Buyers Watching, Gradually Becoming Weary

Rayon market has entered a defined situation, yesterday continued to turn within 7 million, and in the end the price evened out with the previous day. No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang opened at 6.7 million, reaching 7 million in the morning before closing. The Sanma brand saw a transaction at 17 million. The final asking price for the afternoon was 6.7 million for those who wanted to buy, and 900,000 for those who wanted to sell, but the other brands had no ups and downs.

Factory owners are gradually becoming weary because the buyers are watching. Yesterday’s market ask price at each level was 300,000 to 500,000 lower than the previous day. E grade was doing at 19.8 million, and ordinary other grades were asking 19 million, but transactions were extremely few. The trend appears to still have some weakness.

The silk goods market was also fairly steady yesterday. A silk quilt cover made by Dacheng was asking 8.4 million, and a counter-offer of 8.3 million was not transacted. Checkered Bi Chou was asking 2,300 at the opening, doing at 600 before turning back to the last ask price of 2,000. Every other day the opening ask price was 2,300. The production of Chongdian power spun fabrics was low, and raw fabrics were being reported at 230,000. Therefore, the Shanghai market opened doing 260,000-270,000, but other goods saw no great changes.

### Supply Is More Than Demand - Market Is Still Uninspired

Yesterday, the yarn market saw tight money flow and at the open, because of the Textile Construction company distributing yarn, sales were lively, but the customer brokerages’ purchasing was turning flat. In addition, cloth prices decreased, so the asking price for 20-count yarn fell sharply, with Shuang Ma doing at 6.6 million, a smaller reduction of 200,000. 42-count Lanfeng was at 11.9 million, 450,000 lower than last month. But 32-count and 16-count yarn, were being purchased by towel, handkerchief, and sock factories, so the prices were firm.

Textile Construction company yesterday as usual distributed yarn, and each count had a tendency for coarse yarns to be weaker and thin yarns to be slightly fair. 824 pieces were sold, completely sold to factories, with 627 purchase orders.

### Cloth Market Sluggish

Yesterday’s cotton cloth saw the morning open with still brisk demand, and the opening ask price was once steady, but then it was heard that exports from North China were being limited, and that Textile Construction’s cloth supply from the previous day, Wu Fu fine cloth and Ruyi bleached cloth, even though numbered for allotment, were entirely completely allotted to dye factories, and there were ample blank cloth chips, and operators in the business were tightened by money flow, and the street purchasing was sluggish, and brokerages from Tianjin were expressing their inventory on the market, and the market collapsed. 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was from 302,000-303,000 to the final 293,000, declining 13,000 from the previous day. The other Wu Fu, Lan Ji, Cai Qiu, and other brands of fine cloth, also each declined from 8,000-9,000 to 14,000-15,000, and all day the trend for each cloth was hovering lower.

### Tea Merchants' Joint Meeting Applies for Loan: China Farmers Bank to First Allocate Raw Tea Loans

[Our Newspaper News] Regarding the improvement of this year's tea loan plan, tea merchants originally intended to suggest adopting a loan-for-processing method, with the government purchasing the produced tea at a fixed price. It is learned that the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Tea Corporation, among others, gathered yesterday morning to discuss this matter. They believe that this method is difficult to implement. The government finds it hard to stipulate a purchase price, and the estimated total purchase price would reach 200 billion yuan, a massive amount that is unlikely to be approved. However, the existing tea loan plan of the China Farmers Bank already has detailed regulations for loan methods, percentages, conditions, etc. Therefore, it was decided that tea merchants should first propose improvement suggestions to the existing loan plan, so that it can be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval. At around 5 PM yesterday, the Shanghai Tea Export Association, the China Tea Association, and the Southeast Tea Region Tea Factory Federation, among other organizations, convened a joint meeting. Representatives from various organizations attended, chaired by Shou Jingwei, and discussed until the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to recommend that the authorities first request the China Farmers Bank to allocate 20 billion yuan from this year's 80 billion yuan tea loan for raw tea loans. This sum would be handed over to the China Tea Corporation, together with the China Farmers Bank, and the tea export associations in Shanghai, Hankou, and Fuzhou, as well as tea trade associations in various regions, to be lent separately according to the qualifications and production capacity of each tea factory. It is reported that this suggestion will be submitted by the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval.

### National Bank Hopes Tea Merchants Will Redeem Boxed Tea Used as Loan Collateral

It is reported that the National Bank had stipulated that tea merchants who requested government-backed loans last year using boxed tea as collateral should redeem the goods with funds in the future and sell them themselves to promote exports. The National Bank still hopes that tea merchants will redeem and sell the tea to boost the export business. If the tea merchants are still unable to fulfill the agreement, the government will sell it on their behalf and then settle the outstanding debts with the tea merchants.

### Difficulties in Carpet Exports to the US

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] Importers dealing with Chinese carpets told reporters that they have not imported Chinese carpets since the end of the war. Competition in the US market is more intense than before, the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender fluctuates, and US customs duties are also higher than before. Unless these issues are improved, importers will not resume trading in Chinese carpets.

### Deng Xihou Speaks Freely About Sichuan Politics

— Chengdu, 14th (Air Dispatch) Our Newspaper Correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan

Since Chairman Zhang Yuejun of Sichuan Province requested leave of absence last year, personnel changes have been brewing, with many twists and turns. It was not until the government reorganization this time, with Chairman Zhang becoming the head of the Executive Yuan and Deng Xihou, who was acting as the provincial chairman, being summoned to Beijing, that the reorganization of the Sichuan situation became clear. Therefore, Chairman Deng's visit to Nanjing to report on his duties this time is of great importance to the future politics and construction of Sichuan. Chairman Deng's visit to Beijing has attracted increasing attention from those concerned about the Sichuan situation.

Reporting Duties in Nanjing

Extremely Fruitful Results

Chairman Deng was summoned to Beijing on the 29th of last month, stayed in Beijing for ten days, and returned to Chengdu by special plane on the 12th. On the afternoon of that day, despite the fatigue of the journey, he met with reporters and spoke freely about the process of reporting his duties in Beijing and the grand plan for the future construction of Sichuan, and answered various questions raised by the reporters.

First, Mr. Deng spoke in a very pleasant tone about his motivation for going to Beijing, which was to report to the central government on the military and political measures taken in Sichuan and Xikang in the past few months, as he had been acting chairman for eight months, and to request instructions on future construction plans. During his ten-day stay in Beijing, he met Chairman Chiang three times and Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, ministers of ministries and commissions, and central responsible officials many times. He discussed and consulted on the future direction of Sichuan's political measures and the promotion of economic construction, which was extremely fruitful. Concrete decisions were made on issues such as Sichuan's economic construction, political advancement, and ensuring social order in the future.

Principles for Building Sichuan

Chairman Announces Three Points

Chairman Chiang is most concerned about the construction of the new Sichuan and repeatedly encouraged Mr. Deng to make Sichuan a model province for the whole country and to play a leading role in construction. The Chairman also instructed three principles for building Sichuan: (1) Transforming the atmosphere, (2) Strengthening social order, (3) Actively promoting construction. Mr. Deng said, "The Chairman summoned me (Deng referred to himself) several times and urged me to work diligently and to encourage each other with a willingness to work hard without complaint." "Especially in transforming the atmosphere, such as strictly prohibiting opium and drugs and cracking down on undesirable organizations, there were clear instructions." At the same time, "Many central figures have traveled to Sichuan every year and regard Sichuan as their second hometown. They have high expectations for the construction of the new Sichuan and are happy to see it succeed." Mr. Deng believes that now is a golden opportunity for the construction of Sichuan, and the people of Sichuan should work together to build the province and live up to the Chairman's earnest expectations.

Five-Year Plan

Central Government Fully Assists

Regarding the "Sichuan Construction Five-Year Plan," Chairman Deng spoke in an excited tone about the results of consultations on asking the central government to assist in its completion: "Sichuan's construction involves many aspects, and the Five-Year Plan is a whole, so the completion of the Five-Year Plan is the unanimous expectation of the people of Sichuan." "The most important thing for construction is funding. This time I went to Beijing with the full Five-Year Plan and discussed the funding issue with the Ministry of Finance. It was decided that the source of funding would be: (1) A portion raised by Sichuan Province itself, (2) Central government subsidies, (3) Use of foreign capital. Regarding the construction funds for the first year, the central government decided to provide subsidies and decided to fully assist Sichuan Province so that the Five-Year Plan can be completed on schedule."

Two Major Constructions

Actively Starting Construction and Repair

The two major post-war constructions in Sichuan that are of national concern - the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiangyan Power Plant - have already started construction, but the specific funding has not yet been finalized. One of the main tasks of Mr. Deng's trip to Beijing this time was to solve the entire funding problem for the two major projects. Mr. Deng happily spoke about the consultation process: "The central government is very concerned about the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The project funding was originally set at half from the central government and half from the local government. After repeated consultations with Minister Yu Dawei, it was decided that the entire 25 billion yuan would be borne by the central government. According to Minister Yu, the central government has already included 39 billion yuan for the civil engineering of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in this year's budget." "Regarding the French loan, because the interest rate issue has not yet been resolved, French representative Bansha arrived in Beijing last week and will sign the agreement with Director He Beiheng of the Sichuan Construction Department within the week." Regarding the construction of the Dujiangyan Power Plant, Mr. Deng said: "The Canadian government has expressed its hope that the Sichuan Provincial Government will send someone to Canada to discuss the matter. The Provincial Government is considering asking Mr. Lu Zuofu to go to Canada. The central government has already allocated 700 million yuan to ship the generators, and it is decided to generate 25,000 kilowatts first. In short, under the central government's concern and assistance, these two major constructions will be actively started, and it is expected that they will be completed within the time limit without any problems."

Developing Industries

Strengthening Sichuan's Industry

Another aspect of Sichuan's economic construction, which is currently the most urgent and practical need, is "developing Sichuan's industry and strengthening its industry." This was also one of Chairman Deng's tasks in Beijing. Mr. Deng and Mr. Zhang Gongquan and Mr. Weng Wenhao studied this several times and believed that "the important economic constructions that are easy to achieve should focus on developing Sichuan's inherent industries. I negotiated with the central government in Beijing and decided to ask the government to support Sichuan in developing foreign trade and increasing the production of tung oil, cotton, bristles, sugar, and salt." Mr. Deng continued, "Regarding strengthening Sichuan's industry, I have requested that relief supplies and Japanese reparations factories be allocated to Sichuan. The central government has now agreed to transfer the Weiyuan Iron Plant, the Zizhong Steel Plant, and the state-owned factories in Beibei, Chongqing, to provincial management. The generator factory and sulfuric acid factory from Japanese reparations will be allocated to Sichuan Province to lay the foundation for Sichuan's industrialization." "In order to coordinate the development of industry and industry, the central government will also develop Sichuan's transportation. In addition to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Chengdu and Sichuan-Guizhou Railways will also be built at the same time."

Ensuring Security

No Worries About Sichuan and Xikang's Defense

Finally, Chairman Deng assured in a sincere tone: "The security of Sichuan and Xikang can be ensured, and the Sichuan and Xikang Pacification Headquarters will be temporarily retained to meet the needs of the times. In terms of strengthening local armed forces, we have requested the central government to subsidize weapons and ammunition to strengthen the strength of the garrison and security teams. At the same time, in the near future, it is impossible for the Communist Party to disturb Sichuan, and the remaining bandits and thieves lurking in Sichuan and Xikang will be completely eliminated in the short term." Regarding the Xikang issue, Mr. Deng replied: "The Chairman is very concerned about the recent situation in Xikang and has instructed me to tell Chairman Liu that he must work hard earnestly, especially in the prohibition of opium, which should be implemented earnestly."

From the confidence of this new chairman, coupled with the newly reorganized provincial government personnel, the reporter is looking forward to the bright prospects of Sichuan's political construction.

### From Xuzhou to Lincheng

— Lincheng, 9th (Fast News) Our Newspaper Reporter Ling Songshou

Rickshaws are Antique and Elegant

Xuzhou really doesn't have anything to love. Yellow sand fills the sky and the earth, the people are crude, and the language is unpleasant to hear... When you first arrive in Xuzhou, it won't give you too good of an impression. If you must say what is lovable about it, then the rickshaws are quite good - that's my opinion. The rickshaws are inlaid with brass patterns and lace, which makes them look antique and elegant.

Chicken and Duck Soup with an Egg

The first time I went to Xuzhou to steam rice, it was very hard, but it suited my taste. This time I ate a "Sha".

It's really strange, a bowl of chicken and duck soup with an egg, and it's called by such a strange name "Sha". I drank a bowl and ate four large buns, and I didn't feel hungry until 3 PM.

Noise Everywhere, No Light at Night

Xuzhou is now an important military town. The sound of airplanes in the sky and the sound of car horns and engines on the road come and go, and it's all noisy.

Perhaps the municipal authorities felt that the dust on the road was too much to bear. In recent days, many roads have been hurriedly paved with cobblestones, which is a good phenomenon. However, in my opinion, Xuzhou is still Xuzhou. Even if its status becomes more important in the future, it will be difficult to change it into something like Nanjing and Shanghai due to its inherent conditions. Not to mention anything else, the shoe-shining business is very quiet here. The small stalls on the road pat the chairs and ask me, "Shine your shoes?" I look at the gusts of yellow sand in front of me and shake my head.

At night, there are no streetlights on the road, and it's all dark. A dozen rickshaws are connected together and run in a long snake formation on the wide and quiet road, which is another kind of flavor. Please don't be surprised, this is just like the crude pottery stalls under the five-story Western-style buildings, and the many people who are picking lice on their bodies. It is indeed Xuzhou's shortcomings, but it is also Xuzhou's charm.

There are two trains from Xuzhou to Lincheng every day, up and down. According to the timetable, the first train heading upwards is a mixed train between Xuzhou and Tengxian, which departs at 7:30. The second train is a third-class train between Pukou and Lincheng, which departs from Xuzhou at 10:25. In order to take the third-class train, the reporter did not hesitate to wait for several hours in vain, and took the second train. Who knew that the second train was still all freight cars. With the permission of the conductor, the reporter sat down on a leather suitcase in the guard car.

Car Vibration Creates a Funny Scene

In the same car with me was a certain major general officer from the Lunan Military Management District, and his family, a total of five people, two adults and three children. Because the machinery was being inspected, the guard car vibrated violently every time it stopped and started again. As a result, either the older brother fell down, or the younger sister fell down, or the younger brother being held in his arms hit his mother's forehead. Every time the car started, a performance was given, sometimes accompanied by crying and laughter. The reporter watched coldly and felt that this scene was quite interesting.

After passing Liuquan Station, we arrived at Liguo Station. This is the junction area of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, and the only iron production area in Jiangsu Province. There are many factories to the west of the station, but they have now become a dead silence, and no smoke can be seen coming out of the chimneys. Continuing northward, each bunker on the side of the road stood a sentry, staring ahead in a bayonet-style posture. To the right of the railway are rolling green hills, looming in the misty distance, and to the left is the Grand Canal, with misty waters flowing endlessly to the south. Everything is tense, but also quiet. All that can be heard is the sound of the wheels. Approaching Lincheng, the train passed through Mengjiazhuang and Hanzhuang stations, with broken walls and ruins, which was a shocking sight. Especially Mengjiazhuang Station, which used two carriages as offices, which was truly laughable.

No Lard in the Hotel

Lincheng is the junction of the Jinpu Railway and the Linzao branch line. Its importance and prosperity in the past can be imagined. But today, after being besieged by the Communist army for eighteen months after the victory, the Linzao branch line was repaired and then suffered a second destruction. Although the Jinpu Railway main line has been connected to Tengxian, all that the two mixed trains bring every day are returning refugees, nothing else. Most of the houses in the town have been destroyed. The houses at the station are the three that survived the overturning of the nest. A water tower as high as several tens of feet can no longer be used... Destruction and poverty are seriously attacking it. The population of the whole town is about 15,300, and food is extremely scarce. Pork at 3,500 yuan per catty seems cheap to us, but I am afraid that no local people here will pay such a high price to buy it. I ate a meal in a small hotel. There was no lard. When I asked the boss, he said that the small amount of lard produced every day was reserved for the families of the troops.

My first goal in coming to Lincheng was to visit General Li Yutang, the commander of the Xuyan Pacification Zone, who was said to be stationed here. In addition, I also wanted to see what the situation was like because I heard that many refugees were gathered here.

Work Team's Main Relief Work

But I was disappointed. General Li has now moved to Tengxian, and the refugees have already returned to their hometowns one after another. The reporter went through the streets and alleys and found the location of the Lunan Office of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Lunan Branch. I handed in my card, and the one who came out to meet me was Gao Qingya, the head of the relief stock of the second work team in the area. After talking, I learned that the Lunan Office had moved to Xuzhou, and the team was staying here to continue carrying out relief work. The area of work for this team is the area on both sides of the railway from Tengxian to Yanzhou. They have held these two general accounts in Lincheng: The first time was at the end of last year, and a total of 4,124 bags of relief flour, 10,054 pieces of old clothing, and 3,561,000 yuan in relief funds were issued. The second time was between January and March of this year, and a total of 1,895 bags of relief flour were issued. At present, their main task is to handle emergency relief and work relief in the recovered areas. The ones that have already been issued are: 2,000 bags to Yixian County, 4,500 bags to Yanzhou, and 500 bags to Zou County. However, due to insufficient funds, it is not possible to directly send them to the counties and districts, and only the requesting agencies are asked to move them themselves. Furthermore, due to the inconvenience of transportation, the relief flour that Yanzhou should have received has not yet been moved. In terms of work relief, it is currently being implemented on the canal embankment from Jining to Jining. For every cubic foot of earth dug, 2.5 catties of flour can be obtained. At most, each person can dig ten cubic feet a day, and can get a reward of 25 catties of flour, which is not bad.

Small Game of World Peace

At the time when the refugees gathered, there were about 300 orphans received here, with the aim of implementing education and care. Now, because they have returned to their hometowns one after another, there are only more than 30 students left.

There is nothing else to record about my stay in Lincheng except for one very interesting thing. That is: groups of two or three children on the street use scissors, paper, and stones to play a game and write the four characters "World Peace". Each time they win, they add a stroke. Whoever finishes writing first is the winner. Before everyone stretches out their small fists to compare the outcome, they shout in their mouths: "World Peace". However, when can there be peace? I think: This should not only be the cry of children!

### Taiwan Province Excerpts

— Chiayi, 4th (Air Dispatch) Di Dong

The architecture and structure of houses in Taiwan are worth mentioning. Generally speaking, the construction of houses is mainly based on wood, but the structure and design are very exquisite and practical. Each residential building has a living room, study, and sanitary facilities. Most doors and windows use glass, which is convenient to open and close, and the air flow is particularly smooth. The area occupied by a building is always more than several acres, so there are spacious courtyards and open spaces. The streets and general shops are also commendable for being clean and wide, and there are evergreen trees planted on both sides of the road, with cars driving in the middle and people walking on both sides, and the order is well-maintained. When I first arrived in Taipei, I deeply admired Taipei's urban construction, which is not only advanced but also successful, because it has the flavor of a garden city and divides the commercial and residential areas so rigorously. When we look down on the entire city from the plane, it will naturally make you feel that there are both the grand scale of a city and the fun of a garden, with lovely green trees planted in every corner of the city.

Convenient Water and Electricity, Comfortable Housing

Although the first thing that most people who come from the mainland feel is the most unpleasant thing about living is the trouble of taking off shoes when entering the living room or bedroom, after some days of getting used to it, it doesn't feel like much. Now, the public and education personnel who have come here from the mainland have such low salaries that it is difficult for a family of several people to make ends meet. Rather than saying that everyone is willing to live this difficult life, it can be said that they feel that the climate here is pleasant, the water and electricity are convenient, and the housing is comfortable. Taking the house I live in as an example, it was originally second- or third-rate, but some time ago, friends actually joked and said: Your house is even better than the ones occupied by ministers during the war in Chongqing. Indeed, in the Japanese era, in order to encourage the Japanese to come to Taiwan and plunder our resources in Taiwan to provide them with capital for aggression, the Japanese government gave special preferential treatment to the personnel who came to Taiwan. The Japanese ruling era organized a huge construction organization, which was the main agency dedicated to solving the problem of stable housing for the Japanese after they came to Taiwan. All Japanese who came to Taiwan could borrow money from the construction organization according to the level of their position to build houses, and the required construction costs could be paid in installments. Because there was an agency that helped immigrants solve the housing problem, ordinary public officials at the recommendation level (naturally, those who were commissioned also had them) had relatively spacious and well-equipped dormitories. As for the heads of various departments, there were also official residences provided. After the restoration, the public and education personnel who came from our mainland took over their houses and indeed enjoyed a lot of the benefits.

Thrifty and Hardworking, Used to Eating Cold Rice

The compatriots who have been under long-term Japanese rule have not only changed their customs and habits, but have even completely learned the spirit of hard work and endurance of the Japanese nation. The thrifty and hardworking life of the Taiwanese people is something that will make us admire. Ordinary people, like people in the mainland, still eat three meals a day, but most of them only cook one meal in the morning, and no longer cook at noon and night. They have a habit of eating cold rice. Taking ordinary Taiwanese public and education personnel as an example, they prepare about one or two bowls of rice every morning before going to work, put it in a "white iron box" with very limited vegetables, called "Bento". After getting off work, they eat it like wolves in the office, without soup or water. Secondly, the clothes they wear are also very casual. Men like to wear suits, but they don't pay much attention to them. Most of them don't wear ties, and their shirts are not clean, and rarely ironed until they are shiny. As for women, they are used to wearing skirts and suits, and they don't look bad. If they are of good figure, they have a kind of healthy and beautiful appearance.

Various Types of Working Women

People who have not been here all think that the women in Taiwan are particularly enchanting and flirtatious. Some people even advised their wives who had already come here to hurry up and catch up, otherwise, it would be difficult to guarantee that their husbands would not be robbed by Taiwanese women. I have personally seen many wives who, based on this idea, took great risks and sailed light boats to come here. In fact, Taiwanese women are not as rumored. Young girls do have the habit and interest of working, so in the city, various types of women with different occupations have emerged, such as so-called groups of "waiters" in hotels, "maids" in hotels who serve guests, girls working as laborers in government agencies, and "maids" who cook and wash clothes in official residences, and they are all dressed fashionably and wear makeup. However, except for those in hotels and inns who can be teased and played with by guests due to the driving force of life, the "maids" and "laborers" can be said to be honest, hardworking, and earning meager wages to maintain the lives of several families. The general age of the above-mentioned working girls is between 25 and 17 or 18 years old, so people who come from the mainland at first are very surprised to see them, and their attitude and behavior seem so innocent, no, it should be said that they are frivolous and graceful, and even allow guests to tease them very casually and naturally. This is all a legacy of the Japanese era. It is said that unmarried women are indeed more casual, but when they choose an object, or even after they get married, they are unusually strict and disciplined. At present, the girls who work as laborers in government agencies are really careful and serious when they do things. Therefore, after the restoration, whether it is the central or local agencies, most of them still follow the old habits of using female workers.

A Proposal for Resolving the Rice Shortage in the City

Recently, a rice shortage has occurred in the city, causing extreme social unrest. Many citizens advocate that the government should promptly suppress rice prices. I believe that merely suppressing rice prices will not only fail to alleviate the rice shortage but will also cut off rice sources, leading to a more serious situation.

Currently, the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs is working hard on rice rationing. However, whether rationing can be fair and universal, and whether the working masses will suffer losses in terms of time and energy, are all questionable. Therefore, I believe that rationing can only play a passive role and is not a good solution to the rice shortage.

Shanghai is not a rice-producing area but is located on the edge of rice-producing areas. Therefore, the only solution to the rice shortage is to facilitate the flow of rice. The government should encourage rice merchants to go to Wuxi and other rice-producing areas to purchase rice. The government should provide assistance within its power in terms of financial accommodation and transportation convenience, while limiting their due profits and preventing rice merchants from reaping excessive profits. At the same time, attention should be paid to the quantity of rice entering and exiting the city to prevent hoarding.

What should be especially noted is that large-scale purchases by Shanghai rice merchants in rice-producing areas can also stimulate local rice prices. Therefore, the government should do its best to purchase imported rice to supplement the supply. As the season of food scarcity approaches, it is hoped that the government will quickly take effective measures to eliminate hidden worries. (Wu Xinbao)

At the same time, letters from readers Chen Liguan and Huaibao, among others, called for the same thing and will no longer be published.

A Call for Living Expenses for Public Education Personnel

Editor: I am a poor civil servant. To say that the salary level is too low is not very low. The base salary is 140 yuan, and the salary including the current in-kind distribution difference amounts to 400,000. Before March, it was barely possible to maintain a family of three with a meager income, but with the current prices, there is a huge difference. It is difficult to maintain even a bowl of porridge and a meal. This is not a plea to the government for poverty relief but a request for the government to add some subsidies. I think a civil servant has to go to work at 8:30 a.m. every day and does not leave until 5:00 p.m. Being late or leaving early will be punished. If things are done wrong, they will be subject to disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances. This is the government's rectification of officialdom, of course, it should be so, and civil servants should also be diligent in their duties for the government. Then the government should also take responsibility for the lives of civil servants and provide reasonable maintenance so that it can revive the spirit of civil servants in handling affairs. The current prices have risen so high, and the government has not yet had an effective way to suppress them, and the adjustment of treatment is still under discussion. Civil servants are already starving to the point of dying. I hope that the adjustment method will be formulated and implemented as soon as possible! (Hu Yan)

Another Letter: In recent days, prices have soared endlessly, and the lives of colleagues have become increasingly difficult and unsustainable. It has been found that Zhenjiang is located between Nanjing and Shanghai, and the prices of local products are higher than those in Nanjing, while the prices of foreign goods are higher than those in Shanghai. However, when the treatment was adjusted last year, Zhenjiang was listed as a second-class city, which is obviously unfair. Colleagues have always adhered to the principle of enduring poverty, and although they once raised objections, they did not pursue them further. Now the pressure of high prices is even greater, and the desire for adjustment is even more urgent. It is hoped that the facts will be taken into account and that it will be listed in the same rank as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. Otherwise, it will be difficult to settle down to work.

### Zuo Wenxiang in the Northwest

— Zhao Zongyu

By Qin Hancai, published by Commercial Press

There is a very important question that has been a pending case for thousands of years and has never been properly resolved. What is this question? It is the Northwest question. Theoretically, the Northwest is the birthplace of the Chinese nation, and the Northwest question was originally an internal problem of China, a very important internal problem. However, for thousands of years, everyone has regarded it as a border issue, and the way of dealing with it is generally no more than three kinds. The first is to solve it by force. When the country is rich and strong, it uses overwhelming force to suppress the Northwest. The pressure is effective, and at most it is appeased, but no thorough work is done. For example, Ban Chao of the Han Dynasty, who guarded the Western Regions, is an example. The second is a policy of appeasement, using the Confucian advocacy of "continuing the extinct lineage, raising the abandoned country, governing chaos and maintaining danger, paying tribute on time, being generous in giving and stingy in receiving," to maintain the dignity of the Celestial Dynasty. The third is to close the door and not ask questions, temporarily severing relations. In a word, all dynasties have regarded the Northwest as a border issue and never regarded it as an internal issue.

The former Qing Dynasty spent a lot of effort on the Northwest. Zuo Zongtang was the person in charge of this work. Mr. Qin Hancai has a research interest in the life history of Zuo Zongtang, collecting Zuo Zongtang's materials and conducting in-depth research, which has been going on for ten years. Using modern eyes, he has carefully sorted out, analyzed and synthesized, and recently published a part of the research results on Zuo's management of the Northwest, entitled "Zuo Wenxiang Gong in the Northwest," which is divided into twelve chapters. In addition to the military pacification of Shaanxi and Gansu and the recovery of Xinjiang, there are very detailed descriptions and evaluations of financial facilities, civil administration facilities, economic facilities, and educational facilities. In the chapter on financial facilities, it is further divided into eight sections: analysis of expenses for the Western Expedition, reorganization of land taxes, reorganization of salt affairs, reorganization of tea affairs, reorganization of likin, organizing donations, organizing foreign debts, and reorganization of the currency system; the chapter on civil administration facilities is further divided into eight sections such as rectifying officialdom, invigorating the political style, famine relief, and the policy of prohibiting opium and benefiting the people; the chapter on economic facilities is further divided into four sections such as opening canals and wells, revitalizing agriculture, animal husbandry, and sericulture, and establishing machine weaving and gold mining; the chapter on educational facilities is further divided into four sections: academies, charity schools, printing books, and examinations. The above chapters are all political work, which can be regarded as a rough scale at that time. This method can be regarded as correcting the previous prejudice of regarding the Northwest question as a border issue and formally regarding it as an internal issue of China. This is where Zuo Zongtang differed from Zhang Qian and Ban Chao. Mr. Qin's book can also be regarded as revealing the true face of Zuo Zongtang.

In Chinese history, Zuo should be re-evaluated, which is the greatest feature of Mr. Qin's work! And the last chapter, "A General Review of Zuo Gong's Management of the Northwest," is even more the result of Mr. Qin's research, listing the major issues such as the relationship between the rise and fall of national defense and military force and the governance of the Northwest, the reasons why political achievements cannot be great, the lack of talents in the successors, the Northwest of national defense, the people as the foundation of the country, the causes and consequences of exile, the essentials of enriching the population, and the suffering and need for improvement in transportation, the need for the central government's determination and the burden of the national treasury for the construction of the Northwest, the primary importance of large and long-distance transportation tools hindering the completion of the construction of the Northwest since ancient times, and the paramount importance of political integrity, etc., are all the main opinions for thoroughly solving the Northwest question in the future. Therefore, this book is not only a reconstruction of Zuo Zongtang's historical status but also the most valuable reference material for building the Northwest, and it is worth a solemn introduction to those who are enthusiastic about studying the Northwest question.

### Developmental Psychology

— Yang Tongfang

Author: Zuo Xueli

Publisher: Commercial Press (University Series)

Publication Date: June 1946

Books on developmental psychology, except for the translation of H. L. Hollingworth's "Mental Growth and Decline" (translated by Zhao Yan), are rare in the domestic publishing industry. Zuo Xueli's new book is the manuscript she compiled and wrote at the National Northwest Normal College. The author studied under Professor F. N. Freeman and adopted a lot of materials from Professor Freeman.

Anyone who studies education should not ignore the discipline of developmental psychology. Life from embryo to old age is a developmental process, so Western educators such as Comenius, Pestalozzi, and Rousseau all advocate that the educational viewpoint should be based on the natural development of children or on the laws of children's psychological development. The naturalistic educational philosophy of the eighteenth century even contained the concept of developmental psychology. In modern times, influenced by the development of evolution, child psychology, and comparative psychology, the study of developmental psychology has become a more general trend. In fact, it is not only those who study education who need this knowledge, but anyone who wants to obtain references for self-cultivation should also understand the content of the process of life development.

The first five chapters discuss generalities, and then describe by period

The publication of this book is indeed urgently needed today. Regardless of the collection and compilation of materials, the book is sufficient to enable the general public, especially those who study education, to obtain a clear basic concept and understand the entire process of life development. It is indeed as Professor Hu Yi said in the preface, "The segmented arguments are detailed and careful." I feel that although Hollingworth's book is detailed, it is still inevitably trivial, and it may not be entirely suitable for beginners who want to know the concept of developmental psychology, while Zuo Jun's "Developmental Psychology" is concise and appropriate, and most beneficial to beginners.

The whole book is divided into twelve chapters. The first five chapters generally discuss the general principles of development, and from the sixth chapter onwards, the development of each stage of life is described in turn. The main points of each chapter are described as follows:

Chapter 1, "Introduction," describes the scientific background of developmental psychology, the meaning and scope of developmental psychology, and provides a detailed description of the concept of development, as well as the various methods for studying developmental psychology.

Heredity and environment: which is more decisive?

Chapter 2, "Heredity Determinism and Its Criticism," the author gives a concise description of Galton's and Terman's studies of geniuses, K. Pearson's family similarity studies, E.L. Thorndike's, C. Werriman's, and N.D. Hirseh's twin similarity studies, and H.G. Muller's monozygotic twin studies, and then criticizes them.

Chapter 3, "Environmental Determinism and Its Criticism," the main basis of argument is Watson's school of behavior psychology. This school is an absolutely uncompromising environmental determinist. In addition, most of those who study environmental issues do not completely deny psychological heredity, but put forward evidence of the significant impact of the acquired environment on human achievement to disprove absolute heredity. The book cites the research of J-Mek Catteh, H. Gordon, S.M. Stoke, Freeman, and K.J. Holzinger. The author's criticism believes that the fact of heredity cannot be erased by theoretical denial. Heredity and environment really influence each other in the development of human psychology.

Several stages of life: the characteristics of psychological development

Chapter 4, "General Characteristics and Facts of Development," tells us that development is the result of the interaction and simultaneous action of the two factors of heredity and environment, and it includes a continuous process.

Chapter 5, "Germ Plasm and Fetal Period," explains the physiological basis of development and the factors and stages that determine the development of egg cells, and discusses the germ plasm problem based on Mendel's law of heredity. Finally, it also talks about two important principles of body structure and function, namely the law of development direction and the law of Cephalocandal development. Fetal reaction behavior and prenatal education are also discussed.

Please pay attention to children: the study of behavioral psychology

Chapter 7, "The First Three Years of Preschool Age," describes the development of intelligence after the age of three. Regarding the development of social attitudes and behaviors, it provides many valuable materials. The author introduces Bridges' publication on children's social behavior, which can be used as an important reference for improving the development of children's social behavior.

Chapter 8, "The Activity Period," is a very important stage from the age of six. When children enter this stage, the scope of activities becomes wider and their abilities increase. To guide or control their activities or behaviors, it is necessary to understand the motives of their behaviors first. This chapter broadly discusses the interests of children in this period and the development of social concepts and moral concepts.

Chapter 9, "Youth Period," makes a very detailed discussion of the developmental characteristics and significance of youth, the physical development, emotional development, and social relationship development of youth. The book indicates the main points of youth physical and mental hygiene, emotional cultivation, and sex education, which parents and teachers should pay attention to, and which youth should strive to practice.

Before the age of fifty: no decline in learning ability

Chapter 10, "Adult Period," describes the physical and mental development after the age of twenty. The author synthesizes the research of various families, and takes Thorndike's adult learning experiment as the main basis, emphasizing that there is no significant decline in learning ability before the age of fifty. The differences between the emotions and social behaviors of adults and those of previous periods are also described very clearly.

Finally, Chapter 11, "Old Age," is the period of decline in life. Not only is there physiological decline, but also intelligence and various abilities show decline. The difference between the emotions of this period and those of the past is that mental errors are most likely to cause mental illness. The book analyzes the causes of mental illness in the elderly and lists various different symptoms of mental illness. Finally, it points out that mental hygiene is particularly important for the elderly, and ensuring the happiness and social utility of the elderly is indeed a problem worth paying attention to.

Beneficial to self-cultivation: widely adopts the results of experiments

In summary, the advantages of this book are that it is concise and to the point, and it can extensively cite and collect the theories of various families without omission. It can also benefit life cultivation, integrating theory and practice in one furnace. It adopts new and old experimental research on the various problems discussed and makes objective criticisms, which is different from the views of one family. It also discusses the literature related to developmental psychology in other disciplines such as biology, anthropology, ethics, and criminology, so that researchers can obtain a whole and connected concept. Finally, the collection of materials in the two chapters on adults and the elderly is especially difficult, because this stage has always been less studied, and there is not much readily available information to adopt, but Zuo Jun has expressed many unique insights here. As for the rigorous organization and clear system of this book, it is rare in domestic psychological works. Also, because each stage of life development is continuous, the description in this book can take into account the connection between each stage (the chapter-by-chapter description is only for convenience), and it is consistent from beginning to end, which is another feature.

### Outline of Commercial Law

— Luo Gengsheng

Author: Huang Fangyan

Printer: Kaiming Bookstore

Distributor: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce

According to recent publications of various bookstores, there are very few books for businessmen to read. The reason is very simple, because businessmen are engaged in business and have no spare time to read books. In fact, this view is wrong! Many businessmen are very willing to absorb new knowledge in their spare time, and the reason why businessmen do not read books now is that these books do not suit their taste and needs. The purpose of businessmen reading books is different from that of ordinary young students. Students only care about their own interests, while businessmen require practicality!

What do businessmen need? This question is very simple. They hope to know how to trade and deal with people; and to know how the country protects their business, so that they can engage in business activities as much as possible under protection without danger. These are all issues of commercial law.

Since the opening of trade with various countries, business has become increasingly complex. In this era, if a businessman does not have a little common sense of commercial law, then he may not be able to cope with this complex environment and unexpected events, thus affecting his business prospects. In this way, commercial law and businessmen are closely related, and the study of commercial law is also needed by businessmen! However, China's commercial law imitates the Swiss system of civil and commercial law unity, and the provisions of commercial law are mostly incorporated into the civil law, so that it is difficult for businessmen to start even if they want to study it. Recently, there is a book called "Outline of Commercial Law" by Huang Fangyan, which summarizes the overview of commercial law without omission. It is worth reading for businessmen and those who are preparing to engage in business.

The whole book is divided into seven chapters. The main points of the book are extracted as follows:

(1) The Meaning of Commercial Law From the old-style commercial situation in China, it talks about the importance of commercial law now, and at the same time explains that customs, precedents, and legal provisions are the sources of commercial law.

(2) Contract Contract is the main topic of commercial law, so the material is very rich, and it is divided into ten sections: the types of contracts, the cause of the contract, the offer and acceptance, the expression of intent, the capacity for action, the contract should be legal, the intention should be consistent, the effect of the contract, the rescission of the contract, and the interpretation of the contract. In addition to explaining the conditions for the conclusion of the contract, it also provides a detailed explanation of the legal effect of the contract.

(3) Commercial Relationship It includes issues such as the types and powers of agents, the formation of partnerships and the responsibilities of partners, and the types of companies and the powers of shareholders.

(4) Contribution and Sale This is the most important mode of conduct in commerce, and it is also a kind of non-formal contract. A store, a company, cannot do without buying and selling. There are many problems in buying and selling. Businessmen who do not understand the law may have troubles and twists and turns at any time.

(5) Transportation of Goods The next step after buying and selling is transportation. The procedures for transportation, insurance, and the responsibilities of both parties can all be used as a memorandum for businessmen.

(6) Negotiable Instruments What is circulating in the commercial field now are negotiable instruments. There are three types of negotiable instruments: drafts, checks, and promissory notes. The meaning of various negotiable instruments, the way of circulation and transfer, and the responsibilities of the drawer and the handler are also essential knowledge for modern businessmen.

(7) Maritime Law Maritime transportation of goods, foreign trade, sailors, ships, ship collisions, rescue and salvage, and general average are also regulations that import and export and shipping merchants must be familiar with.

The characteristic of this book is that it emphasizes both theory and facts. Every theory must be attached to facts for reference. Originally, law is nothing more than theory, and theory is nothing more than human relations, and human relations are the crystallization of local customs and habits. These facts are not fabricated by the author, but are precedents from various countries, so that readers can not only get the training of legal theory, but also get practical experience because of the reference of facts.

### Review of "China and America"

— Zhao Shichuan

China and America, By Foster Rhea Dules, Princeton University Press, 1946, 277 pp.

There are several famous Western books on the history of China's foreign relations? Such as H-B-Morse's The International Relations of the Chinese Empire and Macnair's Far Eastern International Relation-ms, etc. However, as far as I know, there are simply no special books that specifically discuss the history of Sino-US relations. Judging from the close and complex relationship between China and the United States, this cannot but be regarded as a pity. The publication of Dules's "China and America" obviously makes up for this deficiency, because it is a narrative of the history of Sino-US relations. Therefore, we feel that this book is quite valuable.

This book starts with the first US ship coming to China for trade in 1784 and ends with the end of World War II, General Marshall's visit to China, and the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. The whole book focuses on official relations, and does not talk much about the trade between the two countries and the circulation of religion and culture. However, the advantage of this book lies in this: it is not specialized, it is interesting, it is concise, and it is suitable for general readers.

One point of this book worth mentioning is the author's goodwill towards China. The author avoids quoting and making criticisms unfavorable to China as much as possible. I am not saying that we are unwilling to accept unfavorable criticisms. I think that at least in terms of the author's intention, it is worthy of our gratitude.

The author has frankly admitted that the American people cannot escape responsibility for China's former semi-colonial status. But he believes that if the "United States abandoned various privileges based on the most-favored-nation clause at that time, it would not necessarily be beneficial to China. Such a sacrifice will sooner or later force the United States to withdraw from the Far East, and make China groan even more under the control of Western imperialism. (Page 68)"

But in any case, we cannot deny that the United States is China's most friendly country in the history of China's foreign relations. This point is particularly emphasized by the author in this book. In addition to quoting the remarks of Sino-US friendship from the official and civilian sides everywhere, he also proves it with facts. Here we may as well ask: Why is the United States particularly friendly to China? We feel that in addition to the fact that Americans are full of justice, commercial issues are the most important reason. The author once said that "the potential purchasing power of 400 million customers makes (the United States) being friendly to the Chinese people a very worthwhile thing. (Page 188)"

Although Dules's book is only an outline of the history of Sino-US relations, it is still a scholarly work. Therefore, the author omits the footnotes, which we think is very regrettable. In addition, although the bibliography is quite good, it ignores many important works. In particular, the great work of Dr. HB-Morse mentioned above was not included, which is a flaw.

### Martina

— Written by Shi Jimei

Byerner, translated by Lin Ke, Cultural Life Publishing House

If you don't like strong, rich wine, and only love drinking light green tea, then I want to recommend this small, pastoral book—"Martina," a quiet, sentimental drama in five scenes.

In that July, in the desolate midday of a summer village, on the main road to Tonggang Mountain, next to a small apple tree, the simple and beautiful farm girl Martina meets a young man named Ru Su. After some conversation, it turns out that this young soldier, just returned from Syria, is the grandson of Old Mrs. Maifang, Martina's neighbor across the street. They chat very congenially, no, not just congenially, Ru Su feels that he has already fallen in love with Tonggang Mountain, even though he is still lingering on the main road to Tonggang Mountain. The hour has passed noon, he pretends to be a sick and wounded soldier, and walks to Tonggang Mountain with Martina's arm, like a pair of lovers. Half a month later, Old Mrs. Maifang at home often talks to her grandson about marriage matters. The elderly value etiquette, but young Ru Lian doesn't care about this. He is willful and only remembers enjoying the moment. As for the poor Martina, although he is captivated by her, he regards her as nothing more than a roadside willow or a wall flower. But later, he gets engaged to Shanna, an old friend of his, a learned and well-matched twenty-year-old girl. Autumn comes, and the autumn of the heart also comes. The small apple tree by the roadside has already shed its green buds and leaves. Joy ends, love withers. In the dusk of October, heartbroken Martina sits by the roadside, immersed in reverie, the autumn colors in her blurred eyes, the hazy spring dreams of the past, the faithful Afulei proposes to her, but she is completely unmoved. She only thinks of Ru Lian, Ru Lian, who is engaged to Shanna. He is no longer in Tonggang Mountain. Does he still remember her? A few days of sweet talk are like fleeting clouds to him, but in this girl's simple heart, no one would have imagined how deep a mark it would leave. Poor Martina, Ru Lian and Shanna got married. Not only does she not get the person she loves, but she is often called upon to comfort her lover's wife, because when Ru Su is not in Tonggang Mountain, Shanna needs her company, because she feels that she can find her own husband in Martina, as if he had left a trace of himself in this girl, like leaving something on a book he loved or a puppy he played with; but when Ru Su returns, he feels that she is superfluous. Poor Martina. What is even more pitiful is that even this bit of warmth in suffering is not enjoyed, Ru Lian and Shanna leave Tonggang Village and move to another place. After Martina has shed enough tears of sorrow, she agrees to Old Mrs. Maifang's persuasion and marries Afulei. She understands that she not only has no good fortune to enjoy the happiness of love, but even the pain of love is not destined for her. A year later, it is the late evening of a bleak winter, the desolate and sorrowful twilight. Martina and Ru Lian meet again. At this time, she is already Afulei's wife and is also pregnant. Old Mrs. Maifang has passed away. Ru Yun returns to Tonggang to take care of the funeral and sell his grandmother's house. He wears filial piety and sees the woman he loved for a few days a year ago in that simple farmhouse. He is suddenly moved. The past pleasures... brilliance... youth... the laughter of wild joy... the true and false love... he remembers it all. He is moved and says many things to Martina, things that, in principle, need not be mentioned again, to relive old feelings, nothing else, this selfish person is just reliving old feelings. Martina cries. The tears that she has spent so much time and pain enduring for so long flow for him again. This selfish person says goodbye to her again, maybe a permanent goodbye, but maybe not. However, Martina's story is over, the story of Martina and Ru Lian is over...

What is not over is the quenched desire and prolonged suffering left to people, how much gloom and how much despair, and how much lingering...

What a plain story, you might say. But it gives people such an extraordinary feeling of intimacy and truth, you will experience it. Just like on a drizzling spring night, hearing the distant flute playing the desolate "Zhaojun's Lament" will not make you cry, or even shed tears, but it will give you a profound sense of desolation and lingering melancholy. It is not like fine wine that intoxicates people, but like green tea that gives people endless aftertaste. It is the fragrance of flowers, not the color of flowers. It is a lightly sketched Chinese landscape painting, with no amazing strokes from beginning to end, but every stroke is amazing.

Regarding the author John Jacques Bernard, according to the translator's preface to this book, we know that he is the eldest son of the comedian Tristan Bernard, born in the suburbs of Paris on July 30, 1888. He spent his childhood in Paris, and later entered the University of Paris. By the end of 1936, he had already published more than twenty plays and four or five novels, and was, together with H.R. Lenormand, a builder and representative writer of new French drama. "Martina" has a reputation as a "model play." It does not pursue bizarre formats, and resists conventions that bind the spirit. It only seeks originality in the usual format. As the translator says: "Bernard feels deeply, reveals little, and retains taste and chastity..."

### Worries

— Cao Juren

Random Notes on Life, Part Two

Blake has a line: "In every face I meet, marks of weakness, marks of woe." This line of poetry is a true portrayal of the people in our current situation. Regardless of new or old acquaintances, regardless of the poor or the wealthy, the old or the young, regardless of their living conditions, everyone carries the marks of worry. "Though the species of unhappiness may differ, yet you meet with it everywhere." (Bertrand Russell)

Every occasion is filled with quarrels, from tall buildings, tea shops, dance halls, theaters to crowded carriages, there is constant quarreling. It's truly a matter of holding grudges over trivial matters. Even a slight touch of clothing evokes fiery glares that seem to devour you. Those going to the theater, supposedly seeking pleasure, almost daily quarrel with the box office, and stare at each other. One must constantly be wary of unexpected guests rushing in, like facing a formidable enemy, and be careful that "when the city gate catches fire," one doesn't become collateral damage. Every tram stop is like a major event about to happen. When a car arrives, the flood of people, charging and climbing through windows, stepping on feet, knocking over children, always causes some kind of accident to spice up the dull, dirty car. From the moment we open our eyes until late at night, what we see, hear, and encounter are these kinds of things.

Accompanied by the noise of "distress" and "irritation," there is another side of human nature, a psychology of suspicion, forgetfulness, and jealousy. Every occasion is like a gathering to settle disputes, with knives hidden in sleeves, wanting to harm you, to get rid of you. In short, relationships between people disappear in struggle, and the whole society becomes like Luoma Lake, seeing who is "formidable."

In this way, there is "no such thing as faith," no "central idea"; your teacher is trampled under my feet, and my teacher is trod on his foot; even one's own teacher is only a temporary tool, and can be sold for the benefit of thirteen dollars. It is said that love is sacred, but the gold of this world has long faded, and romance is just a game. As the Roman historian Gibbon said, "History is little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind." Nothing else!

This is our real "worry," we are born into such worry. In the past, we thought that what kept us on tenterhooks was "internal and external troubles," but now we understand that we are really living in "heart troubles." As Samuel said, "Are we content to watch this world tear itself again into dog-like factions, the Epicurean and the Stoic?" Alas,

### The Army Man Who Draws Talismans and Incantations

— Ji Gan

A tall man in military uniform was accused of rape. However, he claimed that upon seeing that the woman appeared to have a nervous disorder, he took her to a hotel to treat her. This secret remedy of his, it is said, was learned from an old Taoist priest ten years ago: many talismans and incantations. The judge asked him to write out the talismans in court to see if they were "genuine." Unexpectedly, he actually drew a talisman and also wrote a few incantations, "He he yang yang, the sun rises in the east, your disciple respectfully invites the Taoist master..."

The woman in question is said to have become "infatuated" due to "unrequited love," which is already abnormal enough. And the man she encountered, besides confessing that his lower body was disabled and unable to perform the act, can also draw talismans and chant incantations. Seeing these strange things put together really makes one feel like, what age is this?

Not long ago, an old woman dressed as a man was called a transvestite because of her indecent behavior, fraud, and drug use suspicions. In fact, this is just a criminal (as can be seen from the court's conviction). The real monsters, however, are in other places.

Originally, the so-called monsters are nothing more than two explanations: strangeness and calamity. All strange things can be called monsters. However, the most important thing is whether there is magic. Only those with magic can be called monsters, otherwise they are just strange. People with strange tempers are called eccentrics, and strangely shaped stones are called grotesque rocks. None of these should be regarded as enchanting people or stones. As for a type of person who uses deceptive words to mislead the public, charms people with magic, claims to be able to predict the future, and chants incantations, making people feel as if deities have descended to earth, to the point of using all methods that violate common sense and science to "guide the lost," this type of person, although their clothes and daily life are the same as ordinary people, can also be called a monster. Furthermore, anyone who believes in this kind of magic is bound to be infected with monstrous energy, and anyone who seems to see monsters everywhere is bound to be wearing a pair of monstrous glasses. Because fundamentally speaking, there is no such thing as a real monster in this world. One kind of monster is pretending to be a god or a ghost, and the other kind is suspecting the existence of gods and ghosts.

Let's try to open our eyes and see, how many of these monsters are there? When will Mr. Science bring a hundred thousand elite troops to China and sweep away all this monstrous energy! Here, the writer hopes that the army man who draws talismans and chants incantations, as well as the people who watch him draw talismans and listen to him chant incantations, although he performs "as if it were a real thing" in court, it is not really "a serious matter."

### How to Teach Your Child

— Translated by Meng Lin

(3) The Transformation of the Moth

Like many young and mischievous children, I often ran to my mother for help whenever I encountered tricky difficulties, but my mother always let me solve them myself. I didn't understand what she meant by refusing me until one day I saw a moth wriggling in its cocoon, as if gasping for breath. I presumptuously cried out and began to take out the small knife in my pocket to cut open the cocoon, so that the moth could come out more easily. My mother turned around and watched me perform the surgery. When I discovered that the moth would not fly and was greatly disappointed, my mother got an idea.

"Child," she said, "the moth's struggle in the cocoon is purposeful—it gives it the strength to flap its wings and fly away from the ground, unlike its relatives who usually crawl on the ground. You didn't let it grow up, so now it can neither fly nor crawl. This is the same as children, a person as big as you, if someone solves his problems for him all the time, loses the opportunity to develop. If we use our own strength to solve every struggle in life, then this cultivates our strength to meet the next one!"

(4) Things That Cannot Be Taken Back

My younger sister, Xi Xiao Tongue, was used to spreading untruthful stories among her peers, thus causing many discords between our family and the neighbors. In fact, she didn't harbor any malicious intentions, and after being reprimanded by her family, she would say apologetically, "I'll try to take them all back."

Ordinary punishment was no longer effective, and my mother remembered a lesson that her grandmother had taught her. She instructed my sister to take a feather pillow core outside and cut it open. Then my mother said, "Now I want you to put all the feathers that have been poured out back inside."

"But that's impossible!" my sister said, "They've already flown everywhere."

"That's right!" my mother replied, "They are just like the rumors that you spread, once they are spread, you can no longer take them all back."

Now, when I am about to pass on unverified rumors or gossip to others, I immediately remember this lesson that my mother gave to my sister. (Translated from the April issue of Reader's Digest)

### War Criminal Okawa Shumei

— Bao Qing

Okawa Shumei, the director of the Manchurian Railway East Asia Economic Bureau, who was arrested as a war criminal for participating in the "September 18th" Incident, was also the former chairman of the "Shinbukai" of the Black Dragon Society, the Taisei Yokusankai, and Ashida Hitoshi. Recently, due to suffering from third-stage syphilis, combined with mental disorder, the Far East International Tribunal has decided to stop trying him and wait for him to die. This is the fourth person to be missing from the war criminals on trial. The previous three were Konoe (suicide), Matsuoka and Nagano (death in prison).

If we are not forgetful, we can recall the farce that Okawa performed when the International Tribunal began questioning Japanese war criminals in Tokyo on May 3 last year. He first unbuttoned his shirt, gladly stroked his chest and abdomen, and then suddenly reached out and hit Tojo, who was sitting in front of him. Okawa was immediately taken out of the courtroom and sent for a physical examination. It was said that his nerves were somewhat abnormal. Now we know that he not only has mental illness, but also has severe

Okawa is sixty years old, a graduate of the Department of Indian Philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, and a famous Doctor of Law. However, he is a believer in fascism. The followers of those secret fascist groups all admire him. He successively organized groups such as the Yuzonsha, the Kōchisha, and the All-Japan Patriotic Common People's Learning Council. He thoroughly advocated the "Radical Mainland Theory," so he had close ties with young military officers. In 1931, he even plotted with Hashimoto Kingoro to seize power, but it was abandoned due to opposition from the military. However, he then prepared with the Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki and others to launch an incident in Shenyang. After the "Shenyang Incident" broke out, he was busy organizing the "Shinbukai," based on the so-called "Shinmu Founding Spirit," with the aim of Greater East Asianism and reforming the Japanese government. It brought together young military officers, members of the Kōchisha, and the Taisei Yokusankai; and with the financial support of industrialist Ishihara Hiroichiro as backing, it had ties with the military. Its financial strength and power were the greatest among fascist groups. At that time, he was a thorough militarist thinker, vigorously advocating aggressive ideas, and his views became the creed of militarists. In 1933, during the Japanese "May 15 Incident," he was arrested for providing funds and weapons. After being released on bail the following year, the Shinbukai was dissolved in the following year. He was sentenced to four years in prison for the criminal part, and began serving his sentence after the establishment of the Konoe Cabinet. He was released on bail. Although he later had obvious direct involvement in aggressive actions and incidents, he spared no effort in planning, advocating, and assisting, so the Far East International Military Tribunal wanted to arrest and try him for his crimes, mainly because he participated in the conspiracy of the "September 18th" Incident.

It is said that his learning is like a crane among chickens among lawyers, with a rare Mongolian-type face in Japan, and aristocratic manners. From his figure, he looks very much like a diplomat. Unfortunately, he went astray into the fascist camp and became a terrible and hateful person.

Man B: Why?

Man A: I haven't finished telling her what I think of her, and she passed away.

### Fisherman's Song

— Ning Po

"The perch is fat, the jug of wine is hot, a small boat rests on the river; you say dukes and marquises are happy, but I, a fisherman, have a heart as clear as water, and money as pure as snow, how can I compare to those who extract fat and blood from the people."

It is not known who wrote this doggerel fisherman's song. Its meaning is to clearly state the chastity of the fisherman who relies on his own efforts and the greedy officials who specialize in sucking the people's cream. However, it may have forgotten that today's fishermen who rely on fishing for a living in lakes and seas are probably unable to find one out of ten who has the blessing of fat fish and hot wine!

### Invisible Garbage

— A Lin

Someone sarcastically said: Shanghai is a city that produces garbage. Perhaps under the current declining economic situation, garbage is truly the city's biggest product. Because other industries may stagnate or close down, while garbage is universally produced by four million citizens, with no wage issues and no unemployment phenomenon for three million people.

In the past, the French used to transport garbage to fill up the Yangjingbang, but today, because there is no more bang to fill, it can only be piled up in streets and alleys. Even if some of it is shipped by boat with great difficulty, it is said that it is also sunk in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. Therefore, the Huangpu Bureau is even busier.

These few days I heard that the authorities have decided to spend 400 million yuan to compete with the 4 million pounds of daily produce. This is certainly a great way to make Shanghai radiant again. It's just that visible garbage can still be removed, but invisible garbage is even more worthy of attention.

This invisible garbage is constantly piled up in the places that have the least garbage, but it is more relevant to environmental sanitation than visible garbage. It not only corrupts people's hearts, but also brings hunger to the door. If you don't feel anything, then please understand the four neon characters on the roof of the International Hotel. You can find that this invisible garbage has already submerged Shanghai like volcanic lava destroying ancient city-states.

Therefore, in order to save a livelihood, morality, and people's hearts from being submerged, it is necessary to remove invisible garbage at the same time as removing visible garbage.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Director Xiong, young and vigorous, suddenly raised his eyebrows and rushed to the driver's seat in one stride. He first snatched the weapon from the woman's hand, and then with a force, he threw a Zhou wife, as fat as a pig, straight from the car to the ground. Her pair of square-toed black leather shoes also seemed to have grown wings and flew up from their owner's feet, straight into the air.

"Bastard! See if you're still fierce, you shrew?" Director Xiong said proudly, raising his hands and sticking out his chest.

The woman rolled around on the ground readily, crying and cursing all the way, flattening a large patch of green grass like she was practicing "Drunken Eight Immortals."

"Director Hou, Mrs. Hou, please get in the car!" Company Commander Liu also seized this opportunity and rushed over to throw down all the fat woman's scattered luggage, and hurriedly greeted the middle-aged man to get in the car.

However, their movements were not fast enough. The fat woman on the ground had stopped rolling and suddenly jumped up and pounced like a madman; at this time, her face was covered with mud, plus tears and snot, making her look like a clay god enshrined in a rural temple. Director Xiong saw that her momentum was too fierce and did not have time to take care of his identity, so he rushed up to block her head-on.

"I'm going to fight you!" But the woman was not afraid of him at all, but took advantage of the situation to twist him firmly, and the two of them looked like they were practicing wrestling.

Young Director Xiong was really embarrassed this time, and he almost wanted to draw his gun, but he finally managed to restrain himself; after a minute or two, the mud on the fat woman's face and body had all been wiped onto his grass-green military uniform, and then his cap was also torn off. Seeing this scene, many people cheered like Zhang Chang.
