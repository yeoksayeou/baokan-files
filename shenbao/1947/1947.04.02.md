[Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] Bai Chongxi held a press conference at the Taipei Guest House at 5:00 PM on the 1st and issued a written statement stating: Regarding the post-Taiwan settlement measures, I have decided on the following measures and handed them over to the military and political authorities in Taiwan to implement. Namely: (1) Arrests of criminals must be carried out in accordance with legal procedures; (2) Trials must be fair and speedy; (3) In the event of special major cases, they must be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval before implementation; (4) Arrests of criminals should be handled uniformly by the Garrison Headquarters; (5) The crimes of the criminals sentenced to death should be announced and executed in public to achieve the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. All criminals arrested and detained during the incident, except for the main elements of the communist bandits, should be severely punished according to law. The remaining blind followers, if the circumstances are minor, should be allowed to be released on bail. During the period of cleaning up the countryside, arrests of criminals should also be limited to the main communist bandits and criminals who conceal weapons and ammunition and fail to hand them over. Furthermore, the central government, in order to cherish these youths and give them a chance to start anew so that they may become cadres for building the province and the country in the future, will leniently exempt the young students who were incited and blindly followed the communist bandits during the incident from any punishment. They only need to be lectured by their parents, led to school, and then allowed to return to school to resume classes. Communist bandits who are now fleeing and hiding in various places should also be treated leniently if they know how to repent, surrender their weapons, and surrender. As for the case of the investigators of the Monopoly Bureau who illegally injured and killed people during this incident, the local judicial authorities have been urged to expedite the judgment to show justice.

### Will Suggest Measures to the Central Government to Govern Taiwan

In his written statement, Bai stated: Regarding the measures to govern Taiwan in the future, I intend to suggest the following to the central government: In terms of politics: (1) Change the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office to a provincial government. In order to adapt to the environment, the number of members of the provincial government should be slightly increased compared with other provinces, and deputy positions should be added to the various departments and bureaus of the provincial government in order to give priority to selecting Taiwanese talents and cultivating senior political talents. (2) County magistrates and mayors should be allowed to be elected regularly. Before the preparations are completed, the principle should be to select local talents and people with financial resources and prestige to serve as officials. In terms of economy: (1) The heavy industry of Taiwan Province should be state-owned or jointly operated with the province in accordance with the central government's regulations, and the principle should be to raise funds from the majority of Taiwanese people to run it, and to avoid being monopolized or manipulated by a few capitalists inside and outside the province. (2) The public land of Taiwan Province should be leased out in accordance with the "Measures for Leasing Out Public Land in Taiwan Province." The public land should be distributed to Taiwanese people with the ability to cultivate it in order to enrich the people's livelihood and relieve unemployed Taiwanese compatriots. (3) The Monopoly System Currently, there are four types of monopoly goods: tobacco, alcohol, camphor, and matches. Camphor is operated by the province and is not widely distributed. The raw materials for matches are all imported from abroad, and the production value is not very large. After exchanging opinions with the competent authorities, it is planned to abolish the Monopoly Bureau and establish a Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau. (4) It is planned to abolish the Trade Bureau immediately and change it to an agency similar to the Materials Supply Bureau. The finished products of provincial industries are exported abroad, or the agency manages it. Private industries can also entrust it to handle it.

### Chairman Jiang Respects Teachers; Hosts Educational Workers in Nanjing

The accurate figures for each school must be sent to the Bureau of Education by the 1st so that preparations can be made.

### Reforming Education in Taiwan Province; Three Points Deserve Urgent Attention

In terms of education, the education that Taiwanese compatriots received during the more than 50 years of Japanese rule was mainly focused on learning Japanese language and literature. The current reform of education should first pay attention to the following items: (1) The central government should select outstanding teachers to jointly run education, and at the same time encourage Taiwanese students to study in the mainland to cultivate teachers and promote cultural exchange. (2) Social education: It has been found that the broadcasting industry in Taiwan Province is relatively developed. There are more than 100,000 radio receivers in Taiwan Province. In the future, the competent education authorities in Taiwan Province can make planned use of broadcasting to provide social education so that compatriots can learn and promote the Mandarin language competition, so that the language is consistent with the mainland to promote emotional unity. (3) Use electrical education. All films should pay attention to selecting those with national thought and patriotic spirit to stimulate the increase of compatriots' national concept and national consciousness, especially the education problem of the Gaoshan compatriots, which must be paid attention to.

Bai concluded that in the future, in addition to paying attention to the improvement of politics and economy in the guidelines for governing Taiwan, education is the most fundamental. He sincerely hopes that the public education personnel who come to Taiwan from the mainland should stick to their original intentions and serve with peace of mind, and hope that all compatriots will unite sincerely, work together with people from outside the province, and work hard to build Taiwan and build China.

According to well-informed sources, certain technical issues are currently being negotiated on-site between China and the Soviet Union. Once resolved, the Chinese government can proceed with the reception. Dalian Mayor Xue Sui is scheduled to go to Shenyang on the 4th and will then go to Pulandian. However, the issue of the Chinese Changchun Railway is unrelated to the Dalian issue and will be negotiated and resolved in Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] Transformers and other equipment in Dalian are being dismantled by a certain party. It is feared that when we receive it in the future, it will become a world of darkness again.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 1st] TASS today denied Chinese newspaper reports that Soviet authorities are not allowing Chinese administrative officials to enter Datong, and stated: The Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed to the Chinese government, most recently on March 7, to establish a Datong administrative organization, but has not yet received a response from the Chinese government.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] A person from Dalian said that the Soviet Union notified the government that the Datong to be received only covers a small area south of the tramway line, less than one-tenth of the former Kwantung Leased Territory. The Soviet army is currently transporting materials out of the city and destroying those that cannot be moved. The city is extremely short of materials. Although the Soviet army has repeatedly declared that it will import daily necessities from elsewhere, it is only "hearing the sound of the stairs." The general population still relies on smugglers for daily necessities. The Soviet army's coastal defenses are very sparse. Although checkpoints are densely deployed on the roads, merchants can still pass through with bribes of alcohol. It was also claimed that the equipment of the National troops in Dalian is not much different from that of the Soviet army.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st] The Hong Kong government's reply refusing to extradite smugglers and return soldiers of the Security Team has been received here today. The Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to lodge another strong protest.

### Mentougou Mine Should Be Nationalized; Representatives of the Company's Industry Union and Members Petition the Authorities, Requesting the Recovery of the Shares of Englishman McBain

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st] The Mentougou Sino-British Coal Mine was previously approved by the Executive Yuan to return the shares of Englishman McBain. Currently, Zheng Qinglu and Liu Dagang, representatives of the company's industry union members, have submitted a document to the highest authorities, requesting the reversal of this decision, and stating three reasons: (1) In 1942, Englishman McBain went to Shanghai and signed a "Donation Treaty" with the Japanese Shirama, actually losing his ownership and becoming enemy-puppet property. Moreover, this mine concerns national defense resources and should be nationalized. (2) After our country's victory in the Anti-Japanese War, all unequal treaties have been abolished. Coal mines should not be operated by foreigners. Moreover, Mentougou is one of the largest coal mines in North China and should be purchased at its value to avoid losing sovereignty. (3) Englishman McBain, who previously controlled the Sino-British Coal Mine, exploited the interests of the workers. When the Pacific War broke out, he actually signed a treaty with the enemy, constituting the crime of cooperating with the enemy.

### Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Can Be Mined for a Thousand Years

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] The Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province, which is as famous as the largest coal mines in the Northeast, such as Xingan (Liaobei Province), Fushun (Liaoning), Beipiao (Jehol), and Fuxin (Jehol), had an annual output of 600,000 tons during the enemy-puppet period, with a daily output of about 1,700 tons. According to geological surveys, the coal seam of this mine is very old. In the past, when excavating coal pits, fossils of elephant tusks were found. After electrical exploration, it was found that the coal seam was more than 3,000 feet deep. It is estimated that the coal reserves reach more than 700 million tons. At an annual output of 600,000 tons, the mine can be mined for a thousand years. The coal seam is close to the ground, so the mine can be mined by both open-pit (i.e., so-called open-pit) and pit methods, making it a very promising coal mine in the country. Heilongjiang Province has the richest coal reserves. In addition to Hegang, there are also Mishan Sanxing and Muleng mines. The coal produced by the Mishan mine is coking coal, which can be used for smelting ore.

Editorial

### The Soviet Union Should Cherish the Friendly Feelings of the Chinese People

British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall have both responded to the letter from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov of March 24. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated solemnly in his reply that the United Kingdom adheres to a policy of non-interference in China, and has no representatives stationed in North China, so it cannot provide any information. Although Marshall's reply has not been made public, according to the Moscow dispatch of the United Press, the content of the letter does not contain anything surprising, only recounting the efforts made by the United States in mediation in China, and the circumstances of the US military withdrawing from China. Therefore, no matter what statement the Soviet Union will issue, the international wave caused by Molotov's request for the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the China issue may have come to an end.

Molotov's suggestion at the opening of the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers to request the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the China issue not only aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, but also made people with a sense of justice in various countries feel injustice. This suggestion, which was close to humiliating China, could not be accepted by the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States. Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed a compromise solution, advocating that the China issue be discussed informally outside the meeting by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Marshall also insisted on his consistent position that the China issue could not be discussed without the participation of Chinese representatives. Molotov also knew that his suggestion was completely unreasonable, and had to change his tune, abandoning his original suggestion, and instead agreeing with Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall to informally discuss the China issue outside the meeting by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and also expressing his agreement to sending representatives from China to participate in the discussion. However, the Chinese government, considering that domestic affairs should not be interfered with by other countries, also solemnly declared to the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels on the 14th that China would never send representatives to participate in the discussion of the China issue, whether it was inside or outside the meeting. As a result, the secret agreement established by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to discuss the China issue was once again canceled by the solemn declaration of the Chinese government. Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall then replied to Molotov, unanimously expressing their opposition to discussing the China issue inside or outside the meeting. However, Marshall proposed a compromise solution, advocating that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union exchange information on China in writing with each other before April 1, and send a copy to China. Molotov felt that he could not achieve anything alone, and had to agree to Marshall's suggestion, and on the 24th sent letters to Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall, on the one hand expressing his agreement with Marshall's suggestion to exchange information on China in writing with each other before April 1, and send a copy to the Chinese government; but on the other hand, he still expressed that he was not completely satisfied with this kind of procedure, and still hoped to discuss the China issue. Foreign Secretary Bevin immediately issued a statement after receiving the two letters: the United Kingdom cannot provide any information. Marshall's reply has also been submitted, and the content is expected to be released within a few days. It is reported that the Soviet Union is not very satisfied with this, but in any case, the wave caused in the international arena by Molotov's request to discuss the China issue can finally be regarded as coming to an end.

Molotov's request for the four-nation foreign ministers' conference to discuss the China issue, no matter how it is interpreted, is ultimately a great insult to China, which damages China's dignity and honor. The roar of the Chinese people and their protests to the Soviet Union are a natural expression of the people's concern for the country. When we speak or write in anger, we inevitably become emotional and go to extremes; but now, calmly thinking back, we still feel a lot of emotions.

First, Molotov's action, in itself, certainly had a great effect. On the one hand, he wanted to strike at China's status to stimulate the Chinese people; and on the other hand, he also attempted to launch a preemptive diplomatic offensive against the United States as a condition for obtaining American concessions on the issue of other claims. But Molotov's diplomatic offensive proved to be a failure. Molotov not only overreached himself, but his "haughty beginning and humble end" really had the demeanor of a diplomat. We always feel that the Soviet diplomacy of wartime assistance repeatedly makes the same mistakes, giving the world a bad impression, and unanimously believing that the Soviet Union is a country that values rights and interests and neglects credibility. This realistic approach is enough to hinder cooperation between countries and the Soviet Union, because the international community, like human society, naturally wants to make friends with people who value credibility the most; conversely, if they do not pay attention to credibility, but only seek profit everywhere, then everyone will stay away from them and dare not get close to them. Most of those who end up isolated in society are people who do not value credibility. Therefore, we want to advise Molotov that if the Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country that wants to lead the countries of the world in creating peace, then the Soviet Union's restoration of its credibility in the international arena is an absolutely indispensable prerequisite.

Second, post-war Soviet diplomacy everywhere adopts a preemptive posture. In the Soviet Union, it considers itself to be in an active position, able to advance and retreat with ease, but this kind of diplomatic style is most likely to break the harmonious atmosphere in the international arena. Molotov threw bombs at the international arena, not hesitating to cause a huge wave, not starting from today; Molotov has repeatedly caused embarrassment to people in previous international conferences, not only this time treating China like this. Therefore, we believe that the post-war international situation is uneasy. Soviet diplomacy disregards the overall situation and often acts rashly, and cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Soviet newspapers often boast: the Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country, and its contribution to the creation of world peace is the greatest. We are certainly unwilling to spoil the Soviet people's mood and express dissent; but we hope that the Soviet Union can truly place international security and world peace as the most important things in the future.

Third, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall are in a posture. In the Soviet Union, it considers itself to be in an active position, selfishly thinking, which is really admirable. From beginning to end, they firmly maintained their consistent just position, and especially we Chinese people are endlessly grateful.

Fourth, we not only have no prejudices against the Soviet Union, but are very willing to be friends with the Soviet Union. Our country spared no expense to conclude the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union, which is an excellent proof. This time, the Chinese people protested and demonstrated against the Soviet Union, not as an anti-Soviet movement, but only to oppose Molotov's suggestion to insult China in the foreign ministers' conference. Now that this wave has become a thing of the past, and Molotov also knows that he has overreached himself and stepped back step by step, we can no longer be emotional and hold grudges forever. Therefore, we still hope that after a storm between China and the Soviet Union, they can become closer and more friendly. We have nothing to ask of the Soviet Union, but we hope that the Soviet Union can earnestly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty and hand over Dalian and Lushun to the Chinese government for takeover, which is a major test of whether the Soviet Union is fulfilling the Alliance Treaty.

In short, although we have not yet read the statement that the Soviet Union should issue on the China issue; but in any case, the Soviet Union must pay special attention to the friendly feelings of our 450 million people. And it is not difficult for the Soviet Union to cherish the friendly feelings of the Chinese people, as long as Molotov can accept the lessons of the past and immediately change his diplomatic style, a new page in Sino-Soviet relations can be opened before our eyes.

### Marshall Reiterates the US Position: Insists on German Economic Unification; Opposes Extracting Reparations from German Production

[Our News Agency] London, 1st: Broadcast from Moscow: The United States demands that the Soviet Union begin to make concessions on the German issue, otherwise it will indefinitely postpone the negotiations on peace with Germany. When the four foreign ministers initially decide to hold an informal meeting here today, Molotov will take this opportunity to reveal the Soviet Union's response.

[United Press, Moscow, 1st] It is believed here in the British and American sides that Marshall's speech will become a turning point in the conference, but the Soviet newspaper remains silent about it. Dulles, a Republican advisor to Marshall who has always been the target of Soviet newspaper attacks, voluntarily requested not to attend today's informal meeting. Observers generally believe that this matter is of great significance, as it is intended to avoid stimulating the Soviet Union as much as possible in order to win its possible concessions. Accompanying Marshall to today's informal meeting were Ambassador Smith and Mr. Cohen.

[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] At today's meeting of foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall reiterated the U.S. opposition to the division of Germany. He said that making Germany permanently divided is dangerous to European and world peace, and that a divided Germany means a divided Europe. The United States' insistence on German unification is precisely because it does not want Europe to be divided. Marshall also expressed regret at the Soviet Union's extraction of German industrial products as reparations, and its use of this as a condition for accepting the principle of economic unification. He said that the Potsdam Agreement did not stipulate such conditions, and the United States firmly opposes this condition. He felt that the Soviet Union seemed to have the intention of "selling a horse twice." Marshall continued, regarding import and export plans and financial agreements, the countries have already recognized their necessity in principle, but the four powers still need to agree on an agreement to implement political and economic unification, must agree to establish a central administrative body, a provisional German government, agree to the free movement of residents, goods, and ideas within Germany, abolish barriers between zones, and share the temporary budgetary differences of each zone. Marshall also stated that after the agreement is reached, it must be fully complied with, and the Potsdam Agreement can no longer be implemented only partially. Rather than having an agreement that cannot be implemented, it is better not to make an agreement at all. In short, the situation of implementing the Potsdam Agreement must never be repeated. Marshall then mentioned the conditions put forward by France regarding coal, saying that France is not a part of the Potsdam Agreement, so its demands cannot be regarded as conditions for negotiation. Marshall then outlined the position of the U.S. delegation, declaring support for the establishment of a balanced import and export plan based on the principle of enabling Germans to survive, raising the level of German industry, and making German factory production meet European needs. The United States' support for the principle of German economic unification is precisely to prevent Germany from being divided. A divided Germany will inevitably lead to a situation where each zone governs itself, eventually forming two strong parts, which, once merged, will become a militaristic Germany again.

French Foreign Minister Bidault then argued about the coal issue and the relationship between the future of the Saar region and German economic unification. He believed that the foreign ministers' conference could not determine the level of industry, the standard of reparations, and economic unification until it had decided on the amount of German coal exports and domestic consumption. The issue of whether the Saar region should be incorporated into the French economic sphere has not been decided, so the issue of German economic unification cannot be decided. Bidault also requested that the possibility of using German industrial products as reparations be reviewed again when discussing the level of German industry.

### Britain Announces Four Principles

[Agence France-Presse] Finally, Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward four principles on German economic unification, namely (1) freedom of movement of people, goods, and ideas; (2) balancing import and export trade so that export trade can offset import trade; (3) the four occupying countries jointly bear the burden of occupation; (4) establishing a German central administrative body and granting it executive power. Foreign Secretary Bevin said that the United Kingdom still opposes extracting reparations from Germany's current production, four-power joint management of the Ruhr region, and the cancellation of the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones. Britain supports the economic merger of the Saar region with France, but objects to any formal agreement on German coal exports to France. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a secret meeting tomorrow to continue discussing the issue of German economic unification and the issue of the level of industry.

### Committee of Experts Discusses German Secondary Issues

Differences of Opinion Among the Four Countries Remain

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] The Committee of Experts established by the Council of Foreign Ministers, responsible for studying all the crucial issues of the peace treaty with Germany, met today. Differences of opinion among the countries remain extreme, no different from the disagreement of the four countries on various important issues. The representatives of the four countries exchanged views thoroughly on the two issues of eliminating Nazis and German political democratization at the Committee of Experts meeting today. France insisted that the scope of German political parties and trade unions should be limited to the provinces, rather than national political parties and trade unions. The United States wants all parties to compete freely, with each party leader responsible for their own actions, and trade unions must also be financially independent. Regarding the electoral system, the Soviet Union insists on its demand to adopt a proportional representation system, but in any case, the Committee of Experts must complete its task on schedule by tomorrow.

### The British Government Publishes the Texts of Three Agreements

[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The Foreign Office has recently published a white paper, publishing the Tehran Agreement of December 1943, the Yalta Agreement of February 1945, and the Potsdam Agreement of July 1945.

### British-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Underway

British Foreign Trade Minister to Visit the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] After British and Soviet representatives began negotiations on treaty revision on the 27th of this month, they will meet again tomorrow. Sir Frank Roberts will represent the United Kingdom, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev and Director of the Foreign Affairs Department Golubensky will represent the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] British Foreign Trade Minister Wilson will soon travel to Moscow. According to recent reports, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will meet with Stalin to discuss trade issues between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.

### World Health Organization Begins Work in China

[Reuters, Geneva, 31st] The World Health Organization announced at the opening of its third meeting here today that its work in China will begin on April 1.

[Associated Press, Geneva, 31st] The Interim Commission of the International Health Organization today took over the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's health work in China.

### Prince Paul of Greece Inherits the Throne After King George II's Sudden Death

[Our Dispatch] London, 1st - A broadcast reports that King George II of Greece died suddenly today from a heart ailment at the age of 56. His brother, Prince Paul, will inherit the throne today at 7:30 PM (Athens time). George II was twice exiled and only recently reassumed the throne last year after a public referendum. At the time, the Greek Communist Party strongly attacked the referendum, deeming it unrepresentative of public opinion, but British and American representatives fully supported it. The King's death adds a new dimension to the still-under-discussion US aid to Greece.

[United Press, Athens, 1st] According to Greek left-wing leaders, the British and American governments both acknowledge the current Greek government's instability. Unless President Truman seizes this opportunity to urge reforms in the Greek government, George's death will not fundamentally change the overall situation. In Washington, Senator George, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the King's sudden death should not alter the US aid to Greece process. Assuming Greece can form a stable government, the King's death may, in some ways, assist the process.

### Anglo-Albanian Dispute to be Submitted to the Hague Tribunal

[Agence Nouvelle de Presse, Lake Success, 31st] A high-ranking British official revealed today that the British delegation to the Security Council has proposed submitting the Anglo-Albanian dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The British accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel remains on the Security Council's agenda. However, due to the Soviet Union's veto on the matter last week, the issue will not be revisited until after the Pacific former Japanese mandated islands issue is resolved. British sources state that if the Security Council cannot reach a decision on this matter, submitting it to the International Court is perfectly logical.

### Marshall and Stalin May Meet This Week; Molotov Receives Stettinius

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] It is learned that Stettinius, a Republican candidate for the 1948 US presidential election, is preparing to visit the Ural Mountains. Stettinius requested a meeting with Stalin after arriving here, but it is understood that this meeting can only take place after Stettinius returns from the Ural Mountains. In addition, Stalin is expected to receive US Secretary of State Marshall for talks within the week.

[TASS, Moscow, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with prominent US Republican leader Stettinius today for talks.

### Atomic Energy Commission Subcommittee Passes French Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission adopted the French delegation's proposal yesterday, stipulating that the subcommittee immediately review the differing opinions in the committee's reports. The vote was ten to zero, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining. Sources say this is the first concrete step toward establishing an international body to control atomic energy.

### Vandenberg Proposes Amendments Regarding US Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Aiming to Harmonize US Relations with the United Nations

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today proposed three restraining measures for President Truman's $400 million aid package to Greece and Turkey. One provision stipulates that UN agencies have the power to halt secondary aid, but the Soviet Union cannot use its veto power to obstruct US action. If a UN agency wants to block it, the Security Council or the General Assembly must vote on it as a procedural matter rather than a substantive one. In other words, a majority of seven out of the eleven members of the Security Council is required, and the veto power of the five permanent members does not apply. In the General Assembly, such a vote requires a majority of twenty-eight out of fifty-five votes. Vandenberg told the press that his amendment was intended to show that the US intends to act within the spirit of UN agencies. In fact, Vandenberg's proposal is equivalent to the US being willing to relinquish its voting rights when it encounters any obstacles in the aid to Greece and Turkey plan. Voting on "substantive" issues in the Security Council requires unanimity among the five major powers, each having the power to veto. According to Vandenberg's intention, the US is willing to abide by a majority vote, even if it violates US policy. If the US asks the UN agency itself to decide on aid to Greece and Turkey, the Soviet Union or other major powers could use their veto power to block it. Republican Senator Taft endorsed Vandenberg's amendment, and Democratic Senator George called it "a step in the right direction." Vandenberg's amendment also stipulates that the President should revoke all or any aid to Greece and Turkey in the following two situations: (1) If the government of either Greece or Turkey requests it, provided that such government represents the majority faction in that country; (2) If the President finds that the aid objective has been largely completed or cannot be completed. Republican Congressman Crawford, in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that the US should warn the Soviet Union to disarm, otherwise the US would not hesitate to confront it with atomic bombs and economic power. If the Soviet Union intends to obstruct, it is equivalent to starting a war, and if war breaks out, the Soviet Union will suffer a severe blow.

### Britain, at the Request of the United States, Continues to Aid Greece

[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] It has just been learned from responsible sources here that the British aid to Greece plan, originally scheduled to end today, will continue at the request of the United States until US aid to Greece takes effect. The US aid to Greece bill is still under discussion in Congress, and London sources hope that this plan will be passed by the US Congress before the end of April. As for the transitional period of British aid, it should be minimized in scope, and officials are certain that such aid will not be of any military nature.

### New US Ambassador Nominees to Yugoslavia, Portugal, and Poland

[Reuters, Washington, 31st] President Truman today nominated and appointed Mr. Cannon as the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Mr. Wiley as the Ambassador to Portugal, and Mr. Griffin as the Ambassador to Poland.

### Sweden Replies to US Protest Regarding Import Restrictions

[Reuters, Washington, 31st] The US previously protested to Sweden regarding the imposition of import restrictions. Sweden's reply has been delivered to the State Department. It is understood that the reply is moderately worded, but it emphasizes that the situation has changed dramatically since the establishment of the US-Sweden reciprocal trade agreement in 1935. Sweden stated that there is no discrimination against the US in the implementation of general import restrictions and is willing to negotiate with the US government on the issue of implementing import restrictions.

### Franco Suddenly Announces Spain as a Monarchy and Declares That He Will Be the Head of State for Life

[Reuters, London, 1st] Radio Madrid broadcast General Franco's speech last night, announcing Spain as a monarchy, with Franco as the head of state, and the establishment of a regency council. The previous monarchy in Spain ended in 1931 when city councils in major Spanish cities voted in favor of establishing a republic. King Alfonso XIII abdicated and went abroad, never returning. Radio Madrid also announced the monarchy law today, declaring Spain as a kingdom, with the head of state named "Chief of State." It stated that the regency council should assist the Chief of State in handling all affairs. The regency council is composed of the National Archbishop or the most prominent Archbishop, the Chief of Staff, the President of the State Council, and the President of the Supreme Court. In addition, members of parliament representing labor unions, local administration, university presidents, and professional associations each nominate one representative to participate in the regency council. The law also clearly stipulates that no king will be established before Franco's death or loss of capacity. It further states that upon the death or incapacity of the Chief of State, a person of royal blood may be established as the Chief of State upon the recommendation of the regency council and the government, with the consent of two-thirds of parliament. If no one meets these conditions, or their nomination is rejected by parliament, a regent may be appointed to act as the Chief of State.

### The "Sidistes" Express Opposition

[United Press, Madrid, 1st] The "Sidistes" consider Franco's plan "completely unacceptable." Their reasons for disapproval are: (1) Restrictions on the qualifications of the head of state; (2) Preservation of the real power of the current parliament and the Falange, which the monarchists want to eliminate; (3) This plan extends Franco's term of office indefinitely. They also claim that the purpose of this plan is to prevent the direct mobilization of monarchists, complete the restoration, and ensure that Franco continues to wield great power.

### Reactions in Britain and the US Mostly Express Dissatisfaction

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US State Department declined to comment on Franco's statement regarding Spain. According to one diplomat, if the Spanish army decides that the time has come to restore the Spanish Empire, Franco, as a soldier, should obey orders, as the army appointed him as leader during the Spanish Civil War. The diplomat also stated that if this is the case, the restoration of the Empire is possible, because the victory of the Allies in the Great War gave the army an overwhelming advantage over the Falange.

[United Press, London, 1st] A Foreign Office spokesman stated: "The political system of Spain must be freely decided by the people and cannot be forced by Franco. Only after Franco and his regime are eliminated can Britain adopt a compromise attitude toward Spain."

### Underground Train Collision in Japan; More Than 100 Passengers Killed and Injured

### Haifa Oil Depot Fire Unextinguished

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] After rioters bombed and ignited the Shell Oil Company's oil depot in Haifa, the fire raged fiercely. Two thousand soldiers from the army and navy, naval firefighters, army firefighters, and firefighters from Haifa City and the oil company were all dispatched to extinguish the fire for fifteen hours before cutting it off to prevent it from continuing to spread. Officials estimate the loss at one million pounds and expect to burden Palestinian taxpayers with compensation, as was done after the bombing of the King David Hotel.

### Conservatives Support Government Proposal; Britain Will Extend Conscription Law; Some Labor MPs Still Dissent

[Reuters, London, 31st] The House of Commons began the second reading of the Conscription Bill this afternoon. For the first time, the Conservatives helped the government defend against the opposition of a few Labor MPs and Liberal MPs.

[United Press, London, 31st] Churchill today led the Conservatives in supporting Prime Minister Attlee's suppression of the rebellion within the Labor Party against extending the Conscription Bill to 1954. Churchill declared that "we admire the courage of the Labor leaders in resisting the conspiracies and corrupt elements in the party." Seventy-seven Labor MPs have introduced a bill to repeal the Conscription Bill. Attlee urged party unity at a secret meeting of Labor MPs this morning. However, well-informed sources state that forty to fifty party members will still vote against extending the Conscription Bill. The law stipulates that 200,000 young men aged 18 to 26 will be conscripted into the army, navy, and air force each year. Minister of Labor Isaacs opened the debate in the House of Commons today, saying that Britain's military strength has been reduced to a serious stage and strongly advocated passing the bill to save it. He also said, "Unless we take some steps to remedy this defect, we will be in a very difficult situation." The debate will last two days and be voted on tomorrow night.

[United Press, London, 31st] After Opposition Leader Churchill stated that the Conservative Party would fully support the Labor government's Conscription Bill, the passage of the bill became a certainty. Churchill also stated that he had proposed a conscription bill in 1933 to cope with the threat of Nazism, which was opposed by the Labor Party at the time, but this time he was happy to support the Labor Party's conscription bill to defend against "another crisis, another dictatorship." Churchill's so-called "another crisis" implicitly refers to the Soviet Union.

### Hodge Has Returned to Seoul; Numerous Difficulties Between US and Soviet Occupation Zones in Korea

[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in southern Korea, flew back to his post in Seoul today.

[United Press, San Francisco, 31st] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in southern Korea, returned to his post today after a month in the US. He passed through here and reviewed the difficulties between the US and Soviet occupation zones in Korea at a press conference. It is said that if the US lacks interest and withdraws from Korea, it will have a serious impact on Asia. Hodge also said that he had discussed the matter with Secretary of State Marshall before he went to Moscow, but he could not explain the content. The provisional parliament sponsored by the US military in southern Korea has made progress in drafting an election law. Once the bill is completed, it is planned to elect a formal parliament in the US occupation zone as a first step toward democracy. The election date has not been determined. Hodge continued that there is no doubt that the Soviet occupation zone in northern Korea now has a Korean army under Soviet control, but the recently reported number of 500,000 in Washington is a misunderstanding. The 500,000 he estimated at the Washington meeting was the possible maximum number. For internal security purposes, the US military occupation zone in southern Korea is organizing a small-scale elite police force, the training of which is so good that some US troops sometimes go to observe.

### Korea Prepares Grand Welcome for Seo Jae-pil's Return

[Asia Press, Seoul, 1st] Since General Lerch announced the news of Dr. Seo Jae-pil's return to Korea, the provisional legislative parliament has selected Speaker Kim Kyu-sik, Deputy Speaker Yoon Ki-byun, and two others to prepare the welcome and will reportedly go to the airport to welcome him in person. Seo organized the "Independence Association" in Korea after 1895 and made many contributions to the Korean independence movement. Seo has now acquired US citizenship. General Lerch announced that Seo's return to Korea is only to assist the advisory group and that he has no ambitions for Korean politics.

### US Establishes Selective Service Record Bureau After Repealing Wartime Conscription Law

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] The wartime conscription law, which conscripted over 10 million US citizens into the army to fight in World War II, officially expired today.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Officials announced today the appointment of representatives from 18 major industries as members of the Industrial Mobilization Committee to assist the Army and Navy Munitions Bureau in preparing a national industrial mobilization plan, thus entering a more intense stage of the US post-war military preparation plan.

US Ambassador to Turkey Wilson returned to the US from Istanbul on March 24 to report to the State Department. (Special Dispatch from the New York Times)

### Gui Yongqing Personally Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the "Fubo" Warship Tragedy Will Transfer to the Accident Location in Xiamen Within Days to Investigate Relevant Investigative Personnel Held Review Meeting Yesterday Afternoon

[Our Dispatch] The sinking tragedy of the "Fubo" warship shocked the international community and the Naval Headquarters expressed particular concern, dispatching three personnel to Shanghai to investigate and offer condolences within a week. Gui Yongqing, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Department, personally came to Shanghai to investigate yesterday and will transfer to the accident location in Xiamen within days to investigate. It is understood that the Naval Headquarters has received a telegram from Xiamen stating that fishing boats have rescued more than twenty survivors, but their names have not yet been ascertained. As for the list of all the officers and soldiers who died, it will be announced in Beijing. To avoid excessive stimulation for the relatives of the deceased, individual notification may be adopted. The Department is considering it. Also, Ruan Chengzhang, Director of the Second Division of the Department, who came to Shanghai to offer condolences to the families of the deceased officers and soldiers, has not yet completed his condolence work. He was ordered to return to Beijing last night.

[Another Dispatch] The Shanghai Naval First Base Command held a review meeting for the "Fubo" warship investigation handlers at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the findings of the investigation in recent days.

### Former French Municipal Council Accounts Missing; Difficulties in Calculating Savings of Chinese Employees; The Cleaning Committee's French Concession Subgroup Met Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The French Concession Subgroup of the Shanghai Municipal Former Public Works Bureau's Official Assets and Obligations Cleaning Committee held its fifth meeting at the Land Administration Bureau yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Zhu Ping, Zha Liangjian, Zhang Yishu, Xiao Jianrong, Sun Kuifang, French representatives Greed, Tuffin, Gu Ruiliang, Father Moorey, Yang Zuoying, and French representative Xue Huali, among others. The issue of the refund of savings for Chinese employees of the former French Municipal Council was discussed, but no results were obtained. It is understood that this issue of savings for Chinese employees of the former Municipal Council is different from that of the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau has accounts to check, while the accounts of the Municipal Council are still missing. According to the regulations of the French Municipal Council Chinese Employee Savings Association on July 8, 1931, savings were deducted from employees' monthly salaries at a rate of 5%, and the Municipal Council subsidized 5% of the monthly salary, in addition to paying interest. According to the literal interpretation of this regulation, there should be a sum of money in existence. However, according to the French side, the savings association for Chinese employees was different from the savings association for European employees. The latter was an autonomous organization that received subsidies from the Municipal Council and contributions from employees, and deposited the funds in the bank, preparing to pay them upon retirement. However, the savings of Chinese employees did not have any special organization. The funds paid were recorded by the Municipal Council itself, and it undertook to add the interest that should be obtained at the interest rate stipulated in the annual budget when paying. When the Municipal Council Board of Directors resolves the budget each year, it shall stipulate the interest rate that the savings association will receive in the following year, and so on. The subgroup now acknowledges the debt owed to the former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council, but wants to find out whether the savings were deducted at that time, and if so, where the funds are now. The current concern is that the relevant accounts of the French Municipal Council are no longer available.

### China Fortune Zhong Company: Organization and Business Overview

To clarify the truth, the reporter visited Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the company, who provided the following information: Q: Who are the shareholders of China Fortune Zhong Company, and what is the capital?

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: Regarding the news item "Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Commits Suicide by Drowning" published in your newspaper on March 25th, the content does not match the facts. The TCM practitioner Lin Zongjing has resided in　for years. I did ask him to move some months ago, but there was no so-called "failure to move, followed by a beating," nor did I "close the gates, preventing patients from entering," obstructing his practice. Furthermore, Kunshan is not a brothel owner. That brothel was established by the tenant Chen Jinshan, and the brothel has a license, proving it has nothing to do with Kunshan. I was not coercing him. For the sake of my personal reputation, I specifically request your newspaper to make a correction to clarify the responsibility and distinguish right from wrong. Sincerely, Shao Kunshan.

To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Zhang Benda, who states that he read in the Shen Bao on March 27th an article titled "Bail for Chen Boluo's Escapees Subjected to Further Scrutiny," which stated, "Subsequently, the High Court discovered new evidence of Chen Bofan's crimes in another case and dispatched two court police officers to Zhang Benda's residence to arrest Chen Bowen. Unexpectedly, Zhang prevaricated with the court police while informing Chen's family." This does not correspond to the facts. The traitor Chen Bofan was sentenced to one year and three months in prison by the High Court. When his sentence expired on January 1st of this year, he was released on bail. His mother, Ms. Liang Song, begged Zhang Benda's mother to ask Benda to serve as his guarantor because it was difficult to refuse the request at the time. Unexpectedly, on February 2nd, court police officers from the High Court went to Chen Bofan's residence at No. 1, Lane 215, Rue Cardinal Mercier (i.e., Shen Hua's house) to summon him without success, then went to Muda's place to ask the guarantor to hand him over. They immediately joined forces with another guarantor, Kong　Jiu, to help search for him. The facts are all there. The guarantor had no　knowledge of the escape of the person he guaranteed, and he himself suffered　. The statement mentioned above, "Zhang prevaricated with the court police while informing Chen's family," is completely inconsistent with the facts. Please issue a correction in the Shen Bao to avoid confusion. Respectfully submitted, Lawyer Zhu Fangyi.

### Two Grass Shed Fires, Six Deaths in Zhabei

[Our Newspaper Report] At around 10:30 PM the night before last, a fire broke out at the grass shed of Yu Junnian's family at No. 12 Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness. Black smoke billowed and flames soared, and within moments, over ten grass sheds in the vicinity were engulfed in flames. The fire was extinguished in about two hours. Because it was late at night, residents were unable to escape, resulting in ten deaths and injuries. An investigation revealed that the dead included: Chen, the mother of the fire's source, Que Junnian (62 years old), Chen Caifu, Chen Guanquan, Wei Duozi, Cao Shihai, and his wife, Mo. Four people were burned: Que Junnian, Huang Zhicong, Qian Shunmo, and Huang Wenjiang.

### Reader Consultation Service Legal Questions

(1) Unauthorized Opening of Mail

Pu Tou Yong Kang Company asks: Our company received an important letter from a certain firm in an import port on October 6th of last year. Upon receipt, we discovered that the letter had been opened by someone else. We immediately approached the agency that delivers the letter on their behalf, and the agency's staff admitted it outright. We have legal questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) Is it illegal for the agency to overcharge for postage and demand handling fees? (2) Is it illegal to open other people's mail without authorization? (3) Is it illegal for the agency to have inconsistent delivery schedules and often deliberately delay deliveries?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If it is true that the agency overcharges for postage and demands handling fees, then in addition to violating postal regulations, they are suspected of criminal activity. They have violated the criminal law regarding fraud and dereliction of duty, and their actions constitute "using one's position to fraudulently obtain property" under Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. (2) Unauthorized opening of mail is regulated by Article 41 of the Postal Law. Punishment will be based on Article 315 of the Criminal Law. (3) You can report them to the competent post office. According to Article 5 of the Regulations on Postal Agencies, if an agent handles matters poorly or violates regulations, they should be replaced immediately, and if they are suspected of criminal activity, they should be handed over to the judicial authorities for review.

Security Deposit Question

A reader of ten years asks: In 1935, I leased a house from someone for a term of six years. The security deposit was 200 silver dollars, and the monthly rent was $4.50. When the lease expired in 1941, we agreed to renew for another five years, with the security deposit remaining the same and the rent increasing by $10 per month. Later, the rent was further increased by $15 in government bonds, and then again by two measures of rice, up to the present day. Now that the lease term has expired, I have the following questions and would appreciate your answers:

(1) When returning the security deposit, what is a reasonable proportion to return the original $200, or should it be returned based on the rice price at the time?

(2) Would it be reasonable to demand a refund based on the cost of living index?

(3) Would it be legal to negotiate with the landlord to continue living there based on the original rent of $4.50 per month set in 1935 until the security deposit is used up?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) No, because what you paid at the time was not "rice." (2) Current law does not have a provision for increasing the refund based on the cost of living index. (3) The security deposit is not prepaid rent, and the rent may increase or decrease at any time due to fluctuations in the value of goods. If a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term is up, as clearly stipulated by law. It is not legal to calculate the rent based on the amount from over ten years ago and live there until the security deposit is used up.

### Zhengda University Student Protest Not Resolved, Everything Transferred to Ministry for Resolution, Students Resumed Classes Yesterday Awaiting Further Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 1st] The Zhengda University student protest has not yet been resolved, and everything has been transferred to the Ministry for resolution. The students resumed classes yesterday, awaiting further instructions. The School Protection Association has declared that it will continue its work to protect the school and will not stop until its goals are achieved. Cheng Qibao, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, returned to Nanjing to report. According to him, the Zhengda University student protest has complex internal issues and is difficult to mediate. Although classes have resumed, the future is still uncertain. Cheng also said that the school's equipment is indeed simple, but considering that it was established six years ago and has been relocated several times, it is not easy to have its current scale. In the future, it will be necessary to raise large amounts of funds to enrich the internal equipment.

### Shanghai University Students Organize Committee for Reform of School Affairs, Send Letters to Parents Explaining Reasons for Freedom of Entry and Exit, Also Submit Proposal to School to Cancel Point System

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai University student strike was still deadlocked yesterday. The students insisted that they would not return to classes until a resolution was reached. Regarding the previous day's decision by the school board that "the principle of free entry and exit from the school gate is acceptable, but it must be approved by a majority of parents," the students were still not satisfied. Fearing that a majority of parents would not understand the inner workings of the school and would object, and because it would take a long time for letters to be exchanged, the students felt impatient. The students of the school organized the School Affairs Reform Movement Committee. In order to win the sympathy of parents, the committee sent letters to the parents of the students yesterday, detailing the impropriety of the school's punishment of Jin Jialin, a student in the Department of Political Science, for leaving the school gate privately, and the situation of the student strike, hoping that parents would sympathize and support them. The letter explained the reasons for allowing students to enter and exit the school gate freely: "The school calls roll every time there is a class, and the school has strict punishment measures for absenteeism. Our request for free entry and exit will not affect our classes. We only ask to be able to enter and exit freely when we have no classes, and we must return to the dormitory before 9:00 PM, so there will be no bad consequences. Please rest assured, wise parents."

It is also heard that the Shanghai University School Affairs Reform Movement Committee resolved that the strike will continue today, but reading groups will be organized, and Wang Yunsheng, the main writer of the Ta Kung Pao, will give a speech entitled "My View on Japan."

(Another News) Students from the first school of the Shanghai University School of Business held a general assembly of all students at the Wu Liande Hall of the Shanghai Museum the night before last to discuss responding to the students of the Yangshupu Day School to reform school affairs. They resolved not to strike for the time being, and decided on the following important recommendations: (1) Respond to the Yangshupu students and support all their demands. (2) Reiterate the cancellation of the point system. (3) Request that the school cancel the limit of at most 15 credits and at least 12 credits. (4) And cancel the five-year graduation system. Xu Zhendong, chairman of the Shanghai Alumni Association, recently made a statement saying: "I am very sympathetic to this student movement. However, I fear that the students' opinions will cause further complications. At the beginning of the student movement, the Student Union proposed to restore freedom and cancel the punishment of Jin Jun. Now, regarding the first point, the School Huang Association has agreed. As for the latter, Jin Jun and his parents have accepted the punishment, and the second term is about to expire, so there should be no major problem. However, the School Affairs Reform Committee has now proposed to the school to "cancel the point system." If this continues, I am afraid there will be no end to it."

### Respectful Reply to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding the National Textbook (Part 1)

— Lu Dianyang

Deng Gongsan's Sunday article published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on January 26, 1947, made many criticisms of the Ministry of Education-compiled textbooks, which are worthy of attention. However, each point he made should be explained to avoid misunderstandings. 1. Looking at Mr. Deng's entire article, except for the abusive parts that do not need to be debated, it can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Errors in temporary editions due to misprints, proofreading errors, and inappropriate wording, which have either been corrected in the revised edition or the Shanghai edition and were not seen by Mr. Deng, or the revised edition was delayed by the Qilian Office and is in the process of printing and has not yet been published, so it has not been supplied; (2) Issues that belong to the curriculum standards and not to the textbooks; (3) Whether Mr. Deng's views are appropriate is open to discussion. These are described below:

(1) Errors in the temporary editions that have been largely corrected in the revised edition. For example, the first lesson of the third volume of the revised edition of the senior primary school Chinese textbook has been corrected to "In the Sino-Japanese War, our country was defeated, and the people were angry." The revised editions of the junior high school Chinese and history textbooks were sent to print before May of last year, but have not yet been published, so it is regrettable that schools continue to use the temporary editions! However, the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition has corrected some errors, which is slightly better. The points raised by Mr. Deng have been corrected in the revised edition. The original manuscript is being typeset by the Qilian Office, and it can be reviewed. Even in the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition, some parts have been corrected. For example, Mr. Deng mentioned that Zong Ze and Li Gang of the Song Dynasty "firmly maintained the peace agreement." The ninth line of the forty-fifth page of the third volume of the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition has been corrected to "For example, in the battles between Song, Liao, and Jin, Kou Zhun, Li Gang, and Zong Ze were all able to firmly reject the peace agreement and be upright and unyielding, not to mention the arduous struggles of Han Shizhong and Yue Fei." The Chongqing edition omitted the word "Jin" and mistakenly wrote "rejected" as "maintained," resulting in the opposite meaning. However, the following sentence proves that Li and others were people who rejected peace rather than maintained it. Also, the names "Yelü Dashi" and "Yelü Dashi" of the Western Liao, and the prime minister "Tokto" and "Tuotuo" of the Yuan Dynasty, were originally transliterated nouns. Before the transliteration names were unified, the records in various books may have been different. However, in the Shanghai edition, "Yelü Dashi" has been changed to "Yelü Dashi," see the second to last line of the seventh page and the fourth line of the fiftieth page of the third volume. In the revised edition, "Tokto" has also been changed to "Tuotuo." Also, regarding the Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars mentioned by Mr. Deng, the Shanghai edition has long been revised to "...all history books and poetry books, and the language of hundreds of scholars were completely burned. Only the books on medicine, divination, and planting trees were not burned. If the people wanted to learn the law, they could take officials as their teachers. It is said that after the burning of books, hundreds of scholars were buried in Xianyang. This is the story of Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars." See the fifth to eighth lines of the eighty-seventh page of the first volume of the Shanghai edition. In the revised edition, the last paragraph of the chapter has been deleted, and the section on burning books and burying scholars has been changed to "However, Shihuang was too eager to seek unification, and his measures became autocratic, and even had the burning of books and burying of scholars." For example, in the junior high school history textbook, the phrase "Yuan Shizu promoted agriculture" in the lesson on Yuan and Ming society, "Shizu" was mistakenly printed as "Taizu." It has also been corrected in the revised edition. Many other misprints in the Chongqing edition of the junior high school history textbook have been corrected in the Shanghai edition, and there are major corrections in the revised edition. It is hoped that schools will pay attention to purchasing the revised edition, which is the most appropriate!

### Decision to Halt Tea Purchase, Tea Merchants Allowed to Add Additional Collateral, Total Tea Loan Amount for This Year Already Approved by the Four Banks Joint Office

Since the Ministry of Finance announced that the national treasury had no budget for the profits and losses of tea purchases and could not bear the burden, the national banks' discussions on bundling loans and export methods have become ineffective. After exchanging views with representatives from the tea merchants to the customs banks and the Agricultural Bank of China, a new decision was finally reached last night: the government has decided to cancel the purchases. In the future, tea merchants will work hard to manage exports and accelerate new tea production. The national banks have allowed tea merchants to add additional collateral to facilitate turnover. The amount is standardized at 80% of the originally scheduled collateral price for new tea this year, i.e., 480,000 yuan for Qihong (originally 350,000 yuan), 400,000 yuan for Tunlv (originally 280,000 yuan), and 320,000 yuan for Pinglv (originally 200,000 yuan). The total amount of additional collateral is worth several billion yuan. This will revitalize the rural economy. It is also reported that the above measures will be implemented after being submitted to the Four Banks Joint Office for approval.

Also, at the 320th meeting held by the Four Banks Joint Office, the tea loan program for this year was approved. The loan areas are the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Hubei, which is more widespread than last year. The total amount is 80 billion yuan, which is nearly ten times more than last spring. Loans are based on processing as the focal point, followed by transportation, sales, and collateral in export locations. The aim is to attract idle funds into rural areas, devote efforts to production, and promote the production of packaged, refined tea for transportation, sales, and export to earn foreign exchange. According to last year's packaged tea situation, although companies such as Wang Yutai, Huacha, Jiuxing, Xinghua, Dadechang, Zhenzhong, and Zhongnan exported through land routes, a large amount still remains in Shanghai. The loans have been in place for almost a year, and due to delays in manufacturing and transportation, sluggish exports, and the operation of production funds, they are not flexible enough. It is hoped that this year's tea loans will be completed within five months to promote the development of the tea industry.

The tea loan program for this year has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office, and its purpose is to support tea merchants' exports, earn foreign exchange, and balance international payments. Therefore, the amount has increased tenfold compared to last year, and tea-producing areas such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are all handled in the same way, in order to be widespread. Tea merchants can obtain loans in all processes, from processing to transportation, sales, and export. The loan for the processing period is deducted when handling sales loans, and the loan for the transportation and sales stage is deducted when exporting. This allows the loan to have a cyclical effect. Therefore, the tea loan is divided into three stages and processed separately. The first step is the processing loan, totaling over 27 billion; the second step is the transportation and sales loan, totaling over 50 billion; and the third step is the export loan, totaling over 80 billion. All of these are determined based on the actual needs of the tea merchants. Based on an average of 400,000 yuan per dan, it is estimated that 250,000 dan of tea can be exported this year (excluding tea merchants' own funds). In order to reduce leaf costs and save expenses, the bank has stipulated that each tea factory must have a minimum annual output of 100 dan in order to qualify for a processing loan. Those who do not meet 100 dan can form a cooperative tea factory with several other tea factories to reach the 100 dan figure. Otherwise, approval is unlikely. Processing loans can be processed starting in mid-month. Cooperative tea factories can apply later once the organization is ready.

### Government Bonds Flat and Weak

Government bonds were sold off by a major player, Chen, in yesterday's morning session, leading to weakness. However, new players were still active, and the price easily rebounded after the weakness. Unified C bonds opened at 11,500 yuan, immediately falling to 10,500 yuan, struggling between 11,000 yuan and 12,000 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the price finally rebounded to 13,500 yuan and then turned stronger.

### Foreign Stocks Turn to Sideways Trading

The momentum in foreign stocks declined yesterday, turning to sideways trading. Yisha opened at a high price of 27,600 yuan in the morning session but was immediately sold off by floating players and Guangbang, falling to 26,500 yuan.

As a result, compared to the previous close, the steel industry fell by 10%, the shipping industry and paper industry fell by half a percentage point each, and the rest declined slightly.

### Grain Stores Take Delivery, Xian Rice Sales Are Good

Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of over 12,500 shi of rice. After a long period of weakness, the stores have skillfully taken delivery, and middle- and low-grade early thin rice has shown some activity. The trend for northern japonica rice has also become firm. Xian rice sales are good, while Baiyuan and Yinyuan have seen little change. The supply and demand for flour remains fairly balanced, with little change for the time being. However, foreign flour is being digested actively, and prices have continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales are very sluggish, with a flat trend. Bean cake sales to the customer groups are normal, but the factory side is quite firm on selling prices due to expensive raw materials, and prices have risen slightly by 100-200 yuan.

The source of soybeans remains scarce, but the demand is acceptable. The price is nominally stable but secretly tight, rising by 1,000 yuan. Green beans are similar. Southern red beans continue to be handled, and arrivals cannot keep up with sales, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Corn is being taken by alcohol factories, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Red sorghum is strong, and foreign firms are slightly interested in raw peanuts, creating a stable situation. Sesame remains solid, and broad beans are outstanding. Although the sales of oil to foreign locations are unchanged, sporadic real sales are still active on the street, and arrivals remain scarce. Raw oil continues to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan, sesame oil rises by 3,000-5,000 yuan, and clear oil and soybean oil continue to rise sharply by 10,000 yuan. At the close of the noon session, the prices were slightly flat.

### Artificial Silk Rises Sharply

[Report from our newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's allocation of artificial silk to the silk weaving industry this week has not been allocated as of yesterday. Also, the allocation of goods to the silk weaving joint venture company has not been delivered as scheduled. Therefore, the artificial silk market has risen sharply. Yesterday morning, Gaoshan No. 120 rose from 6.15 million yuan to a high of 6.25 million yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price rose further to 6.6 million yuan, but there were few sellers. On average, the price rose by 450,000 yuan compared to yesterday.

### 17 Jintianbao and Other Large Silver Shops Reopen, More Redeemed Than Purchased

After more than 200 small silver shops in the city reopened on the 29th of last month, 17 large silver shops, including Jintianbao, also reopened yesterday as a whole. The purchase price is 480,000 yuan per tael, according to the regulations of the Central Bank, and will increase or decrease according to the Central Bank's purchase price. The redemption price is 570,000 yuan per tael, of which 48,000 yuan is legal profit and 42,000 yuan is loss interest tax. Ordinary gold labor costs 2,000-3,000 yuan per qian, and a loss of 30,000 yuan must be paid to exchange old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry. Yesterday was the first day of reopening, and business was light, different from the past. Moreover, redemption was several times higher than purchase, so it is impossible to maintain for a long time. It is reported that the industry will request the government to allocate gold to maintain its business.

### Securities Firms Privately Set Up Intercom Telephones, Four Bureaus Jointly Remove

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Municipal Police Bureau, Social Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau, together with securities exchange personnel, went to several securities firms to remove privately installed intercom telephones from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM yesterday.

### Textile Control Committee Announces March Cotton Yarn Purchase Prices Based on 400-Pound Machine-Packed Yarn

[Report from our newspaper] The Textile Control Committee has recently announced the price list for purchasing cotton yarn of various counts and grades in March this year. The purchase price is based on 400-pound machine-packed cotton yarn, including commodity tax.

### Simplification of Cash Collection and Delivery Agreed Upon

Yesterday, the Shanghai Silver Industry Association and the Money Industry Association held a joint meeting at No. 59 Hong Kong Road to discuss simplifying cash collection and delivery methods. The collection and delivery of exchange differences between various banks and firms is centrally handled by the Central Bank. The amount of cash collected and delivered is very large, often extending to late at night, especially the transfer of large amounts of cash, which is very risky. It is not always possible to count the money at the time, and there are many disputes afterwards due to shortages, which the various banks and firms feel very painful. Therefore, the Central Bank was requested that all cash to be delivered by various banks and firms should be deposited in advance with the silver industry reserve association for safekeeping, and the reserve association should issue a custody certificate. The custody certificate can be accepted by the same industry and can be delivered to the Central Bank, in order to be safe and avoid the trouble of sending cash. In consideration of the difficulties of the various banks and firms, the Central Bank has agreed to accept this method. At the same time, if the various banks and firms encounter cash that should be received from the Central Bank, the Central Bank intends to issue a deposit slip to the bank and firm, in order to mutually facilitate business. The custody rules were discussed and approved yesterday, and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and record, in order to be solemn.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Remain Strong, Prices Steadily Rise

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw continued purchases from the Tianjin group for Yuan Bi Ji, and there was also demand from Dihua. 客帮 (Ke Bang, meaning merchant groups from other provinces) absorbed a significant amount, leading to a steady increase in asking prices. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal Bi Ji rose from 160,000 yuan to a final price of 165,000 yuan. Initially, the market for plain gray cloth was stable, but towards the close of trading, it was reported that yarn prices were still rising. Local Liang factories and retail shops replenished their stocks, boosting confidence. Asking prices for various types of plain cloth uniformly increased compared to the previous day, ranging from 1,000 to 5,600 yuan. Twelve-pound Dragon Head plain cloth was priced at 157,500 yuan, Blue Chicken at 150,000 yuan, and Five Blessings at 153,000 yuan. Yesterday, Fangjian Company continued to supply cloth as usual, with Five Blessings gray cloth listed at 148,500 yuan. Traders in the industry were actively buying up purchase orders from the company at higher prices. The prices of other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and natural-colored cloth also remained firm. However, the retail sales of blue cloth and Shilin cloth were sluggish, and the market remained weak and lifeless.

### Foreign Exchange Canceled by Designated Banks Must Be Sold Separately to the National Bank

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 92 to all designated banks, stating: If a designated bank, according to the regulations of the Central Bank or other reasons, cancels foreign exchange that it has sold to its customers, such as when the letter of credit has expired and there is still an unused balance, then the canceled foreign exchange should be resold to the Central Bank according to the following regulations: (1) If the letter of credit for the canceled foreign exchange was established between March 4, 1946, and August 16, 1946, it must be sold to the National Bank at a rate of 3,340 yuan per US dollar and 13,450 yuan per British pound. Other currencies can be converted at the above US dollar or British pound rates. However, the designated bank needs to convert these currencies into US dollars or British pounds for delivery to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank can choose either one. (2) If the letter of credit for the canceled foreign exchange was established after August 19, 1946, it must be resold to the National Bank at the National Bank's quoted buying price on the date the designated bank sold the foreign exchange to its customers. Other currencies not quoted by the Central Bank can be converted at the National Bank's quoted buying price for US dollars or British pounds on that day. The designated bank needs to convert these currencies into US dollars or British pounds for delivery to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank can choose either one.

Furthermore, Section 6 of Circular No. 54 issued by the National Bank on September 23, 1946, is hereby canceled.

### Joint Allocation Office Lacks Control, Edible Oil Market Prices Rise Frequently, Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Meeting Tomorrow

Yesterday, the situation with edible oil continued to be one of rising prices. Off-market transactions saw peanut oil at 230,000 yuan per担 (dan, a unit of weight) for a Jeep barrel, and soybean oil at 285,000 yuan. The Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office has not allocated any oil since the beginning of last week. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday, it also received an order from the highest authorities, stating: "The price of edible oil in Shanghai has been rising continuously in recent days, which greatly affects the lives of citizens. It has been learned that the main reason for the rise, in addition to insufficient supply, is that the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office lacks control and cannot shirk its responsibility..." After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to convene a meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow with the responsible persons from the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the China Edible Oil Company, the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office, the Industrial Association of the Third District Refining Industry, and the Shanghai Oil Industry Commercial Association to discuss strengthening the function of the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office and urging the improvement of joint allocation methods. It is also reported that the problem of oil allocation in this city has come to a standstill because private oil mills are unwilling to supply oil. The relevant departments of the Social Affairs Bureau believe that, according to the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, any factory that has inventory and refuses to supply civilian needs may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of one to three times the value of the goods. To allow private manufacturers to express their opinions and seek a fair and reasonable solution, it was decided to convene a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of the 3rd with the responsible persons from the oil pressing industry, the oil trade, and the joint allocation office to discuss everything.

### China Farmers Bank Holds 14th Anniversary Celebration, New Assistant Managers Cheng Yuanfan and Others Take Office Simultaneously

The China Farmers Bank held its 14th anniversary ceremony at 10:00 AM on April 1st at its head office on Zhonghua Road in Nanjing. The newly appointed Assistant Managers Cheng Yuanfan, Xue Dijin, and Zhao Baoquan were also announced to take office simultaneously. Chairman Chen Guofu delivered a speech, first praising the past achievements and the efforts of colleagues over the past 14 years, which have led to today's achievements. The Farmers Bank will have even greater responsibilities in the future, and he hopes that colleagues will make extra efforts to promote the increase in agricultural production in our country. We should continue to release the various loans that have been approved, and the amount released should exceed the budgeted amount to invigorate rural finance and restore prosperity. This year, the Farmers Bank will advance with the development of national economic construction. Finally, he said: During today's celebration ceremony, the newly appointed Assistant Managers Cheng, Xue, and Zhao were announced to take office simultaneously. Chen also introduced the experiences of each of them and encouraged colleagues to work harder in the future, each guarding their posts, conducting more research and promotion in their work, and progressing with the progress of the bank's business. Subsequently, Directors Zhao Zhiyao, Li Zikuan, Liu Yongyao, and General Manager Li Shuming delivered speeches successively, and Qian Tianhe, Chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Di Ying, a member of the Central Committee, were invited to speak. Di congratulated them on the abundance of talents and resources. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon. The past history of the Farmers Bank is described as follows:

1.  Evolution: The predecessor of the bank was the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. At that time, the National Army was suppressing the Communists in the Jiangxi area, and in view of the desolation of the rural areas, the bank was established in the 22nd year of the Republic to benefit the rural economy. The head office was set up in Hankou. After the government implemented the legal tender policy, the bank was listed as a national bank issuing legal tender. Therefore, in the 24th year of the Republic, it was renamed the China Farmers Bank, expanded its scope, and moved its head office to Shanghai. Less than two years later, the War of Resistance broke out, and the head office was moved to Chongqing. After the victory, it began to recover and moved to the capital.

2.  Distribution of Institutions: Before the war, the institutions established in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were relatively widespread. During the war, new institutions were actively established in South China and the provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Guizhou, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu. However, in several provinces in North China, preparations began after the recovery. In total, including county cooperative treasuries, agricultural loan correspondence offices, and agricultural warehouses and other branches, there are more than 750 units (of which branch units are more than 280), with more than 4,680 employees.

3.  Business Conditions: (1) Increase rural production to cooperate with the government's export policy is the goal. The current business center is divided into four points: (A) Agricultural loans, (B) Land finance (handling agricultural land improvement, loans, and agricultural land distribution loans), (C) General banking business, (D) Handing matters (establishing the Pacification Zone Business Promotion Committee, handling Pacification small wood loans). Among the above four items, agricultural loans are the main focus. This type of loan is divided into two types: ordinary and special. Ordinary loans include living, processing, improved seeds, working cattle, marketing, and side businesses. Special loans are for tea, silk, etc. A total of more than 10 million yuan have been loaned for various loans.

### US Treasury Bills and Bonds, Subscription Voucher Format Has Been Determined

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank received an order from the Ministry of Finance the night before yesterday to start handling the issuance of US Treasury bills and bonds. The format of the US Treasury bills and bonds subscription vouchers was also determined by the bank around 5:00 PM yesterday, with one type each for treasury bills and bonds. The text on it roughly stated: "Received from ××× National Currency ×××, converted according to the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate of ×××, totaling US$××× face value of 36-year short-term treasury bills, with interest coupons attached from the ×th period. After the bonds are printed, this voucher will be used for exchange. This subscription voucher is specially issued as proof." There are two notes printed next to the voucher: (1) This subscription voucher will be void if altered. (2) This subscription voucher is divided into registered and unregistered types. However, if the unregistered type is lost or destroyed, it cannot be reported as lost. The subscription voucher is in triplicate, one for the bond purchaser, one for the report, and one for the stub. The Central Bank delivered it to the Sixth Joint Printing Plant for printing around 6:00 PM yesterday, with 5,000 copies of each type printed first. It is expected to be completed within a few days.

The organization of the sales committee will be established according to the situation in various places, with the number of members ranging from eleven to seventeen. The members of the municipal sales committee will be set at seventeen, and the list is currently being proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the silver and money industry, and other guilds. In addition to the Central Bank being responsible for the issuance of bonds, it will also promote the three banks and two bureaus, and other commercial banks and firms to jointly assist in the issuance. The list of banks and firms is also under consideration.

### Dried Longan Arrived Sparsely, Prices Rise

Recently, the arrival and inventory of dried longan are scarce, and the market is tight. The price of Tong'an goods has risen by nearly 20% before and after, and it is heard that Guangdong has also risen by 20-30% due to the lack of inventory. Given the price reversals with Shanghai, the future market will inevitably follow closely.

### Plain Carriages and White Horses Fill the Capital Gate, Public Burial for General Dai Yunong

— Nanjing Express News, March 26th, Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua

Dai Li, Dai Yunong, no Chinese person does not know his heroic name. Quietness, patience, greatness, and strength are the main factors of his success. For twenty years, regardless of fame or gain, adhering to the spirit of "never yielding when it comes to righteousness, and acting bravely when seeing justice," he devoted himself to the revolution and dedicated himself to the country, creating his illustrious career. He is indeed a legendary figure in China.

"General Dai's underground work strengthened the anti-Japanese ranks; General Dai's Sino-American cooperation shortened the world war." These are the words of American friends who posthumously praised the late General Dai, and they are also iron facts.

Loyal Soul Lives Forever in Zhigong Temple

From June 14th last year, the loyal soul of the late Director Dai has been entrusted to Zhigong Temple. He is not lonely. Candles are always bright, and there are often attendants serving. He has been resting for ten months. Today (the 26th) is the grand ceremony for his relocation and public burial. Plain carriages and white horses filled the inside and outside, and the crowd was huge and unprecedented. The superiors, colleagues, subordinates, relatives, and friends who had been estranged for more than a year met today, and the General smiled! The General's thick eyebrows and sharp eyes were a display of heroic spirit, inspiring respect. The layout of the mourning hall was simple, with incense swirling around. The portrait of the late Director Dai, surrounded by white floral tributes, was placed in the center of the mourning hall. Above hung Chairman Chiang's eulogy "Loyalty for a Thousand Autumns," and on both sides of the temple door were General Hu Zongnan's couplet: "The ancestral sorrow of the rooster's crow, the vast Yellow River, who else will bravely strike to cross the river? The spring breeze blows across the wild grass, the turbulent world, only you are enough to fear the rebellious ministers." Further inside was the couplet by the head of the funeral committee, General Zhu Shaoliang: "Crossing the sea to help slay the long whale, generously seeking revenge, happily paying this aspiration in Jiuyao, with the fierce omen of the wind retreating the crane, calmly sacrificing oneself, winning a monument of loyalty for thousands of years." After twelve o'clock, central leaders and all sectors of the capital went to pay their respects. Liang Hancao, Gui Yongqing, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Guofu, Chen Bulei, Zhu Shuming, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng... all came to mourn. The sky was filled with gloomy clouds, and the candlelight flickered in front of the spirit. Dai's son, Zhuangyi, tearfully answered the condolences, and the mourning hall was filled with a tragic scene.

Foreign Brothers Weep Bitterly Before the Spirit

Major General Miles and General Dai Yunong were the leading figures in charge of Sino-American cooperation. Since the 31st year of the Republic, he and General Dai had planned how to defeat the enemy and how to support the Allied forces' landing. For five years, they had risen and fallen together, secretly entered enemy territory, disguised themselves and stood up along the coast, directed and attacked in combat, and pre-organized the training of students. He had personally experienced some dangers. Once, when inspecting the southeast, he was almost shot down by enemy planes. Therefore, they were not only good friends at work, but also foreign brothers in times of trouble. Analyzing the enemy's situation, they were in perfect harmony. When they drank, they would toast and drain their glasses. Their feelings were extremely harmonious. The fruitful achievements of Sino-American cooperation were, of course, the harvest of their private friendship. Unfortunately, General Dai died for his country. Miles recalled his comings and goings to Zhongjiashan in Chongqing and wept uncontrollably. He came from the United States specifically to pay his respects. Today, he was wearing a gray and light black suit. After getting out of the car, he heard the mourning music and felt depressed and sad. Walking up the stone steps and entering the mourning hall, he couldn't help but shed tears. He stood to pay his respects, expressing his grief to the extreme. Then he went inside to view the coffin and shook hands with Dai's son, Zhuangyi, with a furrowed brow. Dai's son was moved by the people and cried loudly. Miles also shed tears like pearls. Other accompanying mourners also wept, and the scene was indescribably tragic. After the Major General entered the rest room, his tears continued for more than ten minutes. When our reporters asked about the past of Sino-American cooperation, he was too sad to speak. He only said, "General Dai is my Chinese brother. The word 'sincere' is enough to be praised. My emotions are really too impulsive to say more, please forgive me!" Before the translator had finished translating, he was filled with tears again, flowing down like rain.

Chairman Personally Presides Over the Funeral

At one o'clock in the afternoon, Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun walked into the mourning hall together. Both of them and the late General Dai were close friends who participated in the central government during the War of Resistance, discussing major military and national policies. Today, they caught a glimpse of Dai's remains and couldn't help but feel extremely sad! When the two entered the rest room, suddenly a bugle call of attention came from afar. At this time, the personnel in charge of security were vigilant for a while, knowing that the head of state had come to Zhigong Temple in person. In the midst of the mournful military music, Chairman Chiang arrived at 1:15 PM. Party and state elders President Yu Youren and Secretary General Shao Lizi and his wife also arrived at this time and were listed as mourners along with Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, and Zheng Jiemin. The chairman bowed his head in silence, with a sad expression on his face, and used a glove to wipe away his tears. He offered incense, flowers, and read the eulogy, every word was tears, every sentence was heartbreaking! When reading to "The school collapsed and the beam broke, the worry of the party and the country, the loss of the limbs, the transfer of assistants is impossible, the tears cannot be collected after a year of absence? Remotely watching the great opportunity, my heart is leisurely!" he couldn't help but shed tears. For a moment, there was silence, and the mountains and rivers lost their color.

General Sleeps Forever, Leaving a Thousand Years of Regret

At 2:00 PM, the relocation and public burial began. Suddenly, the sound of firecrackers shook the mountains. The relocation team's guards slowly advanced through the dense forest. The vanguard was the music team, followed by the guests holding the ropes, and then the coffin covered with the party flag. Dai's subordinates guarded the spirit from left to right, front and rear, and the filial sons and grandsons were at the rear. After twenty minutes, they arrived at the cemetery. Standing in front and looking straight, they saw the tombstone of General Dai Yunong, erected on March 26, 36th year of the Republic of China, written by Wu Zhizhi himself, which made people look up to him. The cemetery faces west from the east, backed by Zijin Mountain, about a mile away from the cemetery of the martyrs of the National Revolutionary Army, reflecting and shining on each other. The tomb was built of three-in-one cement, one zhang long, five chi wide, and five chi deep, with a national flag at the bottom to show the meaning of a public burial. The coffin was moved into the tomb by Dai's senior subordinates and students themselves. At 2:25 PM, the burial was officially held. Major General Miles mourned for a long time. At this time, he shed many heroic tears again! Just as the farewell ceremony was being held, Minister Chen Lifu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and Chairman Fang Zhi also arrived at this time to participate in the ceremony. At that time, there was no sound. Forever grieving for the misfortune of the Chinese people and the misfortune of the world!

Looking at the General's Merits from Numbers

The late Director Dai was responsible for military intelligence work for twenty years and made great contributions to the Republic of China. Let's look at his merits from the statistics! During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he presided over the Military Affairs Committee Investigation and Statistics Bureau, destroying the enemy 2,107 times, attacking 585 times, sanctioning 515 enemy leaders, killing 17,873 enemy personnel, wounding 4,916 people, capturing 566 people, destroying 492 enemy locomotives, 1,627 carriages, 477 cars, 20,320 boxes of gasoline, 1,797 motors, 2,675 meters of electric weaving, 15 machines, 442 ships, 51 fortresses and bunkers, 2,1318 rifles, 33 cannons, 48,209 boxes of various ammunition, 71 aircraft, 1,578 barracks, 81,462 ancestral grains, 1,316 telephone poles, 5,551 military uniforms and blankets, 5,051 boxes of toxic gas raw materials, 250 bridges, 1,658 meters of rails, 19,924 zhang of iron wire, 547 boxes of kerosene, 56,415 pieces of silk cloth, 7,670 bales of cotton, and seized a lot of spoils.

Taking Sino-American cooperation alone, in the past three years, 26,799 enemies have been killed, 11,642 have been wounded, 508 have been captured, 182 bridges have been destroyed, 158 sampans have been destroyed, 35 steamships have been destroyed, one aircraft has been destroyed, 425 locomotives and carriages have been destroyed, 271 warehouses have been destroyed, 303 sections of railways have been destroyed, 269 motorized vehicles have been destroyed, and 130 United Nations pilots have been rescued. These achievements are the price of the struggle and sacrifice of General Dai and his hundreds of thousands of subordinates, and his reputation will be immortal.

Visiting Miles After Returning from the Cemetery

Returning from the cemetery, I felt that it was a regret not to have received Miles's final assessment of General Dai. So I drove to Miles's residence to inquire. At this time, Major General Miles was calm. The reporter first asked what he thought of General Dai. Miles happily gestured and said, "General Dai is good, General Dai is good!" Then he spoke to the reporter non-stop: "My first impression of General Dai is that he is decisive and capable. When I first arrived in Chongqing and met General Dai, it was the most critical time in the Chinese war. I asked him if there was a way to deploy along the coast. He replied to me: "There is a way. I am absolutely responsible. In two months, you will see my realistic performance!" At that time, I was busy investigating personnel and had no chance to find him. One day, he suddenly came to find me. I was very happy and said, "Mr. Miles, look at this stack of telegrams. This is from Fuzhou. This is from Wenzhou. This is from Shantou, this is from Guangzhou. How the enemy is eroding, the positions adopted by the enemy, as well as the internal organization and financial situation of the enemy, are all pointed out to me one by one. I was very surprised, and I pressed him closely. What's going on. He said that a week ago, I personally went to those places to arrange it. I limited them to immediately show results. I told you a month ago that there was a way, and I am absolutely responsible, that's the reason. From here on, I deeply recognized General Dai, so I immediately sent a telegram to Washington, and in less than half a month, Washington approved my plan to cooperate with General Dai, and the work of the later Sino-American Cooperation Institute was produced. My second impression of General Dai is that he is responsible in his work. General Dai often said to me: My methods are only eight words, which are "hard work, hard guarding, taking responsibility, and accepting complaints." The achievements of Dai's life lie in this place. His subordinates are happy to obey orders and also achieve "quietness, patience, greatness, and firmness," loyal to the country and loyal to the leader. General Dai is responsible in his work, and I will use a fact to illustrate: After the recovery of the Philippines, the US military prepared to land from China, and the authorities gave me information asking me to cooperate with the Chinese side to support the landing. After all the arrangements were made, Chiang Kai-shek was deeply worried that after some people retreated, the bandits would take the opportunity to cause chaos. At this time, General Dai often flew on the southeast line to make arrangements. One day, he said to Chairman Chiang: "The leader can rest assured that as long as the Japanese army retreats, it must be our loyal National Salvation Army who will be the first to raise the banner in Nanjing and Shanghai to respond to the National Army. Not only will the bandits not be able to enter, but we must also seize Nanjing and Shanghai before the Allied forces." Later, it was all realized. This is what subordinates say to their superiors about being responsible. My third impression of General Dai is that he loves his soldiers and his comrades. He often threatened his subordinates that the soldiers and officers of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau are all comrades, and there is only a difference in duties. I often go up and down the mountains with General Dai. General Dai always asked about the soldiers' living conditions along the way, and if there were any malpractices, he would go back and punish them, so the general soldiers regarded General Dai as their parents and were able to use them peacefully, which proves General Dai's kind and equal virtue. ... Major General was busy answering the phone that had been ringing! After the reporter got this valuable information, he said goodbye and left. Major General replied politely with the words "farewell for now."

General Dai, born to be a hero, died to be a spirit, come back again! The Republic of China needs you!

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Merchants Flock to Hong Kong

— Hải Phòng, 15th Day of the Voyage — Zhu Jin

A Glimpse of Hải Phòng, the Gateway to Vietnam

Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Broken down by gender, males constitute 80%, and females 20%. By occupation, the majority are laborers, followed by businessmen, and then freelance professionals. The most populous residential area is Xī Dī in Southern Vietnam, followed by Hải Phòng, Hà Nội, and Nam Định in Northern Vietnam, and then Huế and Quy Nhơn in Central Vietnam. By place of origin, Guangdong is the most represented, followed by Fujian, with very few from other provinces.

Hải Phòng is one of the gateways to Vietnam. Academic groups such as the "Đông An," "Overseas English," "Shí Xí," and "Zhonghua" alumni associations have been established. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Alumni Association and the Zhonghua National Federation have also been established. Luo Weiqi, the chairman of the Zhonghua Association, and Chunli, the chairman of the Zhonghua Chamber of Commerce, are both veteran overseas Chinese leaders in the city.

The former Consul in Hải Phòng, Zhu Yuanzhang, has been recalled to Beijing. During the interim, Xie Wushen from the Consulate General in Hà Nội is responsible for the duties. The newly appointed Consul in Hải Phòng, Xiao Jinfang, has arrived in Hải Phòng and will formally assume office soon. Xiao is against the recent French proposal to reinstate the former Bangzhang system, believing that the establishment of such a system is a clear attempt to divide the strength of the Chinese. If the French side insists on restoring this Bang system, he will decide to take effective countermeasures. He attaches great importance to overseas Chinese education in the city (Hải Phòng). Mr. Xiao has been quite busy inspecting various places in recent days.

Order Restored in Hà Nội City

Hà Nội is the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of Northern Vietnam. The US Consulate General is located there. Currently, Colonel Ba, the supreme commander of the French army (referring to Northern Vietnam), is commanding the French army in battle with the Việt Minh forces.

Order has been restored in Hà Nội city, but commerce has come to a standstill. There is no large-scale publishing industry here; spiritual nourishment can only rely on supplies from Hong Kong, Saigon, and Kunming. The cultural level of the overseas Chinese is relatively low, and they do not have much interest in films from the motherland.

Frequent Robberies in the "Three-No Zone"

Móng Cái is located on the Sino-Vietnamese border. The area is small, and most of the residents are Chinese. It faces the town of Dongxing in Fangcheng County, Guangdong Province, across the river. Geographically, this border area has little value, but due to the past resistance wars, this small border area has become the only route for movement from Southern Guangdong to Vietnam, and everything has flourished. The population of Móng Cái is only about ten thousand, and the city appearance is quite clean. However, the security there has been poor recently. Robberies occur frequently at night, causing considerable alarm to the citizens. The French forces have not yet arrived, the Vietnamese forces are insufficient, and the Chinese government does not care, so it has become a "three-no zone." Bandits appear and disappear unpredictably.

Overseas Chinese Business District Inspections

(1) Northern Vietnam: Hải Phòng, Hà Nội, Hưng Yên Port, Macau, Beihai, and Zhan City (Guangzhou Bay) have convenient water transportation. Most of the overseas Chinese here engage in export business, with rice, coal, iron, and various local products being the main commodities.

(2) Central Vietnam: Huế, Đà Nẵng Port, Hội An, Thanh Hóa, Nghệ An, Quảng Trị, Quảng Ngãi, etc., mostly deal in medicinal materials, followed by foreign sundries and local products, and then food products.

(3) Southern Vietnam: Saigon-Cholon, abbreviated as "Xī Dī," has a larger commercial port, a larger population, and complex business sectors. The main businesses are ships, rice, sugar, raw rubber, timber, and firewood. Foreign sundries have a wider market, and various side businesses are also quite prosperous.

(4) Cambodia and Laos: Mostly engaged in cultivating pepper, kapok, and corn. The market mainly trades in medicinal materials and foreign goods.

In Northern Vietnam, since the French announced the regulations for controlling import and export trade and foreign exchange settlement last year, import and export trade has almost come to a standstill, and the overseas Chinese economy has been severely hit. Since the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese war, the situation has been even worse, and most merchants have moved to Hong Kong.

### New Education, New Youth, New China

— Zhou Jixi

Youth are the new cells of the country and the new bloodline of the nation. Therefore, the construction of a new country, the growth of a new nation, or the innovation of an ancient country, and the revival of a declining nation, all depend on outstanding youth who are healthy, virtuous, highly intelligent, capable, ambitious, promising, and principled. But to have such new youth, there must be a perfect new education. To build a prosperous and happy new China, we must educate healthy, virtuous, and intelligent new youth, and develop a perfect new education.

We have been running new education for decades, but it has all been copied and imitated, repeating what others say, without taking the best and discarding the worst, or innovating. Instead, we have cultivated countless traitors, national thieves, corrupt officials, unscrupulous clerks, profiteers, local bullies, and evil gentry… so the more new education we run, the more chaotic and impoverished the country and society become! Therefore, to cultivate talents and build the country, and to save the country and the people, we must have a new national construction education movement, to run our education of new youth, and to build a new China with a change of direction and a new life education.

The most important thing in educating new youth and building a new China's new education is to cultivate noble personalities in the youth. Last July 11th, the author flew from Chongqing to Beijing to return to the capital in victory. Because of the deep feeling of the low level of personality, physique, and qualifications of the general people, as well as the declining academic, political, family, social, and national customs, which are a major obstacle to the future of national construction, I published an article "Advocating Three Qualities and Rectifying Five Customs" in "Ta Kung Pao" to correct people's hearts and change customs. Eight months later, the three qualities and five customs have become even worse, leading to more chaos and poverty in the country and society, and the general ignorant masses are even more miserable. If this continues, the future of the country and nation is truly unthinkable! To save the country and the people and build a new China, we must respect personality and rectify declining customs; to rectify declining customs and respect personality, we must first rectify academic customs and cultivate noble personalities in the youth; to rectify academic customs and cultivate noble personalities in the youth, we must first invite morally esteemed and highly respected scholars to be university and middle school principals and heads of training (deans of universities, directors of moral education in middle schools), so that they can lead by example and be teachers for the youth, implementing personality edification and personality education. If there is no noble personality or moral prestige, then even if one is highly talented and knowledgeable, they are not worthy to be university principals or heads of training. As for the cultivation of good academic customs and the shaping of youth personality, as far as the author can see, it seems that the four words "loyalty, trustworthiness, diligence, and frugality" should be the goal. The meaning of "loyalty," I think, is "responsibility." In this great era of national construction, the most important thing for the new youth of China is to be loyal to the country and loyal to the people, that is, to be responsible to the country and the people. Everyone must establish the great ambition of building the country and saving the people, and take on the great responsibility of building the country and saving the people, to save the people from deep waters and raging fires, and to make the country a prosperous and happy city as their own responsibility. Secondly, they must be loyal to their duties. Although young students have not yet served society and the country, their study at school is originally for learning for application, for serving the country and society. Therefore, they must have sufficient preparation and in-depth research for the duties they intend to take up in the future, so that when they graduate and are employed, they can display their strengths, stand on their own positions, and make the best efforts and the greatest contributions to a certain sector of national and social construction. Other things such as the training of service ethics and the cultivation of enduring hard work are all personality education for training young people to be courageous in taking responsibility and loyal to their duties. Secondly, the meaning of "trustworthiness," from the "shape" of the word, is "human words are trustworthy." Therefore, new youths who have received new education must think what they say, and do what they say; thinking, saying, doing, or heart, words, actions, must be like the three points said in geometry, connecting the three to form a straight line, which is heart straight, mouth straight, consistent words and actions, which is trustworthiness. Conversely, if you connect the three points to form an angle, it is curved and not straight, action does not follow words, words are insincere, and untrustworthy. Therefore, new youths who have received new education, whether learning, being a person, doing things, dealing with people, or conducting themselves in the world… must respond to each other with sound and heart, consistent words and actions, that is, heart, words, and actions are one, to become a person of integrity and outstanding integrity. Thirdly, the meaning of "diligence" is to do one's best without being lazy or tired. Young students, if they can study diligently and persevere, they will surely, because of their nature, their talents, their interests, and their abilities, continue to improve and succeed, and even become great scientists, great inventors, and great scholars, all in the word "move." We, the new youths who have received new education to build a new China, can we not "persuade" to seek knowledge and develop the virtue of diligence to seek to establish achievements? Fourthly, the meaning of "frugality" is to be thrifty and not to waste. Today, the young people who are educated in middle schools and universities, the rich often squander extravagantly, indulging in luxury, wasting the country and society's wealth, and wasting precious youthful time. How regrettable this is! Moreover, they often wear foreign clothes, eat Western food, and use foreign goods, which is all the more distressing! To promote domestic goods and advocate a frugal construction of the country, we must start with young students. Young students must not only save money and materials, but also save time, because they are still in the consumption era of studying, and consumers who waste and students who study to play are truly moths of the country and society, and their future will be unthinkable! Therefore, all young students in the country must develop the virtue of thrift. Only if new education can shape the new youth's noble personality and virtues of loyalty to love the country, trustworthiness to be a person, diligence to study, and frugality to nourish the factory with the above four, can it create new talents for building a new China. It is hoped that comrades across the country who are engaged in new education and training new youth will pay attention to it.

Secondly, the new education of educating new youth and building a new China must train young people in scientific knowledge and construction technology. In the past, China's school science education can be said to be divorced from the needs of national construction and people's livelihood, so on the one hand, various construction departments of the country and society need talents but cannot find them, and on the other hand, countless young people need work but cannot find it. There are many reasons for this contradictory phenomenon, but the main reason is that the training in the past education was insufficient, so that when young people leave school, there are inevitable problems in their knowledge and ability, and what is presented to us is that all kinds of construction undertakings need talents, but countless young people cannot be employed. Learning from the past, the new education of training new youth in the future must actively train them in scientific knowledge and construction technology.

Science education in secondary schools must focus on experiments and compiling "China-based" textbooks, so that science speaks Chinese and studies Chinese science problems. However, in addition to clarifying basic scientific principles, experiments must focus on scientific knowledge and skills needed for people's daily life and various construction undertakings. The books, instruments, and all equipment needed for scientific experiments and research must be enriched as much as possible. As for compiling good China-based textbooks, attention should be paid to the following three points: (1) Recognizing the facts of our country's inventions in science in history and its contributions to strengthen the national self-confidence of young people in developing science; (2) Discussing the industrial, agricultural, and mining principles required for the construction of the new China and the types of talents and materials that the construction of the new China lacks to arouse the interest of young people in selecting specialized subjects in the future; (3) Trying to adopt and study the nature, uses, quantity, and manufacturing methods of native products, and how to improve them, can improve the quality and increase the output.

In higher education, the scientific research of young people should be matched with the needs of national construction and people's livelihood; that is, the scientific education of all colleges and universities above specialized subjects must aim at training cadres for national construction. Young students in colleges and universities above specialized subjects must be given more time and opportunities for practice and experiments. If they can use winter and summer vacations to send them to factories, farms, mines, hospitals, etc. for practice, so that they have a specialized scientific technology after graduation, they can devote themselves to construction work, it would be even better! When the author was in Chongqing a few years ago, I heard that the National Frontier School used winter and summer vacations to select students to go to various factories to learn a specialized technology, such as leather making, etc. I heard that the results were very good. This method is really a good way to train young people to learn scientific technology, and all schools can follow suit. As for larger universities with colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, they should establish research institutes related to construction undertakings, recruit talents, enrich equipment, enroll graduate students, and devote themselves to scientific research. Military scholars, if they want to study a scientific problem, should provide them with information at any time, and expect them to make inventions or creations? Young students with particularly excellent scientific achievements should be heavily rewarded to encourage them.

The world today is a world of science. To build a modern new China, we must actively develop scientific education and train young people in scientific knowledge and skills.

Furthermore, new education must train strong, brave, and enterprising new youth to move towards the future of building a new China and move forward.

Our China has always had the saying of "sick man of East Asia." Generally, young students are often weak and sick. According to the results of health checkups in various schools, more than 80% have physical defects. This is a major obstacle to the future of national construction. To build a prosperous and happy new China, we must train strong and brave new youth, so that young students who are prematurely old, weak, and sick can be transformed into strong and healthy, "powerful," and "brave and knowledgeable" "materials." To achieve this goal, schools at all levels must pay special attention to the health of young people. All equipment for medicine, hygiene, sports, etc. that can improve health must be enriched as much as possible. Special attention should be paid to the cleanliness of toilets, classrooms, dining halls, dormitories, and all school grounds, as well as environmental hygiene. Physical education classes must be widely promoted for fitness exercises. Morning exercises or inter-class exercises must be held every day, and extracurricular exercise time must be stipulated, forcing all young students to participate, and no absence is allowed without reason. When spring comes, students should be vaccinated to prevent smallpox. When summer comes, they should be injected with vaccines against cholera, typhoid, copper disease, etc. to prevent epidemics and ensure safety. In addition, such as pointing young students to have a fixed time for study, a fixed amount for diet, a regular life, and training them in hygienic habits, quitting all bad habits such as smoking and drinking, and actively promoting health education, are all new educational measures and activities to make young students strengthen their bodies, get rid of diseases, and improve their health.

In addition to training young people's strong bodies, new education must also train their brave and martial spirit, so that they have the courage to dare to act, the courage to do what is right, and the spirit of striving for sacrifice and striving for progress, and the perseverance to build achievements and establish a career without turning back.

New education is a great undertaking to train new youth, and new youth are the new force to build a new China. My respectable, admirable, and lovable comrades who are engaged in new education! We are all training officers who train the new force to build a new China. These thousands of new forces all rely on our noble personality to influence them; our extraordinary wisdom to teach them; our strong and majestic energy to train them, so that they can become new youth with noble personalities, extraordinary wisdom, strong and brave, healthy and intelligent, ambitious, promising, and principled, and build a prosperous and happy modern new China.

On the tenth of this month, after I published an article "The Road of National Construction Education" in "Ta Kung Pao," I was either interviewed or sent letters to discuss it. In the excitement, I drafted this article, and I hope that educational comrades and young friends will teach me. (Written in Shanghai, Nantong College on March 26, 1947)

### Appeal from Female Graduates of Silk School

We are an unfortunate group who graduated from a female silk school. After graduation, we immediately suffered the pain of unemployment. The beautiful ideals we had in school have all become illusions. We dare not have other extravagant hopes, we only hope that society will give us an opportunity to be able to use what we have learned. So we waited for the opportunity to come. This year, the opportunity finally came. The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Management Improvement Committee published the news of recruiting 500 instructors. We rushed to register, but the reply we received a month later was that we could not be hired due to lack of experience. This was like a bolt from the blue to us. How disappointed and heartbroken we felt!

May I ask: Do those who have experience have experience as soon as they leave school? Didn't they come from having no experience? If you must have experience to be hired, then why did the country establish silk schools? Wouldn't we, this group with no experience, be societal parasites forever! Is our life over? We want to question why the Sericulture Committee abandoned us, and we want to appeal and ask for the help and sympathy of people in society to save us (A group of female silk school graduates from Suzhou)

### Talking About Sun Yat-sen Rebuking Chen Hèshì

— Liang Lieya

Recently, I read a story about Sun Yat-sen in this newspaper's "Special Issue Commemorating the 22nd Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death": "Sun Yat-sen was kind and rarely angry. When he lived in Shanghai, his servant, Chen Hè, was quite foolish. When things did not go his way, Sun Yat-sen would scold him: 'Dà Pào Hè,' but he rarely did so. 'Dà Pào' in Cantonese means foolish."

However, what I know is that Chen Hè was also a comrade, not Sun Yat-sen's servant. His position as Sun Yat-sen's cook was partly hired and partly voluntary. He was not a fool, just fond of gambling. Therefore, Mr. Feng Ziyou said in his book "Anecdotes of the Revolution": "One day, Zhang Taiyan, Tian Tong, Hu Hanmin, etc. were talking about the revolution at the Premier's residence (Tokyo, Japan, in 1906), and Deng Muhan, who was present, had no way to interject, so he entered the kitchen and talked about current affairs with the cook Chen Hè and the Japanese maid, enthusiastically, with voices that shook the outside. Chen Hè was also a comrade and liked to gamble. He often used the money for buying groceries for a gamble. Once, because he lost all his money gambling, he claimed that he lost his shoes in the cold alley and wanted the Premier to give him money to buy them again. (Cold alley is a Cantonese dialect, which is commonly known as the corridor. In Japanese architecture, the corridor is located indoors. According to Japanese customs, people sit on the floor, and shoes are placed outdoors.) There is no reason to lose shoes in the corridor. The kitchen speech and the cold alley shoe loss are both rare and strange events. The Premier once imitated the chapter titles of the chapter novels and made a couplet to give to Deng Muhan and Chen Hè: "Deng Shiye spoke in the accounting room; Chen Hèshu lost his shoes in the cold alley" to mock them." The party members in Tokyo also regarded this as an interesting and wonderful article, elegant and humorous, and recited it for a while. As for why the Premier did not use "Chen Zi" for "Deng Shiye," it was because he recognized Chen Hè as a revolutionary comrade, not as a cook. Furthermore, the Cantonese dialect also uses "Dà Pào" to mean exaggeration without substance, and even more so to mean exaggeration and shocking. "Dà Pào" is not entirely used to describe foolish people, but Chen Hè can indeed be called "Dà Pào Hè"!"

Also, during the time I followed the Premier, Zhu never saw the Premier scolding the employees he personally employed when they did not do their job well. Even if there were mistakes, he would only explain and instruct in detail. However, there were three comrades who were rebuked for errors in military affairs and for violating the party's principles. One, during the First World War, the Premier was about to take this opportunity to overthrow the traitorous Yuan government, and at the same time, he proposed to the British and French countries to abolish the unequal treaties against our country, and then make beneficial participation in the war. Wang Jingwei was always fond of making his own decisions and could not deeply understand the Premier's grand plan. He actually wrote a booklet "The Question of Participation in the War," intending to urge our country to quickly join the war, which was extremely disapproved by the Premier. One day, Wang met with the Premier and was rejected by the Premier, and he instructed Mr. Huang Huilong to tell Wang in a reprimanding tone: "Tell him (referring to Wang) not to come to see me, get out of here quickly!" Later, Wang destroyed all his books. Second, the troops under Mr. Liu Yushan failed to defend Boluo and retreated from Shilong to Shitan. At that time, the Premier's supervising car arrived, and Mr. Ye Xiasheng, Liu's chief of staff, met the Premier in the car. The Premier greatly rebuked the army for its poor performance! President Chiang, who was then the chief of the general staff, was also extremely angry when he followed on the side. He ordered the army to retake the lost ground within two hours, otherwise, they would be punished according to military law. Ye bravely rose up and led the regiment commander Tan Shouqiao back to the battle, and finally retook Shitan, and Guangzhou was stabilized. Third, in the thirteenth year, the Yunnan army stationed in Guangdong often occupied land and collected taxes, resisting government orders. At that time, people called them arrogant soldiers and generals. One day, Zhao Chengliang, the army division commander, entered the marshal's mansion to meet the Premier and called the Premier "Mister." The Premier was displeased and rebuked him: "You are not worthy to call me 'Mister'! (All of our party members call the Premier 'Mister' without adding a surname, just like Confucius's disciples call the Master.) You are a soldier wearing a military uniform and should respect this Grand Marshal as 'Grand Marshal.'" This is especially recorded together to make history.

### The First Letter

— Lan Hui

A letter is a warmth, and I have received many warm letters of friendship; I feel that I am happy.

I once wanted to write a letter to someone I missed, but unfortunately, I was timid and lacked the courage, so the letter was never written; I just quietly sent him a meditation and blessing in the quiet of the long nights, or occasionally saw his shadow in my dreams, that unchanging shadow that remained in my memory; when I thought of that familiar shadow, I was filled with energy, and I secretly loved him, without letting anyone else know.

However, one day, I unexpectedly (and after a long time of secretly fantasizing), received his first letter, both surprised and delighted.

It was a gloomy afternoon, with fine rain drizzling all day, the soil moist and emitting a fresh scent. My fingers trembled as I held the letter, suppressing the excitement in my heart, forcing myself to guess which kind of hand had written the beautiful handwriting on the envelope; my memory clearly told me that it was his handwriting, but my heart was beating excessively with joy, a complex and contradictory feeling of hoping it was true but not daring to believe it, said that it was not his handwriting...

——If it's not his handwriting, whose handwriting is it then? …Strange, it looks so much like his handwriting! …I was bewildered, standing still, hesitating.

Finally, as if deciding my own fate, my panicked fingers quickly tore open the envelope, hastily and carefully pulling out the letter paper, fearing that I might damage the precious letter; my heart was pounding as I rushed to see the signature at the end of the letter first—it was him! It was his name! …I immediately stuffed the letter into my pocket, as if afraid it would "change" in an instant; then, as if I had stolen something and was afraid of being discovered, I hurried towards the distant fields. I had only one thought: to savor the words in the letter alone.

I disappeared into the green cornfield. The corn forest formed a small green world for me, and the rain brushed my cheeks, giving me a cool feeling. My heart was constantly thinking, busy and chaotic, and I didn't even know what I was thinking; I just felt my face burning for no reason…

Without missing a single one, my eyes searched for every word on the letter paper that would bring back my memories, and every kind word; I could not only understand all the meanings above, but even memorize the image of every word on it…

The sky above my head was still gloomy, but I began to have a mood that was brighter than a sunny day: I felt my heart gently floating up! Like a pair of nimble and skillful boats, floating in the warm sea of love; like a strong and tireless eagle, circling in the vast blue sky full of light and warmth.

Gradually, I sank into fantasy: I seemed to feel a force suddenly surging in my body, wanting to sing loudly, or run freely...

Afterwards, I really wanted to kneel down and kiss this fragrant land, and thank Heaven—how lovely this world is!

I murmured, smiling to myself, thinking of many, many things. (Copied in March, 1947)

### A Record of the Gongchuo Hall

— Lü Baihua

Those who have read "On Saving the Nation Through Transportation" all know of Mr. Ye Gongchuo, a great recluse in the city, an advanced scholar in the court, who assisted the Premier in managing finances and establishing railways, his contributions were truly great. But few know that his economic writings were the first to advocate new learning. In his early years, Mr. Ye studied at the local school and came under the tutelage of Mr. Zhang Wenda of Changsha. Mr. Zhang Wenda, when revolutionary ideas were being passed on, had a long-standing tradition. Since his interactions with the Premier, he strongly advocated that education must precede transportation, and he established seventy-five railway staff schools. Thus, Jiaotong University in Shanghai was established, and Mr. Ye served as its president. As the name suggests, it is known that Mr. Ye fostered the talent for transportation in China! When the Japanese invaders cunningly invaded China, Mr. Ye closed his door and read the "Book of Changes," comparing himself to Ji Zi in the "Ming Yi" hexagram, "suffering internal difficulties but able to maintain his will." Now, transportation friends, compelled by admiration, wishing to make some memorial, they changed the name of the workshop hall, which Mr. Ye established on the school grounds in his early years, to "Gongchuo Hall." They will enshrine Mr. Ye's staff within it. Although the avant-garde is not yet complete, the wood framework is viewable, which is also sufficient to revive decline! This is the record.

### Ode to Spring

— Lin Yongquan

Last night——

Near dusk, the sky spread out an even thicker black curtain, and a gust of wind blew in the opposite direction from usual. The earth was darkened, and the windows were closed.

Moreover, there was a power outage, and the room was also pitch black. In the blur between wakefulness and sleep, I heard many sounds outside. At first, they were rustling, then gradually chirping, and then evolving into howling and whistling. I knew it was raining. "Last night, I heard the spring rain in the small building, and tomorrow morning, apricot blossoms will be sold in the deep alley." The scenery tomorrow morning will be different.

Early in the morning, the sun poked out from the top of the small mountain in the east with its young, bright red cheeks, and I woke up. I was awakened by the intense red light, pushed awake by the irresistible vitality of youth.

Almost every day, I get up very quietly and silently, doing the things that should be done every morning. Now, there is one more procedure in my life, which is to change the water and trim the flowers, leaves, and branches of the seasonal flowers that I bought yesterday morning! Like a girl's dressing up, this takes almost half an hour. The morning sun gradually left the top of the mountain.

When I stood up from the edge of the bed and opened the window that had been closed all night, I clearly felt a group of fresh morning winds bouncing and jumping in, followed by the fragrance of rapeseed flowers in the garden, the fragrance of new buds in the forest trees, the fragrance of new grass in the meadow...all coming together in unison. And the peach blossoms, pear blossoms, and wild gardenia blossoms in the vase: the fragrance that spread throughout the house overnight mixed with those that sneaked in from outside the window, forming a formation of fragrances, a procession of fragrances.

They are too lively, even more harmonious and affectionate. They are strolling everywhere, traveling everywhere...

This is the best time for reading, so I carried my strongest joy and my favorite verses out into the courtyard, and they were still surrounding me. Were they laughing with their shoulders together? Were they scattering light smoke-like fine hair, dancing in circles and singing low-pitched songs?

This is truly happiness, truly the most precious moment in the world!

On the road, I opened my arms to the flat road flashing with white sunlight, what a comfortable breath! I further measured the road with the broadest stride, then puffed out my chest and walked into the vegetable garden with my whole body.

I knew they were still following me, accompanying me all the way. And I also saw that there were others playing and chatting everywhere, and many more were floating in from afar on the boundless fields.

Again immersing myself in the sea of rice, this sea has undergone several changes. This green, this green field that drank a night of drunkenness, is even greener. The roots and buds that have been imprisoned in the dry soil for many days began to wriggle out from the soft cakes, stretching out their arms and legs, and the verdant leaves stretched upwards into the sky and spread out to the neighboring sky with all their vitality.

Some grains—especially the gathering of boundless broad beans, each of their oval-shaped small leaves was soaked with some small shiny water liquid. They cannot yet condense into beads, so we are unwilling to call them dew. The origin is nothing more than the remnants of those fine fog networks.

But under this sunlight, under the gaze of this excessively affectionate eye; all the grains and weeds show the vitality of life, show the luxuriant vitality, because of it—the fog network left behind.

The sun gradually climbed up the higher steps.

That field of yellow flowers has already begun to be lively. I don't know when, bees and butterflies from near and far have rushed to the scene like they were hurrying to a fair. And that place has become intoxicated all day long, with unceasing songs and secret words—perhaps also mixed with some gorgeous struggles and quarrels...these, we cannot distinguish.

Those robust broad beans, in addition to using their combined physique to form a wave-like sea, also have small gray flowers dotted under each layer of flat leaves. Those flowers also form a large mass of simple, rustic, but not sweet fragrance. All the bees and butterflies also came smelling the fragrance. But mostly the small gray butterflies, which resemble the flowers and seem to have a relationship with the same race, always kiss and attach to the underside of the flower petals for a long time.

There are also those small birds, those unnamed moth-like small birds, also flying quickly and chirping on the湛green sea of grains...who knows why this is? Or do they also love this sea, have their companions been lost in the sea? Escaped to the depths of the sea…Are they searching? Calling?

The tall poplars by the side of the road, whose leaves were completely torn off by the winter wind, also protruded new buds on their dry-looking branches, like tadpoles in a pond in April, crowded beyond recognition.

Children wearing various costumes can also be seen everywhere, working together with their mothers and all the relatives, who are older but still full of spring feelings; just like some colorful small petals scattered on the ground, and one or two large flower buds and a few large leaves.

The girls always walk hand in hand, are they conveying warmth to each other? Are they making another hypothetical entrustment to each other?

The wind is coming. The fog is also gradually dispersing. The distant mountains are clearly displayed again. Please open the eyes that were just in a dream and look into the distance, is the distance also busy with spring? (Kunming Army Station, Spring, 1947)

### Four Poems on Spring Willows

— Shi Liangfu

Last year, Qingyun Books and Periodicals planned to print an enlarged edition for the New Year. The editor, Mr. Jiang Xiaoyou, urgently requested poems and paintings. I hastily wrote and sent an old work, "Spring Willows," in response. After it was published, I was honored to receive praise from Mr. Lu Mangwu and Mr. Chang, which brought me a lot of comfort. This spring, after being ill, I am sitting idle and bored, so I continued with four more poems. After careful consideration, I respectfully submit them to Mr. Jinshan for his criticism.

First Poem:
A stretch of misty water locks the pond,
A thin silk dress, a light makeup adorns.
The cuckoo cries sadly in the continuous night rain,
The spring breeze arrives first at the study hall.
Poetic sentiments sway in the gossamer,
Free spirit rushes along the official road.
Tell you, young green willows by the roadside,
The young woman in the boudoir has boundless grief!

Second Poem:
Green as mist in the sound of the cuckoo,
It is again the second month in Jiangnan.
Standing idly in front of the door, feelings lingering,
Peeking out from behind the curtain, resentment continuous.
The wind drags emerald shadows to invade the study window,
Flowers bring a pure fragrance to fall on the inkstone.
Since Mr. Jingjie ascended to immortality,
For whom does the light or heavy makeup adorn?

Third Poem:
The slender waist can barely support itself,
Emerald eyebrows lightly outlined in a painting.
Southern beauty is extraordinarily lovely,
The petite figure is as soft as wood.
A bend of water encircles the Azure Dragon reclined,
Three paths of flowers are like snow spread.
Pointing to the old Marquis residence in Wuchang,
Intolerable past events are vaguely remembered!

Fourth Poem:
Leaning on the railing on the left, next to the building on the right,
Suitable for joy, suitable for delight, truly charming and shy.
Although the beacon fire is urgent at the edge of Lianhai,
The scenery of the pavilions is still serene.
A rain does not prevent the change of old appearance,
Why do the double eyebrows lock deep sorrow?
Yesterday, someone was expected after dusk,
A crescent moon hangs above the jade梢head.

### Little Artist

— Renoir

Auguste Renoir (1847-1919) was a painter who lived in poverty throughout his life. Like Sisley, it was common for him to go three or four days without bread. However, he did not give up painting because of this, and he continued to work hard every day. Finally, he discovered the principles of Impressionism and became a major general of the Impressionist school. His works often feature figures, mostly nudes, with bright colors and soft brushstrokes. The subject and background are blended together, creating a very rich feeling. In his later years, he suffered from hemiplegia and could not stand. He lived in seclusion in Cagnes-sur-Mer in southern France, sitting in an automatic chair all day long and continuing to work. He lived to be seventy-one years old. (Lion)

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 307

— Ye Jingfeng

At the same time, he did not forget to study this young maid; although she was not very beautiful, she was not unpleasant, and she had the appearance of Kikuko in Matsushima. Her actions were very quick, and it seemed that she had received athletic training in school. What was especially noticeable was her pair of sharp and alert eyes. This time when she entered the room, while answering and speaking, she had already noticed the strange note on the floor. Tsurumi's eyes could not ignore these details.

The maid listened to Tsurumi's instructions and withdrew in less than a minute. Tsurumi's subordinate had already entered the room to pay his respects.

"Zhengyan-kun...sit down and talk!" Tsurumi had always been this casual with his subordinates, unless there were senior colleagues present.

"Captain!" This subordinate sat down uneasily, "I was late in welcoming you this morning, ten minutes late, and I came to Daoli to apologize. The young lady who came to Shanghai with you, Captain, instructed me to come back at 10:20." As he spoke, he stood up again, gave a fake salute, and formally apologized.

"Did you receive Secretary-General Yue's message?" Tsurumi meant that Zhengyan had received the news of his arrival in Shanghai.

"There were several messages, regarding the "eight" 松character, noting the Captain's and her joint actions." Zhengyan sat down again.

"Are there any other important messages?"

"The biggest news is about Commander Hasegawa Kiyoshi...the fleet under his command is about to move out."

"Oh!" Tsurumi was a little shaken. This Commander Hasegawa's fleet, naval marines, and water bomber squadron, and water mine brigade, were well-known for their bravery and ruthlessness among the various fleets. This move was a symbol of a major landing, and Tsurumi could not help but be a little shaken.

"Anything else?" Tsurumi was stunned for a moment, and pondered for a while. "Also, Song, Lan, Mei, each action team has been mobilized. From three to four o'clock this morning, two teams of team members came south by chance. Some of them are stationed in Shanghai, and some have gone to Nanjing."

Yamamoto Zhengyan is a Taiwanese mixed-race, born in Shanghai, received elementary education locally, and studied in Japan for middle school. After graduation, he entered the Telecommunications Technology College. After interning in the Northeast for two years, he was assigned to Shanghai, and has always been under the command of Tsurumi. In Tsurumi's organization, he is number "013". After arriving in Shanghai, he still used Yamamoto in terms of duties, but privately, he used the three characters Lin Zhengyan, the reason being "convenient for handling affairs." He is about the same age as Tsurumi, twenty-six or seven years old. Although his mind is not very flexible, he is very loyal to Tsurumi; and he can always move forward.

"Who did the Lan team send?" Tsurumi has always been paying attention to Doihara.

"A total of four people, three of whom are women. According to the list, the leader is "Special No. 8" Kawashima Yoshiko; so far, she has not been seen coming to the department, perhaps she has not come south at all."

"Kawashima Yoshiko!" Tsurumi repeated this name, "That is some special team outside of the Lan team—a satellite of the Lan team—that old thing is preparing for a major expansion..."

"In reality, only one man and one woman have reported, and there is also someone called Mizi, who has not been seen." Zhengyan continued his report: "Their mission seems very urgent..."

### Starting from Zhao Xiangzi's Heavy Drinking

— Bu Shu

"Dongpo Zhilin" records such a joke:

"There were two scholars who were talking about their ambitions. One said: 'The only things I lack in my life are food and sleep; when I succeed in the future, I will eat my fill and then sleep, and sleep and then eat.' The other said: 'I am different from you, I will eat and then eat, how can I have time to sleep?'"

Neither of these two scholars wants to "載通," if they can write articles, they would naturally belong to the "expressing ambition faction." One is eating and sleeping, the other is simply eating. The things are very funny, so they should only be seen as jokes.

However, there are also jokes that cannot always be seen as jokes.

"Zhao Xiangzi drank alcohol, for five days and five nights without stopping. He said to the servant: 'I am truly a noble person! I have been drinking for five days and five nights, and I am not sick at all.' You Mo said: 'Your Majesty, please work harder, you are only two days short of Zhou.' Zhou drank for seven days and seven nights, now you are five days and five nights. Xiangzi was shocked and asked You Mo: 'Then I will perish?' You Mo said: 'You will not perish.' Xiangzi said: 'I am only two days short of Zhou, why will I not perish?' You Mo said: 'Jie and Zhou perished because they met Tang and Wu. Now the world is full of Jie, and you are Zhou. Jie and Zhou are in the same era, how can they perish together? However, it is also almost over.'" (Liu Xiang: Xin Xu)

The two scholars suffered because they lacked broad knowledge, only knowing how to eat and sleep; Zhao Xiangzi was the same, drinking alcohol for five days and five nights without getting sick, so he was elated. ——He forgot that although Shang Xin could drink for seven days and seven nights, the ending was still a monarch who lost his country.

It is impossible to open up the future history by simply eating and sleeping. You Mo said: "Jie and Zhou are in the same era, how can they perish together?" In fact, it is not entirely true. There is Zhou who only knows how to drink, and there is also Jie who only knows how to kill and plunder. Jie and Zhou can also be divided into big and small, strong and weak. The annexation of various countries during the Spring and Autumn period is an example of the mutual destruction of Jie and Zhou.

I once read an essay about Auteuil, which mentioned the "historical affairs" department of France before World War II, saying:

"Countless people with poetic inspiration have devoted all their efforts to the entertainment of Parisians. At first, it was archery. Some young girls slept in hammocks, and some young men shot bullets at a target, and then the hammock fell down, and the girls screamed shrilly and fell into a rather pleasing group. From shooting to targets, these literati turned to swimming. The girls sank into the water in front of those moved Gigoers, and the young men drank Cechtuilo while sighing at those beauties covered in rain."

This was the entertainment of the French gentry in the early 1940s. Although it is not a secret of the war, it reveals the true reason for the French defeat. The behavior of the young men was naturally much more generous than Zhao Xiangzi's drinking. It is naturally much more generous than the scholars dreaming of eating and sleeping. But there are still more generous pleasures, which were invented after swimming and shooting.

"The Parisians among the Qing automobiles do not like the herdsmen's horses. The poets have found a solution. They have lowered the status of girls to be the same as汽军. A dance floor called Tcoxic-Gtgx has opened in Paris. Customers buy tickets, and the tickets give them the right to have girls. Those girls have numbers on their chests: T.G. is priced at one and a half francs. Customers can invite those young girls to dance, he can drool, sniffle, or make people smell bad: this is his right."

Swimming, shooting, automobile girl dances, these great events are all things that the French rulers of 1933 praised. They were dizzy for several years, while Hitler made guns for several午. Once something happened, the elegant and refined French army collapsed. After Paris fell, they raised the white flag, wrote elegies, and it was over. And this is another example of the mutual destruction of Jie and Zhou.

Using Jie to attack Zhou, everything is almost the same. However, Jie, who previously loved guns, will slowly start to love swimming and shooting after the world is at peace, or even invent more pleasures. The more glories there are, the more it shows that this world can still progress in "mutual destruction".

Free Talk

### The Rats of Nanchang

— You Jin

In middle school, I read the fairy tales of the blind poet Eroшенко. When he described Li Hongzhang, he said that Li Hongzhang was a nation that ate rats. I was very unfair to Li Hongzhang, because I and Li Hongzhang were fellow villagers. Because I did not eat rats, it was enough to prove that Li Hongzhang would never eat rats. I thought that the Russian's rumors were really hateful!

Later, I gradually learned that some southerners do eat rats, and this time the plague in Nanchang was caused by eating stir-fried rats.

According to reports, Mr. Li Xueqiao (from Guangdong) and his wife, both employees of the Jiangxi Provincial Audit Office, ate stir-fried rats together and died together! According to the doctor: "Usually, eating a rat is not a big deal. The rats eaten by the Li couple this time were probably not cooked thoroughly, and the bacteria were not killed. Once eaten, the bacteria invaded the lymph nodes, causing death."

The plague bacillus was discovered, and the plague spread. The number of deaths increased day by day, and Nanchang "talked about rats and changed color"!

During the Anti-Japanese War, the plague was very serious at the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang. Now it is gradually spreading from south to north and from east to west. Jiangxi did not have much plague in the past, but now it is also spreading. It is really terrible!

Of course, even if Mr. and Mrs. Li had not eaten rats, the spread of the plague would still be unstoppable, but Mr. and Mrs. Li might not have died immediately at the same time. The ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." Now, according to the situation of Mr. and Mrs. Li, we have to change it and say: "Disaster enters through the mouth, and disease comes out of the mouth." If they hadn't eaten stir-fried rats, they wouldn't have immediately caused a fatal disaster; isn't that "disaster entering through the mouth"? As for "disease coming out of the mouth", that is even more obvious. The plague was confirmed by the death of Mr. and Mrs. Li, so of course it is so-called "disease coming out of the mouth".

The desire for food and drink, the disaster of which is so severe! This is more terrible than "risking death to eat pufferfish," rather die than not eat pufferfish, which is even more terrible! Our strange and delicious nation!

### Sichuan and the People of Sichuan

— Liu Ling

Sichuan is a province with very rich products, and the people of this province often take pride in "the Land of Abundance" or "the Revival Site of the Anti-Japanese War". However, I once heard a person from another province with too deep prejudices angrily say. "Forget it, it's useless even if there are many products, the sugar is not sweet, the salt is not salty, the oranges have no orange flavor..." This is of course a near-foolish slander. No one can demand that the products of a place be good and standard in every item. I love Sichuan's Guanggan oranges, the small peanuts of Ciqikou, the ornaments and snacks of Chengdu, and that unique local sentiment.

Generally speaking, the scenery of the entire Sichuan area is very good, with mountains and rivers and lush trees. Many place names, such as Begonia Creek, Misty Rain Fort, and Red Bean Tree, can illustrate this point. In terms of language expression, knowledgeable people speak "somewhat literary", especially elegant. Beautiful women are produced, but ordinary women are short and fat - some people call them "water buckets".

I admire the eloquence of the people of Sichuan very much. Sometimes, a person with very low knowledge speaks "logically" and is quite able to justify himself. In various parts of Sichuan, there are particularly many teahouses, and business is quite prosperous. Reasoning, doing business, meeting, and eating tea摆龙阵 (idle chatter) are all carried out there. Every day, how many people sit in teahouses, talk, and pass the time.

Apart from the generally hateful profiteers and snobs, the people of Sichuan are very polite, and the concept of old morals is very deep. They are relatively conservative, greedy for small comforts, and more or less have a bit of xenophobia.

### Arts and Culture Scene

The atmosphere of translation in Chengdu is quite strong. Currently residing in Chengdu are the following literary translators: Lin Ru, the translator of "Zola's Biography"; Luo Yujun, the translator of "The Red and the Black"; as well as Luo Niansheng, Xie Wenbing, Chen Xianghe, Chen Weimo, and others, all engaged in translation work. Ms. Nei Luo Wang is a female writer who studied in France and has a deep understanding of French literature.

He Jiahuai is still recuperating in the Minsheng Sanatorium in his hometown of Yiwu. Although he is recovering from a serious illness, he has not yet fully recovered and can only barely hold a pen. The doctor advises him not to overwork his brain.

— Ziyue

The Hong Kong weekly magazine "The Masses" has recently released its eighth issue. This issue contains the full text of Song Zhi's reportage "On the Battlefield," which is quite long and only published in three installments.

— Ziyue

The culture of Guilin is extremely depressed. There is only one monthly magazine, "Jiliu," edited by the poet Ai Sen. Because the prices in Guilin are very high, publishing magazines always results in losses, and "Jiliu" is naturally no exception.

### "Pyramid"

— Feichen

An executive of an American airline discovered a giant "pyramid" in the barren mountains southeast of Xi'an, Shaanxi. The history of this "pyramid" is likely unknown to anyone at present.

Perhaps some people will once again use an "Ah Q" mentality to proclaim to others the richness of ancient China, unmatched by any culturally advanced country.

Wasn't the principle of airplanes and the invention of explosives all invented by the "yellow-faced," "queue-wearing" descendants of the Chinese people in the five-thousand-year-old ancient country?

What is one "pyramid" worth? Egypt has "pyramids," and now you see: China also has "pyramids"! Moreover, according to the report of this American airline colonel, this giant "pyramid," if compared with the Egyptian pyramids, would truly "pale in comparison." Chinese people, upon hearing this, who shouldn't be "beaming with joy"!

But sadly, the Chinese people are born both "poor" and "busy." A "pyramid" "about one thousand feet high and one thousand five hundred feet in circumference" has been buried in the barren mountains of southern Shaanxi for who knows how many ages!

If no foreign plane had flown over this "barren mountain," we would be hard-pressed to say whether this "pyramid" would be discovered even after another half-century or a century.

Blame it on our people, who have been too busy to turn around and too poor to breathe for the past fifty years. Who would care about any "pyramid"!

Now that this "rare treasure" has finally been discovered, I wonder if our poor and busy people have the leisure to do "surveying" and "archaeological" work.

### Multifaceted Musical Genius

— Ni Qiuping

Perhaps it's because I myself am incompetent, otherwise why would I find it so admirable to worship geniuses and multifaceted individuals? Such talent is not only something I find difficult to achieve, but also very astonishing. Let's talk about a few musicians and music writers:

The great musician Mozart could compose at the age of four. The recently deceased Caruso was an outstanding singer and also a sculptor. The Fascist demon Mussolini was once called the first violinist of Italy, and his literature was also very famous. The Polish politician and revolutionary giant Paderewski was a prominent pianist and composer of modern times.

The current violinists Elman, Heifetz, and Menuhin were all performing difficult musical pieces at the age of eleven or twelve. Kreisler is a long-established violinist who is also a composer. His piano and painting skills are also very good. Not only that, but he can also speak eight different languages and has a solid foundation in Greek and Latin. In addition, he is also a researcher in mathematics, philosophy, and pharmacology. This is truly versatile.

The Chinese musician Ma Sicong publicly performed the violin in Paris at the age of eleven. At that time, newspapers all over Europe used large headlines to record our glorious prodigy. Now he is a very famous composer and violinist in China. He also plays the piano very well. Ma Sihong is his younger brother, who at the age of thirteen was already performing the huge violin piece – Spanish Symphony (Latos Symphonie Espagnole). Violinist Tan Shuzhen is also an architect. He is very outstanding in sculpture and Western painting, especially in the manufacture and repair of violins, which can be considered very researched.

Someone said: "Genius and versatility are not miracles, as long as you study subjects that suit your learning and personality and do not go down the wrong path. Then there is great hope, unless there are health defects." Let's ask ourselves if we have any health defects? Which subjects or techniques are we proficient in? If we think we are too old, then we should pay attention to our children, they are the buds of genius and versatility. This not only fulfills a great responsibility to our children, but also our supreme glory.

### Record of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

The voices of two women had already launched into a fierce quarrel. He curiously walked to the small window and pushed open the two paper-covered window panels.

Outside was a small alley five or six feet wide. The alley entrance connected to the Liuhe Road outside. There were three or four households in the alley and at the end, all living in Hong Kong-style and Shanghai-style bungalows with names like "Shulu" and "Qiyuan" written on the doors. They had always been inhabited by the most comfortable people in Guilin – political dignitaries or bank managers. At this time, Old Zhu turned his face to look out and could vaguely see a large truck parked at the alley entrance. Five or six workers in the alley were moving goods and boxes, and one or two shrewd and capable guys were directing, all looking very nervous; but the loudest voices were a group of children, about four or five, some arguing and some crying, but the adults didn't care about them at all. Outside the bamboo fence gate of the garden house at the end of the alley, two women were raising their voices, arguing like fighting cocks.

"...Why didn't you leave last time? I don't care! You can't get on the car this time...!" A Ningbo-accented woman said decisively.

"Bullshit! This is the pharmacy's car, everyone can ride!" Another Tianjin-accented woman's voice was not weak either, and her shrewishness seemed to be even greater than the Ningbo woman.

"We decided a long time ago that it can't be changed!" The Ningbo woman immediately retorted. "We asked you to leave last time; this time it's the second car, and it was agreed that it would only take our family. No one else can even think about getting on the car!"

The Tianjin woman seemed to feel she was in the wrong, and paused slightly.

"Are you being unreasonable?" She launched a preemptive strike. "The situation is so tense today, do you want our family of four to die in Guilin?"

"Hmph, am I being unreasonable?" The other woman sneered. "Why didn't you take us with you when you left last time? Now it's our turn, and you want to take over! It's absolutely impossible! Even if your Mr. Zhang comes, he has to be reasonable. Who said that last time?"
