### Important Topics of the Fourth Plenary Session: Eradicating Corruption and Reforming Politics; President Chiang Returns to Nanjing to Preside Over the Opening

[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng told this agency that the important items on the agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session include political and economic reforms and the eradication of corruption. However, these reform plans are not the result of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China. The Kuomintang's reforms were planned long ago and will be temporarily limited to reforming local administration. Wu also emphasized that the National Government will not change its fundamental policy of cooperating with the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties to implement national construction plans. He also called on Kuomintang members to support the party merger plan to establish a united revolutionary front to cope with the current difficulties. Wu also said that at the Fourth Plenary Session, party members will thoroughly discuss and adopt measures to eradicate corrupt practices.

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Senior officials said that the Kuomintang's Fourth Plenary Session will decide on a major party purge, including some senior party members and government officials. Those who are disloyal to the party headquarters and the government, those who are demonstrably corrupt, and those whose public and private behavior disgrace the party's reputation will be subject to expulsion. The targets of the purge are not factions within the party, but only individual party members. The names of senior party members who have been accused will not be announced for the time being. According to Kuomintang rules, the accusation procedure should be initiated by the local party headquarters and then reviewed by the Central Supervisory Committee.

However, no final decision has been made yet. At today's meeting, Chiang Ching-kuo reported on the process of handling the general review of corps members and youth issues and provided many suggestions. After the report, the issue of unified party corps organization was discussed. At the afternoon meeting, the "Draft Outline for Kuomintang Reform" was discussed, and speakers were very enthusiastic. However, the general opinion was that the案 was too vague and did not specify concrete measures for personnel and systems, how to achieve reform in the future, national unification, and suppressing bandits. It should be resubmitted for review and reorganization.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 7th] Central Committee member Chen Bulei is currently planning to stay in the mountains temporarily because his health has not yet recovered and will not go to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session.

Mr. Chen concluded: In the future, the central idea of ​​journalists should be to recognize that China's future is bright and hopeful. Although there are unsatisfactory aspects due to various relationships, it should also be regarded as an inevitable process in the course of a certain undertaking, but we should overcome various difficulties and enhance the self-confidence and enterprising spirit of the people in the country and the nation. The reporter also asked about the Ministry of Interior's recent opinion on defining the identity of journalists. Mr. Chen said: This should be strictly regulated and self-eliminated to improve one's own identity.

China imported 800,000 bales of cotton last year, and this year's import is likely to be less than this number.

### Singapore's Various Aspects

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang

A Follow-up to the South Seas Inspection by China Airlines Plane, Part 3

The citizens of Shanghai are worried every day about the soaring prices, the surging labor unrest, and the surge in wages. If they knew that the situation in Singapore was several times more serious than in Shanghai, perhaps they would feel a little relieved! For example, taking rice as an example, in Singapore, the price of each picul of rice is 140 Singapore dollars, which, according to the current exchange rate, is 70 US dollars per picul, which is about seven times higher than the price of rice in Shanghai. However, the salaries of ordinary wage earners are not seven times higher than those of Shanghai people. The average salary of an office worker is about 300 Singapore dollars. In Singapore, such a salary is considered good. According to a compatriot told the reporter, the most economical life in Singapore also requires 500 Singapore dollars, or 250 US dollars. Thus, the plight of wage earners there can be imagined.

However, the treatment of Singapore workers is relatively superior. After the war, various occupational unions sprang up like mushrooms after rain. According to local statistics, in the new city with a population of approximately 950,000, approximately 270 unions have been established. The entire labor movement in Singapore is commanded by the Malayan Communist Party ("MCP") under the leadership of a certain overseas Chinese communist, Zhang Mingjin. Almost every union in Singapore has communist infiltration, and it is almost hopeless for many industrialists to prevent cyclical strikes from occurring in their factories.

According to a certain industry leader told the reporter that the average wage of unskilled workers is 5 Singapore dollars per day, equivalent to 2.5 US dollars. This number seems to be very considerable compared with the general wages in Shanghai. However, the locals say it takes a lot of effort to balance the monthly income and expenditure.

Looking at the overall economic picture of Singapore, it feels that all industries are in recession and the post-war reconstruction work is progressing slowly. The economic structure of Singapore is mostly based on rubber, but in the world market, the price of rubber has fallen from the original 45 US cents per pound to 29 US cents per pound. According to people in the local rubber industry, the cost of producing each pound of rubber is about 39 US cents, so they have to lose some money for every pound of rubber they sell. The fall in rubber prices reflects the entire economic situation in Malaya. You can meet people frowning and sighing everywhere.

In addition to the fall in rubber prices, the war in the Dutch East Indies has also greatly affected Singapore's transshipment industry. Singapore has always imported large quantities of rubber, sugar, and rice from the Dutch East Indies, and supplied various manufactured goods to the Indonesian market. However, as a result of the Dutch blockade of Indonesian ports, import and export trade has almost completely stagnated. Within the area of ​​the Republic of Indonesia, although small-scale private smuggling trade is still going on, most of the danger is too great to arouse the interest of legitimate businessmen.

In conjunction with the British Empire's policy of preserving foreign exchange reserves, the Singapore authorities recently stopped issuing import licenses to various currency regions. This does not mean that you can get American-made products smuggled into Singapore via Hong Kong. But generally speaking, in the past few months, Singapore's import and export industries have slightly seen a trade surplus. From January to May of this year, the total amount of imports was 581,000,000 Singapore dollars, and the total amount of exports was 569,000,000 Singapore dollars. During the same period, Singapore's exports to the United States totaled 158,000,000 Singapore dollars, and imports from the United States were only 37,500,000 Singapore dollars, resulting in a dollar trade surplus.

The high cost of living, the corrupt atmosphere left over from the Japanese occupation, and the British inability to establish a highly efficient administrative agency, these factors combined to create a widespread phenomenon of corruption in the colonial government. According to compatriots, the "extortion" behavior of government officials is commonplace. Malays want a clean government, and this hope was not very bright before the war, but now it seems even dimmer.

Let me give an example to illustrate the extortion behavior of Singapore officials. According to government regulations, citizens must first obtain approval from the authorities and obtain a vehicle purchase permit when they need to purchase a car. However, in fact, a Singapore resident can walk into the sales room of any car company and get a car without applying for a permit. According to local residents, there are many ways to obtain a permit, and the cost of each is 600 to 1,000 Singapore dollars.

Politically speaking, Singapore can be regarded as one of the most important communist hubs in the entire Southeast Asia region. The Communist Party was banned before the war. During the Japanese occupation, they organized a strong anti-Japanese organization under the banner of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Part of the organization's military supplies was supplied by the British, and part was seized from the Japanese army. In northern Malaya, it is said that the former guerrillas still carry weapons.

The "MCP" openly operates in various parts of the New Island, and the leader of the headquarters is a Chinese. It is said that "the first communist" is directly ordered by Moscow and is responsible for directing all communist activities in the South China Sea region.

At the same time, due to unrestricted political activities in Malaya

Singapore has become a battleground for our country's domestic politics. The pro-Kuomintang and anti-Kuomintang factions in Singapore are fiercely opposed to each other, and their relationship is getting deeper and deeper. Last year, during the Double Tenth National Day, there was a celebration of opposition. Recently, during the Confucian birthday memorial ceremony, the pro-Kuomintang and anti-Kuomintang factions again took different actions.

Recently, the British immigration authorities refused to renew the passport of a Soviet purchasing agent stationed in Singapore. The purchasing agent had purchased large quantities of rubber and other products from several Chinese commercial banks. According to unconfirmed rumors, the Soviet purchasing agent secretly provided local communists with financial assistance through trading activities. Many people say that although his passport has been revoked, he has not left Singapore, but others say that he has gone to Hong Kong.

### Alxa League of Inner Mongolia: An Oasis in the Desert; Rich in Resources and Important in National Defense

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 7th] The Alxa League is one of the special leagues in Inner Mongolia. Administratively, it does not belong to the league, but is directly under the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. The league has an area of approximately 1,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 60,000. They live a nomadic life and are honest and kind. There has never been any fighting. If there are no strong neighbors, it is truly a "Shangri-La" on the northwestern grasslands. The seat of the league government is Dingyuanying, which is lined with trees and has a beautiful environment. It is an oasis in the desert. Because its buildings are mostly imitated from Beiping, it is known as "Little Beijing." When the reporter went to investigate, he paid attention to the league's culture, education, and economy. Now I will briefly describe the impressions I gained for the reference of those who care about the border areas:

Alxa League currently has a national experimental primary school, a league-established experimental primary school, and a Mongolian language tutoring school, a total of three schools, all located in Dingyuanying. Each school has more than 400 students. The first two are complete primary schools and also enroll Mongolian and Tibetan children. In addition to teaching ordinary courses, they also teach Mongolian. The latter is purely for Mongolian people and school-age children among lamas who are not familiar with Mandarin and do not know Mongolian. Therefore, when teaching, both Mongolian and Chinese are equally emphasized. After graduating in four years, they are inserted into complete primary schools according to their level and continue to study. The league's Zasak Darizaya is the most enlightened among the princes of Inner Mongolia. The compulsory education he implemented has achieved considerable success. It is said that they plan to establish a middle school next year so that Mongolian children can study in depth. However, they feel that there is not enough talent and hope that all parties will provide assistance. In addition, there is the Alxa League Briefing, which is directly affiliated with the Central Party and is the only lithographic newspaper in the league. It copies the concise news from the Central Broadcasting Station every day and publishes and distributes it in Mongolian and Chinese. It sells 300 copies a day. In addition to being read by the 6,000 residents of Dingyuanying, it is also distributed to important locations within the league.

In terms of economy, when it traded with Outer Mongolia in the past, Dingyuanying's commerce was once very prosperous. Later, the relationship with Outer Mongolia was severed, and commerce gradually declined. However, the league's abundant products are better than other leagues in Inner Mongolia. The economic future is promising. The league currently has approximately 7-800,000 sheep, more than 100,000 camels, and more than 10,000 horses. The average annual output of wool and camel hair is more than one million catties. The licorice and musk produced are of secondary importance. In terms of minerals, there are coal, salt, alkali, etc. Because coal and alkali are not in great demand, the output is not large. The output of salt is relatively large, but it is only a thousand dans per year. There are a total of thirteen salt lakes in the league, with the Jilantai Pond, which has been mined, being the largest, reaching more than 200 Chinese miles in circumference and approximately one zhang and five chi in depth. The salt produced is not only white and delicious, but can also be dug up this year and regenerated next year. It is truly an inexhaustible treasure.

In terms of the current situation, Alxa League is already one of the most advanced leagues among the forty-nine leagues in Inner Mongolia. However, from a national defense point of view, all its measures still need to make the greatest efforts. Alxa League and Outer Mongolia have a border area of 400 Chinese miles. Because the league produces so many special products, its economic value is very great, so it also increases the importance of its national defense status. At this time when the Outer Mongolian army is invading our Xinjiang, I hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to it.

### Deng Wenyi Discusses the Military Situation in the North

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] News Agency reports: Deng Wenyi, who recently returned from an inspection tour of the Northeast and North China, stated: (1) Regarding the military situation of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Army, since the Communist bandits launched five offensives and failed one after another, the strength of the Communist bandits is far inferior to before. Their elite troops and cadres have suffered heavy losses. Although their total force is claimed to be close to 300,000, only half of them can be used on the battlefield. The so-called sixth offensive may be difficult to launch recently, and even if it is launched, it will encounter more serious setbacks. On the side of the National Army, due to the complete victory in the Shandong battle, the National Army has successively entered the customs to reinforce, and its strength has doubled. At the same time, due to the National Government's order for general mobilization, the dispatch of troops is justified, and the people are obedient. The National Army's treatment has been improved since August, and the Northeast Headquarters has been reorganized to strictly rectify military discipline. As a result, the military's prestige and morale have been greatly boosted. Judging from the current situation, with a little more time, it will not be difficult for the Northeast bandit suppression to follow the Shandong bandit suppression and achieve a decisive victory. (2) The military situation in the North has also changed in the past two months. Liu Bocheng's main bandit force has moved far away from Hebei, and most of it has been annihilated by the National Army. Although a part of Chen Yi's remnant bandits fled north of the Yellow River, they are at the end of their strength. Recently, the National Army has swept away the bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area. Although Rong Zhen's bandit troops still claim to have 100,000 people, their main force is only three columns, about 50,000 to 60,000 people, in the Baoding and Shimen areas in the northern section of Pinghan. They are fleeing east and west, trying to escape the encirclement of the National Army. Once the main force of the National Army is concentrated, they will inevitably repeat the disastrous defeat in Jining and Zhangjiakou around October last year. (3) The political, economic, and social situation in North China has improved and stabilized compared to several months ago. Price increases are not as rapid as before, and people's hearts are more stable. The victory of the Shandong National Army and the stability of the Northeast military situation have had a great impact on North China.

### Three Principles Determined for Developing the Northeast Economy, No Conscription Allowed in Newly Recovered Areas for Six Months

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] In order to develop the Northeast economy, prosper industry and commerce, and regulate people's livelihood issues, the Headquarters convened relevant parties for discussion and decided on three principles: (1) Simplify loan procedures, (2) Connect the currency systems inside and outside the customs, and the legal currency is determined to go out of the customs, (3) Regulate the supply of materials and pay attention to the needs of the people.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the strengthening of administrative efficiency by the provincial and municipal governments in the unrecovered areas, three principles have been determined.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 7th] Chu Xichun will temporarily serve as the chief counselor of the Northeast Headquarters. After completing his mission, he will return to Datong.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The Northeast Military Service Review Conference was held at the Headquarters at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th. Director Chen attended and presided over the meeting and gave four instructions on the spot: (1) No conscription is allowed in the newly recovered areas within six months, (2) Returning righteous people from the Communist areas are not allowed to be conscripted before they are formally naturalized, (3) Conscription will be suspended for two months from now during the current autumn harvest season. (4) Strictly crack down on the practice of forcibly recruiting soldiers by miscellaneous units, and no regular troops are allowed to recruit soldiers on their own.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th] The Qinghai-Xinjiang Border Region and Qaidam Industrial and Mining Resources Survey Team of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was previously obstructed by the Kazakhs on the way to their destination and returned to Dunhuang. Now, after Commissioner Jin of the Gansu-Qinghai-Xinjiang Border Region Office negotiated with the Kazakhs, an understanding has been reached. The team departed again on the 1st of this month. Because winter is approaching and the climate in the border area is bitterly cold, in order to seize the time, it has been divided into two routes. The western route is led by Zhou Zongjun and will still follow the original route along the Altun Mountains. The eastern route is led by Lu Bingxiang and will take the route south of the Qilian Mountains to enter the northwestern edge of the Qaidam Basin. The former focuses on petroleum and geological meteorology. The latter focuses on general industrial and mining resources. In addition, Yin Zanxun, Director of the Paleontology Research Office of the Central Geological Survey Institute, has now led eight staff members to join the team to collect specimens and conduct research in the Qilian Mountains.

### Cultural Circles' Association for Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the Nation Rejects the Absurd Theories of Tail-Following Elements, New Imperialism Uses Communist Bandits as Tools of Aggression, Suppressing Rebellion is Actually a Revolutionary Task

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The General Mobilization Association of Chinese Cultural Circles for Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the Nation issued a declaration to refute the absurd theories of tail-following Communist bandits. It first explained the reason for the organization of the association, which is to mobilize cultural workers and mobilize human and material resources to complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and saving the nation. It then pointed out that some people in the cultural circles, in newspapers and publications, opposed their so-called civil war and called for their so-called peace, claiming to be neutral and using democracy and freedom as an excuse, regarded suppressing rebellion as internal strife and party struggle, and carried out extensive counter-propaganda.

These absurd theories are even more unfortunate events in cultural mobilization and the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation. The declaration then took the position of clearing up Liao's arguments and upholding justice to criticize the counter-propaganda that hindered the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation: "Everyone knows that old imperialism invaded China by using warlords as tools, and new imperialism invaded China by using Communist bandits as tools. Therefore, Communist bandits are traitors, and suppressing rebellion is saving the nation. How can suppressing rebellion be referred to as a simple civil war? To be honest, suppressing rebellion is a war to resist aggression and protect independence, and it is also a war to eliminate separatism, consolidate unity, uphold the constitution, complete democracy, oppose destruction, and expand construction. In all respects, suppressing rebellion is indeed a revolutionary task. Is it not the final battle of the National Revolution of the past fifty years? Of course, revolution is also a civil war, but it must not be confused with the so-called civil war in general. It is obvious that it is not a party struggle. Some people use the fact that Special Envoy Wedemeyer pointed out that the people need peace to oppose the so-called civil war, but they do not know that needing peace is one thing, and how to seek peace is another. When peaceful methods fail, there is no other way but war. Therefore, war and peace have the wonderful effect of being opposite and complementary to each other. Moreover, calling for peace during the suppression of rebellion is tantamount to calling for peace during the final battle of the National Revolution of the past fifty years, which is actually a kind of reactionary behavior.

Yes, the so-called "opposing civil war" is actually to advocate for aggression, separatism, and destruction, to hinder constitutional government, and to oppose independence, unity, democratic construction, which obviously stands on the side of the Communist bandits and traitors. How can it be said to be neutral? The Communist bandits and traitors are mobilizing in their so-called "liberated areas," while "opposing civil war" under the rule of the government means that only Communist bandits and traitors are allowed to make trouble and sell out the country, and the government is not allowed to suppress rebellion and save the nation. Therefore, "opposing civil war" only under the rule of the government is actually the tail of the Communist bandits and traitors, the fifth column of the fifth column, which is by no means a neutral element, but a disguised neutral element. The Communist bandits and traitors hold their violence and willingly act as henchmen, striving to create unrest and having no atmosphere of a peaceful and legitimate political party. They cannot be treated with leniency and freedom. In particular, it should be made clear that freedom of speech cannot be used as a shield for partiality towards the Communist bandits and traitors, while suppressing rebellion against riots, traitors, and unrest is needed by democracy. This is a very important point. Can all of this not explain the mistake of that group in the cultural circles who claim to be neutral, and who use democracy and freedom as an excuse to regard suppressing rebellion as a civil war and a natural struggle, and who call for their so-called peace? We hope that they will have some understanding of the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation and make some efforts, otherwise the entire cultural circles cannot tolerate it, and the entire people cannot tolerate it either." Finally, the declaration called on cultural circles in various places to pay close attention to the tails of the Communist bandits and traitors and correct their absurd theories. It also stated that since the government has passed the General Mobilization Plan for Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the Nation, it cannot be without responsibility. Since the Communist bandits and traitors are facing the government with weapons on the front line, how can the government allow their tails to work for the Communist bandits and traitors in the rear to undermine the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation?

### Australia Donates Rubber Tree Seeds and Seedlings to China

[Central News Agency, Canberra, 6th] The Australian Forest Timber Bureau has provided China with substantial assistance in forestry in the past four years.

According to the Bureau's reply, the rumor that a certain type of rubber tree is indeed true, but it is not suitable for the climate of Nanjing. However, the Bureau will send three kinds of fast-growing rubber tree seeds and 15 seedlings to Nanjing. The Bureau will also send several of its publications to the Chinese National Forestry Experimental Institute at its request and will also donate 18 kinds of rubber trees for planting experiments throughout China.

### Tianjin Police Bureau Cracks a Major Bribery Case Involving a Russian, the Embezzled Money Totals $30,000

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] The Tianjin Police Bureau recently cracked a case of a person bribing with a huge sum of money. The embezzled money amounted to 30,000 US dollars. 18,000 US dollars have been handed over, and all the criminals in the case have been arrested and are being strictly interrogated. The manager of the Dalu Oil Factory at No. 4 Lingnan Road, Tenth District, Tianjin, a Russian named David Guriewidis, was arrested by the police for supplying military supplies to the Japanese enemy. His brother, Elford, and his friend Solomon Pediretti colluded with the Chinese Chen Jialan and colluded with Wang Yuguo, the prosecutor of the East Station of the Police Bureau, to bribe the Police Bureau with 30,000 US dollars in US dollars to release the arrested David. After Police Chief Li learned of this, he initially pretended to accept the bribe and accepted 10,000 US dollars on the 3rd.

Editorial

### US Diplomacy and the United Nations Organization

In a speech delivered to the Brazilian Senate and House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, President Truman pointed out that the difficulties of post-war world peace were even greater than generally expected, but he believed they could be resolved. He also stated that the United Nations organization is indeed a powerful combination for the sake of the world's common peace and welfare, and although it has encountered various difficulties, the United States will never be discouraged by this. The United States will use all its resources to support the United Nations organization and ensure that it completes its mission. President Truman's words are, in fact, clichés that we have long been familiar with from the mouths of ordinary diplomats and do not contain any novel elements. However, in today's volatile international situation, the United Nations organization has repeatedly encountered serious tests, and its effectiveness in maintaining world peace and promoting human happiness remains a question. President Truman's speech at this time, calling on all countries of the world to unanimously support the United Nations organization, has special significance and is particularly worthy of our attention.

The second session of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the 16th of this month at Lake Success and will discuss the issue of whether permanent members of the Security Council should have the right of veto. This issue not only involves the amendment of the United Nations Charter but also has a great bearing on the true effectiveness of the United Nations organization. All countries in the world attach great importance to this session of the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also personally led a delegation to Lake Success to participate in the United Nations General Assembly. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and gave a speech to the press, frankly stating China's position and attitude towards the United Nations organization. He said, "Although the Chinese government has some doubts about the possibility of amending the Charter at present, it is fully prepared to respect the majority opinion of the General Assembly on the reasonable interpretation of the veto power in the Charter, in order to restrict its use. When the San Francisco Conference passed the United Nations Charter in 1945, the four countries that convened the conference, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, issued a joint interpretation on this matter. When necessary, the Chinese government intends to support the proposal to change that interpretation." From this, it can be seen that the Chinese government can not only consistently support the United Nations organization to the end but also respect the opinions of the majority of countries in the United Nations General Assembly at any time and amend the Charter or make other interpretations. Therefore, there is no question that China will fully support the United Nations organization, but today's question is whether the United Nations organization should avoid disappointing its supporters.

The United States sincerely hopes that the United Nations organization can fulfill its responsibilities and will do its utmost to support it and make it the most effective organization for maintaining world peace. No one can doubt this. However, there are still bound to be errors in the policies and common will of the United States, which could lead to major mistakes in the future. Therefore, we must point them out clearly for the reference of the US diplomatic authorities and hope that they can reflect on themselves and correct them at any time.

The United Nations organization was born at a time when the war was about to end. At that time, far-sighted political diplomats had already seen that it was not difficult for the United Nations to win a military victory. However, immediately after the end of the war, creating world peace was the most difficult task. Therefore, while the war was still going on, a conference was held in San Francisco and a United Nations Charter was passed as the basis for creating world peace after the war. Unexpectedly, after the end of the war, although the United Nations General Assembly repeatedly convened meetings in London and New York, it has not yet been able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the United Nations organization. Although peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria have been successfully signed, peace treaties with Germany and Austria have not yet been drafted, and even the peace treaty with Japan has not yet begun to be drafted, which inevitably makes people feel that peace is even more distant. Whether for its own interests or for the responsibility it bears for world peace, the United States should step up its efforts, support the United Nations organization, and promote the realization of peace. This Pan-American Conference, under the auspices of the United States, finally led to the establishment of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. The peace and security of the Western Hemisphere have already been greatly guaranteed as a result of this, which cannot be regarded as a major success of American diplomacy. However, under the current international relations, whether it is peace or war, it is indivisible. The United States can only achieve self-preservation, or only guarantee the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere. If the peace and security of Europe or the Far East are not guaranteed, then the United States will still have no peace to speak of, and the United Nations organization cannot play its role. We believe that the US diplomatic authorities must see the current world situation very clearly. Not to mention that today's Europe is still in turmoil, today's Asia also harbors all kinds of terrible factors that are sufficient to become a source of future international chaos. However, judging from the US diplomatic measures, the United States still does not abandon the approach of "Europe First, Far East Second." The Truman Doctrine has long been implemented in Europe, sparing no expense to assist Greece and Turkey in resisting the intrusion of foreign forces. The large-scale aid to Europe plan will also soon become a reality. However, the United States is still hesitating about the Far East, not knowing where to go. Although it knows that the seriousness of the situation in the Far East is no less than that in Europe, it ultimately feels hesitant and is unwilling to promote the Truman Doctrine in the Far East. Even some shortsighted people in the United States advocate supporting defeated countries as a stabilizing force in the Far East. This erroneous view will not only mislead the countries of the Far East, but the United States will eventually suffer the consequences!

In short, although the United States is now striving to promote the functions of the United Nations organization, judging from the diplomatic policies it has implemented, there are many places that run counter to its original intentions. For the sake of peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the future of the United Nations organization, we must point out the errors of American diplomatic policy and hope that American diplomatic policy will be corrected as soon as possible!

### US Suggests Four-Power Consultation on Korean Political Situation; Soviet Government Refuses to Accept; Also Disagrees with US Proposal to Establish Provisional Assembly Separately

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] TASS announced today a statement by the Soviet government completely rejecting the US proposal for the US, Soviet Union, China and Britain to discuss the Korean issue, and also disagrees with the proposal to establish a provisional assembly separately in the north and south of Korea. The Soviet Union's reply to the US was submitted in the name of Foreign Minister Molotov on the 4th of this month, stating: The US-Soviet Mixed Commission has not yet exhausted its wisdom and capabilities, and the US suggestion to England, China and the Soviet Union to hold a four-power conference to discuss the Korean issue is a unilateral action. The reply also reiterated the Soviet view that the US representative is to blame for the US-Soviet Mixed Commission's failure to reach an agreement. The US proposal only serves to strengthen the division between the north and south of Korea, and the current key is to organize a provisional unified government by all democratic elements in Korea.

[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio reported that Molotov rejected the US proposal to convene a meeting of the four powers in Washington on September 8 to negotiate the stalemate in the Soviet-American occupied zones of Korea. The broadcast stated that Molotov addressed a note to Marshall on September 4, stating that the US proposal was not appropriate because the US-Soviet Mixed Commission had not exhausted its efforts to draft a completely appropriate proposal. Molotov's reply was in response to a note from Acting Secretary of State Lovett. Lovett requested the convening of a four-power conference because the US-Soviet Mixed Commission had failed to implement the Moscow Conference's agreement on Korea.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] MacArthur's May report on the activities of the Korean military government stated that the people of South Korea continue to strengthen their transitional democratic system, as the Korean Legislative Assembly has been engaged in formulating various measures to expand universal suffrage. The report announced that 18,889 refugees moved into South Korea from North Korea in April, 1,149 moved in from Northeast China, and four moved in from inland China. The report also stated that trade with China is conducted by ship and barter, and the market in Hong Kong is also forming.

### Vietnamese Governor Will Announce Armistice Conditions; Glimmer of Hope for French-Vietnamese Peace; Hong Kong Becomes Negotiation Center for Both Sides

[Reuters, 7th] Vietnamese Governor Bollaert made a peace proposal from the French government to the Viet Minh on Saigon Radio on Wednesday night, which included major concessions, including the following: (1) Accept Ho Chi Minh's previous request that France allow the Viet Minh complete independence one year after the signing of peace; (2) Retract the previous statement denying the Viet Minh's right to secede from the French Union; (3) Completely exempt the Viet Minh from the obligation to compensate France for losses; (4) Release all Viet Minh political prisoners.

It is reported that Ho Chi Minh's representative has flown to Hong Kong to meet with the Vietnamese Governor's representative. The hope for an early resumption of peace has never been stronger than this time in recent months. Although there has been no disclosure of Ho Chi Minh's possible reaction to the French proposal, Viet Minh underground personnel here expect the Viet Minh radio station to announce Ho Chi Minh's acceptance on Thursday, so a truce agreement may be signed as early as the weekend.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 7th] On the eve of Vietnamese Governor Bollaert's broadcast of the French peace proposal to the Viet Minh, Hong Kong has become the center of negotiations between the two sides. It is reported that three senior members of the Viet Minh and the representative of Vietnamese Governor Bollaert arrived in Hong Kong today, and they will begin negotiations with former Annam Emperor Bao Dai tomorrow.

### Next Session of the Far East Economic Commission to Be Held in the Philippines in November

[Reuters, Manila, 7th] The next session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is tentatively scheduled to be held in Baguio, Philippines, on November 15, after the Philippine general election.

### British, French, and Australian Reduction of Imports Affects US Industry

[United Press, London, 6th] According to a survey today, the US industry has lost no less than one billion US dollars in transactions due to the recent decisions by Britain, France, and Australia to reduce imports. The goods that the three countries decided to stop purchasing are all urgently needed, but due to the reduction in the supply of US dollars, they must be saved as US dollars for purchasing necessities. France decided to save 250 million US dollars in the next six months, and Australia decided to reduce imports by 40 million US dollars each year. Most of these savings are on the US side, but smaller gold standard countries will also be affected, especially Canada.

### US Response to Gold Allocation Proposal is Cold

[United Press, Washington, 6th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal that the United States should redistribute the gold at Fort Knox, although it is fresh news today, has not changed the US's cold attitude towards this proposal. According to London, Bevin's argument is that the United States should increase the US dollar value of its huge gold reserves so that it can use this "surplus" to aid Europe without directly increasing the tax burden of American taxpayers. The government said that this is another invitation to ask the United States to borrow money and give gifts. US Treasury Secretary Snyder recently denied any intention to change the price of gold to 35 US dollars per ounce, so the Treasury Department will definitely oppose this. In any case, changing the price of gold must be approved by Congress, and there is no such intention in Congress at present.

### To Avoid Paying a Greater Price, the United States Must Accelerate Aid to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The State Department agreed on the 6th to accelerate the implementation of Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Neal, Acting Director of the International Trade Policy Division of the State Department, broadcast a statement from the State Department tonight, saying: "We believe that the timetable for the Marshall Plan must be advanced so that Europe can receive aid before the end of this year."

Neal also said that many European countries, such as Britain, France, and Italy, are in serious situations. Although Neal did not say that a special session of Congress must be convened to advance aid to Europe, he said, "Congress is scheduled to reconvene in January next year, so it is difficult to expect action before spring. However, if European countries cannot import coal and food this winter, the situation will inevitably become critical." Neal also strongly stated that the United States is determined to do its best to help Europe. From a moral point of view, the United States cannot just sit idly by and watch it collapse or watch its people starve to death simply because other countries do not have the money to purchase reconstruction materials. From an economic point of view, the United States cannot sit idly by and watch its huge production facilities collapse simply because of a lack of capital. From a political point of view, the United States cannot allow right-wing or left-wing dictatorships to grow under the lack of assistance. In short, the United States' refusal to provide assistance will actually cost more than providing assistance.

[United Press, Detroit, 7th] The president of the Automobile Workers' Congress of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of the United States, Luces, requested on the 7th that President Truman convene a special session of Congress and proposed to immediately restore the control of prices of food and other major items. In a letter to the President, Luces warned that if Congress convenes a special session to intensify action on the European economic crisis, it must also take action on the "domestic economic crisis."

### France Will Apply to the US Export-Import Bank for a New Loan of 500 Million US Dollars; France's Reduction of Bread Rationing Causes Disturbances Throughout the Country

[United Press, Paris, 6th] Well-informed sources said today that the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, will return to office next week, and the cabinet has ordered him to apply to the US Export-Import Bank for a loan of 500 million US dollars to tide over the difficulties until the Marshall Aid Plan takes effect. This is the second time in months that France has applied to the Export-Import Bank for a loan. The first application was for 500 million US dollars, and the result was 250 million US dollars. France needs money to buy food, gasoline, and wheat. The bread ration has been reduced by two ounces again, causing disturbances throughout the country. Yesterday, 150,000 workers marched in Paris to protest the reduction of bread rationing, shouting slogans such as "Ramadier resigns" and "Ramadier to the guillotine." At the same time, Prime Minister Ramadier won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly yesterday and is reportedly drafting broad administrative, financial, and budgetary measures to reorganize the interior.

### Fort Knox Vault; Door Weighs Over 40,000 Pounds; Stores 12,000 Tons of Gold

[United Press, Washington, 6th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent sudden proposal that the United States should redistribute the gold at Fort Knox, the world's largest gold reserve, has thus reappeared in the news. What exactly Bevin meant, how this plan will be implemented, and what benefits it will bring are all a big secret. Reporters and another United Press reporter spoke with US Treasury Department personnel and private economists for hours, but no one knew for sure what Bevin meant. However, the people's curiosity about the large storage of 12,000 tons of gold in Kentucky has been aroused again because of Bevin's proposal. In fact, the gold at Fort Knox is only a part of the US gold reserves. The total value of gold used by countries around the world as currency reserves is about 38 billion US dollars, of which 21.8 billion US dollars belong to the United States. And about 12.5 billion US dollars are stored in a heavily guarded vault at Fort Knox. This gold is all melted into gold bars, each only six inches long and weighing about 27 and a half pounds, with an estimated 829,000 pieces stored in it. The vault is divided into two floors, one underground and one on the ground. The door of the vault weighs over 40,000 pounds. The US government built this vault for storage in 1946 because it had too much gold in storage.

### Truman's Outing in Brazil Suffers False Alarm; Car Wheel Comes Off and is Only Inches Away from Cliff

[United Press, Brazilian Capital, 6th] President Truman's visit to Brazil has lasted six days and is about to return to the United States. Today, he and several others rode in a large open White House black car to climb the mountain for lunch at the home of Brazilian businessman Fontes. On the way, the car wheel suddenly slipped off and almost had an accident. However, Truman remained calm and smiled and asked reporters and photographers to help push the car back so that they could continue. Reporters saw that the left rear wheel of the car was resting on the curb, only two feet away from the cliff, which can be said to be extremely dangerous.

### Political Situation in Eastern European Countries is Confusing and Unpredictable; British and American Policies are Inconsistent; US Dislikes Britain's Policy Towards the Soviet Union Having Too Much Appeasement Color

[United Press, Vienna, 6th] United Press reporter Roberts reported that diplomatic observers have found that the differences between Britain and the United States on policies towards Eastern European countries are deepening, which allows the Soviet Union to take advantage of this rift to develop its plan from the Balkans to the Baltic Sea. For weeks, British and American diplomats stationed in Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been making relentless accusations against each other.

The reporter has repeatedly met with British and American diplomats during his six weeks in Eastern Europe and has gained the impression that the British think that the Americans often take irresponsible actions, while the Americans feel that Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union has too much appeasement. The British are particularly dissatisfied with the fact that some American political and military representatives often discuss the inevitability of war with the Soviet Union. Rumors that war is about to break out in Eastern Europe are spreading daily, and conservatives especially hope that the United States will rise up to "stop" the Soviet Union. After Bulgarian opposition leader Peterkov was sentenced to death, there were widespread rumors in Sofia that the United States would invade Bulgaria within a week. In addition to protesting the unfairness of the Hungarian elections and Peterkov's execution, the British representative did not take a second step. Non-official British sources estimate that the number of fraudulent votes in the general election did not exceed 200,000, which is not enough to change the result. Vienna reported that Britain and the United States have stopped exchanging political intelligence, especially information about refugees fleeing from Soviet-controlled countries. The obvious sign of the divergence of opinions between Britain and the United States is that the countries under the wings of the Communist Party have a more enthusiastic attitude towards Britain than before, and Britain also hopes to establish trade relations with these countries quickly.

### Trial of Japanese War Criminals Will Enter a New Stage

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Allied trial of Hideki Tojo and his 24 war co-conspirators is likely to enter a new stage this week, most likely next week, when each war criminal will defend himself individually. Before this stage begins, it is still necessary to wait for the President of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Webb, to stipulate the time for each war criminal to testify on the witness stand. Predictions here say that each person will have a time limit of three days to a week. If the limit is three days, the entire process will take more than ten weeks, and the time sequence has already entered December. Webb and the court judges are striving to give the war criminals a fair and speedy trial, so the court will do its best to complete the trial before the Christmas season. The order in which the war criminals will make their defenses is likely to be arranged in alphabetical order in English, so Tojo will be the second to last person to defend himself. After the defendants have finished defending themselves, the prosecutors will rebut the evidence presented by the defendants, and the defendants' lawyers may have the opportunity to rebut again, but it is generally believed that this is unlikely. Then both sides will make a brief report to the court as a whole. Because there are no jurors in the trial, there is no need to make a brief summary report to the court.

### International Statistical Conference Opens Today in Washington

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] More than 500 representatives from 56 countries (including China) gathered here today to participate in the International Statistical Conference that opened here on the 8th. The head of the Chinese delegation is Zhu Junyi, and the members are Jin Guoshi and Chen Da. The main purpose of this conference is to seek international statistics and standard development. According to Zhu Jun's conversation with a Central News Agency reporter, in view of the fact that this conference will discuss the population census and international income census that China itself intends to conduct, this conference will have special significance for China.

### Consular Corps Supervise Indonesian-Dutch Ceasefire; Five Countries Send Military Officers to Assist; Indonesian Capital's Defense Commander Changes

[United Press, Batavia, 6th] According to reliable sources, several members of the United Nations Consular Corps have today received instructions from their home governments to expedite the arrangements for supervising the ceasefire in the Dutch East Indies. The corps is ordered to submit a report to the United Nations Security Council before the 20th of this month. The head of the Consular Corps, US Representative Ford, convened a meeting of all representatives on the evening of the 7th. It is reported that Ford has obtained official confirmation that US military officers will come from Manila and Tokyo to assist in supervising the ceasefire.

One party said that each of the six countries of the Consular Investigation Team will send 80 army or navy officers for technical assistance. China, Britain, France, and Australia are expected to send their own military officers, but Belgium may temporarily borrow US military personnel to serve because the country has no military officers left on the Asian continent.

[United Press, Batavia, 7th] Indonesian Republic Minister of State and Yogyakarta Chief Purbonoto is reportedly to succeed Army Chief of Staff Sumohalarajo as the defense commander of Yogyakarta City, making it possible to confirm the previous rumor that Bawono intended to declare Yogyakarta a defenseless city. Indonesian sources recently claimed that the capital of the Republic will be moved to Padang, West Sumatra.

### Jewish Underground Attempts to Bomb London; Three Key Criminals Arrested by French Police

[United Press, Paris, 7th] French police authorities announced that a Jewish rabbi and two members of the Stern Gang underground organization have been arrested in connection with a plot to bomb London. According to the police, the rabbi attempted to drop leaflets over London from the air, while the Stern Gang members planned to bomb London in revenge for the Jewish refugees returning to Hamburg in 1947. The rabbi, named Korff, is the chairman of the Palestinian Political Action Committee. He was arrested near Versailles, France, at a private airfield while preparing to board a private plane to London. Police said the plane was filled with boxes of documents containing propaganda, ready to be distributed over London. The propaganda was signed with the name "Fighters for the Liberation of Israel" and stated, "We fight today for free liberation, so as not to fight tomorrow for liberation as slaves." The two Stern Gang members, known only by their names as Jaggers and Olga, were arrested at the same time in an apartment in Paris. According to the police, six homemade bombs were found in their apartment. It was also learned that Jaggers and Olga had hired a plane and planned to fly to London to drop bombs.

### Four Supervisory Committee Members Arrive in Shanghai Under Order of the Yuan; Thorough Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage; To Clarify Whether the Usage of Various Agencies and Industries is Proper; Results to be Organized and Publicly Released

The Control Yuan previously dispatched Supervisory Committee members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Guanwu, and Du Guangxun to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the use of foreign exchange by the Central Bank and the case of Yangtze, Fuchung, and other companies purchasing large quantities of luxury goods from abroad. After receiving the order, the four committee members conducted a preliminary review in Nanjing based on reports from various parties. It is now learned that, in order to conduct an on-site investigation and obtain more detailed information, the four individuals arrived in Shanghai separately from Nanjing on the 6th and are scheduled to commence their work separately starting today. The targets of the investigation are not limited, with the aim of clarifying whether various agencies and industries are using foreign exchange properly. The duration of the investigation will also depend on the needs of the actual situation. The results of the investigation will be organized and, in addition to being reported to the government, are also planned to be released publicly.

The District Representatives of the 30 Districts Host Chiefs; Provide Opinions on the General Election; Hope for Openness and Clarity to Establish a Good Atmosphere; Support the General Mobilization Order and Resolve to Demonstrate with Facts

[Our Newspaper] The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies of the thirty districts of Shanghai hosted local chiefs and members of the press at the New Life Club at 6:00 PM yesterday, both to express respect to local officials and to provide opinions on the national general election. Those in attendance included Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, representing Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Qia, President Cha Liangjian, Tang Shichang representing Du Yuesheng, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan of the Municipal Assembly, and approximately 70 people including the chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the chairmen of the district mediation committees. The assembly presented the "Zhongyong Shun Song Commemorative Album" to Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, President Cha, Inspector Yan, and Director Du in appreciation of their service to the locality. During the gathering, Liu Xiexun, chairman of the people's representative assembly of the Old Zha District, delivered a welcome speech, and Ren Jinpin of the Xincheng District delivered a eulogy.

Self-Reliance · Do Not Seek External Assistance

Jiang Zhaohu of Huangpu District, the executive director of the Federation, then explained several points of opinion regarding the reception: (A) Regarding the election of legislators and National Assembly representatives, it is hoped that: (1) A good atmosphere will be established, and economy will be promoted, and any form of bribery, such as using banquets, will be rejected. (2) The election should be open and transparent, with public speeches to the district residents, and the people should have a clear understanding of politics. (3) Participants should explain in detail their past political achievements and not just report their resumes. (4) It is hoped that intellectuals and those qualified to be elected will participate more. (B) The special envoy Wei Demai did not contact the real representatives of the people during his visit to China, and he criticized our people, which seems unreasonable. Although he collected a lot of information, it was all personal complaints from those who "sue to foreigners," so the district people's representative assemblies must express several opinions: (1) We do not want to beg for money from the United States. The United States should help China as a moral act, and loans should not damage China's sovereignty. (2) The United States' Far East policy clearly abandons China and holds on to Japan, a phenomenon that will inevitably repeat the Pearl Harbor incident. Our people must be self-reliant and not rely on external forces.

Unity From Top to Bottom · Achieve Prosperity

(3) Support the general mobilization order. (4) We ourselves must be determined to answer the criticism of others with facts. On the one hand, we must report corruption, and we ask the Shanghai authorities to lead us in a spiritual counterattack. The cooperation of the people depends on whether the authorities cooperate. (C) Regarding the local autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, the government does not pay much attention to it and must strive for it. Local autonomy should begin with cities, not with rural counties, and constitutional government should also be carried out from the bottom up. The district people's representative assembly should be a legal entity.

Then Chairman Fang delivered a speech, briefly stating: I have been in Shanghai for eleven months, but I have not done my best for the citizens and people's representatives of Shanghai, which I feel ashamed of, but I believe that my colleagues have done their best. In the future, I hope that the representatives will encourage me more, and that we will unite as a whole from top to bottom to achieve prosperity in this city. I believe that Wei Demai's judgment is due to insufficient understanding and too little contact with the people. Chinese affairs must be resolved by the Chinese themselves. I will accept the proposed election opinions.

Assembly Hopes · Exchange of Views

Later, Speaker Pan delivered a brief speech stating: The constitution only stipulates "to be determined by law separately" regarding the local autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, and the status of these municipalities has not been determined, and the number of representatives produced is small. The Autonomy Committee of the Municipal Council has printed and organized the draft general rules for the autonomy of provinces, counties, municipalities directly under the central government, and ordinary cities issued by the central government, which will be discussed at the current assembly. It is hoped that the district people's representative assemblies will provide opinions.

It is indeed regrettable to issue a statement regarding the results of the Wei Demai investigation team's visit to China. The General Assembly of the Municipal Council will be held soon, and it is hoped that the district people's representatives will exchange views with the Council as much as possible before the meeting so that municipal construction can be promoted and developed.

### The City's Various Motorized Junk Companies Refused Membership in the Shipping Association; Jointly Submit Petition to the Social Bureau; Requesting Rectification

[Our Newspaper] In this city, motorized junks (i.e., diesel engine vessels) were active along the Yangtze River coast after the victory, when various shipping companies had not yet restored their operations. The total number of these junks was about two to three hundred. After the restoration of various shipping lines, they gradually changed routes, and there are still more than a hundred vessels remaining. Approximately seventy or more companies have been formally established. Several months ago, they applied to the Shipping Business Association for membership, but the association shelved the application for several months. Later, on July 28th, they stated: "Resolved by the 24th joint meeting of directors and supervisors that all motorized junks and vessels with a total tonnage of less than 200 tons and a true horsepower of less than 200 horsepower do not need to join the association," etc.

Various motorized junk operators believe that there is no sufficient reason for the association to refuse their membership and submitted a petition to the Social Bureau on the 20th of last month by seventy companies including Willy Shipping, Sitong Shipping, and Zhenxingren Shipping, stating five reasons why the association's actions were inappropriate and requesting rectification. The general idea is: Motorized junks are no different from ships. According to the Maritime Law and the Shipping Law, and the measures for the competent Ministry of Communications and the Shipping Administration Bureau to issue various permits for shipping operations, the handling methods are clearly the same. The association's decision to limit the total tonnage to 200 tons and the horsepower to less than 200 horsepower is unfounded and inconsistent with the law. Even in terms of the association's articles of association, there is no provision for the above-mentioned restrictions. Now, modifying the articles of association based solely on the resolution of the directors and supervisors is inconsistent with the law. There are already many members with the same qualifications, and some members are purely agents and do not own their own ships, but they are allowed to join. Although motorized junk companies are different from large shipping companies, their business operations are no different, and joining the association would not be detrimental to the industry. Why are they being rejected? etc.

### New Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Kuomintang to Hold Swearing-In Ceremony Today

All military and political units in this city have received this order.

### Two Inches of Rain; Weather Turns Cool

[Our Newspaper] The weather in this city suddenly turned cool last night, with strong winds and showers yesterday morning. According to the Meteorological Observatory, this was caused by the contact between the Siberian anticyclone and the Pacific tropical air mass near the East China Sea. This air mass is now gradually moving towards Japan, and it is expected that cloudy weather will continue to envelop this city for several days. After the northwest wind stops, the temperature will rise again, but the maximum temperature is not expected to exceed 95 degrees, so the hot season of this year has passed. The rainfall yesterday morning was 2.1 inches, and the crops are in dire need of water. With this moisture, a bumper harvest can be expected this autumn.

According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory's forecast for Shanghai's weather today: Cloudy, turning cooler, with fog in the morning and evening, moderate west to north wind. Yesterday's highest temperature was 83 degrees, and the lowest was 74 degrees.

### Tea Merchant, Fearing Punishment, Mistress Takes Own Life; Cohabitation Without Wedding; Breaking Promise Leads to Tragedy

[Our Newspaper] Chen Mengzhong, the owner of the East China Tea Company, 40 years old, from Zhenhai, fell in love with a female employee, Chen Yanya (31 years old, from Ningbo), several years ago and cohabited at No. 41 Chengqing Lane, Shunchang Road, without holding a wedding. Recently, after repeated urging from Wuya, Chen had agreed to choose a date for the ceremony. However, when Mengzhong's brother arrived from the countryside, he was opposed to it, explaining that he already had a wife in the countryside and that marrying Chen Yanya would constitute bigamy. Mengzhong then stopped the process. When Yanya learned of this, she questioned Chen Mengzhong at 3:00 AM yesterday, and an argument ensued, during which the woman swallowed ten sleeping pills. Chen then hired a car to take her to the hospital for treatment, but due to the excessive overdose, she had not yet escaped danger as of midnight yesterday.

### Preferential Treatment Money for Recruits to be Collected Immediately

The Preferential Treatment Committee of the Shanghai Military Service Association held a committee symposium at the garden hall of the Kangle Restaurant on Nanjing West Road at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the preferential treatment of volunteer soldiers. Those in attendance included Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xie Renzhao, Wang Xianqing, Xu Jiyin, Zhang Xiaosong, and representatives from various industrial and commercial groups, totaling more than 60 people, presided over by Pan Gongzhan. After Pan's speech, Zhang Xiaosong reported on the situation of recruiting volunteer soldiers, briefly stating: Since being ordered to handle the registration of volunteer soldiers, participation has been very enthusiastic, especially in Hongkou and Old Zha districts, which have achieved the best results. The first batch of 1,000 people will be sent to the division management area on the 15th, and all will be sent in three batches. Then, Du Yuesheng, Xie Renzhao, Xu Jiyin, etc., gave speeches one after another. The meeting decided: (1) The preferential treatment money for draftees whose conscription has been deferred and the preferential treatment money for non-conscripted draftees will be collected immediately, and the funds will be turned over to Zhejiang Industrial Bank and China Remittance Bank. (2) The 12 billion yuan for the settlement expenses of 3,000 volunteer soldiers will be raised by each committee member, who will be responsible for raising 100 million yuan. Before the funds are fully raised, they will be borrowed without interest from the municipal banks, cooperative treasuries, and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus.

### Shanghai Women's Association Organizes Sewing and Writing Teams

Serving Soldiers in Transit

After the recent reorganization of the Shanghai Women's Association, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu took office as the chairman of the board. In addition to regularly seeking the welfare of women and organizing relief efforts, she also organized sewing and writing teams to serve soldiers in transit.

### Raw Alum Material Increases Threefold; Water Prices to Rise; Under Study; Pudong Power Plant Requests Subsidies

After the implementation of the new foreign exchange control measures, the central authorities stipulated that liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel oil can no longer be settled at official prices, so the prices of liquid fuels have soared. It is learned that the Shanghai Pudong Electric Company, which had previously purchased diesel oil at the official foreign exchange rate, has exhausted its supply. Since the beginning of this month, the purchase price of the diesel oil used has increased, resulting in increased costs and excessive losses, which has become unbearable. Therefore, the company recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, requesting subsidies for the loss. According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters that the company's request for subsidies will first be investigated for its oil consumption, and then a decision will be made on whether to allocate official-priced fuel or provide subsidies. It is also learned that the water companies are currently requesting the Public Utilities Bureau to immediately adjust the selling price because the raw materials required by each company, mainly alum, are not allowed to apply for official foreign exchange, and the market price has soared by three times. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the current selling price of tap water. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is also studying this issue.

### One Yuan Notes Difficult to Obtain

Zhou Canhai, the owner of Shuntai Hardware Store at No. 44 Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road, recently sued Zhou Juru of Jinchang Iron Works at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shandong Road in court for spreading rumors and slandering. After three court hearings by the prosecutor, it was found that Zhou was indeed intentionally defaming and spreading rumors, and a public prosecution was filed, which was transferred to the court for trial. The judge asked Zou if he had any demands. Zou said that the loss of money was a small matter, but he had to compensate for the loss of reputation by one yuan. Because Zhou found it difficult to find one yuan, he changed the compensation to one Mexican silver dollar. Zou insisted on one yuan note, so Zhou finally managed to obtain one yuan note before the case was closed.

Seeking Compensation for Reputation; The Purpose is Not Money

### Two More Beijing-Shanghai Night Express Trains to be Added

It is expected to be completed before the end of this month, and it is hoped that it can be officially put into operation when the new schedule takes effect on October 1st.

### Bandit Forces Rampant in Southern Anhui Counties; Huining Fellow Townsmen Hold Emergency Meeting; Urge Ministry of National Defense to Deploy Large Army to Suppress Bandits

The bandit atmosphere is very strong in the counties of southern Anhui, especially in Huizhou and Ningguo. They have twice invaded Jixi County, and in Jingxian and Taiping County, they occupy the four villages, making it impossible to implement government orders. Bandit police are still frequent in the counties of Xiuning and Yi County, and the future troubles are worrying. The Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Cao Zhigong. It was resolved: (1) to establish a Local Public Security Promotion Committee, with Yang Xiaotian, Cao Zhigong, Xie Renzhao, Fang Weiping, Cheng Haifeng, Zhang Yizhai, Hu Huanwen, Zheng Zhiliang, Shao Yiqun, etc., as 15 members, and Yang Xiaotian as the director and Cao Zhigong and Zhang Yizhai as the deputy directors; (2) to recommend Cao Zhigong and Xie Renzhao as two representatives to petition the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing as soon as possible and dispatch a large army to suppress the bandits; (3) to send letters to the special commissioners and county governments of the two counties, asking them to establish self-defense organizations as soon as possible and jointly prevent and suppress the bandits.

### Main Focus of TB Prevention is Isolation; Special Weekly Broadcast for This Newspaper; Speech by Hospital Director Zhu of the Public Welfare Hospital

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this newspaper held its 23rd special weekly broadcast at the Oriental Hua Mei Radio Station and invited Dr. Zhu Yanggao (pictured), director of the Public Welfare Hospital, to broadcast: "My Views on TB Prevention." The following is a record of the six points of his speech:

"Tuberculosis is the most cruel disease in the world, the great enemy of mankind. No disease makes us doctors feel as difficult as tuberculosis. Without mentioning the situation in foreign countries and the overall situation in our country, just taking Shanghai as an example, it can be said that people with tuberculosis are working in almost every profession. If tuberculosis patients do not infect others, the problem is not so serious and can be solved gradually. However, when a tuberculosis patient breathes, through the medium of air, he infects his friends, his close associates, unknowingly harming not only himself but also his relatives and friends. This is a very serious problem. Therefore, the main task of TB prevention is to examine many people who are suspected of having tuberculosis. If it is confirmed that they have tuberculosis, they should be isolated from their relatives and friends so that they will not infect others. This is the first step in TB prevention.

Two Types of Examination

The general examination is roughly divided into two types: (1) X-ray examination, (2) sputum examination. X-ray examination can only reveal whether there are any lesions in the lungs. To check whether there are bacteria in the sputum, further sputum examination is required. Many patients with mild lung disease have no tuberculosis bacteria in their sputum. Such people are not in danger of infecting others and do not need to be isolated. However, if the sputum examination results show that there are indeed bacteria, then such people must be isolated immediately. However, this method also has difficulties, namely, what to do after the patients whose sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria are isolated. Some tuberculosis patients are not unaware that their disease can infect others, but for the sake of livelihood, they have to conceal their symptoms and work hard. Doctors advise them to rest and isolate themselves from society, but the family's livelihood becomes a problem. How can they rest in peace? This is a practical difficulty.

Guaranteeing Livelihood

Regarding this point, it does not fall within the responsibility of the doctor. The doctor's responsibility is only to find the cause of the disease and treat the symptoms. As for further social problems, the cooperation of all sectors of society is needed. For example, if agencies, organizations, factories, and businesses discover that an employee has tuberculosis, they should, on the one hand, advise him to actively seek treatment and not delay it, and on the other hand, provide a proper arrangement for his family's livelihood, so that he will not lose his job due to recuperation or affect his family's livelihood due to unemployment. The main task of TB prevention is to isolate patients from healthy people so as not to expand the spread. However, once isolated, they cannot produce. If there is no way to take care of them afterwards, the patients will still not be able to recuperate in peace and will inevitably support their sick bodies and work hard, which will still infect others. Therefore, it is an effective prerequisite for TB prevention for the heads of agencies, organizations, factories, and businesses to provide livelihood guarantees to employees with tuberculosis during the treatment period. This is beyond the power of doctors. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all sectors of society to pay attention to this and promote the spirit of human mutual assistance.

Do Not Be Afraid

As for the medical community, research on tuberculosis is constantly evolving. If patients receive treatment early, the disease is not hopeless. It is hoped that tuberculosis patients will not be afraid psychologically. Although we dare not say that we are 100% confident in eradicating tuberculosis, if all sectors of society can unite and are determined to eradicate it, we will definitely achieve the goal. I am now providing the main task of TB prevention, isolation, to all sectors of society, and I hope that everyone will sincerely declare war on tuberculosis bacteria and not stop until the goal of victory is achieved."

### Special Broadcast Program

[Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper held its 23rd special broadcast yesterday at the Oriental Huamei Radio Station.

### Silk Weaving Factory Workers' Strike in Pudong: Method of Handling to Be Discussed This Morning; Unions in Districts Two and Three Prevent Spread

[Our Newspaper News] The workers of more than twenty silk weaving factories in Pudong continued their strike yesterday. In addition to making every effort to persuade workers to resume work, the Industry Union of Silk Weaving in District Four will hold a meeting of factory representatives at 9:00 a.m. this morning to discuss how to handle the situation. When the workers of various factories stopped working the day before yesterday, the union was unaware of it beforehand. After hearing the news, it immediately notified the workers of each factory to work as usual, but the workers still did not resume work yesterday.

Although the Industry Unions of Silk Weaving in District Two (South Shanghai) and District Three (West Shanghai) feel dissatisfied with the wage discount method decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, they stated that workers in each factory will continue to produce as usual until they receive notification from the Evaluation Committee. At the same time, in order to prevent the spread of the labor unrest, they have made appropriate preparations. The union also hopes that the authorities can revise and improve the inappropriate aspects of the wage discount method.

The Social Bureau and the General Labor Union are paying close attention to the sudden strike of some silk weaving factory workers in Pudong and have sent personnel to investigate.

According to some employers, the wage discount method decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee is quite beneficial to employees, because the current difficulties and unsustainable situation of the silk weaving industry are indeed true. The sudden strike of some workers in factories in Pudong is speculated to be a "demonstration" because they suspect that the employers cannot afford the wage discount method, expressing the workers' dissatisfaction with the method.

### How Many Abandoned Women! Over Three Hundred Cases in Three Months

Shanghai, known as the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession," sees easy unions between men and women, but the number of divorces and abandonments is also not small. Some women with a higher social status have the means to hire lawyers and resort to law, and it is not difficult to be granted a sum of living expenses to support their old age. The most bitter are the wives of general poor and salaried classes. Once abandoned by their husbands, they immediately lose their livelihood and become pitiful insects in the vast sea of people, most of whom turn to the Shanghai China Relief Society for Women and Children for relief. According to Mr. Ding Hao, the secretary director of the society, and Mr. Zhou Naihao, the general manager, "In the past three months, the society has provided relief to more than 300 cases of abandoned women."

### Counterfeit Liushen Pills: Suspect Admits to Years of Forgery

[Our Newspaper News] Liushen Pills produced by the Lei Yunshang Chinese Medicine Store have long been famous everywhere, with a history of more than 300 years, leading to covetousness by unscrupulous people who often counterfeit them for profit. Recently, the store received another secret report. Therefore, on the 4th, it reported to the police station, which, together with criminal officers from the Jiangning Road Police Sub-Bureau, arrested two suspects, Qi Wenhua and Lu Fusheng, at No. 811, Jiangbian Road, for counterfeiting the wooden bottle model for the drug. According to their confession, the police then proceeded to the Yongxing Bakelite Factory at No. 1, Lane 5, Yuqing Lane, Tiantong Road, Zhejiang North Road, where they arrested the boss, Yue Zhixiang, a native of Ningbo. They also arrested the brothers Li Jiechen and Li Maochen, two Nanjing natives, at the Juelu Hotel for buying the counterfeit product. All of them were taken to the Jiangning Road Police Station for interrogation. According to their confessions, the drug has been counterfeited for years, and most of it has been shipped to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and other places for sale. They also stated that a Nanjing native named Zhang Yao is an accomplice. The police station will transfer the case to the District Procuratorate for review and handling after the investigation is completed.

### Electric Pole on Zhapu Road Bridge Snaps, Injuring Three Pedestrians

[Our Newspaper News] At about 5:15 p.m. yesterday, an electric pole on the south side of the Zhapu Road Bridge suddenly snapped, injuring three pedestrians on the spot. Yang Xiaofa, 29, and Wang Damao, 46, both suffered head injuries, and Gao Shilong, 45, suffered a fractured left foot. All were taken to Gongji Hospital by the police on duty for treatment.

### Gramophone Record Industry Declining: Radio Replaces Its Position; Producers and Distributors Plan to Operate Sidelines

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] The golden age of the gramophone and record industry in Shanghai ten years ago has become a thing of the past. There are fewer and fewer customers, and machine and record merchants are worried about the accumulation of unsold products. Smarter merchants are planning or have already started to operate electrical materials, radios, or other sidelines.

Today, radio has replaced the position of gramophone records, and the gramophone is approaching the edge of decline.

Two to Three Million Records Pressed Monthly

The Changming and Decheng factories in Shanghai, which manufacture gramophones, take the manufacture of cuckoo clocks as their main business and electric lights and electrical materials as their sideline, respectively. This can still barely help maintain the production of gramophones. The Baidai and Great China companies, which produce records, accept commissions from Victory, Shangting, and Beikai in addition to their own products, and the latter accepts commissions from Baige, Emei, and Xingyue to release records. Currently, the number of records pressed by all parties each month is between 20,000 and 30,000, only one-fifth of the number pressed each month before the war. These 20,000 to 30,000 records are distributed to Bao Fang, Xinsheng, Dasheng, Tiansheng, Baisheng, Gesheng, and the four major companies, among others, for retail sale. It is said that many of these pitiful numbers cannot be sold each month.

Sales Decline Sharply to Only One-Fifth

Before the war, imported foreign records were all managed by Baidai Company. The American Columbia Company and the British Victory Company also had considerable sales in China, especially in Shanghai. Now, it can be said that there are no imports at all. This is not due to import restrictions, but to the decrease in the number of people willing to purchase gramophone records.

Speaking of the sales of machines and records, in addition to the large volume of retail sales in Kyoto, Shanghai, and various places in Jiangnan, the wholesale business in North China, Tianjin, Wuhan, Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Jinan, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and even Southeast Asia was very common. However, it is said that these wholesale businesses only account for one-fifth of the pre-war level, and the retail volume in the Kyoto-Shanghai area is very small.

High Costs Also a Major Reason

The first difficulty in the record industry is that transportation has not been restored, and finished products cannot be sold to other places in large quantities. The second is that local records are developed and cannot be widely sold. As for the high cost of production, it is also a major reason. In addition to the required materials and labor, the copyright alone used to be 1,000 yuan for Dr. Mei and Ma Lianliang to jointly press a record of *Killing the Fisherman*. Now, if you want to press a record of a famous Peking Opera actor, the cost for the first two months is about more than 10 million yuan, and you have to give away dozens of records. Therefore, popular song records are currently popular because the cost of pressing is lower, and there are no restrictions from famous Peking Opera or other local opera actors. However, the lifespan of popular songs is short. New compositions appear at any time for songs that are popular for a while, and old records have to be piled on the shelves and let them be covered in dust.

I heard the sigh of the gramophone and record industry!

### South Shanghai Vehicle Ferry: Can Be Opened to Traffic on National Day

[Our Newspaper News] Since the Shanghai Ferry Company took charge of promoting the South Shanghai Military Vehicle Ferry project, the results have been good. According to the person in charge of the company, if there are no shutdowns due to storms, strikes, or other accidents, it should be open to traffic on October 10. The pile-driving and approach bridge project on the Pudong side has been completed. The steel bridge and crane can be installed. The floating bridge and loading barge will be installed by the end of this month. As for the dredging on the Puxi side, it has also been completed. The approach bridge project is limited to completion before the 10th of this month. It is reported that after the completion of the entire project, its transportation function may be difficult to fully develop in the initial stage. The company has decided to continue to improve it, and its goals are determined as follows: (1) The ferry uses landing craft that have been converted for transitional use, and in the future, special designs must be adopted, using those that travel at both ends. (2) The crane currently uses a truck and relies on manual rotation, which must be converted to motorized in the future. (3) The embankments on both sides are very thin and should be rebuilt and deepened in the future to facilitate dredging and navigation. (4) The roads in Pudong must continue to be completed.

### Shen Bao Scholarship: Hoping for Generous Donations; Statistics of Needy Students in Various Schools Show More Than 4,000 Awaiting Assistance

In order to investigate and count the number of poor students in this city who are unable to attend school due to their poor family backgrounds and urgently need assistance, we sent nearly 200 "School Overview Survey Forms" to major middle and elementary schools throughout the city a week ago, asking the schools to fill them out for us. Because this kind of survey work can enable us to determine the number of recipients and the budget for scholarships, so that the work can be carried out.

Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of major middle and elementary schools throughout the city, this complicated survey work will soon be completed. To date, four-fifths of the "Survey Forms" have been returned to us. We have classified, organized, and finally obtained a shocking result. This result tells us that the number of students in the city who need assistance from our newspaper is at least more than 4,000. This number is a rock-solid fact displayed in front of us. If each person is given an average scholarship of 700,000 yuan, the total amount will be 2.8 billion yuan, but we only plan to approve 1,500 people, which will require 1.05 billion yuan.

It has been a full sixteen days since our newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" began soliciting donations. The amount of donations received is only more than 40 million, plus the 300 million yuan that our newspaper has committed, there is still a long way to go from the goal of 1.05 billion yuan. In fact, these numbers are indeed of no help.

The above numbers clearly tell us, and at the same time tell the public, that the future effectiveness of the "Reader Scholarship Fund" still depends on everyone's efforts. This effort will bring a bright future to countless poor students!

### Communist Bandit Organization Cracked Down in Pudong: Five Key Leaders Arrested on the Spot

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department recently cracked down on a secret communist bandit organization in Pudong, arresting five key communist bandit leaders on the spot. According to a secret report received by the department from the Taixing County Government a week ago, Zhao Yuzhen, the communist bandit leader and current "Political Commissar" of Tianxiang, and Zhou Peiyu, a communist bandit secret agent, were hiding in the home of Zhao Zhenguan, the current "Instructor" of Wanglu Township, a communist bandit, at a certain number in Liaoyang Road in this city, colluding with communist bandit Zhou Xuexiao and Zhou Hongguan, who had received six months of communist bandit training and were now covering up their identities in the Shanghai Zhongfang Printing and Dyeing Factory, were plotting against the government.

Regarding the partial strike of workers in the silk weaving industry in the Fourth District due to wage discounts, the Shanghai Special First Branch of the Guangfu Association claims that it has never heard of this dispute, so it has nothing to do with the association.

### Building a Good Environment in the Northeast: Undertaking Fundamental Treatment Work; A Conversation with Director Chen Jian Upon His Arrival

Mr. Ma Yuchen said: Xiong Shihui is an internist, please let Director Chen Jian be a surgeon to operate on the malignant tumor in the Northeast!

[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 7th] At the tea party held by Director Chen Jian to entertain representatives of civil production institutions yesterday, Ma Yuchen said in his speech: Xiong Shihui is an internist, please let Director Chen Jian be a surgeon to operate on the malignant tumor in the Northeast. Everyone can be a relative and sign a letter of trust!

Director Chen Jian said: He will accept the opinions of the people, change the special nature of the Northeast to normal, and hopes that local people will take responsibility to remedy the deficiencies of the past fourteen years. Director Chen Jian also said: He will follow Chairman Chiang's will to make the Northeast a Three Principles of the People experimental zone.

Director Chen Jian also said: Everyone hopes that I will operate on corruption and other matters. I will build a good environment as a fundamental cure. Those who should be operated on will definitely be operated on, but there are ultimately few bad people, so don't fall for the Communist Party's divisive schemes.

### With the General's Arrival in Shenyang, the People of the Northeast Feel Open and Bright

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 3rd, Air Dispatch] September 1st is our reporters' holiday, and it was a clear day with oriental colors after days of continuous rain. On this day, we were happy and busy, so we had no time to think about celebrating the holiday. The Pan City field reporters had already been attracted to the Beiling Airport by the news of Chief Chen's arrival in Shenyang.

Little Girl Presents Flowers

At 2:00 p.m., the silver wings of the "Chasing Spirit" special plane slowly landed. As the door opened, Chief Chen got off the plane with a smile, exchanged greetings with Director Xiong, and accepted the flower presented by a little girl, repeatedly saying "Thank you" endlessly. When he shook hands with Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuhan, elders of the Northeast who were nearly sixty years old, he repeatedly said "I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it."

Director Chen Jian and former Director Xiong rode in the same car to the Second Guest House of the Municipal Headquarters. The people and students who stood to welcome them along the way showed their bright mood on their smiling faces.

Before and after the Communist bandits launched five offensives, the hearts of the people in the Northeast were once in a state of distress. Chief Chen's arrival in Pan made the depressed hearts of the people feel open and bright, because everyone knew Chief Chen's straightforward style and hoped that he could make drastic reforms in all aspects of politics, military affairs, and economy in the Northeast to save the crisis in the Northeast and satisfy all the hopes of the people in the Northeast.

Proficient in Military and Political Affairs

Regarding the changes in the Northeast situation, former Director Shihui said frankly: "In the past, the Northeast Headquarters carried out the work of receiving in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, so the Political and Economic Committees were established. In the past two years, the situation has changed, and we have to pay attention to military affairs." Director Xiong's two years of diligent efforts and the peaceful diplomacy he used were greatly challenged due to the Soviet Union's breach of faith and the Communist bandits' forces also took the opportunity to grow. The central government could not sit idly by and watch the situation in the Northeast deteriorate day by day, so it had to change its policies and practices in the Northeast to save the overall situation. Therefore, it changed the policy in the Northeast and sent Chief Chen, who is proficient in military affairs and also good at politics, to preside over the overall plan for the Northeast. On the day he took over on September 2, Chief Chen said: "The problem in the Northeast is not only a problem of China's safety, but also a problem related to world peace."

The local *Central Daily News* hailed him as "a figure of a new stage" the day after Chief Chen arrived in Shenyang, because he has the discernment of scissors, the courage of iron, and the confidence of steel, as well as the commanding power of wind. His integrity and fortitude are admired by the youth of the whole country, and his strategy and revolutionary spirit are admired by people inside and outside the party.

National Army Gains the Upper Hand

From the strengthening of military affairs in the Northeast to the reform of politics and the reform of the economy, the veins are consistent. We can see that all military victories are a prerequisite. This is also what Director Chen Jian has been actively planning before and after his arrival. It is generally believed that the war in the Northeast will inevitably break out in mid-September, and the National Army will take the initiative to gain the upper hand. The initial actions of the National Army will be to eliminate the communist bandits in southern Liaoning and the AnDong-MeiHeKou area, and then point the army north along the Middle East Railway, directly attacking the communist bandits' nerve center in Harbin and the armory in Jiamusi, and fully recover northern Songjiang.

### Reveling in the Dance Hall: Disregarding the Lives of Patients; "Famous Doctor" in Fuzhou Accused

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 2nd] Cao Can, a commissioner of the Fujian Provincial Government Commissioner's Office, is nearly sixty years old and has an only son, Zhiyu, who is only seven years old. A few days ago, he felt unwell. Therefore, in the afternoon when his illness began, he invited Fang Shengzhen, a famous pediatrician in the city, to treat him. After Fang slightly diagnosed him, he first thought it was *ganji* (infantile malnutrition), and then thought it was heatstroke. He immediately prescribed a prescription, first taking castor oil, and then medicine and powder. At that time, Cao's wife believed that her son was already suffering from severe diarrhea, and according to her common sense, it did not seem appropriate to take castor oil. She asked the doctor to examine him properly, but Dr. Fang did not take it seriously and instructed her to prescribe the medicine according to the prescription immediately. Cao and his wife had no choice but to follow the doctor's instructions. However, on the evening of the same day, the child's symptoms changed after taking the medicine. The diarrhea worsened, his hands were cold, and he was delirious. Cao rushed to Dr. Fang's residence, where Dr. Fang was having fun in the dance hall as usual, dancing. After a dance ended, Cao stepped forward and explained the child's evening symptoms, but Fang suddenly told him that it was okay to have heatstroke and told him to return to his residence. At night, the child's condition worsened. At about 2:00 a.m., Cao asked Fang to come to his residence for treatment again. At this time, Fang believed that it was meningitis. Cao asked for emergency treatment, but Fang was unwilling to do so immediately. After a while, the child died. Cao and his wife suddenly suffered the pain of losing their son in their old age, and were greatly devastated. They believed that Fang's love for dancing delayed matters and disregarded human life, and should be held liable for business negligence. Therefore, they filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, requesting that this quack doctor be punished to serve as a warning. It is heard that Fang also admitted that he did indeed have faults that led to the death of the person.

### Lai Shuangxi in Taitung: Old National Hero; Seventy-Six Years Old; Teeth Fallen Out, Hearing Impaired; Still Rides a Bicycle; Visits Wei Daoming

[Our Newspaper, Taitung, 5th, Air Dispatch] This reporter accompanied Chairman Wei on his tour of Taitung and met Lai Shuangxi, a 76-year-old national hero from Pingtung. When the Japanese attacked Taiwan more than 50 years ago, he, as a 24-year-old youth, rose up and called on his comrades to fight guerrillas with the Japanese. As a result, he retreated into the mountains and did not leave the mountains to farm until 1916. He rode his bicycle to visit Chairman Wei, repeatedly saying: "Very good! Very good!" His teeth have fallen out and he has hearing impairment, but his spirit is exceptionally good. Director Zhu of the Civil Affairs Department was so excited that he just nodded. Looking at the back of this elder who had spent 52 difficult years, I was also in awe for a long time. (Reporter Yang Yu)

### Lushan Gleanings

[Our newspaper Kuling dispatch on the 5th] Since the opening of the Nanxun Railway, the once bustling Nanxun Highway, crowded with vehicles, has become desolate. However, the troops stationed along the road for inspection and registration have not diminished their past imposing presence. On the short 190-kilometer Nanxun road, apart from the highway management stations that should regulate traffic, the security teams' inspections cause endless trouble for travelers. The so-called road protection troops' inspections, other than providing them with the convenience of free rides, have not achieved the desired effect on road safety. Because inspection is inspection, and banditry is banditry. Moreover, they also levy an inexplicable registration fee. Once, Chairman Wang Lingji's car was forced to pay a registration fee of three thousand yuan at the road protection team's checkpoint while passing through Zhang Gongbo. This incident was then exposed, and the practice was ordered to be stopped.

Zhang Gongdu is the midpoint of the Nanxun Highway. Cars traveling between Nanxun often have lunch there. In the past, it was as prosperous as before the war, but now it is quiet as a graveyard. Apart from a few small restaurants that are fortunate enough to sell a few cups of boiled water or a simple meal each day, the other shops are all closed. The only hope of the local people now is that the Gan-E Highway will be opened to traffic. They place their hopes for prosperity on the Gan-E road. However, the completion of this road will probably take quite some time.

The remnants of Li Xiannian's troops from the Communist Central Plains Military Region, about two hundred people, armed with six small cannons and more than ten light machine guns, moved from Hubei Province to the north bank of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangxi in mid-August, attempting to operate along the riverbank and loot the autumn harvest. Peng Xiuye, a former investigator from the Fourth Section of the Security Department, is also recruiting local ruffians and vagrants, armed with more than forty rifles and two light machine guns, to operate on the Nanxun Highway. In mid-August, De'an County was once in a state of emergency. The authorities should immediately search for and eliminate these scattered bandits in a timely manner. (Reporter Liu Zao)

### Abbot of Jiaoshan Monastery Accused of Colluding with Communists, Professor Haiji of the Buddhist Academy Offers Explanation

[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch on the 7th] Regarding the widely spread case in Nanjing and Shanghai of the Abbot of Jiaoshan Monastery colluding with Communists, Professor Haiji of the Buddhist Academy on the mountain stated: This matter is entirely fabricated. Monk Xuefan retired in September of last year and was invited this spring to preside over the Qingliang Temple in Changzhou and Shanghai. After Monk Xuefan retired, he was suddenly arrested on August 29th and sent to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters. This is actually an act of malicious accusation. I personally went to Beijing yesterday to request that the Xinmin Evening News correct and apologize for the report, and I also clarified the truth to the Garrison Headquarters. The Headquarters agreed to investigate. As for Monk Xuefan's arrest in Shanghai, it was due to a former monk who had been expelled from the mountain seeing the news report about Xuefan colluding with Communists and attempting to take revenge.

### Black Fever Spreads in Northern Anhui, Health Authorities Urgently Need to Pay Attention to Prevention and Treatment

[Our newspaper Bengbu dispatch on the 3rd] A type of black fever is prevalent in various parts of northern Anhui. It is spreading extremely rapidly and widely, and the number of deaths is increasing daily, which has aroused great attention from the medical community. It is reported that this type of highly contagious and malignant disease was first discovered in Huaiyin, northern Jiangsu, and soon spread to cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, and Xi'an. After the disaster in northern Anhui, people's livelihoods are difficult, and most people are undernourished. This black fever takes advantage of the situation. The area around Si County and Su County is particularly rampant. According to people in the medical field, the source of black fever is said to be the sandfly, which is the transmission medium. The sandfly is quite similar to a midge, with a body that is yellowish in color. It sucks human blood in the same way as mosquitoes. After a person is bitten by a sandfly, red spots appear on the buttocks. The symptoms are quite similar to malaria. At first, there are alternating chills and fever, followed by a persistent fever, yellow complexion, abdominal distension, facial swelling, and bleeding gums. A foul odor is emitted during breathing. This disease is due to the lack of nutrition and weak resistance in the human body. The bacteria destroy tissues in the body, making it stubborn and terrifying. Initially, more children were affected, but recently, many adults have also been affected. Those who do not recognize the condition often mistakenly believe it to be dropsy. This disease spreads widely and quickly. Health authorities in various places should urgently pay attention to prevention. The most effective drug for treating black fever is "Neostam," a British product. Patients urgently need vitamin B, followed by vitamins A, C, and G. Xie Guanyi, Deputy Director of the Anhui Rehabilitation and Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan, inspected the flood disaster in Su County at the end of last month and witnessed many people suffering from black fever. Therefore, he paid great attention to it, and all parties also hope that the branch can provide medical relief to combat the offensive of this terrible disease.

Domestic public opinion generally believes that a good medicine for the right disease, if taken excessively, will not only fail to cure the disease, but when it is truly needed, there will be no medicine available. Reforming the monetary system at this time, because the objective conditions are not yet ready, the effect is limited, and it is too early. It is advisable to wait until the general economic situation improves slightly before making a fundamental plan. The author, far away in Japan, also believes that this issue is of great importance to the national economy. Therefore, I would like to provide some opinions based on my usual research on this issue for the reference of the Chinese people.

More than two years have passed since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. The country is in trouble everywhere, and the people are suffering. Observing the domestic situation, one cannot help but feel grief. Looking at our eastern neighbor, after the defeat in the war, they have cleaned up the aftermath and rebuilt. Their politics and economy are generally on track, and international trade has also been opened since August 15th. With a gold reserve of US$137 million as a fund, its strength is already quite strong. In addition, with the spiritual support of the United States, it feels like everything is going smoothly. The Japanese people are truly elated and full of hope. Our country and Japan are neighbors, with old grievances unresolved, and we are the first to bear the brunt.

The current problem in our country, broadly speaking, is only one economic problem, that is, the monetary system problem. The legal tender is entrusted with the government's credit. Since the end of the war, no concrete method of reorganization has been determined, resulting in malignant inflation, which has reached a saturation point, and a crisis has appeared, with collapse expected. The collapse of the legal tender is the total collapse of politics and economy. If, unfortunately, it reaches an irreversible state, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, if there is a good medicine for the right disease, use it at the right time. A little hesitation will lead to regret. The so-called objective conditions will not come until the credit of the monetary system is re-established, which can be asserted.

To re-establish the credit of the legal tender, it is necessary to start with reforming the monetary system. The current legal tender has lost its soul and cannot be saved. If we can use the greatest courage, directly and clearly, call the existing yuan note, which is actually only worth 30% of its pre-war value, a 30% legal tender, it will definitely produce a different psychological effect and boost morale. Otherwise, we will only see prices continue to rise, nerves constantly tense, trapped in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. Today's banknotes are like the banknotes of the past. Calling them 30% does not make people feel the expensiveness of prices or the difficulty of life. Calling them 10,000 yuan inevitably leads to today's turmoil. Numbers are at work, playing with humanity, and the harm is so great.

The 10,000 yuan of the past has now been devalued to 30%. The 9,999 yuan and 70% are all consumed due to the national War of Resistance. This loss is actually shared by the people of the whole country. Hanging on to this bad debt only makes people feel alarmed. Why not write it off in one stroke and feel clean and happy? However, it should be noted that this remaining 30% must be preserved with all efforts and not allowed to fall again. The way to preserve it is to reform the monetary system and re-establish the credit of the legal tender. However, there are several issues that should be reviewed:

(1) The conversion rate between the new and old legal tender should be determined by economic experts based on the total amount of old currency issued and its existing purchasing power, using precise calculation methods. It should not be too high or too low. Once the ratio is determined, we can proceed to estimate the first phase of the new currency issuance and its corresponding reserve. Assuming that the ratio is 100,000 to 3, if the amount of old currency issued is 100 trillion yuan, the equivalent of new currency is only 3 billion yuan, which is approximately US$1 billion. The amount of new currency issued is greatly reduced, which makes it easier to raise the reserve.

(2) The issuance of new currency must have the same standard of reserve as before the war, otherwise there is no way to maintain its credit. In addition to allocating the government's existing gold and foreign exchange and the proceeds from the sale of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to borrow tens of millions of U.S. dollars from the United States to replenish it, and managed by financial experts with the most stringent methods, and announced on a regular basis to show great trust.

(3) The gold and silver currently held and purchased by the Central Bank should be gradually delivered to the mint to cast coins to increase the people's belief in the new currency, but except for auxiliary coins that must be issued immediately to meet needs, gold coins should not be issued and circulated until a considerable period.

(4) Foreign exchange should be strictly controlled within a period of one or two years. Necessary imports should be offset by exports, adopting the principle of barter. All other unnecessary foreign exchange should be stopped from being settled and sold. In short, under no circumstances should the aforementioned reserve be used within one year.

(5) The old currency should be recalled in a fixed period and its circulation prohibited. For the exchanged new currency, those above a certain amount, except for the necessary living expenses and salaries, etc., which can be withdrawn in installments in proportion to the amount, the rest should be frozen for a short period to reduce the amount issued in the first phase and prevent inflation. The frozen portion should be issued registered deposit certificates by the Central Bank, with reasonable interest.

(6) The procedures for exchanging new currency should be simplified to avoid excessive disturbance. Money houses, commercial firms, institutions, and schools can be entrusted to manage it. If manpower is insufficient, high school students or above can be temporarily recruited to assist.

(7) After the implementation of the new currency, all prices should be restored to their original state one year before the War of Resistance. Rice should be 10 yuan per stone, sesame cakes and fried dough sticks should be 1 cent per piece, and cloth should be 10 cents per foot. The main food and necessary daily necessities should still be controlled in the same way as during the war. The Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should dredge up sources and coordinate distribution. In order to ensure that the distribution system is free of abuses, the heads of each baojia should be ordered to complete the household survey by a certain date. This work can be temporarily recruited from students below high school and above elementary school.

(8) The government's finances should strive to be balanced. All military and government expenses should be temporarily disbursed according to the budget one year before the War of Resistance, and the salaries of public school personnel should also be restored to their original amounts before the war, so that life can be stabilized and corruption can be eliminated. However, those with salaries above 200 yuan should have half of their excess amount frozen for a short period, called savings, with preferential interest. If any institution has increased personnel and the old budget cannot match the current situation, it should be ordered to cut redundant personnel and adjust itself.

(9) The government's issued public bonds are all products of wartime. To increase the people's belief in the government and encourage investment, they should all be recognized at the original amount in new currency, but those that have reached the repayment period should be postponed for one to five years, and interest should still be paid.

(10) The savings deposits of the people, if the deposit period was before the war, should be repaid at the original amount of principal and interest. If the deposit period was during or after the war, it should be converted into new currency according to the sum of the annual price index. Those that have been requested in litigation and have obtained a definite judgment should be followed according to the judgment. Those whose liquidation period has expired should be postponed for one year, and then repaid in installments according to the amount. Interest should be given at the original interest rate during the postponement period. Although some banks may inevitably suffer losses by recognizing pre-war deposits in new currency, it has far-reaching significance, and the intangible gains are incommensurable. Savings deposits are mostly accumulated by the middle class, saving money and food, for the education of their children and to prevent illness and old age. Not withdrawing for ten years shows their deep belief in the legal tender. If they are repaid by converting old currency, then the hard work of the past and the expectations of many years will be lost. Afterwards, no matter how the government promotes or how the bank advertises, they will regard savings as a dangerous path and dare not try. Promoting savings is the government's only good policy to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize the economy. Absorbing deposits is the bank's main business to use idle funds and regulate finance. Now, recognizing these deposits in new currency is tantamount to showing people that no investment is as safe and reliable as savings, which is enough to encourage depositors' interest and enhance their belief. The amount of savings deposits increases, and the credit of the new currency is established from this, which is obvious. As for the banks, since they are given the convenience of deferred repayment, they will not shake their foundations due to temporary turnover shortages. If the bank really has difficulties, the government should fully support it, so that this national policy can be implemented and achieve results.

(11) The government should set a purchase price to buy gold and foreign exchange from the people, but in the early stages, it should not be forced to buy. The government's economic policies over the years have repeatedly failed, which inevitably affects the people's confidence. At the time of the implementation of the new currency, the people will inevitably be wary and adopt a wait-and-see attitude in view of the painful experiences of the past. If the government forcibly nationalizes gold and foreign currency and freezes its price, the people will blame the government for confiscating their legally obtained property and generate resentment. If the government does not force the purchase, then before the credit of the new currency is established, this idle fund will inevitably seek another way out, and use it for various speculations or hoarding, thereby hindering the implementation of the new currency policy. Weighing the pros and cons, it is better to let it be natural. In this way, it is enough to show the government's utmost intention to protect the people's property, and it is also to show that the new currency has its intrinsic compensation and does not rely on the gold and foreign exchange of the people to support it. However, if someone can understand the government's good intentions, or is motivated by patriotism and voluntarily sells gold and foreign exchange to the country, or has to sell gold and foreign exchange due to urgent need for cash, the government will buy it according to regulations, pay half of the price, and freeze the remaining half for a short period, or treat it as a fixed deposit for one year or half a year and give interest. The government should refuse any spontaneous donations from the people in order to respect their dignity.

(12) Open gold and foreign currency deposits, guaranteeing that principal and interest will be repaid in gold and foreign currency at maturity, with no discounts. This deposit may not arouse the people's interest due to past failures, but once the credit of the new currency is established, its future is not as pessimistic as expected. The Central Bank accepts this kind of deposit and transfers it to the reserve bank for safekeeping and never uses it. Therefore, the Central Bank does not profit from accepting this kind of deposit, but also compensates it, which is not cost-effective, but in order to enhance the credit of the new currency, it should not be counted. Gold and foreign exchange are inherently inert. The reason why private investors flock to them is because they have learned from the disappearance of the credit of the legal tender and want to preserve it. Once the new economic foundation is firmly established, this inert object has no future. Depositors will inevitably scramble to convert it into new currency and deposit it in the bank to receive higher interest, which is inevitable.

(13) Organize industrial and commercial loans to support industries, which must be complementary to the new legal tender policy. During the transition between the old and new currencies, there may be some disturbances due to tight chips and poor turnover, which may cause a phenomenon similar to economic downturn. To prevent this adverse result, industrial and commercial loans should be continued, and objective standards should be used as the basis for approval, without any favoritism or fraud. After the war, industries were destroyed and materials were scarce. Now, due to the implementation of the new currency, it is necessary to control foreign exchange and restrict imports, and the situation will inevitably become worse. On the one hand, there is a shortage of materials, and on the other hand, purchasing power is weakened. This contradiction must be designed to be reconciled. If the policy is proper and the execution is effective, the transition period will be very short and will not lead to serious consequences.

(14) Strictly enforce the law and eradicate corruption, which is the key to the success or failure of the new legal tender policy. After years of war and civil unrest, the people's livelihood has declined, and the country is almost non-existent. Saving the country and surviving depends on this one action. Therefore, only success can be expected, and failure cannot be tolerated. The country's credit should not be lightly tested. Once the policy is determined, the whole country should be mobilized with an iron will to go all out. All public officials are executors of this policy. Now that their treatment has been improved and their lives can be stabilized, they should serve faithfully. If corruption is still found, they should be punished according to the law, without any favoritism. Heavy penalties should be used in troubled times. The supervisory committee should inspect various places, and the people of the whole country should cooperate fully, and report everything they know, to ensure that corruption is eradicated and discipline is revived. In any country, the law is strong when it is enforced, and the law is weak when it is not enforced. The success or failure of all events depends on execution, and policy is secondary. In the past, the government's policies were all perfect, but they ultimately failed because the execution was not effective. Now, in implementing the new policy, we should strive to correct this shortcoming and implement it strictly to achieve success.

Comparison Table of Important Commodity Market Prices in This City for One Week (Increase/Decrease)

### U.S. Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills - Resale Resumes Today

After the Ministry of Finance decided to sell U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills at market prices, the Central Bank has scheduled to resume sales today in 19 important areas such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou.

The bank will telegraph the foreign exchange market price of this city to its branches in these areas before 9:30 AM every day, so that it can sell according to the exchange rate of the day.

In addition, whether the million-citizen bond subscription campaign launched by the Bond Sales Committee will continue is still under study. Because there are some difficulties in calculation since the sale at market prices, it can be resumed if this technical problem is solved.

### Artificial Silk Quota - Allocation Determined

The import quota for artificial silk in the third quarter has been approved by the National Economic Commission as US$565,000. It is reported that the allocation of the artificial silk quota has been agreed upon by relevant parties, including the silk weaving industry and artificial silk merchants. The silk weaving industry accounts for 75%, artificial silk merchants account for 10%, and the remaining 15% is allocated by the ribbon industry, etc. According to this allocation amount, imports can be freely ordered from abroad. However, the import of artificial silk through the Sino-Japanese barter trade of the China Trust Bureau is not subject to the above restrictions.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification

### Soldier Marries New Love While Serving Away from Home: "Wife of the Resistance" Complications Arise

Editor: I have several legal questions and request your newspaper to provide answers: (1) If a soldier marries while serving away from home during the War of Resistance, and it has been four years, is it legally valid for his wife at home to accuse him of bigamy? Does the crime of bigamy stand? (2) If his first wife was notified both before and after the marriage abroad, and she still accuses him of bigamy afterward, is there suspicion of intentional framing? (3) If a husband and wife have already separated and both parties have agreed, what is the difference between this and a divorce? (4) If, after the separation, the husband still bears the living expenses of his wife, does she have the right to freely dispose of her husband's property? Reader Wang Jinxiu.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) If the statute of limitations has not expired, a crime has still been committed. The statute of limitations for the right to prosecute someone who commits bigamy while having a spouse is ten years. (2) If the first wife did not instigate the bigamy, even if she was notified by her husband alone, it cannot be said that she agreed. Therefore, accusing him of bigamy does not constitute suspicion of framing. (3) The difference lies in whether the marital relationship continues. "Separation" cannot be considered divorce. (4) Apart from gifts, a wife has no right to dispose of her husband's property.

### Reply to Liu Ping

Letter received; see previous column.

Dear Liu Ping: Based on the facts described in your letter, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the marriage contract your father made for you when you were a child is fundamentally invalid according to Article 972 of the Civil Code, which states: "A marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves." But this is already in the past. Second, the man's use of local evil forces to carry out a "bride kidnapping" completely violates Article 997 of the Civil Code, which clearly states: "A person who marries as a result of fraud or coercion may petition the court for rescission within six months after discovering the fraud or the cessation of the coercion." Therefore, according to your letter, this "bride kidnapping" is completely illegal and violates the law. For your future and happiness, you can petition the local court to rescind this marriage. As for the repayment of the betrothal gifts, that is fundamentally your parents' responsibility and has nothing to do with you. Wishing you happiness. Editor.

Spring and Autumn

### August 25th: A Qingdao Diary

— Zhao Qingge

Today my watch (not daylight saving time. Every year others observe daylight saving time, I insist on keeping the old time. The reason is that advancing the clock by an hour for no reason, it is clear that I wake up at nine in the morning, but with daylight saving time it is already ten o'clock, making me seem too lazy. It is clear that I go to bed at twelve o'clock, but with daylight saving time it is already one o'clock, threatening my spirit! Therefore, I stubbornly refuse to set my watch forward by an hour. This sometimes leads to mistakes, but when I have an appointment, I always try to be vigilant. My friends know my temperament and always remind me when they make an appointment: "Remember, it's our time, an hour earlier than your watch!") reads only eight o'clock, but I am already out of bed. In Shanghai, this is still the time for sound sleep.

First, I went to the balcony for some deep breathing, then washed up, drank a bowl of tea steeped with jasmine, smoked a Great Front Gate cigarette, and then started writing. I had originally planned to finish the remaining chapter of "Jiangshang Yan" in the morning and have a relaxing time in the afternoon. I am not sure about other things, but when it comes to finishing manuscripts, I will finish it when I say I will. I can't control anything in my life, except the pen! The pen listens to my senses, the pen obeys me most gently, and it is always consistent! Therefore, I put down my pen at half-past twelve. I sighed a relaxed and happy breath into the air, and walked out of the residence with a leisurely pace, walking to Hengtai Road. I thought to myself: Let's change to a new small restaurant, eating "Diyi Chun" all the time is getting boring.

As I walked, I found a small restaurant in the middle section of Liaoning Road, hanging a signboard tied with red silk, on which was written: "Dumpling King." It looked clean, so I went in. There was only one waiter, no upstairs, just one room with three tables. It was cold and quiet, not like doing business, more like a family. The landlady was wearing white silk shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun. She greeted me with a smile. I saw that one of the tables by the window already had a guest, so I had to take another adjacent table. I ordered thirty dumplings. I have really eaten a lot of dumplings in the past two days. I had dumplings for two meals the day before yesterday, but I don't feel tired of them at all. After all, I am from the North.

The dumplings were not ready yet, so I could only wait while smoking. The room was so quiet that it felt like a nap. Suddenly, I heard the guest at the next table speak. I glanced back and realized that he had already eaten and was just reading the newspaper. Now that he had finished reading the newspaper, he was humming a tune. Judging by his accent, he was not from Shandong, but seemed to be from Beijing. Listening more carefully, it was not a tune he was humming, but reciting Lin Daiyu's "Burial of Flowers" from "Dream of the Red Chamber," and he kept repeating it without end. My first cigarette was finished, but the dumplings had not yet arrived.

"Kid, go buy me a pack of cigarettes!" The man seemed to have been aroused by my smoking. He had a strong Beijing accent.

"What brand?" The kid seemed to be very familiar with the man, asking with a grinning face.

"Double Happiness."

The cigarettes were bought back, and the man opened them and took one out. The kid quickly went to the kitchen to get a light. At this time, the landlady seemed to be urging the dumplings for me. Only the man and I were left in the room. Taking advantage of this gap, the man said to me in a low voice:

"Smoke?"

"Thank you, I just smoked." I replied, without even daring to look up. I was a little afraid, afraid that the man was a hooligan. I was also a little embarrassed, not knowing how to deal with it.

The man was rejected and stopped talking. The kid and the landlady both came back. My dumplings were also ready. The man smoked his cigarettes, and I ate my dumplings. After a while, I heard the man asking the landlady:

"I probably spent another 200,000 this week, right?"

It turned out that the man was a regular customer here.

"Is 200,000 a lot? Eating two meals a day is less than 30,000." The landlady replied with a smile.

"Uh!" The man grunted and said, "Today I only drank two taels of wine! Why am I so dizzy? It seems that your wine is not diluted."

I realized that the man was a little drunk.

"Look, would I dare to cheat you, an old customer!" The landlady's voice was full of laughter.

After a pause, the man changed the subject. He seemed to be deliberately killing time.

"The Double Seventh Festival passed a long time ago, and the theaters are still playing 'The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.' I don't know if there really is such a thing? It teases the young men and women until they are crying their eyes out. I think it's the fault of the novelists! They deliberately don't let people be happy, fabricating stories out of thin air, bringing troubles to people; like me, knowing it's wrong, I still can't jump out of this emotional circle." After saying this, the man stole a glance at me. He also sighed deeply, indicating that he was really troubled!

I had already felt it. I felt that the man had been staring at me all the time. He knew that the landlady would not understand what he was saying, so wasn't he clearly saying it to me? But I could only pretend not to hear and eat my dumplings with my head down. Sure enough, the landlady just "hmmed" and could not answer anything. So he began to recite the "Burial of Flowers" again. This time, I felt that his tone was so sad, so desolate. I found it a little funny, but also a little pitiful. When I finished eating, I paid the bill. When I stood up, I saw him walking past me to take the black suit jacket and a brand new straw hat hanging on the wall. He was wearing a white shirt, white pants, and white leather shoes. He was handsome and at most thirty years old.

I walked out of the restaurant, and the man followed behind me, but not too closely. This proved that he was not a bad guy. Nevertheless, I still felt a little uncomfortable, so I walked to the entrance of a bookstore and deliberately went in to stall for a while. But he did not leave or rush over, just standing far away and waiting. I had no choice but to walk out again. As I passed the entrance of Zhongzheng Park, he suddenly darted in front of me. He said timidly and still in a low voice:

"Let's take a walk in the shrine, it's quiet here."

As I turned around, the man lowered his head. He was also embarrassed, so I replied to him in an angry tone:

"You've mistaken me for someone else!"

Actually, I wanted to say: "I'm not Lin Daiyu," but I didn't. I hurried forward a few steps, and there was a rickshaw right there. I didn't bother to bargain, sat on it, told the rickshaw puller a destination, and slipped away.

The man did not say anything. I remember that after I scolded him, he sighed. I sat in the rickshaw and left, and my courage grew stronger. I turned back to look at him again. He was still holding the black jacket and standing in the sun! At this time, I said to myself: "What's he doing? Such a good young man (he looks like a single civil servant stranded in a foreign land), moaning without illness! Doing some crazy, meaningless, stupid things that are self-inflicted. I guess he is perhaps heartbroken, so he ran here alone to drown his sorrows! But maybe he has never been in love and is still reminiscing about the dream of love, so he recites the 'Burial of Flowers' so sentimentally, grieving for Lin Daiyu in vain. Anyway, his attitude towards life is always wrong. If I were his friend, I would definitely persuade him to be happy, but I have no interest in minding the business of a stranger."

Lost in thought, I unknowingly arrived at the seaside. I first took a stroll in the Seaside Park, found a clean beach, and lay down to rest. I looked out at the boundless horizon, which was only separated from the sky by a line. When there were no clouds, you simply could not distinguish which was the sea and which was the sky. Looking closely, the seawater gnawed at the beach, constantly muttering some unintelligible words, spraying some white foam.

The sun was scorching hot, so I walked to the "Qingdao Cafe" with dancing spirits in front. I sat down on the veranda by the sea. At this time, there were few customers, and the music had not yet started, so it was extremely quiet. I enjoyed this peace and happily ordered a small glass of brandy. I celebrated myself for finishing one thing today - the completion of "Jiangshang Yan."

I slowly sipped the wine, admiring the scenery of the seaside. On either side of this cafe were tall and low Western-style houses. A little further away was a green mountain, on which there were also a few sparse red-tiled Western-style houses, like a few wild roses blooming on the mountain. At this time, a few white clouds were flying in the sky, looking like willow catkins being slightly intoxicated by the breeze! On the beach under the veranda, children were carrying cotton baskets to collect clams. Men and women were bathing in the shallow water. A pair of teenagers, seemingly lovers, were fighting in the seawater. The man tried hard to press the woman's head into the water, and the woman jumped out of the water with a lunge, using her hands to splash water back at the man. The man was preparing to pounce over to press the woman's head again, but the woman laughed and turned around to escape. The man chased after her. They finally made peace and embraced each other in the seawater!

While I was watching with great interest, a sharp shout startled me! I quickly turned back to look. It was a young lady who was throwing a tantrum at the waiter. She was sitting at a table in front of me. I had not noticed her until now. It turned out that she had arrived even earlier than me. From her words, I could hear.

"What's wrong? Can't customers who have eaten sit for a while longer? You quickly bring the bill to urge me. Does anyone owe you anything?" The young lady yelled in Cantonese.

"That's not what I meant! I saw that you had eaten and weren't ordering anything else, so I thought you were about to leave! That's why I brought the bill." A head waiter came over and repeatedly apologized to the young lady.

"Okay, bring me another cup of coffee, hot." The young lady ordered, her anger subsided a little.

Another waiter brought the coffee over. Suddenly the young lady said again:

"Bring me a bottle of beer too!"

The waiter did not dare to delay and quickly went to do as he was told. The young lady put the coffee aside and drank the beer first. I saw her drinking the wine while staring blankly at the sea and sky connecting the other corner without mountains or Western-style houses. She was also constantly smoking. So I paid attention to the ashtray in front of her. Humph! There were at least twenty cigarette butts. Of course, maybe not all of them were smoked by her, but from the time she got angry until now, it has been at most two or three ten minutes, but she has smoked more than five. I said to myself: She is more fierce than me. She is already smoking one after another. Her speed is even twice as fast as mine.

The young lady was not ugly, with a round face, and a pair of watery eyes, as if she were about to cry at any moment. Her eyebrows had lost their natural shape, and were trimmed so thin. Straight nose, although not too high. Small mouth, painted with bright red lipstick. Her hair had been permed a long time ago and had straightened out, draped over her shoulders. She wore a blue-and-white floral silk cheongsam, white shoes, and no socks. She was neither too thin nor too fat, and her skin was brown. She was not a student, she was quite old. Maybe she was a female teacher. I guessed. She seemed to have something on her mind, and seemed very irritable and depressed. She smoked hard and exhaled heavily, as if she wanted to exhale her distress! From time to time, she scratched her hair, and then casually pulled out a strand or two. She drank alcohol so hastily that a large glass was gone in an instant, a bottle with two large glasses. In less than twenty minutes, she swept them all away. She still swallowed that cup of cooked coffee in two or three mouthfuls. It was like using this thing to dilute her sadness!

"Why is she so annoyed? Is she also heartbroken?" I pondered this, and couldn't help but think of the fake Baoyu who recited the "Burial of Flowers" at noon. I thought: If I had just found such an object here, I would definitely bring that person here, so that they could sympathize with each other, and maybe they could fill some of the emptiness! However, my regret was in vain, I couldn't find that person again. Then, should I comfort this young lady? I am not afraid, and I am willing to do so, but I feel that my comfort is not what she needs! If I did this, I might just run into a wall! It's not worth it! It's better not to mind other people's business. So at this time, I didn't bother to look at any scenery, and just coldly observed her - until she collected her eyes that were looking at the sea and sky; until she finished smoking the last cigarette; until she paid the bill and stood up, and walked out staggeringly, like a rootless ghost, and walked into the dusk!

At this time, my brandy was also drunk, and I ordered another serving of ice cream. It was getting dark, so I also solved the dinner problem by the way. In the music, I walked back with rhythmic steps, accompanied by the moonlight.

As soon as I arrived at the residence, the lady in the small building opposite, who seemed to be suffering from menstrual cramps forever, had already returned from work, and was "wah lah wah lah" scolding the servants again. For some reason, these days, whenever I saw her, I felt a headache, I was almost afraid of her! Her face, which always looked like someone owed her two hundred copper coins, without a trace of a smile, made you unable to avoid being shocked! Coupled with her voice, which was often a curse, made your hairs stand on end! She was simply a mad dog, who could bite people at any time. Because of the mental threat she gave me, I had to hide from her all the time - when she went to work, I opened the window, and as soon as she came back, I quickly closed the window tightly. Anyway, I tried to avoid her as much as possible. Now I had no choice but to close the window again. I sat back at my desk, recalling the two interesting encounters of today, and found them quite interesting, so I wrote them down in one breath.

My watch already reads twelve o'clock, fatigue hits my temples, and I involuntarily fall onto the bed. Tonight, I probably don't need to read a book to fall asleep! (Book from Qingdao)

### Sparks of Red Candles

— Feng Shike

Branches of delicate red candles burned with countless clusters of raging sparks. They leaned against the front of the crimson tent of the "Writers Association Literary Lecture," trying their best to emit the light of wisdom.

That majestic and beautiful crimson tent! With its vast expanse, it carefully protected the radiance radiating from them; it also blocked the wind hissing that slowly invaded from the gaps in the windows, sweeping past the outdoors - under its feathery cover, it did not allow any slender red candle to be extinguished in the noisy and chaotic terror.

That vast expanse of the crimson tent! It stretched out its huge and powerful arms, enclosing a beautiful and tranquil secluded realm, adapting to the body temperature of each graceful red candle, allowing them to continue burning, burning in warm training; until their towering and smiling flames sang out the peaceful and joyful gospel of the human world together.

The goddess of literature, undulating like ripples and gently stroking like willow branches at the top of the huge crimson tent, looked down from above at all this sweet business, using her harmonious and adorable voice, like rose petals, to make priceless gifts to them -

My delightful red candles! Give a point of heat, emit a point of light, this is your only true understanding of the world. Value your radiant appearance! Before the clear moonlight sprinkles down outside the window, before the sky reflects the intertwined stars!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"I don't like this either...!" Little Tiger said with a naive expression.

"I knew you wouldn't like it." Yaoqun immediately picked up the conversation: "That's why, I must change my appearance before going on stage. If I make a mistake and get caught by the Japanese devils, do you think they would spare me? Wouldn't that be a million times worse?..."

"No, Aunt Ji,... you've changed your appearance several times,... but there's no need to use this poisonous herb!" Little Tiger pointed to the package of herbs placed far away.

"But you need to know, this time we are going to Shanxi, it's not a short-term job of a day or two, is it? Working like this for a long time, those foreign color powders, they don't last long, and you have to put on makeup every day, do you think that would be annoying?… So I thought of this thing; just use it once. Master Qiu said, 'It can last a lifetime!' Wouldn't that save a lot of trouble?"

"A lifetime of using this poison?" This was Little Tiger's central question.

"Poison? What are you afraid of?... What does a lifetime matter? ... Many people, for the sake of fighting the Japanese devils, don't even care about their lives, are we still afraid of poison?" Yaoqun said here, with some choking in her voice, unable to continue.

"Aunt Ji, what will happen after the war is over?" What Little Tiger meant was that the war would eventually end, and Yaoqun's original appearance could not be restored, wouldn't that ruin a woman's whole life?

"What will happen after the war is over?" Yaoqun was probably in the midst of grief and did not hear Little Tiger's words clearly: "After the war...; hum... if we lose, of course, you wouldn't want me to be taken by the Japanese devils as a fallen woman, as a nanny, would you?... If we win, then even if we die, it's worth it, why worry about boils or anything... Besides, I don't believe there's no way to cure it, if I'm willing to cure it..."

"Why wouldn't you be willing to cure it, Aunt Ji?" Little Tiger's childish mind turned the problem around, asking to get to the bottom of it!

Little Tiger's question can be said to have hit the real theme right on the head, and it also touched Yaoqun's second point that she was not prepared to explain:

"Silly child, let's wait until we live to that time before we talk about it, how can we worry about so many things at this time!"

After breakfast, the scene in the wine shop ended here. According to the original plan, they walked towards the "French Concession"; Yaoqun was prepared to find comrades from the stationed detachment to inquire about the situation after the fall of Tianjin.

Along the way, according to Yaoqun's analysis, Tianjin at this time could see three types of people: one is the arrogant and domineering bullies; one is the pitiful common people who are filled with anger in their writings; one is the ignorant and foolish who are wandering astray and at a loss. This, of course, is a general outline-style analysis.

### Basic Education and Scientific Knowledge

— Liu Wei

The UNESCO Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education Research was inaugurated in our country on September 3rd. The conference lasted for ten days, with participants from fourteen countries. It is the first of the four regional basic education research conferences to be held. Experts have gathered here to discuss the fundamental methods for lasting world peace, seeking to turn swords into ploughshares and dispel suspicion with understanding. This is a grand event! It is expected that the success of this conference will have significant and far-reaching implications for the future basic education cause of countries in the Far East region, especially our country. We can assert this. While wishing the conference success, we should also take this opportunity to offer some personal views for the consideration of the delegates!

Considering the countries in the Far East region, most are ancient civilizations and emerging nations, and science is generally not very developed. In this era of strong competition in the world, with scientific progress advancing rapidly, a country, if it lacks a corresponding scientific foundation, will inevitably be threatened by other countries. From an individual perspective, if one lacks scientific knowledge, one will not be able to adapt to the environment of modern life. Therefore, on the one hand, the country should promote the research of advanced science, and on the other hand, it should instill scientific knowledge in the people. These two aspects should be carried out simultaneously and complement each other. Therefore, the dissemination of scientific knowledge occupies an important position in basic education. However, reviewing the main purpose of the Basic Education Conference, which is primarily to eliminate illiteracy, there are no specific provisions on how to disseminate scientific knowledge to the general public, especially in many Far East countries with backward science. From the standpoint of scientists, we sincerely hope that this conference, in addition to the several themes, can include the popularization of scientific knowledge as one of the important topics for detailed discussion, formulate plans, so that various countries can adopt them, know what to do, and meet the needs of the times. What Eastern countries lack most now is material construction, not spiritual civilization.

Furthermore, our country's science started late, and science education is very backward, which urgently needs to be improved. We should take advantage of this international conference to examine the national conditions, learn from others, and thoroughly discuss the plan to improve our country's science education, such as the selection of teaching materials, the flexible use of teaching methods, the compilation of books, the preparation of instruments, the design of experiments, the adoption of audio-visual education, the instillation of scientific knowledge to the general public, etc. All of these should be discussed and considered comprehensively, taking into account the appropriateness of the time and place, and referring to the successful experiences and implementation situations of other countries, to create a practical and feasible plan, so as to improve the fundamental aspects, correct the past biased shortcomings, put science education on the right track, create a model, and set an example. If our country can benefit from the Basic Education Conference before other countries, then this Nanjing conference will not be in vain!

Dr. Julian Huxley, Secretary-General of UNESCO, is a famous scientist who has high expectations for the Nanjing Conference. In his congratulatory message, there is a warning, namely, "How can scientific knowledge be transmitted to non-experts?" It can be said that he understands my heart first. It is hoped that the delegates will follow this intention as a guide for the conference.

### Piercing Through the Clouds and Mist! Television Reconnaissance Aircraft

— Bai Gao

Reconnaissance aircraft using television have gradually shown their potential in modern warfare technology. Currently, some scientists and military experts are working hard to research it, seeking military convenience.

A very high-flying aircraft uses wireless television to transmit the truth of the shelled area to the rear, allowing officers at the artillery position twenty miles away to "see" the results after the shelling. This may seem incredible, but French scientists have been secretly verifying it for two years and have achieved this goal, which has aroused serious attention from the French government.

French government personnel have witnessed a film taken on a reconnaissance plane being replayed on a set of televisions a few miles away - and the interval between taking the film and replaying it was only seven seconds!

There is no specific name for this invention, and it is tentatively called "Invention X." Its detailed content is still kept secret, but it is indeed an amazing invention.

A special aircraft has now been designed that can carry a moving picture camera to take detailed pictures of the ground from an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Taking moving pictures from high altitudes has been used in military and commercial applications for many years, and there is nothing surprising about it. However, television reconnaissance aircraft even use infrared cameras to take pictures of the ground through fog or clouds, so they can be used in any weather. Even if the enemy uses smoke screens, they cannot escape its reconnaissance.

This camera is activated by an inspector by hand. It has a large and movable viewfinder that helps him to direct the lens to cover a large area. When the aircraft reaches the ground that needs to be scouted, the photographer orders the film to be activated, and the film automatically passes through the camera.

However, after the film passes through the camera, it is not wound on a spool for development after the aircraft returns to base. Instead, it immediately passes through a developing cabinet, then through a fixing bath, and is washed with a fine water jet. After the washing is completed, the film passes under a television dissector disk, which is connected to a small but powerful transmitter in another compartment on the aircraft.

However, there are many difficulties to overcome in order for this procedure to be put into practical use. The temperature of the air and its effect on film development are still minor problems among all the difficulties. However, the French government and researchers are still fighting hard.

A barrage of shells concentrates on an enemy stronghold a few miles away, and officers can sit at the artillery position outside the firing line and watch their power from the explosion of the shells to the appearance of the destruction work on the screen, which only takes seven seconds. With the report of such a television, it is not difficult to quickly correct the inaccurate shooting of the shells, and any important changes in the target will also be clearly exposed.

The enemy will certainly be jealous of this reconnaissance aircraft and will try to drive it away. However, the television reconnaissance aircraft can also be armed for self-defense, and there must be a squadron of fighter planes to defend it to resist enemy aircraft attacking it in the air.

### Seawater

Shen Ping

Why is it blue?

The theory that seawater turns blue due to the reflection of the sky's blue color has recently been refuted by Dr. G. K. Jenkins, a professor of physics at the University of California, and Dr. Bowen, the director of the Wilson Mountain Observatory, as false. They found when exploring submarines that countless impurities in seawater reflect the sunlight they receive to the surface of the water, but the reflected light must penetrate several feet to dozens of feet of water before it can reach the surface; therefore, the water absorbs the red and yellow colors in the sunlight, and the remaining green, blue, and violet colors combine to form the true blue of the deep sea.

### Arctic Resources

— Song Wu

The Arctic region is very rich in resources. The large forests on the continents north and south of 60 degrees north latitude are the most valuable resources in the world, and have not yet been fully utilized. At the same time, there are still large areas of fertile farmland that have not been cultivated, such as the area south of the Great Slave Lake in Canada. The agricultural boundary in Siberia has been pushed to 68 degrees north latitude. For example, near Igarka north of the Arctic Circle, potatoes and vegetables can be grown. Many places in the Arctic are covered with shrubs, grasses, and various plants such as mosses and lichens.

In the Arctic's icy and snowy land, there is very little human activity, but the types and quantities of animals are still very large. Those with special economic value include reindeer, musk oxen, muskrats, white rabbits, lemmings, otters, minks, wolves, dogs, foxes, bears, etc. on land; and seals, walruses, whales, sharks, etc. at sea; and there are also many types of birds in the air. Among them, the meat of deer, bears, and fish can be used for free. Alaska currently has a large-scale deer farming industry; the oil in the bodies of seals and whales is the most convenient source of fuel for heating and burning in the local area; the fur of various animals can be used to keep warm; shark oil is an important raw material for making cod liver oil; Arctic dogs are tall and powerful, and are used to haul sleds and are the most convenient means of transportation in icy and snowy areas.

The Arctic is rich in mineral resources and has great development prospects. Siberia and the North American coast along the Arctic Ocean may become one of the world's largest oil production centers in the future. The Norman oil well in the lower reaches of the Mackenzie River in northwestern Canada has been equipped with a refinery and has laid oil pipelines to the Whitehorse station on the Alaska Highway to supply the needs of cars and airplanes. Coalfields are very wide in the Siberian Arctic Circle and on the Spitzbergen Islands, and the Soviet Union has begun to mine them. The Arctic regions of Siberia, Canada, and Alaska are famous for producing gold. For example, the Yakutsk Republic and the Yukon River Basin are world-famous gold production centers. Uranium is the raw material for making atomic bombs. The world's most important radium ore is in the Eldorado mining area on the shore of the Great Bear Lake in Canada. At present, the area has formed a town called Port Radium, with more than 200 miners. The ore sand is transported to Port Hope on Lake Ontario by river or air. Niagara's hydroelectric power is used to set up a factory to refine plutonium and uranium. The uranium used by the United States to make atomic bombs during World War II was mainly supplied from here.

### Can Energy Become Matter?

— Shan Shi

Is it possible for electrical energy to be transformed into a physical object and for its energy to continue to exist? What is the force - stronger than electricity and gravity - that can link the nuclei of atoms together? Can electricity be "directly" derived from a group of atoms? Can atoms be used as a source of heat? How can we prevent "nuclear boilers" from exploding? Is it possible for atomic energy to be the driving force of all machines?

Regarding these questions, scientists believe that the application of atomic energy in peacetime must be as great as its contribution in wartime. To achieve this goal, all countries are devoting their full efforts to research. In the United States, the Atomic Energy Research Commission has established two work centers: the Argonne Laboratory near Chicago and the Brookhaven Laboratory on Long Island. They are working hard to find the relationship between the isotopes of radioactive elements and energy and machinery, the structure of the molecules or atoms of metallurgical elements, and use uranium, graphite, and other substances to do experiments, hoping to get the best results, and the effects of atomic energy on the human body and its effects in biology and chemistry are regarded as the focus of research.

According to the latest publication in the American scientific magazine, a machine that can generate one trillion volts has been planned. At the same time, according to Professor Rabi of Columbia University (who won the Nobel Prize), it may be possible to reach three or four trillion volts or more in the future! His explanation is: "This energy The mass of protons or neutrons is possible."

A proton is the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, and it immediately combines with free electrons to form gas. Therefore, for a large number of volts of energy, scientists hope to prove the phenomenon of "the explosion of an atomic bomb, matter can become energy, and energy will definitely become matter!

### Talking About Aerial Surveying

— Ruan Mengkuan

The Shanghai Municipal Government invited the Air Force Headquarters to conduct an aerial survey and mapping of the entire city of Shanghai. The long-silent aerial surveying has received this news, and I am very happy.

Speaking of aerial surveying, the application of airplanes to take pictures and make maps has already begun in European and American countries. During the First World War, the German army used aerial photography to scout the terrain and gained a lot. Afterwards, various countries adopted it successively, not only for military reconnaissance, but also for land surveying. It has also been around for more than ten years in our country, but it was once stopped during the War of Resistance. Before the war, it was also a sensation, such as the surveying of Zhaopu, Nanchang, the Yellow River flood, and the South China Railway, all of which used aerial photography. Now, scientists around the world are no longer studying the problem of aerial photography, but are studying the problem of aerial mapping, how to make the photos taken into topographic maps that are exactly the same as the real terrain, so that the height curves and the horizontal distance will not have the slightest error.

As for the steps of aerial surveying, it can be divided into control, photography, correction, investigation, mapping, etc. If there are height curves, three-dimensional mapping is also required. If we want to survey the topography of Shanghai, we must first carry out a manual survey to gradually reduce and control the vast area by using triangulation, the so-called large and small triangulation and traverse surveying. This type of surveying is beyond the scope of this article, so I will not go into details. However, modern science has already studied aerial surveying without manual control, and uses radiation triangulation instead. This type of surveying is completely indoor work, and points are selected on aerial photographs to control the area. However, it is used in remote mountains and wilderness areas with sparse population, and the smallest scale measured (such as 1:100,000 or more) is used, but for large scales, its accuracy cannot meet our satisfaction.

The second is aerial photography. Aerial photography is aerial photography, which uses airplanes and cameras to take vertical photographs in the sky. What is different from ordinary photography here is that one is vertical or steep inclined photography, and the other is side photography. The cameras and films are also different. The former camera is fixed, and the focal length is fixed. The latter is movable, and the focal length can be free. The lenses must be similar. The former has one at most, and the latter only has one. That is, the film is either full-color (red light should be sensitive to light) or a fish. Non-full-color film. When we take pictures, there are a total of four to five people on the plane. In addition to the driver, one person directs the route, one person manages the radio, and the other one or two people manage the camera. Most of the cameras are electric, and there are also manual ones. If we want to measure a 1:10,000 photo, we can calculate the flight altitude according to the formula. Assuming that the focal length is 21 cm (there are also 10 cm), the required flight altitude is 2,100 meters. We first ascend to 2,100 meters according to the barometer in the plane. Of course, the height that we ascend is not necessarily very accurate. We only seek its approximation, so the scale of the photos taken varies in size, and we must correct it, which is called correction. When we correct, we use a correction instrument to use the perspective of electric light. Make the control points measured on the ground coincide with the corresponding points on the photo. If they do not coincide, correct the height and the Chinese and Western inclination angles and skew angles of the aircraft. After correction, enlarge it into a 1:5,000 or 1:1,000 blueprint, add a field survey, and ink it to make a map. But this map does not have mountain curves. If you add the measurement of the mountains, there is a three-dimensional mapping instrument, or a multi-magnification mapping instrument, and then use electric light to tell a three-dimensional model, just like the three-dimensional map in the "Complete Map of China" published by Shen Bao, we put on red and green glasses, and we can draw the height curves of the mountains on the mapping instrument according to its three-dimensional model, which is a perfect topographic map.
