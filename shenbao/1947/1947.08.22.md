### Resolutions of the National Economic Council: Suspension of US Dollar Bond Sales; Treatment of State-Operated Enterprise Personnel According to Previous Regulations; No Procurement of Goods Other Than Silk Cocoons, Antimony, and Tungsten

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] The 12th routine meeting of the National Economic Council was held at the Executive Yuan from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 21st. The attendees included members Zhang Jia'ao, Lou Tongsun, Liu Hangchen, Sun Longji, Wang Xiaolai, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and more than thirty others, chaired by Zhang Qun. At the beginning of the meeting, Zhang first reported on the revisions to the regulations on foreign exchange and import-export trade controls, addressing the issues of gold note trading, whether to suspend the sale of US dollar bonds, and whether to continue procuring export goods. He also invited the attending members to express their opinions. After a heated discussion among the members, it was decided that the procurement of all export goods except silk cocoons, antimony, and tungsten would be suspended. As for the US dollar bonds, it was decided to suspend their sale. The Ministry of Finance was tasked with formulating detailed plans on how to handle the portions that had already been sold. The council also passed the following routine matters: (1) Regarding the regulations on the treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises, it was decided that, with the exception of the China Textile Industries Corporation and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, whose personnel treatment would be handled on a case-by-case basis, the treatment of personnel in other state-operated enterprises, such as national banks, would be handled according to the regulations passed by the former Supreme National Defense Council. This meant that the salaries and allowances of employees in state-operated enterprises should not exceed those of ordinary civil servants by more than 30%. If the enterprise had a surplus, dividends could be distributed once every three months. (2) Regarding the reorganization of provincial enterprises, it was resolved to appoint five members—Wang Yunwu, Weng Wenhao, Zuo Shunsheng, Pan Xulun, and Xiao Zheng—to review the matter, with Wang Yunwu as the convener. (3) Regarding cases of real estate among enemy and puppet properties being occupied, the Central Trust Bureau submitted a detailed report and proposed several opinions. After deliberation by the members, it was decided to have the Transportation Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee study the matter and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) Regarding the proposal by members Liu Hangchen, Wang Xiaolai, and Sun Longji to exchange domestically produced silk with Japanese rayon, it was resolved to have the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Central Bank study the matter before making a decision.

Attached: Regulations on the Treatment of Personnel in State-Operated Enterprises: (1) The treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises may be determined by the enterprises themselves according to their customary practices, but the total amount of their income shall not be less than 20% or more than 30% of the income of public school teachers and civil servants of equivalent rank. (2) The aforementioned compensation refers to salaries, public expenses, and all allowances. In addition, there shall be no disguised forms of compensation. The superior supervising authority shall conduct strict assessments on a regular basis. (3) If the enterprise has a surplus at the end of the year, bonuses may be issued with the approval of the supervising authority, but the maximum amount shall not exceed three months' income. (4) In the future, unless the compensation of public school teachers and civil servants is adjusted, the treatment of personnel in state-operated enterprises may also be adjusted at any time. However, if state-operated enterprises wish to adjust the compensation of their personnel, they must have the proposal strictly reviewed by the superior supervising authority and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be implemented. (5) All personnel in state-operated enterprises are civil servants and shall be subject to all laws and regulations pertaining to the service of civil servants. (6) If the compensation of foreign personnel and special technical personnel employed by state-operated enterprises cannot be handled in accordance with these regulations, the matter shall be reported to the competent superior authority and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (7) After these regulations are implemented, all existing compensation for personnel in state-operated enterprises that conflicts with these regulations shall be immediately abolished.

### Zhang Jia'ao and Others Fly to Nanjing to Discuss Supplementary Matters After Exchange Rate Adjustment; Tightening Loans is Appropriate for Stabilizing Prices

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, and Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor, flew to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st to discuss with Finance Minister Yu Hongjun other supplementary matters concerning the promulgation of the new foreign exchange control measures. The handling of the 36th year US dollar bonds is also one of the issues.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, returned to Nanjing by plane on the morning of the 21st after going to Shanghai to oversee the implementation of the changes in the management of foreign exchange and import-export trade. It is reported that the lending policy of national banks and treasuries will be closely coordinated with national policy to assist in the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement measures. Various head offices of banks and treasuries have telegraphed their branches nationwide to temporarily tighten loan operations. Various branches in the capital city have received orders to suspend lending for one week. However, according to observations in financial circles, with the settlement measures being revised and import-export trade being active, and with the autumn harvest approaching and agricultural products entering the market in abundance, the sudden suspension of lending by national banks and treasuries will naturally lead to tightening by commercial banks and financial institutions. It is expected that credit will tighten in the short term. Although this temporary measure will affect those with cash flow shortages, it is very appropriate for the overall market and stabilizing prices. The loan review committee of the Joint Treasury will be even stricter in reviewing loan applications in the future.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 21st] Joint Dispatch from Anhui Credit Agency: There is widespread concern about whether export commodities will rise due to the promulgation of the new foreign exchange and import-export management measures, thereby offsetting the benefits of the exchange rate adjustment. This morning, the reporter specifically inquired about this issue with Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, who replied: Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange and import-export management measures, the market reaction has been quite good. The government is closely considering and paying attention to various export commodities and general prices and has drafted overall comprehensive measures, so there will be no other factors affecting the benefits of the adjustment.

### United States Lodges Second Protest Against Continued Soviet Occupation of Dalian; Soviet Union Should Bear Full Responsibility for Losses Incurred

[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 3:00 AM on the 22nd Broadcast: The US State Department announced: The US government has lodged a second extremely stern protest against the Soviet Union's continued delay in reopening the port of Dalian.

In the first protest, the US argued that the Soviet Union had no reason to further delay opening the port of Dalian as a free international trade port, as this was clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 1945.

Another dispatch: The US government lodged a protest against the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Dalian. The protest statement declared that the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility for the losses incurred by the US in Dalian.

### Canadian Delegation Meets with Chairman; Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Reception to Welcome Them

### Varying Comments and Observations from the United States and Britain on China's Implementation of New Foreign Exchange Policy; Washington Officials Skeptical; British Newspaper Believes it Can Control Speculation

[United Press, Washington, 20th] US officials expressed doubt on the 20th as to whether China's new foreign exchange policy would materially help stimulate increased trade between China and the United States. Their opinion is that this new policy may temporarily stimulate China's export trade, but this effect will be weakened in a very short period by China's general economic turmoil. They say that as a result of the new policy, the prices of some Chinese commodities have already risen. This policy clearly cannot stop inflation and may in fact stimulate it. A well-informed official believes that exports such as bristles, wool for rugs, and other luxury goods such as pre-war embroidered products may suddenly increase, but this is an insignificant part of China's trade. He pointed out that tung oil, one of China's important exports, which is controlled and exported by the government, does not receive the benefit of 40,000 Legal Tender for every US dollar under the new foreign exchange policy, but maintains the exchange rate of 12,000 to 1. Chinese raw silk may still encounter rejection in the US market because raw silk has long been subject to competition from Japanese raw silk in the US. The US government's attempt to sell raw silk in the US has not achieved any significant success.

Some officials stated that measures of this kind would be ineffective unless the main causes of China's economic disorder and inflation were removed.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The Washington office of the Wall Street Journal predicted today that China's new foreign exchange policy would not be of much benefit to Sino-US commerce. Although the Chinese government hopes to increase exports and reduce imports in order to establish a dollar supply and make the trade balance more favorable, this may not succeed. The outlook for China's major exports (including tung oil and egg silk) is very bleak. At the same time, high US import taxes are currently hindering the import of Chinese eggs and walnuts into the United States. The war and transportation inconveniences have also prevented the export of bristles, wool, sheepskin, and camel hair, but there is a glimmer of hope among them, which is the export of Chinese luxury goods. Now that China can obtain more Legal Tender for each US dollar, it is hoped that Chinese exporters can supply new luxury consumers with these luxury goods.

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The economic editor of The Times of London commented today on the decision of our country's new foreign exchange measures, believing that this move is a good trend and may stimulate exports as a result. He said that setting daily exchange rates contains a certain degree of flexibility, because the exchange rate can move up or down without rising all the time. This move can also control speculation. He stated that the Chinese government can regain control of the foreign exchange market for a while, but any permanent balance of Chinese foreign exchange cannot be achieved unless two obstacles are removed. One is the continuous deficit in national finances, which eventually leads to massive inflation; the other is the obstruction of transportation, which prevents goods from the interior from flowing smoothly to the ports.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] The Hong Kong Telegraph commented on the new foreign exchange policy promulgated by our government, saying that this move has several effects in saving the devaluation of Legal Tender: (1) Foreign buyers can return to the Chinese market because their gold yuan can obtain a considerable quantity of goods, whereas previously, according to the official exchange rate, they could only buy a quarter of this amount. (2) Import and export merchants can obtain more freedom, especially foreign merchants who previously had to trade at official prices. (3) Increase in remittances from overseas Chinese, which is the most influential thing for Chinese export trade. In short, the Chinese government is determined to save the foreign exchange crisis and has a hope of success.

### Good Reactions from Various Places; Price Stabilization Trend in Peiping and Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 21st] Today is the fifth day of the government's revision of the foreign exchange management measures. The stability of prices in Peiping is unprecedented in previous exchange rate adjustments. Although market conditions have changed slightly in recent days, today they have all returned to their original prices. American yarn has also weakened to 42,000. Because speculators generally cannot estimate the extent to which the government has relaxed import restrictions, most of them are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and some are selling off one after another for fear of losing money.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] Today, foreign currency market prices here are extremely stable. The Hong Kong dollar has been between 7200 and 7300 all day, and one US dollar is still exchanging for 5.1 Hong Kong dollars.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 21st] Commodity prices in Qingdao on the 21st were stable, and the market price of the US dollar was 42,500 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] On the 21st, the Bank of China in Tianjin quoted a buying price of 39,800 yuan and a selling price of 41,200 yuan for the US dollar.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Today, the Bank of Taiwan quoted a buying price of 557.7 New Taiwan dollars and a selling price of 638.4 New Taiwan dollars for the US dollar. The market price was a buying price of 720 New Taiwan dollars and a selling price of 730 New Taiwan dollars, but there were no major transactions. The financial market did not see any fluctuations. Export goods, however, saw price increases. First-grade sugar was 1636 New Taiwan dollars per catty, black tea was 22,000 New Taiwan dollars per catty, Oolong tea was 28,000 New Taiwan dollars, and Penglai rice was 40 New Taiwan dollars per catty.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] After our government announced the new measures for managing trade foreign exchange, Hong Kong's export trade has not changed significantly, but transactions have become sparse and market prices have fallen. Tung oil is 161 Hong Kong dollars per dan, tea oil is 205 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties, raw silk is 1.7 Hong Kong dollars per tael, and lower-grade Min tea is 22 Hong Kong dollars per dan. The main reasons for the sluggish market conditions are: (1) After the relaxation of export controls, the export center for our special products has shifted from Hong Kong to Shanghai. (2) Domestic export goods have risen in price, and Huai merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### Chief of Staff Chen Arrives in Peiping from Shenyang; It is Said That Zuo Yisun and Lianzhong Hurry to Pay Their Respects

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in PanYang, 21st] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng took his staff to Peiping this morning and transferred to Nanjing. Xiong Shihui and others saw him off at the Peiping airport. Chiefs Gao and Zhang, Section Chief Chen, and others who came to Jin with Chen will not return to Nanjing for the time being because they have unfinished official business to attend to.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 21st] Chen Cheng flew to Peiping at 8:10 AM on the 21st. Chen had originally planned to visit Chengde en route, but when he flew to Chengde, he was unable to land due to airplanes in the narrow airport center. He flew directly to Peiping and arrived at Peiping Xiyuan Airport at 10:30 AM. Because the notification to various parties in Peiping was too late, only Air Force station personnel were present to take care of him when he got off the plane. He then took an Air Force Jeep into the city and encountered Li Zongren's welcoming car on the way. They went together to the Taiping Hutong reception center to rest. In the afternoon, Chief He Siyuan, Wu Qiwai, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Bojin, and others visited him. At 6:15 PM, Chen visited Hu Shi for a conversation, which lasted 45 minutes before he left.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 21st] After Chief of Staff Chen arrived in Peiping, there was an important meeting in Peiping. This afternoon, the local authorities successively dispatched planes to Zhangjiakou and Baoding to bring in Zuo Yi and Sun Lianzhong to Peiping to participate. Chuan arrived at 4:30 PM this afternoon, and Sun arrived in Peiping at the same time. Li Zongren hosted a banquet for Chief of Staff Chen at 8:00 PM in the evening, inviting Fu and Sun to accompany him. After participating, they went to the National Theater to watch Ma Lianliang's "Red Mane Fierce Horse."

### The Issue of Postponing the General Election Must Have a Legal Basis: Mr. Hui's Remarks in Shanghai

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Our City] Recently, some people have requested the postponement of the general election, which has attracted widespread attention. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited State Councilor Dr. Yu Chonghui to inquire about his opinions. Mr. Wang agreed to see him despite his illness and provided a detailed critique of the issue of postponing the general election from a legal perspective, demonstrating Mr. Wang's careful and sincere concern for this issue. Mr. Wang said: The election affairs in various places have been gradually established, and all preparations for the general election are being actively carried out. If a decision is made to suspend it at this time, it would be a clear violation of the National Assembly's resolution. The resulting consequences will inevitably affect the effectiveness of any resolution passed by the National Assembly in the future and will directly affect the government's credibility. The importance of this matter cannot be overstated. The Green Government has both a legal and moral obligation to implement the National Assembly's resolutions. Therefore, from the government's standpoint, even if there are clearly many difficulties in the implementation process of any National Assembly resolution, it should not hesitate or yield. As far as this general election is concerned, whether to implement it is one question, and to what extent it can be implemented is clearly another question. In my personal opinion, in order to show a sincere commitment to fulfilling the spirit of the Constitution, the government should do its best to handle it according to the law and should not make any other considerations. Mr. Wang continued: What I have said above does not mean that I want to dismiss the reasons given by those who request a postponement. In fact, I share the same feelings as them, but what I am concerned about is that the National Assembly's resolutions cannot be changed lightly. Even if there is a need to do so, legitimate procedures must be followed and handled solemnly. It is reported that some National Assembly representatives intend to solicit the opinions of a majority of National Assembly representatives through communication to decide whether to postpone the election or not. I still have doubts about whether this method of communication is legitimate.

### Armed Rioters Stir Up Trouble in Turpan, Xinjiang

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xining, 19th] Several hundred armed rioters in Turpan, Xinjiang, incited by a certain party, rioted and attacked the National Army stationed at Shengjinkou at 4:00 AM on July 12th. The National Army defended and counterattacked, and the rioters were defeated. In Lianmuqin, Handun, and Kumushi in Toksun, it was still discovered that bandits under the command of foreign chieftains were looting military supplies. They were dispersed after retaliation. Currently, the National Army is cooperating with the Xinjiang Provincial Government in offering comfort and is not pursuing the matter. However, rumors of the National Army killing people from Turpan have recently been discovered in Dihua City. From what is known, it is clear that a certain party is planning a deliberate provocation, attempting to destroy the feelings between the military and the people and to confuse the public.

### Inaccurate That Special Envoy Wei Will Fly to Tokyo in a Few Days to Submit a Memorandum to the Chairman; Our Financial Information Will Be Submitted to the Mission Immediately

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] A spokesman for the Wedemeyer Special Mission said that the special envoy is scheduled to fly to Tokyo on the 24th to meet with General MacArthur, and then go to Korea to conduct a factual investigation for a week to ten days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Wei Demai visited Chairman Chiang on the 19th for a long talk of five hours. The scope of the talk was very broad, but the content is still unknown. On the evening of the 21st, it was reported that Wei presented a memorandum on the eve of his visit to the Chairman, putting forward a number of important recommendations on the Chinese situation. The reporter inquired about this matter with someone close to the government today. According to the discussion, the content of Wei's five-hour talk with the Chairman is impossible to know. However, Wei discussed a number of issues with the Chairman out of his personal friendship with China and the Chairman, and may have had a number of personal opinions. Wei's mission here is to investigate the facts and prepare a report for the US government's reference. There are no diplomatic documents between Wei and our country. The so-called presentation of a memorandum is not a fact. However, our government, at the beginning of the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional government, is determined to reform politics and economy, so it is quite hopeful to know Wei's opinion and believes that it will be able to consider the situation and adopt it.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] A spokesman for the US Special Mission denied on the 21st that General Wedemeyer had presented a memorandum to Chairman Chiang, as reported in the Chinese newspapers.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] After Wei Demai came to China, relevant agencies of our government, at Wei's request, drafted memoranda on their respective areas of responsibility for Wei's reference. The memoranda from the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs were drafted and sent out long ago. The memorandum from the Ministry of Finance, which was drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank for more than a month, was drafted on the 21st and has been translated into English. It is about two hundred pages thick, with detailed reports and analyses of our country's financial revenue and expenditure, military expenditure and other expenditures, tax revenue, public debt revenue, and issuance situation, as well as various numerical charts for explanation. This report can be sent out within days.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] Professor Bonner Feller has recently completed his investigation of rural conditions and grassroots politics in Suzhou and will return to Nanjing tomorrow to provide a report to Special Envoy Wei Demai for reference.

When Du and others met with Wei, they presented a letter and gave a detailed account of the importance of the North (especially the Northeast) in China and the world in terms of politics, military affairs, and economy. They also mentioned the Soviet Union's assistance to the Communist army and the White Pagoda Mountain incident. They also clearly expressed their opposition to the suggestion of withdrawing from the North made by some people. According to one representative, although Wei did not express his opinion during the talks, Wei seemed very satisfied with what the society said from his expression, and his understanding of China was also clear and accurate.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] General Wei Demai met with Minister Chen Lifu, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, Mayor Shen Yi, Edwards, the representative of the American Aid to China Association in China, and famous figures from North China and the Northeast in the morning of the 21st, Professors Wang Shengzu, Tu Changwang, and Ni Qingyuan of Zhongda and Jindai, and some student representatives.

### The Jiaoji Railway Fully Opened; National Army Seizes the Opportunity to Advance and Recover Changyi; A Major Battle Is Brewing on the Shandong Peninsula

[Qingdao Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] The National Army advancing westward from Gaomi captured Zuoshan yesterday. No bandits were found west of Zuoshan to Hama Village. The Jiaoji Railway is now fully opened. The National Army seized the opportunity to advance and join forces with another unit of the National Army to attack Changyi. They entered the city on the morning of the 21st and completely recovered it by 3:00 PM. Bandit resistance was minimal.

[Yanzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] The National Army's Wang Yaowu unit advanced into Huantai from Datian, north of Changshan, on the morning of the 21st. On the same day, the National Army in Boxing also entered Gaoyuan at 5:00 PM. Thus, within the triangular area south of the Yellow River, north of the Jiaoji Railway, and west of the Bailang River, all twelve counties except Qidong and Qingcheng, which are no man's lands, have fallen into the hands of the National Army.

[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] The National Army is actively deploying plans to pursue and suppress the Communist bandits, aiming to completely clear the entire Shandong region. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the National Army in eastern Shandong recovered Changyi and continued to advance. The main force of the remaining Communist bandits retreated and gathered around Laiyang and Yantai. A major battle is expected in that area within days. North of the Xiaoqing River, the National Army has advanced to the south bank of the Yellow River, sweeping away the remaining Communists.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] The Air Force destroyed over 30 vehicles of the bandit army transporting supplies on the Putai Highway on the 20th.

[Yanzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] A major battle on the Shandong Peninsula is rapidly brewing. It is widely believed that the key to this battle lies in landing at strategic points such as Yantai and Longkou on the Shandong Peninsula, so that the Communist bandits will be caught in a pincer movement. Recently, the remaining Communist bandits in the area have been actively strengthening coastal fortifications and defenses on the east bank of the Wei River.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] The government announced a blockade of Dalian, prohibiting foreign ships from entering or leaving, to prevent communication between the Shandong Communists and Dalian. It is expected that the National Army will also advance on Yantai to supplement this plan. Military observers are paying close attention to Wang Yaowu's unit sweeping up the Communist army along the Jiaoji Railway, with its second objective being the deep-water port of Yantai in northern Shandong. For months, the government has repeatedly spoken of the activities of Soviet ships between Dalian and Yantai. Once Yantai is secured, it can be used to supply troops by sea. According to a telegram from Jinan, the government admits that the entire Jiaoji Railway is in poor condition due to Communist sabotage and will take six months to a year to restore normal traffic.

[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] Due to the military victory in Shandong, various sectors in Shandong believe that the Ministry of Communications' original plan to repair the Jinpu Railway first and then the Jiaoji Railway after the rainy season next year is no longer applicable. They have decided to send a telegram to the Central Government and the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the repair of the Jiaoji Railway be accelerated to coordinate with military operations and facilitate economic flow.

### Eastern Henan Continues to Recover Shangshui; Remnants of Liu's Bandits Flee to the Foothills of the Dabie Mountains; National Army Crosses the Shahe River and Pursues Relentlessly

The National Army on the south bank of the Shahe River advanced rapidly on the 21st toward Zhengyang, Xincai, and Runan at the northern foot of the Dabie Mountains, where the remnants of Liu's bandits are located, launching a joint attack. The Lu Xi (Western Shandong) National Army's sweeping force surrounded over 3,000 remnants of Chen's 148th column in the southeastern area of Juye on the 20th and is currently encircling and suppressing them.

[Zhabu Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] Communist bandits between Henan and Anhui were heavily decimated by the army and air force. Remaining bandits sought gaps to flee. When Liu Bocheng's main force crossed the Shahe River, they were covered by Wei Feng's unit. On the 20th, the air force attacked the fleeing bandits, destroying their supplies southwest of Huaiyang. The railway near the Heshangqiao area of the Pinghan Railway was sabotaged by the bandits. Two spans of the large bridge south of Xindian were blown up by the bandits on the night of the 20th.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st] The southward-fleeing Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's unit encountered National Army intercepting forces near Yangbu and Longkouji, northwest of Xincai, on the 20th. The Communist bandits engaged in a hasty battle and suffered heavy losses. They are now collapsing and fleeing southward. The remnants of the Communist bandits Jin Shaoshan and Li Renlin were again severely attacked by the National Army near Baitan, north of Fugou, on the 20th, and the remnants fled eastward in a panic.

### UNRRA's Transportation of Supplies to Communist Areas; Executive Yuan Committee Accepts Our Proposals in Principle; Modifications Proposed for Transportation Time and Routes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The UNRRA China Office announced yesterday: The UNRRA Central Executive Committee discussed the issue of suspending the transportation of supplies to North China at a meeting held in Washington on the 20th of this month. The Chinese government has accepted the new proposal from UNRRA in principle but has proposed some modifications to the transportation time and routes. The original proposal requested that the Chinese government agree to transport 50,000 tons of supplies to the Communist areas, with half being shipped through Yantai to Shandong and half entering the Communist areas along the canal south of Tianjin. The time allocation was for 10,000 tons to be shipped through Yantai in August, and 20,000 tons to be shipped through both locations in September and October. The Chinese government has currently agreed to ship 10,000 tons through Yantai in August. The transportation time and quantities for the canal route are temporarily unspecified. The UNRRA Central Executive Committee decided at its meeting on the 20th to notify the Chinese Communist Party of the Chinese government's proposal and to consult with them. Furthermore, during the week from August 8th to August 15th, a total of 12 ships unloaded 17,488 long tons of UNRRA supplies in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Fuzhou, and Taiwan. To date, the total amount of supplies shipped to China has reached 2,227,291 long tons.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The UNRRA Central Committee held a three-hour meeting today to consider the Chinese government's counter-proposal to UNRRA's proposed plan to transport and distribute relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas in North China. Reliable sources say that the Central Committee has recommended that the UNRRA China Office reach an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party, based on the agreement already reached with the Chinese government, to ship supplies to Yantai. At the same time, UNRRA still has the right to decide on the allocation of the total amount of 89,000 tons of withheld supplies, of which 50,000 tons were originally designated for Communist areas, and the remainder for areas controlled by the National Government. The Committee further recommended that after an agreement is reached with the Chinese Communist Party, the first shipment of supplies to Yantai will reach 10,000 tons, and the amount shipped to the Chinese government area is expected to increase to 25,000 tons. If the UNRRA Office in China fails to reach an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party based on its existing agreement with the Chinese government, the issue will be referred back to the Central Committee for discussion. It is understood that the Committee's recommendation also stipulates that all supplies shipped to the Chinese Communist Party area via Yantai must be approved by the Central Government and comply with the following conditions: The supplies must not be used by the Communist Party for military purposes, and the distribution of the supplies must be supervised by UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA).

As soon as it is passed, it can be announced and implemented.

Editorial

### From the Tuition Problem to Rescuing Out-of-School Children

The summer vacation of more than two months will soon come to an end, and schools at all levels, from elementary to university, will open in the next few weeks. This marks the beginning of the first semester of the thirty-sixth academic year. Those who graduated from elementary school last semester can enter junior high school this semester, those who graduated from junior high school can enter senior high school, and those who graduated from senior high school can enter university, representing new progress in their pursuit of education. Even those who are continuing their studies at the same school can advance to the next grade level. For most students, after more than two months of summer vacation, changing to a new environment should bring excitement and joy, and they should look forward to the early opening of school. However, under the current circumstances, with the exception of children from wealthy families, most young students are worried about the tuition fees for this semester. Parents are also frowning all day, figuring out how to raise this large sum. Therefore, the tuition fees of private schools have become the most pressing issue today.

Private vocational schools and universities in this city held a meeting of school presidents last week and decided on the standard for tuition fees for this semester, with the minimum being two million yuan. The details are being kept secret for now and are not yet known to the outside world. Presidents of famous private primary and secondary schools also held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided on the standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees: 600,000 yuan for primary school, 900,000 yuan for junior high school, and 1.2 million yuan for senior high school. The news has not only caused panic among students and parents but has also attracted the attention of society. The Municipal Bureau of Education has scheduled a meeting with the presidents of schools at all levels this afternoon to appeal on behalf of poor students and ask the schools to voluntarily reduce tuition and miscellaneous fees.

In all fairness, under the current economic situation, the rise in prices is inevitable. For the sake of the livelihoods of teachers, it seems understandable that schools at all levels should increase tuition and miscellaneous fees. However, running a school is ultimately different from running a business. School authorities must consider the students' economic ability and must not adopt the attitude of "if you don't have money, don't come to school," allowing them to drop out of school. Looking at the facts, from January to July of this year, prices have increased three and a half times, but the fee standards decided by the school presidents' meeting are already more than three and a half times higher, which seems too much. Although the school presidents' meeting decided to increase fees in order to improve teachers' benefits, based on the actual situation of schools in the past, the increase in teachers' salaries is ultimately less than the increase in tuition fees. Therefore, we believe that the school presidents still need to reconsider the fee standards!

Running a school in the current environment is more difficult than any other business. However, during national reconstruction, education comes first. As the saying goes, "it takes a hundred years to cultivate a person." Education should be a national long-term plan. In principle, schools at all levels should be run by the state. However, after eight years of war against Japan, the country's vitality has been greatly damaged, and the Communist bandits' rebellion is consuming all of the country's energy. Taking Shanghai, the most developed city in education, as an example, according to a report from the National Education Department of the Bureau of Education, there are a total of 400,000 school-age children in the city, of which 250,000 attend private primary schools and only 150,000 attend municipal primary schools. This semester, the city's schools cannot increase the number of classes due to budget constraints. Based on this, the promotion of elementary education in Shanghai in the future will still rely on the assistance of private schools. Therefore, the public should not hold a contemptuous attitude toward private schools at all levels but should support them at all times. Regarding the issue of fees, all aspects should be considered to seek a reasonable solution. Do not engage in high-sounding rhetoric, ignore the actual difficulties, and force schools to reduce fees, which would make it impossible for schools to operate.

In short, it is expected that tuition fees will increase sharply this semester, and some students will inevitably drop out of school because they cannot afford to pay. Society must not stand idly by but should prepare early to expand the amount and scope of student aid so that these poor students will not be left wandering outside the school gates. In order to rescue out-of-school youth, this newspaper has decided to hold a scholarship campaign again. We advocate for society, hoping that people from all walks of life, with the spirit of "joy in helping students," will generously donate scholarships so that Shanghai will not see crowds of out-of-school youth!

### Concern for the Sichuan Floods

The Executive Yuan's meeting on the 19th approved two relief cases for the floods in Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces. According to our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, the government's relief measures for the floods in the Xu-Hai and Huai areas and other seventeen counties and cities in northern Jiangsu include seven emergency relief measures, addressing both the root causes and the symptoms. This is a valuable comfort for the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu. The details of the Sichuan flood relief measures are not yet known. According to news reports and appeals from people from Sichuan in Beijing and Shanghai, the Sichuan flood situation is quite serious and requires urgent relief from all parties. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about the disaster in Sichuan.

Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance." It has a large area, a large population, abundant resources, and its agricultural production ranks first among the southwestern provinces. Its handicrafts and light industry have seen rapid development over the past decade. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chongqing, the wartime capital of the National Government, with the help of favorable weather, geographical conditions, and popular support, completed the victory of the War of Resistance. There was not a single flood or drought during those eight years, and there were abundant harvests every year, and the people lived in peace. This year, natural disasters and man-made disasters have occurred frequently in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and unfortunately, Sichuan has also suffered floods. Chengdu, the center of prosperity, has been largely submerged in water. The areas along the Min River, Tuo River, and Fu River, which cut across the northwestern Sichuan counties, are rich in agricultural production. In the past two months, they have suffered two major floods. Disaster victims are spread along the rivers, and highways have been washed away, making it impossible to travel by road. The details of the losses and the number of disaster victims are still impossible to count. In Chengdu alone, there are currently more than 100,000 disaster victims without homes, and property losses are estimated at over 10 billion yuan. According to people from Sichuan, this year's flood in Sichuan is unprecedented in the past eight years. The people have suffered this catastrophe, and the provincial government has only issued an empty document of relief. Who will give them some warmth? Who will provide them with some practical assistance? The disaster victims in Sichuan have no way out and can do nothing. Seeing that the autumn harvest is hopeless, security is worrying. How will they survive!

Now that the Executive Yuan has approved the Sichuan flood relief case, and people in Beijing and Shanghai are raising funds for relief, this will provide great comfort and encouragement to the people of Sichuan psychologically. Judging from the course of the War of Resistance, Sichuan has made a great contribution to the country and the nation. It can be said to be the base area of the War of Resistance. In terms of military service, Sichuan contributed the most manpower. In terms of grain requisition and loans, Sichuan contributed the most material resources. In terms of donations and public bonds, Sichuan contributed the most financial resources. Without Sichuan, China could not have persisted in the War of Resistance for eight years. Without the loyal cooperation of the people of Sichuan, the rear could not have had such stability during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Two years after the victory of the War of Resistance, the central government should not forget Sichuan, Shanghai industry and commerce should not forget Sichuan, and people from the north and south who once resided in Sichuan should not forget Sichuan. No matter how you look at it, Sichuan has suffered a major flood and should be sympathized with and helped. This is not a repayment of favors but a conscience and justice that human beings should have. We are concerned about the Sichuan floods and hope that people from all walks of life can have greater concern and extend a helping hand.

We must also point out that natural factors account for half of the cause of the Sichuan floods. The lack of water conservancy and poor planning are the greatest factors. The ten-odd counties surrounding Chengdu are rich in products. Their farmland irrigation relies on the Dujiang Dam in Guan County. However, the Dujiang Dam water conservancy project is still in its original state, lacking modernization. In addition, historical management is unclear, and management is unscientific. The Dujiang Dam has not only failed to benefit the people but has become a disaster for the people's livelihoods. This is an administrative error. We are concerned about the Sichuan floods and are even more concerned about the local administration and the construction of farmland water conservancy in Sichuan. We hope that the authorities in charge will learn a lesson from this flood and be vigilant!

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 20th] It is reported that, according to the established method, in addition to the allocation obtained from the World Emergency Food Conference, our country can still obtain 1,398 tons of rice from Siam for relief purposes.

### Anglo-American-French Consultation on German Industrial Standards; Soviet Union Suddenly Protests, Claiming This Violates the Potsdam Agreement; US Decides to Ignore and Still Schedule Meeting in England Next Monday

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): The Soviet Union has protested the Anglo-American-French negotiations on raising German industrial standards. According to US official sources, the US State Department has received a Soviet note opposing the three-power meeting, arguing that such talks violate the Potsdam Agreement. According to US officials, the US government has decided to ignore the Soviet protest and continue with all original plans. The three-power meeting is scheduled to open in London next Monday. Similar Soviet protests have been sent to Paris and London. The biggest reason for the Soviet protest is that France has allowed an increase in German steel production. The four powers had originally agreed to limit German steel production to 5.8 million tons per year, only 50% of the 1938 level. The Soviet Union believes that it has the right to participate and advise on any action to increase German industrial production. Earlier, the US and Britain had agreed to increase German industrial production in the US and British occupation zones in order to support the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe. The US insists that war reparations should not be taken from current production, but Molotov has argued in various meetings that reparations should be obtained from German current production.

[United Press, London, 20th] The US Embassy here announced that Lieutenant General Clay, US military commander in Germany, and his political advisor will arrive in London by plane on the 21st to attend the three-power meeting to discuss German industrial standards. At the same time, Martin, Director of the Office of Economic Security of the State Department, and Gecob, head of the German-Austrian Group, will also come here as advisors to Ambassador Douglas.

### Suspension of Pound Conversion to US Dollars: Anglo-American Understanding Reached; Remaining Portion of US Loan to England Temporarily Frozen

[United Press, London, 20th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton suddenly announced today the temporary suspension of the conversion of pounds to US dollars. At the same time, Washington news indicated that the United States has agreed to take emergency measures to prevent the depletion of British dollar reserves. Dalton's announcement stated that after midnight today, anyone who obtains pounds in transactions with the British government or commercial firms, or through foreign exchange trading, will no longer have the automatic right to convert those pounds into US dollars, except for so-called American depositors. The current British economic situation is extremely severe. As of the end of July, Britain had withdrawn $2.75 billion of the $3.75 billion loan. Since August 10, another $242 million has been withdrawn, leaving only $758 million. Therefore, dollars must be conserved. However, holders of pounds are free to convert them into currencies other than US dollars. Restricting the conversion of US dollars will inevitably cause commercial turmoil and even hinder some supplies, which is regrettable, but unavoidable. If we hesitate, the situation will worsen. We hope that all parties understand that the government's decision is a wise measure, only intended to maintain the stable foundation of the pound and make it an international currency. This measure can also be said to mean that overseas assistance will continue to be lacking, and even the already scarce food rations in the country will be further reduced. In this emergency, laziness is a crime. We want to restore the national economy, and there is no other way than hard work.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Anglo-American Economic Conference entered its third day today. The United States agreed to take emergency measures to prevent the depletion of British dollar reserves, while the British side agreed not to use the remaining portion of the $3.75 billion loan pending consultations and ordered the temporary suspension of the free conversion of pounds sterling into US dollars. This decision was announced simultaneously in Washington and London. In Washington, the statement was jointly signed and issued by Treasury Secretary Snyder and Deputy Secretary of State Lovett.

Five Policy Directions for the British Cabinet to Cope with the Economic Crisis

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Morrison said at a press conference this afternoon that our economic situation is becoming increasingly serious, and we will encounter worse things before we get out of the economic crisis. He emphasized that the balance of payments abroad is the most serious problem. He said that Britain will use five policy directions to resist economic difficulties: (1) Increase the production of necessities (coal, steel, and food); (2) Increase the quantity and value of exports so that Britain can purchase the necessary imports; (3) Reduce unnecessary or temporarily unnecessary consumption; (4) Reduce unnecessary or temporarily unnecessary investment and consumption; (5) Adjust overseas burdens.

### Applications for Membership by Italy, Austria, and Hungary Vetoed by the Security Council

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): In today's Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union once again used its only magic weapon, the veto, and as a result, Italy and Austria's applications to join the United Nations were vetoed. Previously, US representative Johnson loudly appealed in support of the Italian and Austrian membership proposals.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st (Broadcast): The Security Council today vetoed the Hungarian application for membership in the United Nations, with one vote in favor, one vote against, and nine abstentions.

### US Requests That the Balkan Dispute Be Included on the Agenda of the UN General Assembly to Counter Soviet Abuse of the Veto

[United Press, Lake Success, 20th] The United States today formally proposed that the Balkan dispute be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in September for discussion. This is the result of the Soviet Union's repeated use of the veto in the Security Council and the Council's admission that it is unable to resolve the case. US representative Johnson hopes that the General Assembly will act to stop the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece. United Nations Secretary-General Lie assured that this issue would be included on the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. According to Lai, Soviet representative Gromyko yesterday requested that the United Nations agency recall the inspection team stationed in the Balkans, which Lai firmly refused. Lai told reporters that the Balkan Investigation Committee inspection team was ordered by the Security Council to remain in Greece and would continue to remain until further notice. The Soviet Union believes that two uses of the veto have automatically liquidated the Investigation Committee and its team. This attitude has led some to speculate that the Soviet Union and Poland may immediately withdraw from the Investigation Committee and its team, but Gromyko and Podezin have made no indication. In any case, it is undoubtedly the case that the small paper will be denied entry into the Soviet Union's affiliated countries neighboring Greece.

### Marshall Urges American Nations to Unite to Protect the Security of the Western Hemisphere; Mutual Defense Treaty to Be Signed on September 7

[US News Service, Petropolis, Brazil, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall said today at the Pan-American Conference that the economic reconstruction of Europe is extremely important to the economy of the Western Hemisphere. Marshall said in a speech to the General Assembly that the United States has undertaken a significant burden to meet the minimum economic needs of war-torn areas everywhere. But he also said: "In assuming this burden, we do not ignore the economic problems of the Western Hemisphere." The United States will continue to discuss economic issues with its sister republics and obtain a sound basis for practical cooperation. He said: "Our countries must do their best to achieve this goal." Marshall expressed his belief that the American republics will be able to solve the various problems encountered by the Western Hemisphere in the coming years. He said: "Today in Rio de Janeiro, we are concerned with the issue of mutual defense and security. Next January in Bogota (the capital of Colombia), we will continue to recognize and strengthen the American system."

[United Press, Petropolis, 21st] Reliable sources revealed that President Truman will address the Pan-American Defense Conference here on September 6, and the conference will continue until September 7, so that the Western Hemisphere Mutual Defense Treaty can be signed on the 125th anniversary of Brazil's independence.

### US Steel Shortage: Three Major Automakers Close Doors

[United Press, Detroit, 21st] The world's largest automobile manufacturer, General Motors of the United States, told us that due to the lack of steel, it has planned to stop manufacturing Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Buick automobiles, and may lay off nearly 70,000 workers.

### Second Batch of German Nationals Repatriated from Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The second batch of 806 German men and women being repatriated left Yokohama by ship yesterday. Former German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, was among them.

### Scope of Operations Expanded for Foreign Banks in Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur Headquarters previously permitted eight foreign banks to establish branches in Japan and start business. Now, it has further permitted these banks to handle various businesses related to Japan's foreign trade.

### Indonesia Actively Preparing for Protracted War; Hatta Appointed as Deputy Commander

[Our Dispatch] London, 21st (Broadcast): The Hague officially stated that if the Security Council cannot clearly order Indonesia to cease actions that violate the ceasefire agreement at the next meeting, the Dutch side will resume large-scale military operations. Although The Hague officials did not specify the nature of "large-scale military operations," it is widely expected that this is a prelude to the Dutch army's attack on the Indonesian capital.

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 21st] Radio Yogyakarta broadcast today that the Indonesian North and Country is preparing to move the capital to Sumatra. Vice President Hatta, now in Sumatra, is the government's plenipotentiary representative and will be assisted by a committee composed of one representative from each department. Hatta was also appointed as Deputy Commander of the Indonesian Army.

### Seoul Conference on Establishing an Independent and Unified Korea Nears Collapse; US Preparing to Return the Matter to the Four Powers for Resolution

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] According to reliable sources, the US-Soviet Joint Commission currently meeting in Seoul is expected to completely break down, and the unification of the North and South Korean occupation zones will inevitably fail. Therefore, the United States has reportedly prepared to return the entire Korean issue to the four signatory countries of the Moscow Agreement (China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union) for resolution. According to Seoul news obtained by Japan, the Soviet Union will not agree with Marshall's request to Molotov on August 13 that the Commission submit a full report on Korea.

It is also learned that US officials have very little hope that a successful resolution can be achieved after the Korean issue is handed over to the four powers, and are preparing to submit it to the United Nations for consideration and final decision. The US official attitude towards the Korean issue may be announced around August 21, which is the date Marshall designated for the Commission to submit its report. It is reported that the US delegation attending the Seoul Commission will submit a report to the State Department tomorrow for consideration, and the United States will also plan to take what steps to complete the Moscow Agreement to establish an independent and unified Korea.

Korean Communist Ambitions Increasingly Apparent

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] "Chicago Daily News" reporter Herles recently cabled from Seoul that this troubled land in the East is filled with fear of a large-scale communist-inspired revolution. It is reported that copies of the main plans for various steps to occupy Korea by force have fallen into the hands of the US military authorities. The initial actions taken by the Soviet army in this area are the same as the steps taken in some Balkan countries, that is, training and equipping the North Korean army. It is estimated that the number of troops trained there is about 150,000, and it may have recently increased to 500,000. It is widely rumored here that about 80,000 of these troops are receiving combat training in the Chinese Communist army fighting in Northeast China.

### Prospects for the Seoul Conference

— Pan Shixian

(I)

The situation of the United States and the Soviet Union stationing troops and occupying Korea is, in a way, similar to the situation in Europe where the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union stationed troops and occupied Germany. In Germany, the occupied zones are distinctly divided, and recently, the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe and the European Economic Recovery Conference led by Britain and France have formed a sharp confrontation with the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc. The division along the 38th parallel in Korea is naturally also easy to understand. Speaking of this, I cannot help but express a bit of injustice on behalf of the Korean people. Germany was the main culprit of Nazism and one of the main perpetrators of World War II, and it deserves to be divided and ruled today. Korea, however, was a nation that suffered under Japanese imperialism for more than forty years, and it was also a region that the four major Allied powers guaranteed would be liberated and independent. The current situation of divided occupation not only prevents Koreans from establishing their unified and independent nation but also makes it impossible for the Korean people to solve their most basic personal living problems. The four major nations that allowed and assisted in the liberation and independence of Korea should deeply reflect on this.

It has been more than two months since the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission resumed its meeting this year. Judging from the news coming from Seoul, it has fallen back into the stalemate that existed after May of last year. The issues that have stalled the negotiations are still the same as last year, namely the selection of which Korean political parties and groups to include. This situation will not be resolved in the short term. General Wedemeyer has not yet arrived in Korea. Once General Wedemeyer submits his report on Korea to the U.S. State Department, the Seoul conference will immediately reflect the result of whether the problem will be solved or will break down. The Korean problem cannot be solved in Korea; it is determined in Washington and Moscow.

(II)

At the present stage, the issue of the eligibility of political parties for consultation, on which the United States and the Soviet Union have conflicting opinions, is merely a superficial aspect of the deadlock in the U.S.-Soviet conference. The real issue is the differing interpretations of "democracy" by the United States and the Soviet Union. If the two interpretations can gradually converge, then the problem of Korean political parties can also be gradually resolved.

In addition to the fundamental issue mentioned above, there are some practical problems that are quite difficult to solve.

First: Regarding the internal political relations of Korea, how will the land policy be adjusted after the establishment of a unified North-South Korean government in the future? This issue is worth studying in advance. After Japan surrendered, in the U.S. occupation zone, the New Korean Corporation established under the auspices of the U.S. took over the land of the Japanese. How this land will be distributed to the Korean people in the future should certainly be studied. In the Soviet occupation zone, the methods of taking over and disposing of land are different. In northern Korea, the Soviet Union not only took over the land of the Japanese but also confiscated the land of Korean landlords, and has now distributed these taken-over and confiscated lands to farmers. The several thousand Koreans who reportedly secretly crossed the 38th parallel blockade line and fled to the U.S. occupation zone were these landlords. The U.S. opposes the Soviet Union's land policy. Since the policies of the two sides are different and each acts according to its own, the longer the time goes on, the more difficult the problem becomes to solve.

Second: Regarding the military organization, in both the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones, military training programs, whether open or secret, regular or irregular, are being carried out. Reports of the Soviet Union training a Korean Red Army in northern Korea have spread throughout the world. In addition, the training of so-called communist youth leagues and the training of public security police can also be said to be forms of disguised military training. As for southern Korea, although the Korean Liberation Army and the Korean Volunteer Corps, which had been in exile in China and had actually fought against Japan alongside the Allied forces, were denied armed return to Korea, the current U.S. occupying forces have approved the establishment of an officers' school with Koreans who had served as Japanese army sergeants as instructors. Military training of other various groups and political-military training of the police are also very active. In order to maintain local security, local defense forces are being organized in areas where there are no U.S. troops stationed. This is also a form of military training and organization.

Third: Regarding diplomatic relations, the relations between either the People's Committee of Northern Korea or the Provisional Government of Southern Korea and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot be considered normal diplomatic relations because neither of the Korean entities in power has been internationally recognized. However, since both the United States and the Soviet Union have established relations with the regimes they support and have obtained the benefits they seek, how can the United States and the Soviet Union be willing to give up their vested interests when a unified Korean government is formed in the future and negotiations are held on the rights and obligations to be inherited from the two regional regimes? It is said that the Soviet Union has signed an agreement with the People's Committee of Northern Korea that allows the Soviet Union to use Korean waterways, roads, and ice-free ports. The validity period of this agreement is thirty years. After a unified Korean government is established in the future, will the Soviet Union be willing to give up this right? If the agreement is still valid, will it also apply to southern Korea? Will the United States also demand equal rights? Will this kind of treaty be a problem for Korean independence?

(III)

Although the future of the Seoul conference is not optimistic, for the sake of the lives of the thirty million Korean people, the United States and the Soviet Union should use all possible means to break this deadlock. If both the United States and the Soviet Union believe that the method of direct negotiation, like the negotiations held before May of last year and the current negotiations, cannot lead to a conclusion, then they can also change the method. If both the United States and the Soviet Union are sincere in breaking the deadlock and are willing to consider more neutral, moderate, and compromise opinions, can they invite China and Britain to participate in the negotiations to resolve the Korean problem? In this way, it would be easier to find conciliatory and compromise opinions and obtain a rational way to resolve the Korean problem. I believe this is what the Korean people earnestly expect. However, to sum up, the future of the Seoul conference depends on whether the United States and the Soviet Union have the sincerity to solve the Korean problem.

### Bathhouse Workers' Petition Incident - Great View Garden Destroyed - Chairman Injured - Forty-Four Perpetrators Arrested

[Our Newspaper] More than 400 bathhouse workers and members of the bathhouse industry trade union in the city, demanding the release of two arrested workers, went to the city government to see Mayor Wu at 5 p.m. the night before but did not meet him. At 10 a.m. yesterday, they went to the city government to petition again. The authorities did not receive them, stating that the arrested workers had acted improperly and had already been transferred to the court for interrogation. The petitioning crowd dispersed at 1 p.m. and advised colleagues along the way to join the petition. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 p.m., more than 100 workers in the industry, because their petition to the city government had yielded no results, marched to the Great View Garden Bathhouse on Mud City Bridge, demanding that the manager, Yang Shaoxiong, the current chairman of the bathhouse industry association, explain the reason for his failure to mediate this time. Seeing the threatening situation, Yang avoided an accident by hiding in a small loft on the third floor, refusing to come out. This provoked the anger of the crowd, and some of the workers destroyed the equipment of the bathhouse. They then rushed upstairs and into the loft. The loft was small and crowded, and it suddenly collapsed, seriously injuring Yang on the spot. The Old City Police Station, after being fully informed, sent a large number of police officers to the scene, arrested 44 workers involved in the incident and took them to the station for interrogation, and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.

According to Shen, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor-management dispute at the bathhouse had already been settled with a mediation record, and work was originally scheduled to resume yesterday. The owner of the bathhouse was confused by superstition and insisted on choosing an auspicious day to reopen, leading to the misunderstanding. According to another source, the employer had previously reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, stating that they would dismiss Peng Zhaolin, Kong Shishi, and 13 other workers who were lazy and inactive. The Social Affairs Bureau has now sent a letter to the Penglai Police Station requesting a report on the handling of this labor-management dispute before further review.

### Public Utilities Request Price Adjustments - City Government Sends Personnel to Beijing to Report and Request Instructions

[Our Newspaper] After the government implemented new foreign exchange control measures, the cost of various public utilities in the city is expected to increase, but the central government has stipulated that price increases are not allowed to avoid stimulating inflation. In order to allow public utilities to temporarily maintain their original prices and to take into account the losses of employers, the City Government's Public Utilities Bureau sent Xu Zhaolin, director of the technical office, and Liu Shengqu, chief of the telecommunications section, to Beijing the night before, to report to the National Economic Commission and request instructions. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai this morning. It is reported that the main purpose of their trip to Beijing is to request the central government to allocate official foreign exchange for the fuel and accessories needed by public utilities. If the central government approves the original price of coal, the public utilities in the city are expected not to raise prices.

It is reliably learned that the public utility companies' requests to adjust prices and their detailed income and expenditure records have been submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for careful review. Whether or not to allow the adjustments will be decided after Director Xu and others return to Shanghai.

### Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Store Rice to Prevent Price Fluctuations

[Our Newspaper] Since the amendment to the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations, the municipal authorities have been closely monitoring price fluctuations. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently preparing to store a large amount of rice in preparation for the resumption of the dumping policy in case of rice price fluctuations, in order to suppress market prices. The authorities are also considering expanding the distribution scope and increasing the distribution volume.

### Movie Ticket Price Increase Delayed - Surcharge for Disaster Relief - Method Undetermined

[Our Newspaper] The cinema industry agreed to contribute 3 billion yuan to the flood relief efforts in Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Jiangsu, but because the various cinemas found it difficult to determine the distribution standard, and foreign film distributors did not agree, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that he would change the method and propose to levy a certain amount of disaster relief surcharge on each movie ticket, to be collected and delivered by the Finance Bureau. This disaster relief surcharge must be submitted to the City Council for approval before it can be levied. Therefore, the originally planned 100% increase in movie ticket prices will be reduced if a separate disaster relief surcharge is levied. Director Wu will report on this matter at this morning's municipal government meeting, so the increase in movie ticket prices will be delayed.

### Party Member Representative Congress Opens on the 24th

The Shanghai Municipal Congress of Party Members of the Chinese Kuomintang, decided by the executive committee of the municipal party headquarters yesterday, will hold its opening ceremony at 9 a.m. on the 24th at the main hall of the Municipal Council, and re-elect all executive and supervisory committee members. Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, will be sent by the Central Committee to supervise the election. The congress is scheduled to last for two days, the 24th and 25th. Representatives from each district are scheduled to start registering at 2 p.m. today in the main hall of the municipal party headquarters, and the deadline is tomorrow afternoon.

### City Government's Budget for Next Year Cannot Be Prepared at Present

[Our Newspaper] The city government's budget for next year cannot be prepared at present due to the excessive gap between revenue and expenditure. According to Min Fan, director of the accounting office of the city government, he has asked all bureaus and departments to reduce expenditures as much as possible and find ways to increase revenue, such as rectifying tax collection. The budgets of all departments are limited to the routine maintenance costs for next year. Temporary expenses and new construction project costs will be handled later when the city's finances improve next year. The above budget is expected to be submitted within days. If the total still exceeds revenue, another reduction will be requested, with the principle of living within one's means.

It is also claimed that the supplementary budget for the city government's bureaus and departments this year has reached 48 times as of yesterday. Thirty-seven times have been submitted to the City Council for approval, and eleven have not yet been approved.

### Wedding Ceremony Innovation - Notarization by a Qing Dynasty Judge

[Our Newspaper] Shen Fuxiang and Cao Mingshan applied to the district court to have a judge attend and notarize their marriage. According to the records, it is the first time in the city that a marriage has been notarized by a judge. Shen is from Guangdong, 29 years old, and Cao is from Jiangsu, 24 years old. They are scheduled to get married at Kang Le Restaurant on the 23rd of this month. It is reported that the court will approve the application and send a judge and clerk to notarize the wedding ceremony of Shen and Cao.

### UNRRA Records are Extensive - Inspection and Investigation are Time-Consuming - Hope for Reconciliation in Xu-Liu Brawl - Postponement of Distribution Director's Flight to the North

[Our Newspaper] Bi Gaokui, the newly appointed Director of the General Affairs Department of UNRRA, took office yesterday. Xu Shichang, his predecessor, will now serve as a commissioner. Although Xu stated that he would sue Liu Dehui, director of the welfare section of the UNRRA Relief Department, who had brawled with him, some UNRRA staff members said that Xu and Liu were close relatives. Moreover, Liu's backer, Xiang Jingyun (Director of the Investigation Department of UNRRA), returned to Shanghai from Hunan yesterday, so there is hope for reconciliation in this case.

After the incident of six senior UNRRA officials being accused of group corruption, the atmosphere was quite tense. However, according to those familiar with the UNRRA situation, the authorities' investigation work is quite difficult. The sheer volume of UNRRA's files and records not only requires a considerable amount of time but also requires several experts who are extremely familiar with technical work. Otherwise, in terms of the valuation of UNRRA's supplies, there will be a feeling of being at a loss. As for the rumor that Li Zhuomin, the deputy director of UNRRA, has sole control of power, Li did firmly request to resign when the former director, Jiang Tingfu, resigned, but Director Huo firmly retained him. Because Director Huo is very busy with all external liaison affairs, the administrative and personnel affairs in the department are indeed entrusted to Li for full handling.

Liu Guangpei Accused More Than Once

In addition, the position of Director of the Northeast Branch of the Agency has been decided to be taken over by the Deputy Director, Nan Bingfang, after Liu Guangpei was dismissed. It is reliably learned that UNRRA planned to transfer Liu internally as an advisor to the General Department as early as last autumn and winter, and to have Lu Guangmian, the current Director of the Relief Department, succeed Liu, but after the official announcement, it was withdrawn due to other reasons, and Liu remained in office. However, this is not the first time Liu has been accused. Therefore, when the Director of the Department of Distribution, Fu Sheng, was ordered to go to investigate, he brought several specialists with him to conduct a more detailed assessment. Fu was originally scheduled to depart yesterday, but it was postponed due to some reason. On the Supervisory Commissioner's Office side, Supervisory Commissioner Yan stated that he was strictly investigating, but he kept silent about the actual investigation situation. According to UNRRA, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office did not send anyone to the Agency to investigate.

Stamping Important Relief Items After Review

He Huimin, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office handling the case, did not go to UNRRA and related agencies for investigation yesterday due to other cases pending. It is said that the UNRRA accounts are as vast as an ocean and it is difficult to find any clues for the time being. However, the Director's seal is added to important accounts after review to prevent alterations. As for the sealing of accounts and documents, it is feared that it will affect the agency's official duties, so it has not yet been considered.

As for Director Huo Shishu, who went to Beijing to report on his duties, is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

### Five More Illegally Installed Intercoms Removed

[Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau continued to send personnel to the Mainland Building, Overseas Chinese Building, Enterprise Building, and the Sichuan Road area yesterday to remove illegally installed intercoms, together with personnel from the Public Utilities Bureau and the Telephone Company. As of the afternoon, Qingfu, Huayi, Qitai, Qicheng, and Gaoyi Securities Companies were found to have illegally installed intercoms and had them removed.

### Paint Store Manager and Deputy Manager Prosecuted for Unauthorized Lending

[Our Newspaper] Xue Berlin and Huang Jiming, who illegally operated an underground bank, were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to the indictment, Xue, residing at No. 6 Qujiang Lane, Hankou Road, is the manager of the Hua Kang Paint Store, and Huang is the deputy manager. Since October of last year, in addition to buying and selling paints, Hua Kang Store also engaged in unauthorized deposit and remittance services, with a deposit interest rate of 15% and a lending interest rate as high as 20%. The daily turnover reached 500 million yuan at its peak. Hua Kang Store also made a lot of profit from the intermediary exploitation. In May of this year, after the Garrison Headquarters learned of this, it sent the case to the Central Bank, which then requested the Ministry of Finance to investigate and then sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. After interrogation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the two defendants, Xue and Huang, were indeed suspected of illegally operating an underground bank and disrupting financial order.

### Du Yuesheng Has No Private Theatrical Performance - Charity Performance Held for Disaster Relief

August 30 is the 60th birthday of Mr. Du Yuesheng. Friends from all walks of life originally planned to launch a grand celebration ceremony. Taking advantage of the arrival of famous performers from the north and south in Shanghai to celebrate his birthday, they planned to hold a private theatrical performance to add to the festivities. After Mr. Du learned of this, he believed that at a time when the whole country was practicing thrift, he did not want to hold a celebration for himself and waste manpower and resources, and repeatedly declined the celebration ceremony. In order to comply with Mr. Du's wishes, the Preparatory Committee decided not to hold a private theatrical performance on Mr. Du's birthday. At that time, under the principle of no extravagance, a simple birthday celebration would be held at the Lido Garden, with only simple vegetarian noodles to entertain the guests. However, in order to commemorate Mr. Du's achievements, a call for contributions was issued to solicit poems and essays from celebrities at home and abroad, and compiled into a book for admiration. Moreover, Mr. Du has always adhered to the principle of self-denial and benefiting others. In view of the serious floods in various places, which urgently need relief, he plans to take advantage of the opportunity of the gathering of famous performers from the north and south to discuss and request them to perform a few days of charity performances, and all the proceeds will be used for disaster relief, which has nothing to do with the birthday theatrical performance. Du's friends deeply approve of this spirit of turning private matters into public service. As for the charity performance program, date, and location, they are still under discussion and have not yet been determined.

### Fu Zhengmo Reports on Conscription in His Jurisdiction

[Our Newspaper] Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, hosted reporters at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon and reported that Shanghai was allocated 3,000 conscripts, and conscription will begin on September 5 and be completed before mid-September. In addition to a settlement allowance of 4.05 million yuan per recruit entering the camp in the city, each recruit will also be issued daily necessities such as military blankets, straw mats, shoes, and socks. The Military Service Association will donate a set of uniforms. Family members regularly enjoy various preferential treatments. Fu also reported on the conscription situation of the Wu County and Songjiang Regimental Districts under the jurisdiction of the Garrison District, stating that the Wu County Regimental District will conscript more than 3,500 people and the Songjiang Regimental District will conscript more than 4,300 people. The Wu County Regimental District has now conscripted more than 1,300 people and will be able to complete the conscription by the end of this month. The Songjiang Regimental District has dispatched cadres to various counties in its jurisdiction to receive recruits, and will be able to conscript two-thirds by the end of this month, and all of them can be conscripted by mid-next month. Fu appealed to all sectors of society to assist in promoting military service. If military service personnel are found to be involved in corruption, he hoped that citizens would report them and they would be severely punished.

### Escorting Que Li to the Scene of the Incident to Demonstrate How He Murdered Yu Shengxiao

[Our Newspaper] Captain Willieford of the U.S. Military Advisory Group's Shanghai Branch recently released news about the interrogation of U.S. Army Corporal Malai in the murder case. According to reports, Major General Rooks, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, has ordered a military court to be formed in Shanghai to conduct a public trial. The date of the trial will be announced by Colonel Parkson, the chairman, and it is likely to be held within the next week.

U.S. military prosecutors, accompanied by police officers, escorted the Englishman Que Li to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate, had him demonstrate the situation at the time, and collected evidence.

In addition, this "Higher Military Law Review" will be organized by five or more military officers, with the highest-ranking officer serving as the presiding judge. A military officer with special qualifications will also be selected as the legal procedure judge to rule on matters relating to legal procedure.

### Propaganda for Joining the Military - Costume Parade

[Our Newspaper] In order to expand publicity and raise citizens' awareness of voluntarily joining the military, the Military Service Association has scheduled a large automobile costume parade for the day after tomorrow. It will depart at 9 a.m. that morning and circle around the city. The publicity parade is divided into twelve groups, with one unit in each group responsible for the design and layout.

### Comforting and Welcoming Soldiers on Expedition - Welcoming Participation from All Walks of Life

The Shanghai Committee for Comforting and Welcoming Soldiers on Expedition from All Walks of Life held its sixth joint meeting of committees yesterday morning and resolved: (1) Soldiers on expedition need Ren Dan, Ten Drops, Wan Jin You, Bagua Dan, eye drops, and Sha Yao Shui and other medicines.

### Good Men Should Enlist - Military Service is a National Duty - Talking About Conscription Procedures During the Conscription Period

[Report from our Newspaper] This city's conscription quota for this year is 3,000 men. The Ministry of National Defense has ordered the conscription to be completed before the 15th of next month. The Military Service Association recently held a meeting and decided that volunteer soldiers will begin registering from the 25th of this month. The barracks for the new recruits are also being repaired and must be completed within half a month, after which the recruits will receive training at the Infantry Camp. However, as of now, many people are still unclear about the various provisions, procedures, and conscription formalities of the military service. To provide readers with a clear understanding of the implementation of military service, we will provide a brief explanation here:

The authorities have stipulated that the city's military quota will be achieved through both recruitment and conscription, meaning that volunteer soldiers will be recruited first, and the shortfall will be made up through conscription according to law. Based on population ratio, Shanghai should conscript 6,000 people. However, since Shanghai is an important center for national defense industries, there are more people who are exempt or have their service deferred, reducing the quota to 3,000. According to the household registration survey results, there are currently 231,537 men of military age in the city. With a ratio of 3,000 men, an average of one soldier will be selected from every 77 people. Generally, it is believed that it will be easy to recruit 3,000 volunteer soldiers. If that is the case, Shanghai can avoid conscription this year. If the number falls short, conscription will be carried out according to law.

Before conscription, four steps need to be completed: background investigation, application for exemption/deferment, physical examination, and drawing lots. The background investigation work in this city has already been completed. The review of applications for exemption/deferment is currently underway. This step involves a wide range of issues and is the most contentious, so it takes longer. If this step is done well, the physical examination and lottery will be easier to carry out later.

Several Regulations Regarding Exemptions, Prohibitions, Deferments and Postponements

Applications for exemption, prohibition, deferment, and postponement of military service are limited to the following categories: (1) Those with physical deformities or disabilities or chronic illnesses that make them unfit for military service (with certificates from doctors and Baojia chiefs); (2) Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for seven years or more (with judgment); (3) Those going abroad on official business (with government approval certificate or other documentary proof); (4) Students in high school or above who have not graduated (with school certificate); (5) Those who are being prosecuted for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a minimum of imprisonment or are serving a sentence of imprisonment (with indictment from court and other documentary proof or judgment); (6) Currently employed specialized technical personnel involved in national defense industries who have been examined and approved (with graduation certificate, technical training certificate, and service certificate from the competent authority); (7) Those who have graduated from teacher-training schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and are currently working as primary school teachers for more than one year and have passed the examination (with certificate of passing the examination); (8) Those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families and have no siblings, or have siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under 18 years of age (with certificate from Baojia chiefs or certificate of service in the military); (9) Those suffering from illnesses that have been proven to make them unfit for combat duty (with doctor's certificate); (10) Public servants of various government agencies who have graduated from high school or above and obtained a military training certificate (with military training certificate and certificate from the head of the government agency). In addition, all men of military age are subject to conscription. Although Ji Feng, the representative of the Communist Party stationed at the Head Office, is of military age, Mayor Wu believes that he has lost the qualifications for military service and will not allow him to serve. From these, we affirm that military service is a sacred duty to the country. Those who betray the country should not be allowed to dishonor the dignity of national law.

Several Agencies in Charge of Military Service

After applying for exemption or deferment, the application will first be investigated by the Bao office, then reviewed by the district, and finally jointly reviewed by the municipal government and the Military Service Association at a review meeting. The list of men of military age who have been approved for exemption or deferment will be distributed to the districts for publication. This work will then be completed. Then, physical examinations will be conducted on a regular basis, and lots will be drawn. The men of military age who are selected will await orders for conscription into the army.

In this city, in addition to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters are two military agencies responsible for supervising and training new recruits. The Military Service Association is legally composed of the heads of various agencies to assist in the implementation of military service. The Association has six committees: propaganda, preferential treatment, physical examination, exemption/deferment review, lottery, and handover. Regarding the preferential treatment measures for volunteer soldiers, the Association has already decided to give each family a settlement fee of 50,000 yuan and a housing subsidy of 4,000,000 yuan. This money will be paid by men of military age who are exempted or deferred, divided into three levels: A (300,000 yuan), B (150,000 yuan), and C (30,000 yuan), to be paid when the exemption/deferment certificate is issued. The remaining amount will be donated by households that do not contribute soldiers. The measures are currently being drafted. As for the volunteer soldier recruitment methods, application forms and guarantee letters for volunteer soldiers can be obtained from the Bao office. After filling them out clearly and affixing the seal, they should be submitted to the Bao office for registration. After registration, they should wait for notification of the physical examination at their original residence. Those who pass the examination will be sent to the new recruit conscription center to await assignment. In terms of procedures, volunteer soldiers are simpler than conscripted soldiers.

Volunteer Soldier Registration is Extremely Enthusiastic

As of now, there are those who voluntarily offer their services, asking to be enlisted as volunteer soldiers, complying with national laws, and serving in the military. One is Cao Xianglin, age 50, currently a cashier at the British tram company. He wants to use his enthusiasm to inject a dose of confidence into Shanghai's 230,000 men of military age, and has written to Mayor Wu requesting a special recommendation. There are also Gu Ye'an, the executive member and secretary of the Fifth Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and Party member Fang Shih-hao, who responded to Chairman Chiang's call and took the lead in applying for voluntary service. There are still many well-known and unknown patriots who are requesting to register as volunteer soldiers.

Conversely, the ugly dramas of unwarranted conscription and selling soldiers have occurred frequently in recent times. Several cases have been investigated and found to be true. Mayor Wu has stated that he will deal with them severely. Commander Fu Zhengmo hopes that citizens will report the truth. Director Zhang Xiaosong hopes to obtain cooperation from all parties to eliminate the corruption of wartime military service and make Shanghai's military administration a model for the whole country.

### Visitor from North of Beitashan - Grand Duke Reminisces - Turbulent Waves on the Bulgan River - Camel Bells Weep for Lost Territory

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] "We must let people know that the Mongolian banners still exist in Xinjiang, amidst the clamor for East Turkestan." This was a remark made by Mr. Wu Zhongxin when he was the Chairman of Xinjiang Province. Now, as the Kazakh compatriots suffer in Beitashan, it is again brought to mind. Twenty years ago, north of Beitashan, in the fertile Bulgan River basin, the Mongolian compatriots of eleven banners had already fallen into the clutches of evil.

Damdingtsereng, the Jasagh Zhenguo Gong of the Khoshut Banner in Xinjiang, after more than twenty years of wandering, came to the capital a week ago, met with Chief Administrative Officer Wu, and was hired as a consultant to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He will soon return to live in Lanzhou.

For Twenty Years, No Peace

When our reporter interviewed him, he spoke sadly about the historical facts of that time and his feelings over the past twenty-nine years, through the interpreter Mr. Chen Shiduo. He longed for the fertile land, grass, flocks of sheep, and herdsmen along the Bulgan River where he grew up. "In the second year of the Republic [1913], after the Sino-Russian and Sino-Mongolian agreements on the demarcation of territories and borders between Kobdo and Altai, in the third year of the Republic [1914], the Beijing government sent three commissioners to survey the border. Each banner sent banner officials to accompany them. I was only twenty-nine years old at the time, and I personally walked the border of Altai. Later, Altai was reorganized into the A-shan Circuit. Our Khoshut Banner, the Zakhchin Banner, and the New Torgut Two Banners, a total of four banners, were set up as Bulgan County. In addition, the Uriangkhai Seven Banners were set up as Qinghe County. The Alshan Oirat Mongolian Eleven Banners had ten years of peaceful life. But in April of the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], disaster suddenly struck. Outer Mongolian troops crossed the border and invaded, and the people, land, and property of the two counties and eleven banners were all looted. Only three of the eleven banner Jasaghs managed to escape. I went to Dihua at the time and saw Governor-General Yang Zengxin, who also suggested that I go to Beijing, but I couldn't do so because of transportation difficulties. Later, when Jin Shuren became Governor-General, the situation no longer allowed for action. By the time of Sheng Shicai, it was impossible to even talk about coming to the mainland. Recently, Beitashan was invaded again, so Director Zhang let me come to Nanjing to report the situation to the authorities. For twenty years, the area north of Beitashan has never had a day of peace. Qinghe, Bulgan, Chahan Tonggu, and finally Beitashan, which is more than 600 li from the Altai Kobdo border, have also been invaded.

Rich Pastures, Endless Treasures

He paused, and then talked about the richness of the A-shan area:

"The Bulgan River basin is the best pasture, and there is also a lot of farmland. The Uriangkhai Seven Banner area (Qinghe County) is the richest gold mining area. The local people have always lived a wealthy life. Furs, livestock products, gold, silver, oil, countless treasures. Not far from the confluence of the four rivers, two Qinghe Rivers (Anle River), one Chahan River (White River), and one Bulgan River (Spring River), there is a place called Nalen Mandu (Sun Flourishing), where there is a mountain in the shape of a reclining camel. The white silver ore is completely exposed, and no one knows how deep it is underneath. But now everything is gone."

A Cage That Only Lets In, Not Out

"How are the Mongolian compatriots of the eleven banners doing now? Do they want to come back?" The reporter's question brought a bitter smile to his face.

"The border of Outer Mongolia is like a money cage. Once you go in, you can forget about coming out. In Dihua, I only occasionally have merchants who sneak across the border to see me, saying that the people of the eleven banners live under the oppression of conscription and taxation, and they don't even have the freedom to kill one of their own sheep to eat. They all hope to return to their homeland. This is a matter for the country. I believe the country will not abandon this large and fertile territory, nor will it abandon the tens of thousands of loving compatriots."

"We also hope that the territory, which is about the size of Zhejiang Province, can be recovered soon, so that Grand Duke Da can see the people of his banner again as soon as possible," the reporter said as he said goodbye.

"Ah! This is the only thing I have hoped for in this life!" His voice was touchingly agitated. I seemed to see the white silver camel in his eyes. (Reported by Pu Dejie).

### Corruption Cases Occur Continuously in Pingyang County; Selling Public Relief Flour to Obtain High Profits for Personal Gain

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 21st] Two corruption cases have occurred continuously in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province. The Pingyang section of the Ruiping Highway Construction Committee colluded with party leaders Xiao Han-chieh, Wu Bo, and others, using their positions and under the guise of resolutions, to privately contract with merchants such as Zhou Heng-shun to sell all 30 tons of public relief flour, and then withheld the proceeds. Upon receiving the report, the provincial government ordered strict punishment according to the law, and the county court has already filed charges. Furthermore, the North-South Port Water Conservancy Office of the county used over 200 tons of public relief flour to offset 50% of the advance payments to contractors, while still requesting the provincial government to allocate 240 million yuan, which was then transferred to the Wenzhou Zhenhai Industrial Bank and the Second Industrial Bank to obtain high profits for personal gain. This has been reported by the provincial bank and is currently being investigated by the Construction Department.

### Homicide Case on Sanyang Boat Solved; Five Million Yuan Reward Issued

[Our Pinghu Correspondent, 20th] The Sanyang boat homicide case that occurred in this county last winter, due to the massacre of all passengers and crew, though widely discussed, remained unsolved for a long time due to the obscurity of the case. Previously, the County Council resolved to request the county government to offer a reward of five million yuan to expedite the solving of the case.

### Suzhou Council Declares Closing Yesterday; Most Proposals Passed According to Review Opinions; Fiercest Disputes Over Electricity and Tuition Fees

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 21st] Today was the closing day of the Council. The entire day was spent discussing proposals, and the adjournment meeting was held two hours early to ensure that all 150 proposals could be fully discussed. Most were passed according to the review opinions. However, regarding proposal 693 from the Education Group concerning whether schools at all levels in the county could collect supplementary food fees or similar fees from students in the autumn of the 36th year, the councilors had differing opinions, with some advocating for allowing the collection and others opposing it. This sparked heated debate. Subsequently, the General Assembly resolved: (1) National schools should collect living subsidies ranging from 20,000 to 70,000 yuan. (2) County middle schools should handle it according to the county middle school's method, while county teachers' schools and county vocational schools should collect half. (3) City school miscellaneous fees should be increased to 44%, and the collection standards for private schools should be uniformly in accordance with the county schools, with the miscellaneous fee amount remaining at 20%. At this point, a temporary motion was made to request the cessation of excessive electricity fees and arbitrary price increases by the Suzhou Power Plant in June, which further intensified the atmosphere at the meeting, reaching another climax. Councilors unanimously condemned the situation, with voices rising one after another. Subsequently, the General Assembly decided on two principles: (1) The Council should send a letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting an explanation for the approval of the Suzhou Power Plant's price increase. (2) Councilors should be sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Beijing to investigate the content of the plant's request for a price increase, and to collect data on prices, coal consumption for electricity generation, and other information from power plants in Shanghai and Wuxi, conduct research, and then conduct on-site investigations of the internal situation of the Suzhou Power Plant to determine whether a price increase is warranted.

If discovered, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 32 of the amended Foreign Exchange Management Regulations: "In addition to confiscating their foreign exchange, the manager shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years." As for the reward for informants, the Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for rewarding informants of gold and foreign currency transactions, which were circulated for compliance before March of this year. The provision of Article 5 of the Financial Penalty Reward Distribution Details: "The reward given to the informant shall not exceed 30 million national currency per case per person, and the reward given to the personnel in charge of the case by the organizing agency shall not exceed 3 million national currency per case per person," was originally established for general tax penalties. The situation of cracking down on the black market for gold and foreign currency is special, and the Ministry of Finance has now agreed that the reward for informants can be exempted from the restriction of Article 5 of the Financial Penalty Reward Distribution Details. In addition, when asked about the recent tightening of credit in the market, they said that the government is currently urging the payment of the 35th year's direct tax, limiting the total tax revenue for the entire year to be paid in full before the end of August of this year. It is estimated that this tax revenue in Shanghai alone will reach 400 billion to 500 billion yuan this month, so it is expected that credit in the market will tighten recently.

### Hong Kong Government Assists Our Country in Cracking Down on Smuggling and Eliminating the Black Market Exchange Rate; Memorandum of Agreement Signed by Representatives of Both Sides

[Reported by this newspaper] According to well-informed sources, our country and the Hong Kong government have repeatedly negotiated and discussed the problems of cracking down on smuggling of imports and exports in South China and eliminating the black market for foreign exchange and foreign currencies in Hong Kong. Finally, on August 15 of this year, a final agreement was reached, and a memorandum of agreement was formally exchanged in Hong Kong on that day. Our country was represented by Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, who was sent to Hong Kong for negotiations. The Hong Kong side was represented by Mr. Fuchs, Director of the Finance Department of the Hong Kong Government.

It is reported that the agreement contains detailed provisions on the method of settlement of export trade transshipped through Hong Kong from South China. That is, for export goods from South China that are transshipped to Hong Kong via Guangzhou, the exporter should first sell the export draft to the designated bank in Guangzhou at the Hong Kong dollar value. The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange is deposited in Hong Kong as a fund. The method of payment and use of the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange is stipulated in four points: (1) The Hong Kong government can use it for importing goods from foreign countries. (2) Our country can also use it for importing goods from foreign countries. (3) If there is still a balance after the payment and use of the fund for a certain period of time, it should be returned to our country. (4) The fund shall not be used for the import trade of third countries.

Based on the above agreement, the Hong Kong government decided to: (1) assist us in cracking down on smuggling in South China, and (2) assist us in eliminating the black market price of the national currency and the exchange rate of foreign exchange and foreign currencies in Hong Kong. It is said that the Hong Kong government showed great sincerity in the negotiation process. Because the lifeline of Hong Kong's economy is closely related to South China, it should seek close cooperation in all aspects. The Hong Kong government hopes that we will maintain its due and legitimate Sino-Hong Kong trade and not discriminate against it. As for all the articles of the agreement, it is said that they will be announced simultaneously by our government and the Hong Kong government on August 23. In order to thoroughly implement the provisions of the agreement, the existing relevant administrative agencies in Hong Kong must undergo a round of adjustments and preparations to ensure strict and thorough implementation after the agreement is announced. According to observations by an authoritative person, the signing of this agreement between our country and the Hong Kong government, coupled with the promulgation of the revised import and export trade and foreign exchange management methods in the country, will complement each other and solve the long-standing problems of smuggling in South China and the black market for foreign exchange in Hong Kong, which have lasted for nearly two years.

### Opinions Expressed by Importers and Exporters on the Disposal of Imported Goods

[Central News Agency, this city] Since the Import and Export Management Committee announced the measures for the disposal of imported goods that have arrived or have been shipped without obtaining a license, Zhang Yaozhang and other responsible persons of the Import and Export Chamber of Commerce in this city recently expressed the following opinions: Regarding the goods that have arrived at the port and have been shipped without obtaining an import license, the Import and Export Management Committee has recently announced two measures for handling them. All those shipped before August 16, 36th year, can register with the committee and wait for processing. This is very wise and seeks a solution to the suffering of merchants, but the disposal measures after registration still need to be announced separately. Otherwise, it is believed that the registered items should be given the convenience of customs clearance and extraction by merchants. Most of these items that have arrived and have been shipped were ordered before November 17 of last year. At that time, our country did not have the procedure for import licenses, so the payment for the goods was almost entirely paid. Foreign exporters or manufacturers cannot ignore the contract for delivery because our country promulgated this import license procedure, and they will definitely deliver the goods according to the contract. In addition, after the disposal of these registered goods, they cannot be purchased or shipped again without obtaining an import license after August 17 of this year. If such a situation occurs, we will definitely support the announcement measures and deal with them strictly. As of today, the official foreign exchange rate and the method of supplying the market foreign exchange rate have been clearly stipulated.

### Rice Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday, a total of more than 7,300 shi of rice arrived in both the north and south markets. It was unprofitable to ship from various producing areas, so the merchants' hearts were quite firm.

The market situation rose first and then stabilized, rising slightly by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Mung beans from Sichuan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui were continuously supplied, and the market atmosphere was difficult to flourish temporarily, falling back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be taken from Shantou, and the situation was lively. Sorghum was outstanding, and corn was balanced in and out, and the price was neither high nor low.

### New Purchases Hesitant, Hua Stock Market Weak

Yesterday, the Hua stock market only showed some brilliance when it opened. Many parties took advantage of the situation to settle their accounts, and suddenly there was loose dumping. Rumors spread that the property tax would be implemented starting next month, and all factory loans would be recovered. The listing of the market price of the US dollar was also said to be reduced. New purchases were not forthcoming, and buyers were eager to settle their accounts. Except for Huafeng Enamel, which stood firm, popular stocks fell to low prices. Zhongsi even approached the limit down, and Meiya was also brought down.

The opening was stable in the morning. After the opening of Diyong Yarn, it was sold from 238 yuan by numbers 218, 32, 223, 232, 186, 97, 104, and 224.

After the closing, the asking price was slightly lower. Among the miscellaneous stocks, Zhongsi even approached the limit down. Only Huafeng Enamel had numbers 220 and Xingye Bank actively buying for deferred delivery.

### Third Review of the Purchase of Foreign Cotton Without a License Held Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the purchase of foreign cotton that arrived at the port without a license, the China Trust Bureau convened a third meeting at 10:00 AM on the 21st, inviting representatives from the Central Bank, China Textile Construction Company, the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, the Textile Adjustment Committee, the Export Control Committee, and the Audit Department. All cases received before the application deadline of August 15 were completely reviewed. A total of 57 cases were reviewed before and after, totaling 36,486 bales of foreign cotton. Among them, more than 5,000 bales were applied for by importers and cotton merchants, and the remainder was applied for by the Textile Construction Company and private spinning mills. Each applicant is currently signing a transfer contract with the China Trust Bureau. However, a part of the above numbers arrived at the port later than the original stipulated date of April 30, and must be submitted to President Zhang for approval before they can be purchased. For all contracted cases, if the applicant is a spinning mill, the spinning mill will still spin on behalf of the China Trust Bureau, and the cotton yarn must be spun into cotton yarn or exchanged for fine cloth within one month to one and a half months. At the same time, the spinning mill will contact the Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau to negotiate export sales, in order to recover foreign exchange on a daily basis. As for the foreign cotton applied for by importers, the Textile Construction Company and the private spinning mills applying for spinning on behalf of the China Trust Bureau will spin on behalf of the China Trust Bureau according to the type and length of the foreign cotton, and the delivery for export will also be limited. In addition, among the more than 36,000 bales of foreign cotton that arrived at the port without a license and were purchased by the China Trust Bureau in this case, about 23,000 bales were US cotton, more than 8,000 bales were Indian cotton, more than 800 bales were Egyptian cotton, and more than 4,600 bales were cotton from Afghanistan, Brazil, Mexico, and Africa.

### Tea Export Association Held a Board of Directors Meeting Yesterday, Deciding to Present the Difficulties of Export Sales to the Government

The Tea Export Association held a full board of directors meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Sun Xiaocun, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, and others attended. Tang Jisan chaired the meeting. The focus of the discussion was on selecting representatives to go to the capital to present the actual difficulties of tea and the remedial measures to be taken after the implementation of the new foreign exchange management method.

As a result, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Ye Shichang, Hong Jingwu, Zai Zhenhuan, Han Junheng, Song Qichi, Tao Zhensheng, Ning Weiting, Zhu Yanqing, Wu Juenong, Sun Xiaocun, Chen Zhongming, and Wang Xiangchen were selected as representatives.

According to the person in charge of the association, the government authorities are implementing the new foreign exchange management method with great determination this time, which is an effective plan to adapt to reality and save our country's export trade crisis. Therefore, Chinese and foreign tea merchants have expressed unanimous support, and they will actively promote and accomplish the task from now on, and will never allow the price of exported boxed tea to rise sharply. The issue of how to stabilize the prices of last year's and this year's boxed tea sales has also been discussed repeatedly, and specific plans will be proposed to the government soon.

### Rayon Falls

Yesterday, the market price of rayon fell sharply as soon as it opened because the allocated goods had to be shipped out. Number 120 of Takayama Yukari first called 25.2 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 5 million yuan. The futures price was called 4 million yuan for delivery in seven days. In the afternoon, the final selling price was 5.3 million yuan, which was 1.1 million yuan lower than the previous day.

The largest call was 180,000 yuan. Until near the close, because there were many retail sales, the price fell. In an instant, it fell within 100,000 yuan, and finally closed at 1.02 million yuan for the spot price and 1.05 million yuan for the deferred price. Dachen goods were only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan more expensive than Huagang goods. The closing price for deferred was 100,000 yuan, and the original price of checkered fabric, made of 37,000 yuan, remained unchanged.

### Benchmark Price of US Dollar Reduced by 500 Yuan Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee approved the benchmark price of 39,000 yuan for the spot US dollar settlement on the 18th, the designated banks have followed this benchmark price to trade foreign exchange in the past few days. As a result, most of the settlements were for exports, and settlements for imports were less, so almost all banks formed a situation of oversupply. Therefore, the revised settlement method has achieved initial results. Therefore, yesterday, the Stabilization Committee observed the actual market situation and reduced the settlement benchmark price of Tianhui to 38,500 yuan, which was 500 yuan lower than before. Calculated according to this ratio, the buying and selling prices of spot US dollars by designated banks were also reduced yesterday, with the buying price being 38,000 yuan and the selling price being 39,000 yuan.

### Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Not Changed for the Time Being

The prices of other coarse and fine yarns were also reduced by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan to 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Dreadful Uterine Cancer

— Xie Junshou

Cancer is a malignant tumor for which there is currently no radical cure. Therefore, when European and American women hear a doctor's diagnosis of cancer, it is as if their death sentence has been announced, and as a result, they have a sense of vigilance about cancer. Our Chinese people do not have much knowledge of cancer, and some simply do not even understand the name of cancer, so it is such a pity and how sad when they miss the treatment period! I encountered such a fact last month: Last year, a middle-aged woman brought her child to see a doctor, and she took the opportunity to talk about her mother, who is now over fifty years old and has not been feeling well recently. Her menstruation has not stopped yet. Is her poor health caused by excessive menstruation? She asked me this question; I then asked her, "Is there a lot of vaginal discharge?" She replied, "Nine out of ten women have vaginal discharge, so there is always some." I told her that a woman's menstrual period should stop after the age of fifty. If there is still vaginal discharge, she should ask a doctor to check for cancer, as cancer is a terrible disease that should be discovered and treated early, otherwise, it will be too late to regret! She simply listened to my advice and left. This year, she came to see me herself and talked about her mother, regretting not listening to my advice. She has now been sent to the hospital, and the doctor told her that she has uterine cancer, and the condition is already advanced, making surgery hopeless. They can only use radium treatments. After hearing this, I felt that the need to popularize medical knowledge is still a matter of urgency.

(1) Why is cancer so terrible? As mentioned above, cancer is a malignant tumor. What is the difference between a malignant tumor and a benign tumor? I will describe them separately below.

A. Benign tumors have a membrane surrounding them. Even if the tumor grows, it has a clear boundary with other tissues and does not invade them. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, have a destructive proliferative ability. Their periphery has no boundary, and they develop around the surrounding tissues as much as possible, using destructive means. Not only are soft tissues destroyed by them, but even hard bones are eroded by them.

B. Benign tumors, when they occur in a certain organ, stop there and do not spread from organ A to organ B. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, have cells that can transfer from organ A to a nearby organ B, or even to a distant organ C, through blood or lymph fluid, and the same malignant tumor can occur.

C. Benign tumors are completely removed after surgery. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, often recur after incomplete surgery if there are still tumor buds lurking in the nearby healthy tissues.

D. Benign tumors do not affect the entire human body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, can make patients look haggard, emaciated, and suffer unbearably, appearing near death. This is called "cachexia" in medicine.

(2) Symptoms of uterine cancer: Uterine cancer mostly occurs in women over forty to fifty years old, especially those who have had multiple births. The symptoms of this disease are, first, excessive menstruation or irregular uterine bleeding (bleeding with a certain cycle is called menstruation, but if it occurs every ten or twenty days, it is not menstruation, but uterine bleeding). Most women think it is just a disturbance when menstruation is about to stop and do not pay attention. Second, vaginal discharge. In the early stages, the amount of vaginal discharge is not very large and has a slight odor. Later, the vaginal discharge is profuse and has a terrible odor, but in the early stages, people do not pay attention to it because of the saying "nine out of ten women have vaginal discharge". Third, pain. In the early stages of cancer, it only invades the uterus itself, and most people do not feel any pain. When it invades nearby organs, such as the peritoneum, bladder, rectum, and connective tissue around the uterus, the patient feels pain. Feeling pain indicates that the disease is expanding. Fourth, in the early stages of cancer, due to the toxins of the cancer, libido decreases. In the late stages, the overall condition deteriorates further, the patient becomes emaciated and haggard, and develops the characteristic cachexia of cancer. If there is a mixed infection, fever and chills will also occur, and the patient's death sentence is imminent.

(3) Is there absolutely no hope for uterine cancer? That is not necessarily the case. If you can go to a doctor for examination in the early stages, that is, when women in their forties and fifties have excessive menstruation, profuse vaginal discharge, or local abnormalities, and the examination results show that cancer is suspected, then a tissue examination should be performed, taking a suspicious part of the tissue for microscopic examination. If cancer is confirmed, surgery should be used to completely remove the uterus, and then X-ray and radium irradiation should be performed to prevent recurrence. Therefore, cancer is not without hope. If the surgical period is missed, that is, if the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissues, causing pain day and night, and the patient looks haggard, even if the patient requests surgery, the doctor can only stand by and do nothing. Early diagnosis of cancer patients is a great blessing for cancer patients, but the lack of medical knowledge among the Chinese people and the sense of shame among women cause the best surgical period to be delayed and missed. What a pity!

### Preface to the Collected Medical Essays of Fan

— Fan Shouyuan

Looking around, one can clearly see the current situation of China and its social environment: the situation twenty years ago is barely improved today, twenty years later. The "problem of traditional Chinese medicine" from twenty years ago remains unsolved today. Although some progressive elements in the traditional Chinese medicine community and progressive people in society deeply feel that traditional Chinese medicine cannot survive independently and have a tendency and fashion of approaching science and studying new medicine, the conservative elements among them still account for the majority. They are still actively reversing course, running against the tide of the times, and still clinging to the theory of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, regarding Yin and Yang and the Five Elements as the "science" of traditional Chinese medicine. The general public is still very indifferent to medical issues and has very little correct understanding of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals. The majority of the people still have an abnormal lack of medical and hygiene knowledge, and their lack of attention to their own health issues remains the same. The epidemic of infectious diseases continues to occur every year, regardless of urban or rural areas, without achieving the goal of containment. In short, everything, everything, the past twenty years seem to have passed in vain, with no significant signs of progress. Isn't this mirror of the real society clearly placed before your eyes?

There are many reasons for the lack of progress: the political inability to unify and the years of internal warfare have made it impossible to build the country, stabilize people's livelihoods, and engage in production. This is the major reason that hinders the progress of all social culture. It is also the major reason that hinders the progress of medical culture. Medical culture is originally a part of social culture. Its development and progress must have its material conditions - economic foundation. For the past twenty years, the country has suffered from long-term internal warfare and the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. It goes without saying that there have been financial difficulties – a weak economic foundation. The authorities have adopted a nominalistic attitude towards medical construction and hygiene facilities, dealing with them perfunctorily; as for medical policies, they both want to follow the trend and believe in science, and yet they hesitate with metaphysics and refuse to let go, greatly reversing course. Opinions diverge and attitudes are ambiguous. As a result, people in the government and the public do not know what to do, making fools of themselves everywhere, a shame for the country, which those with knowledge regret and grieve! The eight-year War of Resistance ended in victory. The people hoped that China's national destiny, although it could not reach the sky in one step, could at least be expected to seize this good opportunity to enter peaceful unification, cooperate in building the country, and gradually complete a modernized democratic country; and that the shameful names of internal warfare and division would never again be seen in black and white. However, contrary to expectations, the flames of internal warfare, following the divergence of political views and the failure of negotiations, reappeared on the land; in the two years after the victory, the situation has greatly intensified, without any signs of stopping. In this way, with political inability to achieve peaceful unification and people's livelihoods unable to be stabilized, how can we devote ourselves to construction and strive for production? Therefore, all social and cultural construction undertakings are in a state of stagnation and paralysis, and the medical and cultural undertakings, needless to say, are similarly unable to be promoted and developed. These are all the actual reasons that have caused China's medical culture to have little progress for decades.

It is precisely because in such a Chinese society that has gone through decades of long years and still sees no progress, that the writings I have written over the years still have value for publication, and these old records of clichés still have the necessity to be retransmitted and repeatedly played. The target audience for my writing these chapters was the immature society at that time, and now that I have collected these writings and published them to the world, the target audience is still the immature society before my eyes. With the society showing no progress from one day to the next, my writings seem not to have died and are still living writings. Therefore, when I publish this book, my heart is truly filled with a sense of laughter and tears!

When will there be a time when my childish remarks and shallow writings are no longer needed? This depends on the speed of progress in our Chinese society.

When Chinese society reaches a new stage of progress, that is, when people in society and the general public feel that the remarks and writings in my collection are childish and shallow, that will be the greatest purpose and highest wish of my writing these writings for nearly twenty years. I hope that my greatest purpose and highest wish can be achieved soon! Because this wish, this purpose, is also the common purpose of all the Chinese people, the common wish of all the people!

Junqing's note: Doctor Fan Shouyuan, as a Shanghai Municipal Councilor in this session, has been working very hard in social movements in medical affairs for many years and has long been renowned in Shanghai. He has now been recommended by the directors of the Doctors' Association as a candidate for the National Assembly representative in the medical field. In the future, his great achievements will surely be a unique highlight in our medical community. The "Collected Medical Essays of Fan" mentioned in this article is his work of the past twenty years, which is the crystallization of his efforts in "social movements in medical affairs". Now that the country is beginning to build, there is an urgent need for talent. In addition to admiring Mr. Fan, I am happy to introduce it as above. (To be continued)

### Random Chats After Diagnosis (Continued)

— Wu Jihua

Anleuron is not the most advanced preparation among male hormones. Its position is between testicular extract and pure testicular hormone. Simply put, it is a testicular preparation that has been tested for potency by biological assays. Compared with crude testicular extract and preparations such as Spohlin, it is certainly superior, but compared with the most advanced pure testicular hormones in modern times, it is still far behind and can only be regarded as an outdated product. Although Anleuron has been tested for potency by comb assay, each cc contains two comb units, but its solution still contains many impurities, so prolonged storage often results in reddish-yellow granular precipitates and gradually reduces its therapeutic value. Most of the Anleuron purchased on the black market today is about ten years old. The efficacy of this stale old product is far less than that of the fresh product, but the price is so high. Isn't it a great injustice to pay the highest price and buy second-rate goods? Assuming you like to use natural testicular hormones, you may wish to switch to various products made by American manufacturers, such as Virosterone "Endo", which contains three or five comb units per ampoule of 1 cc, and only sells for 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Wouldn't it be more economical, and according to my trial use, the effect is similar to Anleuron. Or you can switch to Swiss-made Androstin to get a similar effect.

Padutin is a circulatory stimulant extracted from the pancreas. Its function is to inhibit vasospasm and dilate blood vessels on the surface of the body and the coronary arteries in the heart. Its indications are vasospasm, acrocyanosis, intermittent claudication, Raynaud's gangrene, obliterative endarteritis, trophic ulcers, gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers, essential hypertension and angina pectoris, etc. It is commonly used for hypertension, using its ability to dilate surface blood vessels to lower blood pressure. Because Padutin is a stimulant, it is the same as general stimulants, its efficacy is easily lost and it must be used continuously; according to the prescribed dosage, initially inject half an ampoule once a day, and after three days, inject one ampoule twice a day. If the effect weakens, the dosage must be increased to two ampoules twice a day or even higher. Calculated at the current price of 550,000 yuan per ampoule, the patient will have to spend about 12.65 million yuan on medicine in ten days, which is shocking. And after spending such a high price, can it really cure hypertension? This is not possible, absolutely not possible. Because the pathogenesis of essential hypertension is very complex, and no consistent conclusion has been reached so far, although there are many treatment methods, the results are not satisfactory. Preparations that relax blood vessels and relieve vasospasm, such as Padutin, are only drugs that temporarily lower blood pressure. Assuming the patient does not know how to maintain health or the number of injections is too few, the blood pressure will slowly rise and may return to its original position. According to my experience, resting the body and mind is the most effective way to treat hypertension. If you can abandon strenuous work and live at home quietly without asking about world affairs, take a nap for two or three hours every afternoon, supplemented by regulating your diet, quitting smoking and alcohol, and applying iodine preparations (potassium iodide is the most economical) and sedatives, then the blood pressure will naturally gradually decrease and not easily rebound. If drugs that relax blood vessels are necessary, it seems appropriate to take preparations such as Acetylcholine (Roche products, only 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per box of six ampoules), which have similar effects but are far less expensive. If you worship idols and go to great lengths to seek Padutin, you are really what Shanghai people call the number one big fool.

Dolantin is a pain reliever and antispasmodic drug, commonly used as a substitute for morphine to avoid the side effects of morphine. There are many types of painkillers besides morphine, why must you use Dolantin? If it is used as an antispasmodic, you can take German-made Octinum instead, which has more or less the same effect and is much cheaper (Swiss-made Octinum is even cheaper), or you can switch to the raw material Extract Belladonna Atropin, which is even more economical. In short, Dolantin can be replaced by other drugs and achieve the same effect, so why seek this expensive product? A female patient named Zhou came to my clinic the other day and I bought her a tube of Dolantin tablets. It is said that taking it can stimulate the mind, cause pleasure, and suppress dizziness and heaviness. I replied to her that this medicine should not be worth tens of thousands of yuan, and I was unwilling to buy it for you, so I gave her a few small pieces of Phenobar-bital 1/2gr and told her to try it. Three days later, she said that the effect was very good and she wanted to buy a little more. In short, the Dolantin business was broken by me.

Spring and Autumn

### The Small Village

— By E. Zola, Translated by Bi Xiushao

I.

Where is the small village? In what rugged fold does it hide its many white houses? Are these white houses gathered in the depths of a hollow around the church? Or do they stand in a row along the main road, with a cheerful appearance? Or do they, like mischievous goats, climb up a ridge, overlapping layer upon layer of red, or half-hiding in the green?

Does the small village have a pleasant name? A gentle name that is easy for the French tongue to pronounce? Or is it spelled with many German consonants, sounding very stiff, almost like the croaking of a crow?

In this small village, do people harvest wheat or pick grapes? Is it a wheat-producing land or a grape-growing region? At this time, what are the residents doing on the sun-drenched land? In the evening, returning along the country lanes, do they also stop to look at the vast harvest and give thanks to God for this blessed year?

II.

I am happy to imagine it on a low hill. It stands there, so hidden beneath the dense woods that, from a distance, it looks like a collapsed rock covered with emerald moss. But smoke rises from the branches; down the sloping path, many children are pushing carts. Thus, from the plain, everyone gazes at it with envious admiration; people pass by, with the memory of this half-revealed nest in their minds.

No, I would rather believe it is in a corner of the plain, beside a beautiful stream. Its extent is so small that a row of poplar trees like a curtain can shield it from everyone's eyes. Its thatched cottages, like chaste bathing women, disappear into the willow groves along the riverbank. A verdant pasture serves as a carpet; a hawthorn hedge surrounds it everywhere, making it a large garden. People pass by it, but cannot see it. The sound of the washerwomen echoes, almost like the singing of white-cheeked birds. Not a wisp of smoke. It sleeps peacefully in the depths of its green bed.

None of us know it. The neighboring cities barely know of its existence; it is so small that not a single geographer has noticed it. It is almost uninhabited. Its name evokes no memories. Among the many famous and well-known cities, it is a humble village without history, without glory, without shame, vanishing into a corner.

It is precisely because of this that it smiles so gently, this lovely little village! Its residents live in the secluded wilderness; many children roll on the riverbank, and women come and go under the shade of the trees. It, on the other hand, is very happy, living a hidden life filled with paradise-like joy. It is so far from the mire and noise of the big cities! Its sunlight is enough for it to enjoy; its happiness is created by its silence, its restraint, and the poplar trees like a curtain that shield it from the entire world.

III.

Tomorrow, the whole world may know of this village's existence.

Ah! A disaster from the sky—the stream will be dyed red with blood, the poplar trees like a curtain will be flattened by cannonballs, the destroyed thatched cottages will point out the silent disappointment of each family, and the small village will become famous as a result.

There will be no more songs of the washerwomen, no more children rolling on the riverbank, no more harvests, no more silence and humble happiness. Victory or defeat, one more new place name in history, one more new page of blood, one more tragic new corner irrigated by the blood of our youth.

It smiles, it sleeps, it does not know that it will lend its name to a great massacre. Tomorrow, it will sob, its dying breath echoing throughout Europe. Then, it will remain on the ground like a speck of blood. It, which was so happy and gentle yesterday, is now shrouded in tragic darkness. It will see pale-faced visitors passing before it, as people pass before the floor of a morgue. It will be cursed from then on.

We, if it is Austerlitz or Magenta (1), we will hear it echo in our hearts with the sound of victory. If it is Waterloo, our memories will have tragic echoes, like the sound of drums covered in black gauze, leading the funeral of the entire nation.

It must miss its quiet riverbank, its ignorant farmers, its secluded corner—so far from mankind that only the swallows that return every spring know of its existence! Already defiled, it will shamefully live forever in future centuries with its sky filled with the flight of crows, its land reeking of corpses, like a dangerous place of murder and robbery, forever remaining a terrible ancient battlefield where two nations slaughtered each other.

A nest of love, a peaceful paradise, this small village will henceforth become a vast cemetery, a public burial ground, where even weeping mothers cannot come to lay their gardens.

IV.

France scatters these distant cemeteries all over the world. In any corner of Europe, we can kneel down and pray. Our resting cemeteries are not just Père Lachaise, Montmartre, or Montparnasse; they also have the names of all our victories and defeats. Under the heavens, from China to Mexico, from the snowy lands of Russia to the yellow sands of Egypt, there is not a corner of land that does not sleep a murdered Frenchman.

Many silent and desolate cemeteries sleep heavily in the peace of the vast countryside. Most, almost all, are found at the foot of destroyed villages, their collapsed walls still filled with terrifying sights. Waterloo is just a farm, Magenta has only fifty or so houses. A terrifying evil wind blows on these tiny villages, their syllables, which the day before were innocent, are henceforth stained with such a large taste of blood and the smell of gunpowder that mankind will forever tremble when they smell it.

Pensively, I gaze at a map of the war zone. Following the banks of the Rhine, I inquire about the plains and mountains. Is the small village on the left side of the river or on the right side of the river? Should I look for it near a strategic position? Or should I find its location further away, somewhere in the vast wilderness?

Then, I close my eyes, unable to imagine this peaceful village, the poplar trees like a curtain hanging in front of the whole pile of white houses, this verdant field where many swallows fly over, this end of the meadow, this song of the washerwomen, this virgin land that will be raped by war, its horizon defiled by the sound of military bugles.

This small village, where is it actually located? (2)

### After Bathing

— Robert

Robert (1886-) is a Swiss painter famous in Paris. Thirty years ago, he waved the flag and shouted along with the Cubist movement. But in the past decade, he has been engaged in studying the classics and creating Neo-Classicism.

His works are mostly figures, with complex compositions and rich decorative meaning; the colors are bright and elegant, the tones are delicate, and the style is generally close to Ingres. Unfortunately, he is naturally lazy and has very few works. He is now sixty-one years old, and his entire body of oil paintings is still less than a hundred. Many of his sketches are also unfinished. This work can be called representative. (Liu Shi)

One

At dusk, the first big star appeared on the horizon. I gently closed the gauze window and asked them to tell their wishes.

One said, "I have no wishes."

Another said, "I have too many wishes to tell."

Another said, "I only have one wish. May God forgive me for not having great compassion and a spirit of universal love. I only faithfully pray that all the people I love and all the people I hate will be healthy, safe, and live well. Don't let them die, because if there is a long future, I will deeply love and bitterly hate. As for others, I can't care about them."

The other two shook their heads and cried, "This selfish person with the heart of a wolf!"

Yet, I don't know why, I seemed willing to forgive her ruthlessness. Perhaps her lack of universal love and compassion is wrong, but I was surprisingly pleased with this free and frank wish.

Without fierce hate, how can there be ardent love? Isn't it because of its thorns that we love the rose branches, making them appear so touchingly beautiful?

Two

"Dear friends," I asked, "if there were magical shoes in fairy tales, what would you do?"

"Wearing them, I would walk into the past," the round-faced girl, still with childlike innocence, blurted out, "to appreciate my adorable childhood again, and the childhoods of my father and mother, the childhoods of my grandfather and grandmother..."

"What a faithful slave to memories! Do you really believe that the 'future' is certainly better than the 'past'? My sweet little fool! If those magical shoes could also walk on the path of time, I would go forward, forward, to see the unknown and beautiful future, never looking back." These words were spoken by a lady with a strong personality.

The third person said, "Why are you just wandering on the path of time? I wouldn't. Dear, if I had a pair of magical shoes, I would wear them to the island where Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up, lives, to listen to his stories and the jade-like voices of the fairies. There are flowers as red as fire there, and there are four springs there—"

"There," the last person interjected, "do you know what kind of place it is?"

"I know, it's an island."

"Indeed, the name of that island is 'Neverland'," came the cold reply.

"Oh, 'Neverland'," a faint sigh, followed by the question, "Then what about you? What is the place you want to go to?"

"A place that is not magical, nor hard to find, perhaps not even needing magical shoes. It is the land of mankind, peaceful, safe, tranquil, without the terrible things of bloodshed and killing. Every child has a happy childhood, every old person has a comfortable old age, every person has a beautiful youth. There is no theft there, and no one goes hungry."

"That's not Neverland?"

"No." Shaking her head.

"That's not a memory of the past?"

"No." Stubbornly.

"Nor is it a dream of the imagined future?"

"No." Even more stubbornly.

"But where is it then? Searching high and low, everywhere is vague and unseen, perhaps it is even more eternally nonexistent than 'Neverland'."

"The place is not hard to find, and there is no need to search high and low. It is the land of mankind, which we all know—paradise is not far away, but only in a thought, the thought of countless people, isn't that like a pair of magical shoes?"
