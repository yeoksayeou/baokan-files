### US Emphasizes the Situation in the Far East, Sends Special Envoy Wedemeyer to China; Marshall Plan Expected to Expand to Asia

[United States News Agency, Washington, 11th] The White House announced today that General Wedemeyer (see picture) will soon travel to China and Korea to inspect the general situation in the region. Wedemeyer's mission is to investigate facts, and he will be accompanied by several experts. Wedemeyer is expected to return to the United States within six weeks to submit a report to President Truman. Wedemeyer will travel to China with the following staff members in the capacity of ambassador and special representative of President Truman: Finance Advisor, Mr. Jenkins of the Far Eastern Division of the Treasury Department; Political Advisor, Mr. Spress of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department; Engineering Advisor, Rear Admiral Texel of the Navy's Civil Engineering Corps; Economic Advisor, Mr. Wilkes of the State Department's Economic Development Office; Public Relations Advisor, Mr. Watson of the Baltimore Sun.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman has appointed former U.S. military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, as the head of an emergency fact-finding mission to China and Korea, leading political and economic advisors to study the possibility of extending the Marshall Plan to China and the Far East. The President's decision seems to indicate a change in U.S. policy towards China, influenced by domestic and Chinese pressures to support President Chiang's war against the Communists. General Wedemeyer, like Secretary of State Marshall, is a military man, and his appointment to this position is considered significant. It is said that Wedemeyer sympathizes with the National Government and its anti-communist stance. Wedemeyer's current position as a special envoy of the President is similar to that held by Marshall a year ago, but the purpose of the mission is different. Marshall was previously a peace envoy, responsible for mediating the Chinese civil war, while Wedemeyer's current mission is to comprehensively assess the situation in China and Korea.

### President and Our Government Welcome Wedemeyer's Visit to China; Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The news that General Wedemeyer has been appointed as a special representative of President Truman, with ambassadorial rank, and will soon lead experts to China and Korea for inspection, has spread throughout the capital, filling people with excitement. It is widely believed that this move indicates the United States will strengthen its aid to China, and it is hoped that this friend of China will once again cooperate with President Chiang to contribute to the stability of the Far East. Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh, with unprecedented speed, issued a statement on behalf of President Chiang and our government expressing welcome. Wang said on the afternoon of the 12th: "President Chiang and the Chinese government welcome the appointment of General Wedemeyer as President Truman's special representative to China. General Wedemeyer is an old and close friend of China. During his service in the China Theater after the war, he made significant contributions to strengthening the China Theater and promoting cooperation between China and the United States, for which the Chinese people deeply admire him. I firmly believe that General Wedemeyer's visit will enhance the American people's deeper understanding of the situation in China, thereby enhancing friendship and cooperation between China and the United States. This will also be beneficial to the general situation in the Far East."

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, stated: "Mr. Wedemeyer is familiar with the situation in the Far East, and I am delighted to hear that he has been sent to investigate the actual situation. This shows the active concern of the United States for the situation in the Far East. The situation in the Far East, from an international perspective, is closely related to the peace, security, and economic stability of the entire world."

### Assisting Our Government in Promoting Economic Recovery: The Mission of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Visit to China

[United Press, Washington, 12th] It has been learned here that the primary objective of General Wedemeyer's mission to China is to study how the United States can help the Chinese National Government without wasting its money.

The U.S. decision to send a high-level emergency mission was prompted by the following two reasons:

(1) Senate Chairman Vandenberg has been continuously urging the United States for six months to shift its policy focus to China, providing assistance to the National Government in resisting inflation and the Communists.

(2) Secretary of State Marshall, after mediating in China for over a year, still feels that there is insufficient information to determine how the United States should provide international assistance to China.

The United States chose Wedemeyer as the head of the mission because he has always been sympathetic to the Chinese National Government. Wedemeyer will be the second high-level special envoy to China after the war. Some observers express doubts about his chances of success. It is learned that Wedemeyer's additional mission to Korea will be secondary. Although officials insist that the White House's statement has no "hidden meaning" and that the mission is purely for "fact-finding," observers still believe that this move may have broader objectives, including the following:

(1) Determining how to assist China's economic recovery, the first step of which may be what the Secretary of Commerce hinted at last week: extending the Marshall Plan to Asia.

(2) Deciding whether the United States, after months of maintaining a neutral stance, should fully support President Chiang with justice and material resources in the war against the Communists.

(3) Analyzing the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the establishment of a provisional government in Korea to determine whether the U.S. will act alone in South Korea, as Secretary of State Marshall previously proposed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.

(4) Providing opinions on whether the Korean military government can be replaced by civil administration and handed over to the State Department. A special aid plan for Korea worth $200 million is still under study and has not yet been submitted to Congress.

[Another Dispatch] Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, Walter Bedell Smith, will report to Secretary of State Marshall on the 14th regarding the deteriorating situation in China since Marshall left China in January. It is rumored that Smith may succeed Vincent as the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department. It is said that Vincent has been criticized by pro-Nanjing figures as being unsympathetic to the Chinese National Government.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall's appointment of Wedemeyer as a special envoy to investigate China and Korea for the first time links China and Korea together, indicating that the United States now believes that the two countries have a common problem that needs to be solved. Foreign sources have repeatedly reported that the Korean Communists are fighting in the Three Eastern Provinces, which is one part of this development. However, the U.S. government's selection of Wedemeyer to go to China indicates that he will only conduct investigations on the government side. Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's failure to return administrative power over Dalian and Lushun to China will be a key focus of Wedemeyer's investigation. Considering Wedemeyer's current appointment, it is expected that the United States will adopt a new policy toward China within two months.

### Strengthening Far East Policy, Investigating the Situations in China and Korea

Both the People's and Youth Parties Welcome Wedemeyer

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] An authoritative source here stated that Wedemeyer's visit to China and Korea to "investigate the facts" is likely the beginning of the United States strengthening its Far East policy. Since Marshall took office as Secretary of State half a year ago, his policy towards the Far East has not been as active as his policy towards Europe. The recent issues of Dalian and Lushun, the Beitashan Incident, and the Seoul negotiations all indicate that the U.S. authorities need to reconsider their Far East policy. The authoritative source also pointed out that Wedemeyer's appointment comes after the United States lifted the arms embargo on China, and Wedemeyer's visit to China coincides with our country's implementation of nationwide mobilization, so its importance is self-evident.

[Another Dispatch] Yu Chia-chu of the Youth Party's Executive Committee told reporters on the 12th regarding Wedemeyer's visit to China that the envoy's trip will be of great benefit to our country's current economic situation, so he is more optimistic about U.S. loans. However, he believes that Wedemeyer's trip will not have any impact on the military aspect. Hu Hai-men of the Democratic Socialist Party's Executive Committee told reporters that it is extremely welcome that the U.S. President can send a special envoy to China, and at the same time, it will further enhance the friendship between China and the United States.

### New York Newspapers Emphasize the Increase in Sino-US Relations

[Central News Agency, New York, 11th] Although New York newspapers did not comment on Wedemeyer's new mission, the reports of each newspaper emphasized: "This reflects Marshall's concern for the situation in China, as well as his trust in this wartime commander of the US military in China." The New York Times reported: "It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's new appointment has dispelled China's concerns that the United States will abandon it. At the same time, rumors that Wedemeyer will replace Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China have also been clarified." The Times stated: "It is reported that Wedemeyer was not interested in this position, but was finally persuaded to take on this investigation work." The newspaper's Washington correspondent stated: "It is too early to predict whether this move will lead to the implementation of economic and other assistance under Truman's policy or the expansion of the Marshall Plan to Asia. It is reported that Wedemeyer is quite clear about this policy in his mind. His mission is to determine what the United States can do to promote China's recovery. It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's interest in finding ways to promote the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is far less than his interest in more deeply studying the country's various difficulties."

### Preliminary Draft of Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Agreement Signed Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement, after six rounds of negotiations, is about to be finalized. At 11:00 AM on the 12th, Ling Shih-fen, advisor to the Ministry of Transportation who presided over the negotiations on the Chinese side, and Duesen, the head of the Dutch delegation, signed the preliminary draft agreed upon by both parties in the Ministry of Transportation's conference room, congratulating each other on the smooth success of the negotiations. The content of the draft agreement is roughly based on the standard agreement drafted by the Chicago International Civil Aviation Conference. At the moment, both parties will submit the draft to their respective governments for approval, and then the Dutch Ambassador and the Chinese Foreign Minister will sign on behalf of the two countries. Duesen and his party are scheduled to leave China and return to their country on the 13th.

### Friend of the Chinese People: General Wedemeyer

— Our Newspaper Data Room

In early April of last year, General Wedemeyer ended the headquarters of the U.S. military in the China Theater and returned home successfully. Before his departure, he held a final press conference in Shanghai. Chinese and foreign reporters gave speeches one after another, expressing deep respect for General Wedemeyer's character and achievements, and unanimously said that they hoped General Wedemeyer would one day receive a new appointment and return to China. Now, this friend of the Chinese people has indeed been appointed as President Truman's special representative with the rank of ambassador and is preparing to come to China again.

General Wedemeyer's name is linked to China's victory. He served as the Chief of Staff of the China Theater during the late stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, helping China win the victory, and also took on the arduous task of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war after the war. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, it was the darkest period in the history of China's War of Resistance. At that time, the Japanese army launched an all-out invasion of the Chinese mainland, trying to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Fierce battles were taking place outside the city of Guilin, an important city in the southwest. It was at this time that General Wedemeyer succeeded General Stilwell as the Commander of the U.S. Military in the China Theater and the Chief of Staff of the China Theater Command, assisting President Chiang, training troops, replenishing equipment, and resisting the enemy's offensive. In the year after General Wedemeyer took office, the situation in the China Theater improved day by day. Finally, in August of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Japan surrendered.

General Wedemeyer is a soldier who has experienced many battles and is very strategic. Ten days before the end of World War I, he graduated from West Point Military Academy. He has studied military affairs at the Staff College and the Army University in Berlin, Germany. In the 1930s, he was sent to China and stationed in the U.S. military in Tianjin for a short period of time. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, he served on the Strategic Committee of the Department of War, and made many contributions to the decision-making of the Allied war strategy. In October 1943, he was sent to the headquarters of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia as Deputy Chief of Staff, and since then he has been related to the war situation in Asia. Due to his bravery, wisdom and agility, he was soon appointed as the Commander of the U.S. Military in the China Theater.

From the American point of view, this distinguished general is still very young. He was born in 1896, and this year he is only fifty years old. He has a thin figure, a straight nose, light gray hair, and a pair of soft eyes shining with a solemn and profound light. He doesn't drink much alcohol, but he smokes a lot of cigarettes. When he talks to others, his slow and steady voice often gives people a very deep impression.

General Wedemeyer himself said: He loves China and loves all the people of China. When he took over the duties of the China Theater that year, he said: "I love them, I am here to serve them."

### Wei Daoming on Inspection Tour

### Issue of Equal Treatment for Civilian and Military Personnel

To Be Discussed by the Executive Yuan Budget Committee

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Executive Yuan Budget Review Committee held its second temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Wu Yunwu chaired the meeting. The main topic of discussion was the case of equal treatment for civilian and military personnel, which included (1) salaries, (2) non-staple food expenses, and (3) horse feed salary issues. The principle is to give them the same treatment as civilian personnel, but since the ranks and positions of military personnel are different from those of civilian personnel, for example, military staff members may be majors or lieutenant colonels, or even colonels. If generals, colonels, and lieutenants are compared with senior, recommended, and appointed grades, there will be differences from the current position. If the position is compared with civilian officials, there will be differences from the original military rank. No results were obtained in today's discussion, and it was decided to hand it over to the Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan to consult with the Ministry of National Defense for further discussion. The non-staple food expenses have been increased to 50,000 yuan per person per month. Horse feed is calculated at 300,000 yuan per horse. The expenses required to prepare for the second-line forces were also discussed at the meeting.

### Senior Representatives of the American Cotton Association Arrive in China

### Northern Xinjiang Beitashan: Outer Mongolian Troops Hastily Building Fortifications; Military Personnel Concerned About Next Action

[Dispatch from Dihua via Central News Agency, 12th] It has been learned from military sources that the number of Mongolian army horses at Baiyanggou Pass on the Beitashan front has decreased by two-thirds. The military is currently hastily constructing fortifications, and military personnel here are paying close attention to this. One military observer stated: Since the Mongolian army's invasion began on June 5th, it has been over 30 days. Each time, the Mongolian army launched attacks with superior forces, but were repelled by our troops. In total, the Mongolian army has launched over ten attacks in less than a month. At the beginning of the war, the Mongolian army fought fiercely day and night under the cover of aircraft, but ultimately suffered losses and retreated. It is believed that the Mongolian side is now well aware of the determination of our soldiers to defend our territory and their bravery in combat. In order to seize Beitashan, a key military location, a large-scale military operation is inevitable. The current actions of the Mongolian army will likely be chosen from the following paths: (1) Abandoning the attempt to seize Beitashan; (2) Shifting troops to another location in an attempt to outflank our rear positions. The former is highly unlikely, considering the Mongolian army's aggressive ambitions and the intentions of a certain party to harm China. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the Mongolian army's next action and strengthen our defenses to avoid being caught off guard. Further news: The defending troops at Beitashan were greatly heartened upon hearing the central government's announcement of a general mobilization order.

### Two Mongolian Banner Institutions in Chahar Province Hold Symposium in Zhangjiakou

### Frugality Guidelines Drafted; To Be Submitted to the Full Economic Commission Meeting for Discussion; Zhang Jia'ao Claims 500 Million Loan is Hopeful

[Report from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 12th] The "Measures for Implementing Frugality in Consumption" proposed by President Zhang were further studied at a meeting of the National Economic Commission's subcommittee on the afternoon of the 12th. A "Outline of Measures for Implementing Frugality in Consumption" has been drafted and will be submitted to the plenary session next Thursday after the wording is finalized. Today's meeting was convened by Wang Yunwu, and attended by Gu Zhenggang, He Haoruo, Huang Yuanbin, and Lou Tongjiang, among others. The meeting decided to promote frugality simultaneously in both the public and general social spheres, with particular emphasis on Shanghai, with the goal of reducing all expenses. Even essential supplies such as gasoline will be subject to reductions. Furthermore, a suggestion made at the previous plenary meeting regarding the implementation of production rationalization was discussed today, and it was decided that a separate plan would be formulated.

[Another Dispatch] The subcommittee of the Economic Commission also reviewed the "Joint Export Sales" plan proposed by the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Joint Management Company. The committee attached great importance to this plan. According to the plan, the government would provide loans to various manufacturers, who would then produce finished products and export them to Southeast Asia and other regions, earning foreign exchange for the country. This plan would greatly benefit the cotton textile industry's production and foreign exchange earnings.

[Report from this Newspaper in Beiping, 12th] Zhang Jia'ao arrived in Beiping by plane at 1:00 PM today. After inspecting the Central Bank's branch and general financial operations here, he will proceed to Tianjin for inspection. A decision on whether he will visit the Northeast has not yet been made. Zhang stated to reporters: (1) The US$500 million loan will not be revoked due to the June deadline. The government has already submitted transportation sector construction plans to Washington, and plans for other sectors' use of the loan are also being prepared. (2) The lifting of the gold ban is unlikely. Rumors that the government will allow private gold exchanges for foreign currency are a misunderstanding regarding public bonds that can be exchanged for US dollars. (3) Recent talk of currency system reforms is purely a rumor, and adjustments to foreign exchange rates are also inaccurate.

Communist Destruction of Northeast Economy

[Joint Dispatch from Shenyang, 12th] The Northeast economy is suffering from the blows of the civil war and the constraints of trade regulations. The difficult situation in the Northeast can be exemplified by the China Textile Corporation. Despite all the advantages of government management and monopoly, the company is on the verge of collapse. Only 10,000 to 20,000 of the 150,000 spindles are in operation. Jinzhou Factory No. 1 has suffered a major setback and may close down at any time. Communist sabotage of factories is the main reason for the shutdowns of factories in Liaoyang and Yingkou. Although the Northeast is supposedly rich in grain, it will be difficult to transport grain into the interior or to other locations this year. All of the Northeast's products must now be used to supply the local military and civilians.

Northern China is currently suffering from famine. A delegation from Beiping and Tianjin came to order 60,000 tons of grain, but the contract was ultimately canceled due to insufficient local supply. This situation stands in stark contrast to the period of Japanese occupation. The Japanese army transported approximately 3.5 million tons of sorghum, soybeans, wheat, and millet out of the Northeast each year, with 2 million tons going to Japan and the remainder going to the Soviet Union and Europe. The recent surge in grain prices is partly due to the lack of electricity for the mills to operate. Soybean, the Northeast's main product, saw exports of 240,000 tons last year, but less than 48,000 tons have been exported this year. It is rumored that the Chinese Communists are exporting large quantities of soybeans through the Soviet Union. The government claims this can be verified by fluctuations in London soybean prices. At the beginning of this year, London soybean prices were £47 per ton, but later fell to £35 per ton. This situation is unlikely to have been caused by large-scale exports from government-controlled areas.

### Counterattack in Central Shandong Fully Underway; National Army Pressing Towards Wande and Feicheng; Transportation Between Xuzhou and Haizhou Interrupted by Mountain Floods

[Report from Yanzhou via this Newspaper, 12th] The large-scale annihilation battle in the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains has come to an end. The main force of the Shandong Communist army has been dispersed and is fleeing in two directions, north and south. The National Army in the Tai'an, Dawenkou, and Jieshou areas, in order to concentrate its forces and avoid being surrounded by superior Communist forces, mostly made strategic withdrawals on their own initiative. After dispersing and depleting the Communist forces, they began a full-scale counterattack on the 11th.

### Communist Army Obstructing Yellow River Embankment Restoration; Water Conservancy Department Releases Details; Communist Party Should Be Held Responsible If There Are Breaches When Flood Season Arrives

[Report from Nanjing via this Newspaper, 12th] The Ministry of Water Conservancy released details on the Communist bandits' obstruction of the Yellow River embankment restoration project on the 12th. After listing the facts, it pointed out that the Communist bandits were deliberately trying to sabotage the river works. The representatives they sent to suggest negotiations were merely a smokescreen for their secret plan to cross the river and harass the southern bank. With the flood season approaching, the Communist bandits should be held responsible for any breaches in the river defenses in the future. The Ministry expressed gratitude to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for its human and material assistance in repairing our river defenses.

Repair Work from April to June

According to the Ministry of Water Conservancy's announcement: From April to June this year, twenty-one brick and willow dams were completed at the dangerous worksites of Gao Village and Liu Village in Hebei Province, as well as 1,570 meters of bank protection work. Subsequently, 99,400 cubic meters of earthwork were used to create the embankment body and embankment top. Secondary dangerous worksites such as Lantong, Maodian, Laojuntang, and Baocheng were blocked and repaired, traffic ditches were filled, and defective projects such as gullies and wave nests were repaired with 27,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The earthwork project to reinforce the main embankment was 90 percent complete, totaling over 1.04 million cubic meters. At the dangerous worksites of Zhukou and Dongzhuang in Shandong Province, and the 25-kilometer-long embankment from Zhukou to Beizhuang, by the end of June, the Zhukou Dam (11 dikes and 14 weirs) and the Dongzhuang Dam (12 dikes and 34 weirs), as well as the earthwork section from Zhukou to Dongzhuang, had been completed. Active repairs were also underway on the main embankment at various worksites in Henan Province, and the breaches at Wuchekou and Donghongqiao in the main section of the Qin River were being blocked. The repair work in the three provinces was scheduled to be completed by July 10, but the Communist bandits' sudden large-scale crossing of the river on June 30 affected all projects. The Communist side's suggestions for consultation since April 11 also proved their lack of sincerity.

Facts of Communist Obstruction of River Works

Since the closing of the Huayuankou breach on March 15, the main facts of the Communist bandits' obstruction of the river works are as follows: On March 31, when the Hebei River Defense Office was repairing dangerous worksites at Liu Village in Dongming, the bandit army suddenly attacked, dispersing the workers and seizing two engineers. On April 28, the entire main embankment on the north bank of Hebei Province was occupied by the bandit army, and the whereabouts of some of the workers are unknown. On May 16, the bandit army suddenly attacked the Second Section of the First Main Section of the Wenxian Blocking Bureau. Clerk Cui Zhixin was killed in the line of duty, tools and vehicles were looted, and the remaining employees were detained in the puppet Public Security Bureau, where they were tortured. Five workers, including Zhao Yongsan, Chang Gong, and Liu Jinshan, were captured, and their whereabouts are unknown. On June 10, the Communist bandits opened fire on the workers at the Zhukou Longmenkou bank protection and stone dam construction site in Shandong Province from the north bank. On the afternoon of June 28, the Communist army on the opposite bank of the Liu Village Grand River in Hebei Province built several pillboxes on the north bank and fired at the south bank, obstructing the project. On the afternoon of June 30, bandit troops crossed the river from the north bank below Beikou on a large scale, a serious situation. Furthermore, bandit mobs forced the employees of the Shandong River Defense Office and the western Shandong Office in Linpu to evacuate this morning. Over 20,000 bandit troops from Heze have crossed the river, and the section east of Linpu has been occupied. According to a report from Ma Zhendong, Section Chief of the Shandong River Defense Office, over a dozen employees at the Zhonggudui construction site were captured, and the project has been completely suspended. On the afternoon of July 4, 200 to 300 Communist bandits were discovered destroying embankment structures in the Jia Village to Heling area in Heze County. After the local militia and the National Army joined forces to suppress them, the bandits fled east.

### MacArthur Issues Statement; Advocates Early Peace Treaty with Japan; Japan Will Never Be Able to Re-Arm in a Century

[Dispatch from Tokyo via Central News Agency, 12th] MacArthur issued a statement today, saying: Japan will not be able to re-arm and engage in modern warfare for a century, even without foreign control. Furthermore, the Allied nations should conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. MacArthur's statement today was commenting on the Far Eastern Commission's decision on the post-war disposition of Japan. MacArthur believes that the peace treaty with Japan should be a charter of human freedom, allowing the Japanese people to receive guidance and protection without causing them to feel ashamed and retreat. The peace treaty with Japan should avoid punitive, arbitrary, and impractical provisions, but fundamentally it must not lose its firmness. If so, the Taiwanese people in Japan will certainly obtain peace.

[Another Dispatch] Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi commented on the Far Eastern Commission's new policy on Japanese reparations today, saying: Japan will certainly faithfully fulfill its reparations obligations in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. However, Japan sincerely hopes that the Allied nations will consider that Japan's current economy has reached its lowest level when deciding on the issue of Japanese reparations. Continuing to increase its burden will inevitably delay Japan's economic recovery and its return to being a member of the world's peaceful economic society.

[Dispatch from Moscow via Central News Agency, 11th] An observer for the Soviet Union's Izvestia criticized the current Allied occupation policy towards Japan today, saying that the result of this policy is that the Japanese militarists feel that Japan is not an aggressor but a victim of aggression, who urgently needs to be sympathized with. This situation recently caused Hitoshi Ashida to give a speech, while no one (whether Allied occupation authorities or the Japanese Diet) felt it necessary to refute it. This move further prompted Yukio Ozaki to suggest holding a plebiscite in the Northeast, Korea, and Taiwan to determine who these lands should belong to.

Editorial

### Welcome General Wedemeyer to China!

The White House in Washington officially announced on the 11th that President Truman had appointed General Wedemeyer as a special envoy, with the rank of ambassador, to lead a fact-finding mission composed of political and economic experts to the Far East. The mission will investigate the actual situations in China and Korea, complete a report within six weeks, and return to the country to report on its mission. This important announcement can be seen not only as an indication of the United States extending the Truman Doctrine to the Far East, but also as the beginning of a change in US policy toward China. According to a report by the United Press, General Wedemeyer's mission to the Far East has four tasks: (1) to determine how to stabilize the Chinese economy so that Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan can be implemented in Asia as well; (2) to ascertain whether the United States should abandon its neutral stance in the Chinese civil war and support the Chinese National Government with moral and material strength; (3) to analyze the stalemate in US-Soviet negotiations to form a provisional Korean government in order to decide whether the United States should act alone in southern Korea; (4) to consider the military situation in Korea in order to decide whether the Korean government should be transferred from the US military to the State Department for management. Based on these four points alone, the importance of General Wedemeyer's mission to the East is evident.

Every time Sino-US relations encounter a serious test, we are often reminded of General Wedemeyer. Last July and August, when Marshal Marshall encountered difficulties in mediating the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in China, there were rumors that General Wedemeyer might come to China to assist Marshal Marshall in promoting China's peaceful unification. At the end of June this year, the failure to release the 500 million loan put Sino-US relations to another major test, and the rumors of General Wedemeyer coming to China came one after another. Now, the rumor that General Wedemeyer has been ordered to come to China has finally come true. I remember that when General Wedemeyer came to China in the autumn of 1944 to take office as Commander of the US Forces in the China Theater and Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang, it was the most difficult period of China's resistance against Japan. The National Army not only suffered setbacks on the battlefield, but also felt extremely poor in terms of material resources. Incomplete equipment and insufficient nutrition made it almost impossible to fight against the enemy forces, who had advantages in everything. However, after General Wedemeyer came to China, based on his belief that "American and Chinese soldiers should be treated equally," he intensified the training of Chinese troops and provided them with American equipment. Within a few months, not only did Sino-US relations become closer, and American and Chinese soldiers fighting side by side on the Chinese battlefield almost became friends in adversity who shared life and death, but China also had as many as 39 divisions of American-equipped troops. Trained by General Wedemeyer's "golden rules," they were all able to be friendly without being subservient, democratic without being indulgent, and frank without being restrained. From then on, the Chinese battlefield saw daily changes, and a year later, Japan finally surrendered unconditionally. China's arduous eight-year war of resistance also achieved final victory. General Wedemeyer's achievements will naturally never be erased from the minds of the Chinese people. General Wedemeyer returned to the United States in early April last year, having been in China for two years. He is not only Chairman Chiang's confidant, deeply aware of Chairman Chiang's personality and strengths, and praised Chairman Chiang as "a true Christian who is selfless and only wants to help the people," but also a friend of the Chinese people. He understands the feelings and aspirations of the Chinese people best; therefore, when he left Shanghai to return to the United States, so many people hated to see him go, and he also felt the pain of being reluctant to leave. Even after he returned to the country, he still never forgot China. Now, General Wedemeyer is revisiting the old place after a year and three months. Although the time is short, he will definitely feel doubly affectionate. As we know, General Wedemeyer is already familiar with the political situation in China, and he will know the inside story even without investigation. However, we still want to point out that in the year and three months since General Wedemeyer returned to the United States, China has undergone many changes in politics, economy, society, and culture. Ambassador Stuart knows this very well. After General Wedemeyer comes to China, in addition to conducting on-the-spot investigations, he must also listen to Ambassador Stuart's opinions on China's political economy.

We sincerely welcome General Wedemeyer and the members of the delegation to China for a thorough investigation. We always feel that some Americans do not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation in China due to their cursory observations, especially a few writers who inevitably rely on hearsay. After returning to the country, they publish articles in newspapers and magazines, which American readers believe to be facts they have personally experienced, and take them as true, but we feel surprised when we read them. For example, the American female writer Anna Louise Strong went to the Northeast once in October last year, and in May this year, she published an article in the magazine Amerasia, entitled "A Communist Regime in the Northeast." It can be said that she was completely deceived by the Chinese Communists, only seeing the surface of the Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast, and not knowing its actual operation. Therefore, all the reports are completely inconsistent with the facts. To be honest, there are still some misunderstandings between the people of China and the United States today that should not exist. Therefore, we most welcome people from all walks of life in the United States, especially experts who understand politics and economics and have practical experience, to come to China to see things clearly. The significance of our sincere welcome to General Wedemeyer, a friend of China, and his accompanying political and economic experts to China for on-the-spot investigations lies in this.

Finally, we also have a few words to say to the Chinese government: General Wedemeyer's investigation team's visit to China to conduct on-the-spot investigations of China's political situation is of great significance. It is not only related to China, but will also contribute to the overall situation in the Far East and the future of the entire world. The Chinese government should sincerely and frankly tell the team about the country's internal affairs. What are China's current weaknesses? Where are the root causes of the problems? The government should, to the best of its knowledge, tell General Wedemeyer one by one, as reference for him to draft the report. Concealing illness from doctors is something that patients should try to avoid. We must never intend to conceal anything when a good doctor makes a diagnosis. The overall situation of the country is too serious! The evolution of the overall situation in the world is also truly unpredictable! We must immediately reflect on ourselves first. For problems that we can solve ourselves, we must quickly find solutions ourselves, and we must not intend to seek help from others in everything. Moreover, even if the United States intends to help China and intends to assist the National Government, our government must first be extremely honest and efficient, and must first respect the rights and interests of the people everywhere, care for the welfare of the people, and truly be one with the people, so that it is truly a "national government." Only then will the "government supported by the people" that Ambassador Stuart mentioned be truly seen by General Wedemeyer's investigation team in China, and then the United States will definitely be happy to do its best to help this newly emerging China.

### Europe is Divided!

The European Economic Conference opened yesterday in Paris. Of all 27 countries in Europe, only representatives from 14 countries, including Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, and Sweden, attended, in addition to the two inviting countries, Britain and France. The Soviet Union and its eight satellite states refused the invitation and did not participate in the conference. According to a United Press report on the 11th, the Soviet Union will launch a counteroffensive against the Paris Conference, organizing a Central and Eastern European economic bloc to confront it. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced the "Molotov Plan." The division of Europe is almost a foregone conclusion, and it seems impossible to "unite" again. This is truly the beginning of a great human tragedy!

The Soviet Union's suspicion of the intentions of the Marshall Plan and its refusal to participate in the Paris Conference is the Soviet Union's own business, and no one can dissuade it. We have no objections. However, Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania suffered destruction from artillery fire during the war. Now, if they want to talk about recovery and prosperity, they urgently need foreign aid. Why did they refuse to participate in the European Economic Conference? Apart from the pressure from the Soviet Union, there is really no other reason to explain it. In particular, Czechoslovakia had already expressed its willingness to participate in the Paris Conference, but as soon as the Czech Prime Minister and Foreign Minister arrived in Moscow, they changed their minds halfway and asked Britain and France to withdraw their replies, unwilling to participate in the Paris Conference. The lack of autonomy in the diplomacy of small countries and the control of small countries by powerful countries is ultimately too blatant.

Europe is divided, power politics is revived, and it makes us feel that true peace seems to be even more distant and even more elusive from this world!

### British and French Foreign Ministers Attend European Conference to Promote European Economic Cooperation, Still Hoping that Eastern European Countries Will Change Their Original Intentions, Implementing the Marshall Plan Is Not to Organize an Anti-Soviet Bloc

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 12th: The European Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe opened here today. Bevin and Bidault both attended and delivered speeches, denying that the conference was infringing upon the sovereignty and independence of European countries, and emphasized the importance of the conference for European economic recovery. Chairman Bevin, in his speech, declared to the Soviet Union and its eight satellite states that "the door of the conference is still wide open." Any country that can change its attitude and participate in the Marshall Plan is welcome. Bevin continued: "It is regrettable that the Soviet Union and some European countries have not been able to participate, but these countries must also have regrets in their hearts." Bevin stated: The conference is not preparing to establish a permanent organization to confront the United Nations, but in order to solve European economic problems, it is necessary to establish specialized committees. Bidault said in his speech: "The purpose of convening the conference is not to establish an anti-Soviet bloc. The main task is to improve the chaotic economic situation in Europe." Today's meeting lasted only one hour, making it the shortest meeting in history. The conference first unanimously elected Bevin as chairman, and then proceeded to discuss organizational procedures, establish working committees, and prepare the agenda for the conference. Later, Bevin announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was scheduled to hold its second meeting at 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] After the opening ceremony of the European Conference, the working committee immediately held a meeting and unanimously elected Alphand, the economic director of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as chairman, and Sérurier, the director of the technical service of international conferences of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as secretary-general.

[United Press, Paris, 12th] Representatives of 16 Western European countries gathered in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to begin discussing Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aiding European recovery. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has not participated in major European conferences, which shows the seriousness of the division between Eastern and Western Europe. The conference will first organize several committees to study the degree of self-help in European countries and the amount of US assistance needed. Italy's participation in a major international conference on an equal footing is also the first time since the war.

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Foreign Minister Bidault will do his best to advocate that the Paris Economic Conference be completely open.

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 12th: Moscow Radio claimed today that the reason why the European countries did not participate in the Marshall Plan conference was not to discriminate against the Marshall Plan, but mainly because the major powers did not discuss with the United States through Britain and France. These countries are willing to trade directly with the United States.

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] A commentator on Moscow Radio said: The refusal of eight countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, to participate in the Paris Conference shows that the Paris Conference will inevitably fail. It is said that the refusal of the eight countries has greatly affected the plans of Britain and France, and Britain and France have returned to the dangerous policies of Munich.

### Marshall Explains the Current Situation of the US Aid to Europe Plan to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Soviet Union's Refusal to Cooperate Deepens the Rift Between East and West

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall reported in a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 11th that the US efforts to aid Europe have been hit by the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European Recovery Program, but will not be overturned as a result. In the 90-minute closed-door meeting, Marshall still hoped that he could eventually get the Soviet Union to participate in the long-term plan for European economic recovery. It is reported that Marshall told the committee that although the Soviet Union is currently refusing to cooperate, he hopes that the economic plan can still proceed. He believes that there is currently no need to establish a law to formulate an economic recovery plan, and implied that the plan may not be submitted to Congress for discussion until next spring. However, if this action is necessary, it is possible to establish a law within this year. Marshall also said: The Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference has widened the rift between the Eastern and Western fronts in Europe, and the Soviet Union has exerted pressure on Czechoslovakia and other countries, forcing them not to participate in the Paris Conference, thus deepening the rift. It is reported that Marshall also told the senators that the State Department does not yet know to what extent the Soviet Union will proceed regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with the United States and other Western powers.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] The information revealed after Marshall's secret meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proves that the United States believes that the door should still be open for another attempt at the entire European recovery plan, so as to avoid the permanent division between Western countries and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the attitude of the United States can be seen from its refusal to express any reaction to the "Molotov Plan" transmitted by TASS and the news that the Soviet Union will soon announce a "recovery plan for Eastern Europe."

### The Czech Cabinet Has a Uniform Opinion on Rejecting the British and French Invitations, There Were as Many as Five Breaks During the Meeting

[United Press, Prague, 12th] Informed sources here today disclosed the inside story of the Czech Cabinet's change of mind regarding the Paris Economic Conference. It is said that after the Cabinet received a telephone call from Prime Minister Gottwald from Moscow yesterday, it convened an emergency meeting. Communist cabinet members debated with non-Communist cabinet members for six hours, and there were as many as five breaks in the middle. Finally, they accepted the proposal of the non-Communist cabinet members that the withdrawal statement must clearly state that this move was due to Soviet pressure. At that time, President Benes, who was non-partisan, said that he was powerless, and the opposition cabinet members gave up hope of participating in the meeting.

### Poland and Finland Still Hope to Obtain Foreign Aid

[United Press, Warsaw, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today: Poland deeply hopes that foreign capital will help its recovery, and it would be unfortunate if declining to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan creates an unfavorable impression in the United States. Although Poland's inability to obtain US aid will inevitably delay its recovery, Poland will still seek regeneration with the ability and enthusiasm of its own workers. Poland will apply to the World Bank for a loan of 600 million US dollars, hoping to approve it as soon as possible.

[United Press, London, 11th] Moscow Radio broadcast Finland's reply refusing to participate in the Paris Conference today, saying: "Finland's status has not yet been determined by the peace treaty. Since the Marshall Plan has caused serious disagreements between major countries, Finland is willing to stay out of world political conflicts and is unable to accept the invitation to participate in the Paris Conference, which is unfortunate. However, Finland is very willing to follow other countries in purely economic cooperation. For the sake of its own recovery, Finland also needs foreign assistance. The Finnish government is willing to provide information on the country's economy."

### The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia Established an Agreement to Expand Long-Term Trade, Soviet-Hungarian Negotiations Are Underway

[United Press, Prague, 12th] According to reliable sources in Moscow: As a result of the talks between Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and the Soviet authorities in Moscow in recent days, the two sides have reached an agreement to expand long-term trade between the two countries as a condition for Czechoslovakia's withdrawal from the Paris Conference.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The Hungarian Radio Station said: The Soviet-Hungarian negotiations in Moscow have agreed that Hungary will give half of the amount of compensation for the next year to the Soviet Union, which will greatly help alleviate the situation in Hungary and guarantee the supply of high-grade flour to Hungary. Also, negotiations on Hungary's purchase of 1,000 trucks from the Soviet Union are underway.

### The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Will Soon Loan to Britain

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] According to the "News Chronicle," the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may grant Britain a loan of £75 million to renovate the industry in the Ruhr region of Germany. The loan agreement may be established in Washington soon.

### The Soviet Union Plans to Use the Molotov Plan to Resist US Foreign Aid and Seeks to Organize a Central and Eastern European Economic Bloc

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] Moscow Radio announced today: The Soviet Union has now drafted its own recovery plan, which is superior to any foreign aid to Europe. This plan is called the "Molotov Plan."

[United Press, London, 11th] On the eve of the opening of the Paris Conference, diplomatic circles here and in Paris predicted that the Soviet Union would launch a counteroffensive against it and organize a Central and Eastern European economic bloc. Representatives of 16 Western European countries have gathered in Paris and are scheduled to convene a meeting on the 12th on the last opportunity for US economic aid to revive Europe, while the Soviet Union and its eight countries in its sphere of influence have taken a resistant action. Therefore, diplomats said that Moscow will quickly carry out a counteroffensive plan in Eastern Europe so as to take into account the interests of countries that do not participate in the Paris Conference. The main difficulty for the Soviet Union is not how many countries it can recruit to the Eastern European bloc, but whether the Soviet Union can have sufficient materials to aid the countries so as to match the United States' aid to Western European countries. The side also pointed out that the Soviet Union had previously requested 80% of the Marshall Plan for its recovery. Because the Soviet Union lacks raw materials and manufactured goods, the Soviet Union is afraid that it can only supply a very small amount of materials to its vassal states. In this sense, the Paris Conference on the 12th will form a split in Europe.

Eastern Europe is brewing a mutual assistance system

Eastern European countries now seem to be forming a "mutual assistance" system within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Czech and Polish governments will reportedly establish a "Bilateral Economic Cooperation Committee" within a few days to discuss cooperation in industrial production between the two countries. According to reports, the Czech and Polish sides signed a commercial treaty last week. At the same time, Czechoslovakia and Poland have declared that they will soon begin negotiations with Hungary on a long-term commercial agreement. From August 1, Czechoslovakia will transport coking coal, iron, copper, and clay ore to Hungary to help it complete its three-year plan. According to reports, the Czech-Hungarian temporary commercial agreement has recently been established, and another negotiation will begin in Beijing in early August to make the temporary commercial agreement a permanent commercial agreement. A Hungarian business delegation will also go to Warsaw to conclude a Hungarian-Polish commercial agreement with Poland. The Hungarian government has also ordered major heavy industrial factories to transport factory equipment, machinery, and railway vehicles worth 20 million US dollars to Yugoslavia to help complete Yugoslavia's five-year plan. At the same time, Czechoslovakia is satisfied with the current Soviet-Czech commercial negotiations held in Moscow, and said that a new pier has been built in the city of Keno on the Soviet-Czech border to load and unload the goods of both sides. Bulgaria is currently holding economic negotiations with the Soviet Union. Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Kostov returned to Beijing from Moscow half a week ago, expanding an agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply Bulgaria with machinery worth 10 million yuan to help it implement its two-year plan, while Bulgaria will transport a leaf of the same value to the Soviet Union. Bulgarian Minister of Resources Salov is still staying in Moscow to facilitate continued negotiations. In addition, the Soviet Union will send a delegation to Beijing to discuss the details of establishing a Bulgarian-Soviet airline. Although Finland and Bulgaria are far apart, they are also planning to increase economic relations between the two countries. A commercial delegation led by the Director of Foreign Trade of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently negotiating a Finnish-Bulgarian commercial agreement in Beijing.

### U.S.-Turkey Agreement Signed: Loan Funds to be Used to Strengthen National Defense

[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast); The U.S.-Turkey aid agreement was signed today in the Turkish capital. The Turkish representative was Foreign Minister Hejia, and the U.S. representative was U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson. After the signing, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that this agreement would not only enhance friendly relations between the two countries but also maintain world peace. The first clause of the agreement stipulates that Turkey must make good use of U.S. loans.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The United States and Turkey today signed a $100 million military aid agreement in Ankara to guarantee Turkey's resistance to Soviet pressure and to achieve "freedom and independence." The agreement is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and aims to build friendly relations between the United States and Turkey. It was approved by the U.S. Congress on May 22.

The threat from the Soviet Union is not formally mentioned in the agreement, but the Soviet threat on Turkey's eastern border after the war has triggered a war of nerves, leading to the mobilization of the entire Turkish army. The $100 million loan will be used entirely for military equipment, training, and other projects, such as building Turkish railways to speed up the transport of troops and supplies. This agreement is the opposite of the Greek plan, where half is for military use and the other half for civilian use. According to the agreement, aid will be suspended in three situations: (1) if Turkey requests it; (2) if the UN Security Council or General Assembly deems the agreement "unnecessary or inappropriate"; (3) if the U.S. President decides to cancel the agreement for the benefit of the United States.

Allocation of Funds for Aid to Greece

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Washington, 11th] The head of the U.S. delegation to Greece, Mr. Griswold, stated today that five major plans have been drawn up to complete the Aid to Greece Act, and $35 million worth of military supplies are awaiting shipment to Greece in various U.S. ports.

### Greek Communist Party: Conspiracy to Revolt

Fortunately, Someone Informed, Preventing its Realization

[Reuters, Athens, 11th] The Greek Minister of Public Security, Mr. Zilvas, spoke today about the communist conspiracy to overthrow the government, stating that the authorities had uncovered secret storage sites in Thessaloniki containing firearms, explosives, printing presses, and paper. The authorities also obtained a secret order from the Greek Communist Party to form a revolutionary army and launch an uprising.

Zilvas continued that an order issued by the guerrilla commander Markos was found in Thessaloniki, ordering the Communist Party to launch an armed uprising at 1:00 AM on the 10th. Fortunately, someone from within the Communist Party informed, preventing its success. In the secret Communist warehouse found in Nevara, there were Bulgarian typewriters, "Molotov cocktail" bombs, and automatic weapons. Secret armories were also uncovered in Athens and Thessaloniki. Zilvas promised to allow foreign journalists to inspect the secret documents obtained from various areas after the investigation is completed.

It is said that the recent demand of the Japanese Foreign Minister for the Kuril Islands is a rude outburst of Japanese militarism. Prime Minister Katayama not only did not refute the remarks of his subordinates but said that they had the right to express their personal views on foreign policy issues. The Diet also condoned it, and Diet leader Ozaki even advocated holding referendums in "Manchuria," Korea, Taiwan, and the Kuril Islands to determine their status and even dreamed of calculating the losses of the belligerent countries and giving compensation. All of this is the result of the occupation authorities' connivance with Japanese militarists.

### Collusion for Self-Interest and Damage to the National Treasury: Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng Convicted; Paying Out 2.5 Billion in Gold Before Receiving Funds is Clearly Illegal; Lin Fengbao Found Not Guilty Due to Lack of Evidence of Joint Collusion

[Our Dispatch] The "Gold Rush" case, which caused a national sensation, has been tried by the District Court since March 14, lasting four months, and was pronounced yesterday morning. Before the court session began, the defendants, former Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, and Deputy Director Yang Anren (wearing gray suits), sat quietly in the Eighth Criminal Court. At 9:30 AM, Judge Wang Jiachao ascended the bench, and the defendant in custody, Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, was brought in, followed by Lin and Yang, who stepped into the defendant's box. Yang stood in the middle, Lin on the right, and Zhan on the left. Zhan Liansheng wore a lake-colored silk robe. Judge Wang read out the main text of the judgment: "Yang Anren, jointly profiting directly from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Zhan Liansheng, jointly profiting directly from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to four years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for five years. Lin Fengbao is found not guilty." The judge then sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment and advised that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could apply to the High Court for review. At this time, Lin listened quietly with his right hand supporting his chin, while Yang and Zhan remained silent and made no expression. At the end of the court session, Zhan Liansheng was ordered to be returned to custody, and Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren remained released on bail.

### Full Text of the Reasoning for the Judgment

Reasons: 1. Regarding the parts of Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng, the policy of allocating gold directly affects the livelihood of the people and is indirectly related to the nation's lifeline. Those who perform this duty should be vigilant to achieve results. The Central Bank's handling of gold trading is exclusively under the charge of Yang Anren, the Deputy Director of the Business Bureau. After the defendant Yang Anren implemented this national policy, he paid out gold before receiving payment for it, and when allocating gold, he did not rely on vouchers and had no original documents to check. He also allowed the purchase of gold with checks, resulting in the malpractice of bounced checks, causing the national gold policy to be manipulated by speculators. The procedure cannot be said to be without error. It is verified that according to the Central Bank's practice of allocating gold, transactions concluded in the afternoon require settlement on the next day due to the suspension of exchange relations at the clearing house, as repeatedly confessed by the defendant Yang Anren in the record. Examining the Central Bank's books, the note for 2.5 billion and 335 yuan received from Tongfeng Yu Gold Firm on February 8 of this year was paid out on the same day, and this note was not exchanged or exchanged for an application, as evidenced by the annotation in the notes column of the Central Bank's account table sent to this court on June 27 of this year. Since this note was received after the closing time of the clearing house, according to the above practice, it was a transaction concluded in the afternoon and should have been settled on the next day. In early February of this year, the market price of gold soared, changing several times a day. During this period, the gold that should have been settled on the next day was advanced.

(Continued from the right: Zhan Shusheng, Yang Anren) It was delivered on the first day, and the transfer was delayed by one day by taking advantage of the suspension of the clearing house. It is difficult to say that this was not a collusion for self-interest. This can be seen from the report of the Ministry of Finance sent by the National Government on May 15 to investigate the Shanghai gold rush case, which stated: "It was found that although the national banks had received these notes, they had not been entered into the accounts, that is, the gold had already been paid out, but only a piece of paper was received, similar to selling gold on credit. It is also not unreasonable to worry about whether the notes are worthless. On the surface, the national banks have not provided overdrafts or loans to various banks and firms, but in fact, they have provided the convenience of capital turnover to various banks and firms." And on the same day, the inspection report of the Central Bank Audit Office and the Central Bank Supervisory Committee's inspection of the Central Bank Business Bureau's gold trading, stated: "Collection on the same day should be transferred on the same day. If the notes are deposited in the vault to offset the payment on the same day and delayed day by day, part of the funds is invisibly used by the market." The various words, etc., are even more revealing. Moreover, February 8 was the last day for the state government to allocate gold to the gold industry. According to the practice of settlement on the next day for transactions concluded in the afternoon, the next day, February 9, was a Sunday, and the 10th was a suspension of allocation and could not be settled. The defendant Yang Anren knew that the allocation to Tongfeng Yu Gold Firm had to be settled on the next day according to the regulations, and the gold that could not be settled on the next day due to the impact of the suspension of allocation was advanced to complete the procedures on the 8th. Not only did he collude with the defendant Zhan Yunsheng for self-interest, which is obvious, but also harmed the national treasury to the greatest extent. What is even more advanced is that the nature of gold is similar to currency. Once acquired, it can be profitable. Now the defendant Yang Anren, without receiving gold payment, handed over a large amount of gold to the defendant Zhan Liansheng, so that he colluded for self-interest, which is undoubtedly true. (The full text of the reasoning is not finished, continue to the lower corner)

### Foreign-Owned Public Utilities: Astonishing Business Tax Amount; A Huge Revenue for the Municipal Finance Department; Request for Exemption Deemed to Lack Sufficient Grounds; Once Passed, the Three Companies Will Inevitably Raise Prices

[Our Dispatch] Foreign-owned public utilities in this city, such as the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company, the French-owned Electric Light and Tram Company, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company, etc., previously stated that they had signed a business agreement with the British Municipal Council and had already paid taxes, requesting exemption from business tax. This case has been repeatedly rejected by the Direct Tax Bureau and has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, but it has remained unresolved. Since the business tax was assigned to the local government, the companies have repeatedly applied for exemption from business tax based on previous contractual relationships. They also argued that the company, etc., could not bear the additional burden after the Municipal Council passed the Public Utilities Additional Municipal Construction Donation. The U.S.-owned Telephone Company further added Article 32 of the "Sino-American Treaty" as an excuse for tax exemption. The reporter visited the persons in charge of the Finance Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau to inquire about how this case should be interpreted reasonably, as this case concerns the future tax obligations of foreign companies in China. It is said that the contracts previously signed by the various foreign companies with the Municipal Council were a kind of "remuneration" and were completely different from the business tax to be paid. As for the public utilities additional municipal construction donation, it is borne by the users, and the company is only acting as a collection agent and has no burden to bear. Therefore, there are no sufficient grounds for foreign companies to resist paying business tax.

Estimated Annual Payment of 24 Billion

According to the reporter's investigation, the business turnover of the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company in this city in June was 24,944,402,262 yuan, the French-owned Tram Company was 4,121,712,280 yuan, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company was 4,462,550,612 yuan (this business turnover is calculated from the 10% additional municipal construction donation paid by each company in June, that is, the figure obtained by multiplying the donation amount by ten, which is its monthly business income). If the business tax is paid at 1.5%, the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company should pay 374,166,033 yuan per month, the French-owned Tram Company should pay 61,825,684 yuan per month, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company should pay 66,938,259 yuan per month. The total business tax to be paid by the three companies is 502,929,976 yuan, which is 6,035,159,712 yuan per year. However, the above business turnover includes figures that have not yet been actually received. In addition, public utilities in this city have recently increased their prices several times. If we only calculate an average of four times, the annual business tax to be paid by these three public utilities will reach a huge 24 billion. Although it is a significant burden for each public utility company, it is an even larger revenue for the municipal finance department, so the municipal government is unlikely to give it up.

Collecting Information for Careful Research

Regarding the Sino-American Treaty Article 7 added by the U.S.-owned Telephone Company, it stipulates: "The Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America shall, at the request of one party, or no later than six months after the cessation of hostilities with the enemy country, conduct negotiations and sign a modern, comprehensive treaty of friendship, commerce, navigation, and consular relations. This treaty will be based on modern international procedures and the principles of international law and international practice expressed in modern treaties recently concluded by the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America with other governments." However, although this treaty of commerce has been concluded, the municipal government has not yet formulated specific measures regarding the rights and obligations after the recovery of the concessions, so this case is still difficult to thoroughly resolve. The municipal government is currently searching for this information from the Valley to conduct careful research. According to general observation, once the foreign-owned companies are required to pay business tax, the company will suddenly increase its burden, and the way to solve it will inevitably be to raise prices.

### Chamber of Commerce Asks for Implementation of Economic Reform Plan

### Local Autonomy Society Branch Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the China Local Autonomy Society held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Council yesterday at 4 PM. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the head of the preparatory committee, served as the chairman. In attendance were Mayor Wu, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiyi, Zhang Xiaosong, Xiang Changquan, Wu Yunfu, and about forty other people.

The meeting resulted in the following decisions: (1) Ji Hao, Li Xuexun, and Zhang Xingmin were appointed to review the draft charter of the branch. (2) Methods for recruiting members will be sought. The recruitment group will send letters to each district office and district people's representative assembly to designate three to five people to be responsible, and the recruitment group will also contact other parties to proceed. (3) The establishment meeting will be held on August 17th. (4) The address of the society will temporarily be at the Municipal Council Building. (5) The expenses of the society will be initially advanced by the founders.

### Neither a Dancing Girl Nor a Judge: Young Woman Fenbai Denies Charges; Arrived in Full Dress, Breastfeeding Baby

[Report from our newspaper] The case of young woman Zhu Huang Fenbai, who was accused of impersonating a female judge and disrupting order, was investigated for the first time yesterday by Prosecutor Fang Zheng of the District Procuratorate. Zhu was attractive and fashionably dressed, wearing a silver-gray, red-flowered silk cheongsam and white deerskin high-heeled shoes. She was holding a baby and occasionally uncovering her clothes to breastfeed. According to her testimony, she lives at No. 282, Jixiang Lane, Jinlu Middle Road. Her husband, Zhu Huaipi, is engaged in business. Her uncle, Huang Yan, previously served as the chief prosecutor in the puppet special district court. On the 28th of last month, she was invited by a friend to have tea at the Venus Dance Hall around 9 PM when she was mistaken for a county woman by dancers Zhou Jiahua, Shi Jiaping, and others, resulting in a conflict. She then took Zhou, Shi, and others to the police station. She firmly denied impersonating a judge. The court stated that it still needs to investigate whether Zhu impersonated a public official, used a false name for deception, or engaged in soliciting lawsuits. She was granted bail pending further questioning.

### Huang Zaiyi, Involved in Selling a Huge Sum of Gold from Taiwan, Is Remarkably Resourceful: Escaped the Net Twice, Hid in Japan Under an Assumed Name; His Brother Huang Zairong Was Captured Upon Returning to Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] Huang Zaiyi (pictured), a Taiwanese man involved in the case of U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Evans embezzling 30 kilograms of "Fu" character gold coins from Taiwan (worth US$100,000), has become an international mystery, with judicial and police authorities in the United States, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Tokyo searching for him. The incident occurred shortly after the victory in the war. When our government took over Taiwan, it entrusted Lieutenant Colonel Evans, a U.S. liaison officer stationed in Taiwan, to receive approximately 60 kilograms of gold, gold coins, and gold ornaments that the Japanese had collected from the Taiwanese people over the years. Afterward, Evans handed over only 30 kilograms to our government, and the whereabouts of the remaining 30 kilograms of gold coins were unknown. At the time, our government received intelligence that Evans had smuggled the gold coins from Taiwan to Shanghai and entrusted Huang Zaiyi to sell them all in the Shanghai market. Subsequently, after a thorough investigation by our authorities, most of the gold coins were recovered from various buyers.

After the U.S. government was notified of the situation by our country, Evans was arrested in Los Angeles at the end of May and an investigation was initiated. The U.S. government also requested that the judicial authorities in Shanghai summon witnesses to testify in the United States. On June 6th, a formal lawsuit was filed in a California court. The most important witness in this case is Huang Zaiyi. The Shanghai District Procuratorate summoned him for questioning on March 15th, after which he was released on bail by Cheng Huazhen, the manager of Fuhua Trading Company, a friend of Huang's. Later, the Ministry of National Defense received a notice from the U.S. court requesting that Huang Zaiyi be summoned to the United States to testify, and this notice was forwarded to the Shanghai authorities. However, Huang had already disappeared at this time. Cheng was then questioned, and he was detained for a period before being released on bail of 50 million yuan, with a deadline of fifteen days to produce Huang.

While the District Procuratorate was investigating, it also notified Taiwan and Tokyo to investigate Huang's whereabouts. Until recently, there were no clues.

Our reporter, finding the incident bizarre, independently inquired about Huang's whereabouts. According to investigations: after being released on bail, Huang returned to his residence at No. 941, Nanjing West Road, packed everything, and quietly left Shanghai with his family to return to Taiwan. Later, he changed his surname and name and engaged in large-scale smuggling with his brother Huang Zairong, using small boats to transport goods between Taiwan and Japan. Due to insufficient secrecy, he was arrested once in Japan but eventually managed to escape due to his remarkable resourcefulness. After being released in Japan, his brother Huang Zairong returned to Shanghai. The Songhu Garrison Command heard about this and immediately arrested Huang Zairong, who is currently still in custody.

It is reported that Huang Zaiyi has once again changed his name and is secretly living in Japan. The U.S. military authorities in Tokyo are still searching for him.

### The Cutting Pain of a Dancing Girl: Divorce Did Not Sever the Root of Trouble

[Report from our newspaper] Jin Lina (original name Du Juying, pictured), a 24-year-old dancing girl at the Da Hu Dance Hall from Changzhou, has been dancing for many years. In March of this year, she met a dance patron named Lu Shifang, 31 years old. Over time, they developed feelings for each other and became very close. Later, they participated in a group wedding organized by the Ningbo Fellow Association and officially lived together at the Longgong Hotel.

After the marriage, Lu had no legitimate job and was addicted to gambling. His circumstances were also not good. Before long, he gradually swindled the woman out of her savings, gold jewelry, and money, spending it all. The woman thought she had met the wrong person and that her fate was simply unfortunate. After a considerable period, the woman found her situation increasingly difficult and agreed to a divorce. On June 27th, a lawyer, Shen Hanzhang, officially handled the procedures, and she paid the man 4.3 million yuan in a lump sum, declaring a complete severance of relations.

After the divorce, the woman had no means of support and returned to the Da Hu Dance Hall, returning to the profession. It has been more than three months since then. However, the previous night, Lu Shifang suddenly went to call her to sit at a table. After the session, he insisted on inviting her out to eat. The woman could not refuse, so they went together. While walking on the street, Lu changed his mind again, wanting to invite her to the Eight Immortals Bridge. The woman did not suspect anything and remained vigilant, knowing that Lu's arrival must be ill-intentioned. They walked and walked until they reached Jinling Middle Road. When they reached the entrance of Jiu'an Lane, the woman took advantage of his carelessness and turned around and leaped into the Central Linji Apartment, heading straight to Room 303 upstairs, which was where her foster mother, Zhou Lu, lived. Lu saw the woman escape inside and chased after her, reaching the door, but the woman had already bolted the door. Unexpectedly, Lu was still unwilling to give up and forcefully broke the door open. He then pulled out a bottle of acid he had been carrying in his gown pocket. Zhou Lu knew that something was happening, but thinking that Lu was holding a knife or other weapon, she rushed forward to snatch it. As the two struggled, the bottle stopper came loose, and the acid began to leak out. Lu himself was the first to be splashed. Because acid is highly corrosive and immediately emits white smoke upon contact, Zhou Lu did not know what it was and thought it was a fire. She rushed out, shouting for help, and neighbors gathered, creating a chaotic scene. Jin, unable to escape, used her wits and covered her head with the bedding on the bed. Lu refused to let go and tried to pour the acid on her. After several struggles, the woman's neck and hands were slightly burned. At this point, Lu seemed dazed and rushed out the door, still scattering the bottle of acid everywhere, splashing many of the tenants who had gathered at the door. In his panic, Lu accidentally fell to the ground, causing the acid to pour over his body, resulting in serious injuries. However, after Lu struggled to his feet, he ran downstairs, still trying to escape, but he was eventually caught by several tenants working together. After reporting to the Songshan Police Station, he was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment due to the severity of his injuries. Jin Lina was treated at the Nanyang Hospital and was soon discharged.

Although the tragedy injured many people, fortunately, none were seriously injured. The only unfortunate death was a kitten upstairs that was burned.

### Yang, Zhan, et al. Defend Themselves on Three Points; The Statement of Reasons Refutes Each Point

The reasons for defense specially made by the defendants are nothing more than "(1) The Central Bank's practice of accepting non-exchangeable promissory notes as payment on the same day did not begin on February 8th of this year; there are precedents that can be cited. (2) February 8th was a Saturday. The former Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, only ordered the secret sale at 11:45 AM. Although the time of the secret sale exceeded 12:00 PM, it should still be considered morning before the Central Bank had lunch and is not subject to the restriction of settlement on the next day for transactions completed in the afternoon. (3) The Central Bank was ordered on the 10th to stop gold allocation to gold businesses; the defendants could not have known this on the 8th." After investigation, the court found that the Central Bank's receipt of non-exchangeable promissory notes as payment on the same day did not begin on February 8th of this year. However, its previous illegal acts have been clarified in the aforementioned report from the Ministry of Finance, etc. However, the amounts were not large, and the investigation revealed that it was due to a lack of attention and a failure to rush the exchange. This is still difficult to exempt them from criminal responsibility. On February 8th, the total number of gold bars secretly sold to Tongfengyu was 540, totaling 2.95335 billion National Currency. Among them, as much as 2.50335 billion yuan in promissory notes were not exchanged. In other words, Tongfengyu essentially purchased gold worth 2.90335 billion yuan for 450 million yuan on that day. With such a huge amount, it cannot be said that there was no collusion for profit. Who can believe it? The defendants' first point of defense is untenable.

Promissory Notes Cashed Out, Gold Should Be Returned

As for the Central Bank's so-called afternoon transaction and next-day settlement, it was purely because the afternoon transaction had passed the promissory note exchange time. The promissory note exchange stops at 2:00 PM, and all promissory notes sent to the exchange before 1:30 PM can still be exchanged. According to the testimony of defendant Yang Anren and witness Wang Songtao, even if the transaction exceeded 12:00 PM, it was not impossible to exchange. Moreover, even if it could not be exchanged, the received gold should be returned. This can be seen from the fact that on January 11th of this year, Taikangrun withdrew 90 gold bars, and because the payment promissory notes could not be cashed out on the same day, the gold was returned. Since there was a precedent for returning gold, the gold payment of over 2.5 billion yuan from Tongfengyu was settled with promissory notes, and the gold was not returned. Why was Tongfengyu treated so favorably compared to Taikang? The defendants' second point of defense is untenable.

Avoid Stopping Allocation, Backdate the Date

The government's policy of stopping gold allocation on February 10th cannot prove that the defendants knew about it on February 8th. However, the promissory notes paid by Tongfengyu were not transferred on the 8th and were only kept in the cashier's department. Moreover, the Central Bank's payment of gold did not require a requisition note, and the testimony of the aforementioned witness Wang Songtao can prove this. Therefore, after the allocation was stopped on the 10th, it was not impossible for defendant Zhan Liansheng to have the promissory notes presented to withdraw gold, pretending that they were presented on the 8th, to compensate for the loss. Moreover, the Central Bank's gold trading, except for occasional clear settlement on the same day in explicit allocation and secret sales, otherwise, secret sales all had accounts of afternoon transactions and next-day settlement. However, the secret sale on February 8th was unique in that it did not have such accounts. According to the investigation of these accounts, the secret sale on February 8th involved a total of 800 gold bars, divided into 21 transactions, all completed in the morning (i.e., before the Central Bank's lunch) and settled clearly at the time. There were no transactions in the afternoon, which is factually impossible. Moreover, the number of secret sales was to meet the needs of the market. On the morning of February 8th, when gold prices soared, there were 21 transactions, in other words, there were 21 market needs. But there was not a single transaction in the afternoon. Could it be that there was no need in the market that afternoon? Therefore, the defendant's theory that all transactions were completed in the morning is even more untenable. Combining this with the point that Tongfengyu presented promissory notes after the exchange time, it is clear that defendant Yang Anren allocated and sold 2.50335 billion yuan of gold without payment to Tongfengyu, represented by defendant Zhan Liansheng. This was clearly a transaction completed in the afternoon of February 8th and should have been settled on the 10th. To avoid the inability to settle due to the suspension of allocation on the 10th, the settlement date was backdated to compensate for the loss, which is especially obvious. The defendants' third point of defense is untenable.

Reduced Sentence for Those Over Sixty

In summary, the evidence clearly shows that defendant Yang Anren colluded with defendant Zhan Liansheng to seek illegal profits with respect to the gold affairs under his charge. He should be punished according to law. Although defendant Zhan Liansheng, representing Tongfengyu in contacting the withdrawal of gold, is not a public official but committed the crime jointly with a public official, the crime is established with the identity of a public official. According to Article 31, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, he should be considered a joint principal offender. However, given that the defendant is over sixty years old and fell into the legal trap due to a moment of negligence, his criminal situation is not irredeemable. The sentence should be reduced accordingly, and their public rights should be deprived separately to serve as a warning. As for the Central Bank's secret sale of 1,820 gold bars to Tongjianyu on January 27th of this year, while Tongfengyu only had 820 bars in its account on that day, with the remaining 1,000 bars entered into the account on the next day, the defendants argued that the shortfall of 1,000 bars was due to the afternoon transaction and next-day settlement, which were transferred to the next day's account. After the court reviewed the Central Bank's journal account, it was found to be consistent and is included for explanation.

Criminal Conduct Is Unrelated to Lin

Regarding Lin Fengbao's part, although Lin Fengbao, as the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, failed to prevent the collusion and fraud of defendants Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng in advance, it is difficult to avoid the blame for negligence. This is a question of whether he should be subject to administrative punishment. As for the criminal facts, they must be determined based on evidence. The affairs of buying and selling gold were the sole responsibility of defendant Yang Anren. Moreover, after the promissory note exchange was stopped on February 8th of this year, the cashier's department received the promissory notes from Tongfengyu under the order of Yang Anren. Furthermore, the testimony of witness Wang Songtao is sufficient to show that this criminal conduct is unrelated to defendant Lin Fengbao. In addition, there is no other affirmative evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant had a common conspiracy. It is difficult to convict him simply because he was the bureau director. According to the law, he should be acquitted.

Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, Article 3, Paragraph 2, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Second Section, Article 293, Paragraph 1, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Article 3, Section 6, Article 13, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 31, Paragraph 1, Article 59, Article 73, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, Article 66, First Section, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3, as stated in the main text.

### Haiqian Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Japan with Overseas Chinese; Mr. Chen Guohai's Remarks Are Worthy of Attention: Japan's Ambitions Remain Strong

[Report from our newspaper] The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haiqian" ship, carrying overseas Chinese such as Chen Guohai and Zhang Yuxi, arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 PM yesterday and docked at the company's Second Wharf. They carried their luggage off the ship themselves and departed separately. Relevant overseas Chinese affairs agencies did not send anyone to take care of them. Last night, our reporter visited Chen Guohai at his residence, and he provided a detailed account, which is summarized as follows: "There were about 400 overseas Chinese returning home on this trip. We departed from Sasebo, Japan, on the 6th of this month and arrived in Taiwan on the 9th. About 300 Taiwanese people disembarked. Among them were 12 Japanese family members. Another Japanese family member, carrying four children, has also naturalized in our country and arrived in Shanghai with her husband yesterday. When the ship left Sasebo, the relatives and friends of these 13 Japanese family members all came to the pier to see them off, and they parted with tears."

Still Arrogant, Thinking They Are the Best in the World

"Generally, Japanese people do not admit that China won the war. They are still arrogant and think they are the best in the world. Intellectuals hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will start a war soon so that they can profit from it. Those of lower status hope that MacArthur will 'return' Taiwan and Korea to Japan. Therefore, Japanese people, both men and women, try their best to please the Americans and regard MacArthur as the second Emperor. Secondly, although the Japanese military has been disarmed, their fire brigade and police organization are extremely tight. Prime Minister Katayama announced that from July 1st, all 'overseas Chinese' in various countries must register, otherwise, they will be detained for six months if found. Currently, although Japan is extremely short of materials, due to strict control, there is no phenomenon of soaring prices like in Shanghai. From the first of this month, a personal rationing system has been implemented. To avoid black market transactions, all restaurants and food stalls across the country have been closed. 20% of our overseas Chinese in Japan were engaged in this business. Because they are good at managing, they have made huge profits, which has aroused jealousy among the Japanese. Therefore, many are planning to return home.

Arrogant Attitude, Hair-Raising

"Before we left Japan, we received a notice from the Overseas Chinese General Association that each person could bring three pieces of luggage, totaling 150 kilograms. Everyone carried a lot of purchased goods. When the ship left Sasebo, all of them were detained by the Japanese customs, resulting in huge losses. They disregard our victorious nation's international status. Their arrogant attitude is hair-raising." Finally, he said: Overseas Chinese in Japan all hope that our country will send an occupying army to Japan as soon as possible so that the lives of overseas Chinese can be guaranteed.

He lived in Northeast China as a child and is a "China expert," fluent in Chinese and the dialects of Shanghai and Hangzhou. During China's War of Resistance, he served as the intelligence director of the Japanese Army Hangzhou Special Affairs Agency, the branch chief of the Jinhua Special Affairs Agency, and the chief of the Security Section of the Ningbo Special Affairs Agency, specializing in intelligence gathering and controlling our country's materials. During the war, he also extensively recruited rogues as his henchmen to induce and coerce Chinese women, with hundreds of victims of his rape. He also repeatedly killed civilians and subjected non-military personnel to illegal torture. His heinous acts were widely known, and the people of Hangzhou and Ningbo all hated him with gnashing teeth.

### Wage Dispute in the City's Letterpress Printing Industry: Arbitration Panel Establishes Six Measures

[Report from our newspaper] The wage dispute in the city's letterpress printing industry has been resolved by the Third Wage Arbitration Panel of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee by establishing six measures.

If there are no living subsidies for workers' families, the amount will be discounted in accordance with the regulations, and then further discounted by 90%. Even if there are living subsidies for workers' families, if the amount is less than 13.5 yuan, it can be calculated proportionally from "90% to 85%" according to the discount method in this item. (3) The wages for the first half of each month shall be calculated in accordance with the index of the previous month, and the wages for the second half of the month shall be calculated in accordance with the index of the current month. (4) Companies and manufacturers whose wage methods have been individually resolved after the cost-of-living index was unfrozen shall continue to handle the matter according to their own resolved methods. (5) The above items 1 to 3 shall be implemented from June 1st of this year to October 31st of the same year. After the expiration date, the labor and management sides of the industry shall negotiate on their own according to the situation at that time. (6) The discounts for the wages for May of this year shall be handled in accordance with the methods in items 1 and 2 and calculated in accordance with the cost-of-living index for that month.

### Impressions of the Singapore Tour (3)

Looking at the results of the four games, we feel that Xingdao's skills are still higher than those of the local team. Xingdao's visit has at least given two lessons to the football world: the necessity of a coach and the importance of the forwards' shooting skills. There is no shortage of talent that can be created locally, but what is lacking is collective training and dedicated coaching talent. The local clubs are not as serious as those in Hong Kong. They do not have designated training times for their teams, so they do not pay attention to the coaches who are responsible for guiding them. In the future, if they can imitate the Hong Kong clubs and spend more money and time to train players, the future achievements may be more than this. The impressions left by Xingdao's tour of Singapore this time vary from person to person. Most sports enthusiasts regret their lack of "new blood." Players like Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Xu Jingcheng have been famous in the football world for more than ten years. No matter how deep their skills are, they always feel that they are old and their strength is declining, which is an inevitable trend. It is not something that human power can reverse. Considering the future of the sports world or the glory of Xingdao, they deeply hope that new people will emerge and show a new momentum. Especially since Xingdao is going to England to observe this time, young players should be given more opportunities to learn from it. The lineup this time cannot help but evoke the sadness of "Travels of Lao Ts'an."

Although Xingdao has failed to meet the desires of fans with a brand-new appearance here, it can get Xingdao to fully demonstrate refreshing football skills and develop noble sportsmanship at a time when the football world in this area has been repeatedly criticized for its rude behavior. This is exactly Xingdao's glorious harvest. Regarding this point, the Chinese and Western newspapers in this area have repeatedly praised it. I believe that although Xingdao cannot return in complete victory, it has returned with praise. This kind of harvest is believed to be more valuable than victory. We wish Xingdao to further develop this spirit in England and earn more fame, use a sincere heart to learn other people's skills, and wait for the return to train young people in the future.

### Zhang Huanzhang and Others Hosted Figures from All Circles to Report on the Initiation of Joint Operations, Elaborating on the Characteristics and Advantages of the Joint Operating Company

[This Newspaper News] Zhang Huanzhang, Huang Yuanxin, Ye Xupan, and ten other members of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Import and Export Joint Operating Company hosted distinguished figures from all circles in the city and journalists at the Customs Club at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Huanzhang, director of the preparatory committee, delivered a speech on the spot. He first described the reasons for the decline of international trade and the motivation for the company's founding. He then elaborated on the company's organizational principles and characteristics.

(1) The characteristics of the Joint Operating Company are as follows:

(1) The Joint Operating Company should be an enterprise organized to break the deadlock for import and export colleagues and seek common welfare; it is by no means a trust monopolizing international trade.

(2) The Joint Operating Company should be an open organization that takes into account the welfare of other industries; it should not be exclusive or exclusionary. Under this premise, the demands of Chinese industry, agriculture, and vegetables should be given priority. For example, seeking outlets for the export of Chinese industrial products and agricultural products, increasing the import supply of machinery and raw materials needed for construction and sustained production, and using imported materials to attract overseas remittances and foreign deposits.

(3) The Joint Operating Company should assist the government in promoting economic policies and enriching the national treasury's tax revenue. In particular, it must support postwar economic construction policies and cultivate the foundation of the national economy; it is by no means seeking a separate path outside of national policy.

(4) The Joint Operating Company is based on assisting import and export colleagues and adopts a mutual entrustment joint operation system, so that those in the same industry who have commercial relations with the company and are engaged in exports are responsible for the risk of international market price fluctuations. On the premise of settling their foreign exchange earnings with the Joint Operating Company, impossible exports become possible, and reasonable profits are obtained. Those engaged in import can also be entrusted by the company to engage in import trade, without being threatened by domestic market price increases and decreases, making it easier to import and obtaining legal surplus.

(2) The advantages of the Joint Operating Company are as follows:

(1) Under the overall planning of the Joint Operating Company, import and export trade can be appropriately adjusted. Although the foreign exchange obtained by the company can be used by the company, a special account is still opened and deposited in the Central Bank, subject to its supervision, so that a foreign exchange black market cannot be generated. Capital flight is also impossible.

(2) Industrial raw materials and production equipment are planned and ordered by the Joint Operating Company according to actual needs, which can reduce the import price of raw materials for manufacturers, promote increased production, and prosper industrial and agricultural enterprises.

(3) Finished products of domestic goods manufacturers can be developed by the Joint Operating Company in foreign markets and sold abroad as much as possible, exchanging them for the required raw materials to increase their production capacity.

(4) Overseas remittances and foreign deposits can be attracted by the Joint Operating Company with imported materials, avoiding evasion.

(5) Since the Joint Operating Company uses its own export foreign exchange earnings to operate import business, if it can be fully promoted, it will not only be unnecessary to rely on the government to supply foreign exchange, but the company can instead contribute a portion of its foreign exchange to the government.

(6) With the development of the Joint Operating Company's business and the prosperity of import and export trade, not only can the international balance of payments gradually become balanced, but tax revenue will increase sharply, the treasury will be enriched, and the national budget can also be balanced.

(3) The process of initiating the Joint Operating Company: After a long period of planning, the company convened a meeting of promoters on June 26, passed the company's initiation, articles of association, and prospectus, and appointed a preparatory committee to formally establish a preparatory office and submit a request to the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance for special permission to establish it. A first preparatory meeting was convened on July 8 to actively carry out preparatory work. It is hoped that distinguished figures from all circles, wishes, and leading opinions will not hesitate to advise and assist, so that the international trade of our country, which has a long history, can continue to develop, and the prospects of the national economy will truly depend on it. Outside the arena, the old stocks in Zhabei rose again by about half a percentage point, and the remaining stocks also rose slightly.

### Great Prosperity in the Shanghai Stock Market on the Weekend; Loose Monetary Policy and Active Young Factions

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market met Saturday, and people were excited by the help of loose monetary policy. The young members of the securities firms were very active, aggressively pursuing No. 23, No. 89 towards Yong Yarn, No. 152 towards Dunasin and Harmony, and No. 157 vigorously attacking Mayer, all three full of vitality. Jingfu and Xingguang followed closely behind. Wuhe Weaving strived to move upstream, and the market price has already surpassed Jingfu.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was very active. The atmosphere in the market was unanimously tight due to the rise in cotton yarn. However, due to the small amount of inventory and the small amount of arrivals, prices rose again compared with the previous day. Recently, the flower prices in the producing areas have not fallen, and the merchants have no profit to see, and most of them have stopped. Therefore, before the new cotton is on the market, the source is not smooth, and the market price is also difficult to face small. The trend is always in a high market.

### Cotton Cloth Overtly Firm but Covertly Weak

Yesterday's cotton cloth market presented a situation of overt rise and covert decline. The Guangzhou cloth price was inverted with the Shanghai market, and the buying taste was sluggish. The Hankou market was similar to Shanghai, so the customer traffic was very small. In addition, the head cloth market banned the old, and there were many closings. The market had plenty of chips, so as a result, fine cloths such as Blue Chicken, Colorful Ball, and Yanghe fell by 2,000 to 45,000 yuan compared with the previous day. High-end soil forest, blue cloth, raw cloth, and bleached cloth sister city are still stable. The price of Fangjian's supply and sale of Wufu fine cloth is 420,000 yuan, and the jumping carp and agricultural machine is 455,000 yuan, which is also a stable but soft trend.

### Resuming Sino-Japanese Trade: Efforts Should Be Made to Increase Exports

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Mr. Tang Jiusheng, a business specialist from our country's delegation stationed in Japan, recently returned home on official business. Yesterday, he told reporters: "The entire Japanese nation is tightening its belts, hoping to restore its pre-war trade position. Among the Japanese people, it is not as if no one can live a comfortable life, but they would rather endure hardship and self-discipline, sacrificing individual comfort to 'export through hunger.' This is not mere propaganda, but a true reflection of the situation. We must be vigilant and deeply reflect on this." He further pointed out two points that the Chinese people should pay attention to in resuming Sino-Japanese trade: (1) Some merchants hope to import cheap Japanese goods to obtain huge profits. This idea is completely wrong. It should be known that trade with Japan is conducted in US dollars. Imports only deplete foreign exchange reserves, and there are very few Japanese goods of excellent quality that can be purchased today. Therefore, we should focus on striving to increase exports in trade with Japan. Some export goods that the Japanese side needs, such as medicinal materials, have not yet been noticed by us. As for our country's trade policy, it has always been unsound. It is hoped that the government will improve it as soon as possible so that export merchants can receive assistance. (2) At the beginning of the resumption of trade, the trade volume should not be too large. At this time, if powerful merchants are allowed to step in and monopolize, legitimate merchants will have no room to operate. Furthermore, the import of "prohibited items" will reduce the import of legitimate goods. He stated that the delegation has made preparations for the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade and will soon set up commercial offices. As for the issue of Japanese foreign exchange, it will also be resolved at that time. He also said that Japan has no shortage of raw materials, especially coal, iron, and food. Although its industry has not yet returned to its pre-war level, industrial recovery can be accelerated after trade resumes.

### Taipei in Midsummer

— Taipei, 10th Telegram. Our Correspondent Jiang Muyun.

Taipei has now entered midsummer. During the day, the sun blazes fiercely. People walk along the covered walkways, slowly and deliberately, reflecting the characteristics of a subtropical people. In the afternoon, around three or four o'clock, a black cloud drifts in from the sea, accompanied by rumbling thunder, followed by a shower. The wind, rain, and even thunder in Taiwan are frightening. But the evening is cool and refreshing. The weather and the national character provide a good contrast.

Roads

Roads

are full of hawkers selling army surplus, foreign cloth, groceries, cigarettes, and coral. The police still pass by as usual. The 228 Incident has made the security authorities wary of small-scale traders. But the most timely are the ice vendors, using different sounds, tones, and methods to solicit business from passersby. The authorities have not yet considered whether this hinders sanitation or whether it should be banned.

From the 10th

From the 10th

, government agencies resumed afternoon office hours. What has plagued civil servants the most these past ten days is how to spend a long afternoon. After all, there are too few places in Taipei to kill time.

A miracle

A miracle

has occurred in Taiwan. Taipei, like Shanghai, is experiencing a serious housing shortage. Places have been occupied and lived in. Finding a storefront in the bustling city is too difficult, and finding a dilapidated house in the quiet suburbs is really difficult. As a result, "key money" similar to tickets is prevalent, with prices of two to five million being shouted out, with new tricks constantly emerging.

The Japanese Property Management Committee, which manages vast Japanese assets throughout the province, now has its own housing problem. The Highway Bureau, the owner of the building, wants them to move to a four-story "mezzanine," which has not yet been resolved.

Hotels

Hotels

are crowded with Shanghai businessmen. Eight or nine out of ten are doing business in railway sleepers. They know that there is not much hope, but they must try every means to get connections. Hotel room rates have risen from 100 to 500 yuan per person. Even if they are not accommodated, they still have to pay tips. Although they feel it is too expensive, they still have to endure it.

The official price of a railway sleeper is 550 yuan, but the Ministry stipulates a legal tender price of over 80,000 yuan, which is still profitable. As long as you can find a "permit" and obtain a "futures" contract from the Forestry Administration Bureau. Taiwan has four major forest areas, but the Railway Commission requires 800,000 sleepers, and there is not even a shadow of them yet. The trains roll on the sleepers, swaying and pressing down. The managers of each line are sending telegrams to report the emergency. They say that if something goes wrong, the staff cannot be responsible.

But sleepers continue to be shipped out of the port.

In the past

In the past, the Forestry Bureau had a major problem, and this hole is now being filled by the new Forestry Administration Bureau.

Huang Weiyan, an expert in forestry who studied in Germany, is now in prison, reportedly on suspicion of excessive logging and selling of timber. In the past, water accumulated in the deep mountains and flowed into the sea, taking three days. Now, it has been shortened to three hours. The lack of protection and planting of trees has caused suffering to the farmers in poor areas. Previously, the Japanese raised chickens for eggs, but now they raise chickens for meat, directly and simply.

A special investigation team from the provincial government and the courts, consisting of seven people, is preparing to conduct a comprehensive liquidation of the former Forestry Bureau's business within three weeks. The new Director Tang Banxu has proposed six plans to treat old diseases and prevent recurrence. Adjusting the official price to maintain balance with the black market and reconsidering the distribution method are among the main topics.

The proposal to expedite the restoration of the 450,000 KW Dahui Hydropower Plant, after a survey by personnel from the General Office of Hydropower Generation, has been revived. However, the civil engineering work, which is 70% complete, has been frequently damaged in the past year. The completed materials are openly stolen and transported away, which cannot be prevented.

This situation is similar to that of smuggling. The smuggled goods seized are either empty boxes or inferior goods.

Smuggling is a huge risk, but the waters around Taiwan are a paradise for these adventurers.

However, the authorities have repeatedly stated that they are determined and confident in preventing smuggling.

The registration of importers by the Provisional Import Control Committee unexpectedly saw over 800 applicants from the province. Merchants are waiting eagerly to see if they can be approved to operate the import business. But it seems that it will take another two or three months. It is estimated that about 80 will be approved.

Specialties

Specialties: Sugar, straw mats, bananas, watermelons. Just mentioning them makes people sigh: the prices at the place of origin are far higher than in Shanghai.

The rationing of sugar has been heard, with a price of 100 Taiwan dollars per catty, equivalent to 6,500 legal tender. The most common straw mat costs 7,000 to 8,000. Bananas are in high demand because the Allied forces stationed in Tokyo send specialists to inspect them, with each one costing 10 Taiwan dollars. Watermelons have been absent from the market for over a month due to rain.

Specialties cannot be enjoyed in their place of origin.

### Bitter Heat in West Lake

— Hangzhou, 6th Telegram. Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng.

Since the beginning of July, West Lake has been enveloped by a strong heat wave. The sun rises as early as six o'clock in the morning, shining on everyone who is still asleep, making them feel a burning sensation and forcing them to get out of bed. Thus, "heat" exerts its power, and everyone hides in the dark corners of their houses, fanning themselves constantly. Sweat still flows without end. If there is a tree, even a small one, in front of their door, they consider it a haven from the heat. Therefore, apart from those who have essential business to attend to, few people venture out on the streets, which are so deserted that only the occasional cry of a vendor selling "golden pumpkins" can be heard. After noon, the weather becomes even hotter. The sun is truly like a fiery canopy, and the roads are boiling hot. Although water trucks constantly sprinkle water on the asphalt roads, the asphalt is about to melt.

The Fahrenheit thermometer rises from 88 degrees in the morning. Watching the mercury gradually climb up, 90 degrees, 92 degrees, 93 degrees... all the way to 96 degrees. The heat has increased every day since, setting a record of 98 degrees.

The Charm of a Young Woman

Under the surging heat wave, West Lake has transformed into the demeanor of a woman in her thirties. The leaves of the trees on the lake are even denser and deeper, like her flowing black hair. From dawn to dusk, the entire lake surface can be seen at a glance, no longer half-shyly obscured by a light mist. At this moment, she is not half-reluctant and gentle, but rather full of intense and passionate love. Although she is as beautiful as ever, she is heavily made up, appearing vigorous and powerful.

West Lake, she certainly resembles the charm of a young woman.

In the morning, if you take a small boat to the depths of the lotus leaves and awaken the lotus clusters in their hazy state, the lotus will gently extend its jade arms, exuding fragrance, making you wonder if you are in a world of immortals. Or, if you take a boat to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and see the lotus flowers blooming on Xiaoying Island, it is like being in a fragrant water kingdom, forgetting all the vulgarities. From then on, you can stay on this embankment surrounded by lotus flowers from morning till night, letting the wind blowing from the lake wash away the summer heat in your heart. If you drive to Jiuxi or Longjing to escape the heat wave, or climb to Yanxia Cave to spend this hot summer. West Lake, who dares to say it is not a summer resort? However, many people are busy with their lives and do not have the leisure to appreciate the gifts of nature. Therefore, they can only continue to work in relatively dark corners.

Moonlight over the Inns

Cold drink shops are lined up, with one every twenty steps. Children selling popsicles carry wooden boxes and run around in the heat, shouting at the top of their lungs. Some vendors, with their whole families, live next to the roads, big and small, living on the roads all day long. They have formed two-way families. Rickshaw pullers, carrying heavy burdens, run with their feet competing with the scalding ground. These scenes are also a picture of struggling against nature. There are also many people who are busy with the general election. They come to Hangzhou one after another, regardless of the heat and heat waves, competing under the heat and heat waves.

Every summer on the shores of West Lake, hotels always reach the off-season period. This year, the hotel business is still good, and prices have also risen. The best rooms in the best hotels cost 150,000 yuan a day. People who come to Hangzhou to play despite the heat have not stopped yet. Many well-known people are still playing!

Red Lights on the Lakefront

When night falls and the sun sets, the deserted streets become lively. Everyone who escaped the fiery canopy runs out of their houses to the streets. Every road and every street is filled with bamboo beds and chairs. Even the most prosperous and modern Tingling Road is no exception. Many people lie barefoot and with bare arms on these chairs, fanning themselves to cool off, and only move back into their houses late at night, around two or three o'clock.

The lakefront is even more lively, with people pushing and squeezing each other. Vendors selling Yongguo, soda water, and cold drinks are all concentrated in the six parks along the lakefront. The Sixth Park is full of people. The grass is full of people sitting and lying down. The Lakeside Tea House in the Sixth Park is even more crowded. People who go to drink tea later have to stand aside and wait. The boat business is booming at this time. Many people want to go out on the lake, which costs 10,000 yuan per hour, and some even bargain up to 15,000 yuan. Some people bring soda water, fruit, and musical instruments, row to the center of the lake, and play instruments or sing songs, which is very pleasant.

There are also many girls who specialize in singing ditties. They are on boats in the middle of the lake. When your boat approaches, someone will solicit you to hire them to sing. Singing one song costs about 5,000 yuan, or even 10,000 yuan.

This year, all the boats have a red lantern. The twinkling red stars are spread across the dark night. Looking from the center of the lake to the lakefront, the red and green neon lights are dazzling and eye-catching. The open-air cinemas and night gardens are all competing to be beautifully decorated.

### The Most Economical Air Engine (Part Two)

— Cheng Yikun

Utilizing Four Pistons in Four Cylinders

In previous hot air engines, there were two pistons installed in the same cylinder. In fact, one generates power and the other regenerates heat. After numerous studies, Philips invented a four-cylinder air engine that uses four pistons to achieve the goal of one piston per cylinder. This invention not only saves a lot of materials and engineering during manufacturing but also greatly increases the efficiency of the entire machine.

As mentioned above, the biggest shortcomings of old-fashioned hot air engines are their large size, heavy weight, and low efficiency. According to the engine program manual printed in 1923 by a famous engine manufacturer in the world, the most advanced hot air engine at that time weighed 1,500 pounds, had a volume of approximately 25 cubic meters, and generated only two horsepower. Now, a two-horsepower Philips air engine weighs only 30 pounds (only 1/50th of the previous weight) and has a size of only 0.2 cubic meters (only 1/125th of the previous volume), while its efficiency is twice as high as before. If the Philips air engine is compared with an internal combustion engine of the same size and weight, the power and efficiency it generates are also very close.

Great Advantages: Fuel is Not Fixed

The biggest expense of any engine is fuel. According to economic principles, internal combustion engines are more economical than steam engines, and among internal combustion engines, diesel engines are more economical than gasoline engines. The Philips air engine is between a diesel engine and a gasoline engine. However, the Philips air engine has a great advantage in terms of fuel: it does not necessarily have to use a fixed fuel to start it. Diesel engines must use diesel, and gasoline engines must use gasoline. The Philips air engine can use not only diesel or gasoline but also kerosene, vegetable oil, alcohol, gas, natural gas, charcoal gas, and any other fuel that can heat air. In places where fuel supply is difficult, such as the interior of our country, the Philips air engine is the most suitable and ideal.

In terms of durability, diesel engines, gasoline engines, and all other internal combustion engines are not as durable as steam engines. The most vulnerable parts of an internal combustion engine are its cylinders and pistons. This is because the fuel after mixing oil and air constantly explodes and burns in the cylinder, and in fact, it is impossible to burn completely. A part of the hot oil and hot gas reacts chemically with the steel of the cylinder and piston itself before being discharged, gradually dissolving and damaging them. The cylinders and pistons of the Philips air engine are constantly in contact with only filtered hot air and nothing else. Moreover, this hot air is only compressed and expanded in the cylinder and does not explode or burn in the cylinder, so there is no possibility of it being chemically reacted and dissolved. Therefore, the Philips air engine is more durable than any other engine.

Internal combustion engines have a very obvious disadvantage: the exhaust gas they emit is abundant and smelly and contains a large amount of toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, as well as pollutants and soot. The Philips air engine is very clean and hygienic. The hot air it needs is heated outside the cylinder, the fuel can be completely burned, and the hot air can be filtered before being input into the cylinder. The exhaust gas discharged from the cylinder, in addition to a slight amount of hot air, has no possibility of containing toxic or odorous gases.

The Philips air engine does not use timed cyclic explosions to generate power like internal combustion engines, so it makes very little noise when it is running. Unlike internal combustion engines, which make a deafening noise, a 15-horsepower Philips air engine used in a car makes only as much noise as a regular household sewing machine when it is running, even without sound insulation equipment.

The air engine does not use explosions to generate power, so it does not need spark plugs, distributors, coils, wires, or other electrical equipment. Therefore, it will not stop due to electrical circuit problems.

In addition, air engines have another great advantage: they can still generate great power even when running very slowly. When using a Philips air engine in a car, not only can gears be saved in the gearbox, but the entire transmission equipment can also be eliminated. This can save a lot of engineering materials and costs in car manufacturing, and it will be extremely convenient when driving.

The Philips laboratory is constantly studying various principles. Often, when studying a certain problem, in order to improve, it also studies many new theories, new methods, and new things. The final results are often unexpectedly successful, creating many new things that were not originally thought of. When the air engine was first studied, it was only intended to use the principles of hot air engines to create a more economical and lightweight engine. After more than ten years of continuous research, calculation, improvement, and experimentation, many completely different new parts, new assembly methods, and new materials were completed. Finally, the most economical air engine introduced in this article was completed. Now, these Philips air engines, from 1/10 horsepower to hundreds of horsepower, in various sizes and forms, are readily available. They can be used in cars, trains, factories, homes, and any other place that needs power. European and American countries have already placed large orders and adopted them. In the near future, they should be popular throughout our country to help construction. Because it has many characteristics that are suitable for our needs, especially its fuel supply and economical durability, which are most in line with our country's ideals. It is hoped that in the future, the cost of power can be reduced as a result, and various industries and sciences can rely on it to advance rapidly. Due to space limitations, this newspaper was unable to provide a detailed description. If readers have any questions about this air engine, they can send a letter to P.O. Box 905, Shanghai Post Office, to communicate directly with me. I will do my best to answer everything I know.

### Diagram of New Engine Principle

[Figure 1] Diagram of hot air engine:

The already compressed air is heated in the cylinder VW by the heater II, expands, and pushes the piston ZW to generate power. Driven by the flywheel, the piston ZW is pushed back into the cylinder after generating power. It pushes the air in VW, which has been used and is gradually cooling down but is still relatively hot, through the partition R of the heat regenerator and the cooler K, and into the heat regeneration cylinder VK. This cooled air is compressed and heated again in VK by the piston ZK under the action of the flywheel. This regenerated heat is then input into the cylinder VW through K and R to generate power again.

The heater H is heated by the boiler B. The cooler K is cooled by water or air. This is because if the hot air pushed out of the power cylinder is compressed again without cooling, its temperature will be too high and it will explode. Therefore, it must be cooled before the two cylinders can have a suitable temperature.

On the hot air engine, its two piston rods D are pinned in the center at C1 and C2. Then connect to the horizontal axis S (that is, both sides of the flywheel). On this flywheel, the piston rod of the power cylinder is installed 90 degrees in front of the piston rod of the heat regenerator, so the rotation of the power piston precedes the heat regenerator piston by 90 degrees.

[Figure 2] Diagram of V-type hot air engine:

The principle of this engine is exactly the same as that of Figure 1, but it adds a weight G to the flywheel for uniform rotation. Because this engine uses a V-type installation, it saves a few parts of the power transmission equipment compared to the one shown in Figure 1. The position of the entire machine is also slightly reduced, and the flywheel rotates evenly, so the vibration is also reduced.

[Figure 3] Diagram of Philips four-cylinder air engine:

This engine has a hot air position VW at the top of each cylinder, and a cold air position VK on the same cylinder. The hot air part VW of the first cylinder is connected to the cold air part VK of the second cylinder, with the heater H, heat regenerator R, and cooler K installed in between. The other cylinders are also installed in the same way. Each piston is connected to the same horizontal axis. The first cold piston is connected to the fourth piston Z4 at 90-degree intervals, so the first piston always moves 90 degrees before the second piston. This continues to the fourth piston, forming a 360-degree full circle rotation.

[Figure 4] Diagram of the oldest hot air engine:

This engine only has a piston Z to generate power, and P is a hot and cold air exchange piston. R is the furnace, which heats the cold air in VW, and the hot air is transmitted to VK through P, and at the same time, it is compressed by R, causing it to expand and push the piston Z. The used cold air returns to VW through VK and P, and is then heated by B, so the cycle continues and generates power.

[Figure 5] The first hot air engine manufactured according to the principle of Figure 4: The tall cylinder on the right is divided into upper and lower parts: the lower part is the boiler (i.e., B in Figure 4), and the upper part is the hot and cold air exchanger (i.e., VW, P, and the VK part above P in Figure 4). The small cylinder in the figure contains a piston (i.e., Z and VK below it in Figure 4). On the left of the figure is the flywheel. Other rotating equipment can be seen in the figure.

This figure is a reproduction of the original woodcut print published in the science magazine De Natuur in 1882. (See the figure below for details)

Spring and Autumn

### Jiang Zaixi's Paintings

— Xuan Chang

In recent art circles, many artists have emerged, with splendid talents and competing styles. Among them, there are many talented young people who are immersed in art and make courageous and diligent progress. Jiang Zaixi is one of them, as far as I know. Zaixi, with the courtesy name Jian, graduated from Suzhou Art College ten years ago, hailed as a top disciple. Even his early works amazed the elders. Since the Japanese invaders committed their rebellion, he has been confined to the sea, and has devoted himself even more intently to the Six Canons of Painting. At that time, Suzhou Art College also moved to Shanghai, and he was hired as a professor, where he taught and learned alongside his students. When he went out, he traveled with various prominent figures, and he never tired of learning. Thus, his art has greatly improved. In his painting, he initially took the Song and Yuan masters as his model, and over time, he fully understood their essence. His works often show a sense of rustic simplicity in their meticulous detail. Down to the Ming and Qing masters, he never failed to emulate them with his heart and hands. It can be said that he is able to comprehensively understand them. Therefore, in landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and running animals, wherever his art extends, he has his own unique style. In recent years, he has loved to paint butterflies, lifelike among the flowers, with a divine and immortal appearance. For a time, he was known as "Jiang the Butterfly." I say that calligraphy and painting do not have to be rigidly bound to the past, but they must originate from the ancients. The essence lies in having the ancients within, so that every stroke has its own identity. What is called talent and learning complement each other to achieve success! Zaixi can be said to have attained this.

Zaixi is a fellow townsman of mine, elegant and talented, with calligraphy based on seal script. Recently, he has exhibited his best works, accumulated over time, at the Daxin Painting Hall. I use this article to promote him.

### Presented to Jiang Zaixi

— Lü Baihua

I visited Yu Yi at Xuan Chang Lou, and met Jiang Jun Zaixi, who is good at painting.

He captured the spirit of Xu Huang, a rising talent. I was honored to receive a painting, with lively birds and plants, and a pure

wind within. Now Jiang Jun is exhibiting his recent works, and I offer this poem in tribute.

Later, you should be happy to reside at the top, I will see you again at Xuan Yang Lou, Waiting to receive a fan with treasures of Ji Style, Lively birds and plants fill the Southern Clouds!

### The Realism of Perception in Painting

— Liu Shi

I have previously discussed the trend in the modern Paris school of painting to explore visual realism. Here, I will describe the opposing trend, which emphasizes what is called "perception" (Connaissance). Generally speaking, although modern art emphasizes "reason" (Intelligence), one can still observe in painting a trend towards expressing the reality perceived through perception. We refer to this tendency within the Paris school as "realism of perception" (Realite de Connaissance).

The so-called perception or reason in painting refers to a form of sensibility, not the concepts of perception or reason. In other words, perception in painting is examined in situations where the center of sensibility is regarded as the center of intellect, or where that sensibility has a perceptive direction. This trend is not only present in modern art, but also to some extent in the tradition of French painting, which is undeniable. If one carefully examines the works of classical artists like J.L. David and Ingres, one can find a considerable perceptive atmosphere. This underlying traditional element can be said to be quite pronounced in modern French painting, especially in the Paris school. At the very least, the pursuit of intellectual sensibility is one of the most modern characteristics. The tendency to demand reason or perception as seen in modern painting is a trend that demands "sensibility" (Sensibilite), and this trend can be said to be unprecedented in the history of painting.

Taking the form of how we view objects as an example: If we view it completely according to its natural form, then it is pure naturalism. If we view it with the direction of painting in mind, with visual truth as the center, then it must be said to be visual realism. Conversely, in the direction of perception, whether it be lines or surfaces, they are detached from nature and follow the mechanism of painting, maintaining this state to construct the form of the painting. Furthermore, if one senses the material properties of an object, that will also express the perceived reality of the object. It can be handled as a mechanical sketch or as a close-up. The same can be said in the case of color. Therefore, if one extremely inclines towards the direction of perception, it becomes nothing more than a symbol, or it acquires a symbolic power. For example, Cubism, which extremely promotes the formation of composition. Many artists and schools that emerged from this are based on this perception. To give a more extreme example, there is Dadaism.

Although Dadaism is anarchism in painting, it is not irrational doubt or negation, but rather the raw exposure of absolute intellect and perception.

This tendency is most appropriately displayed by Cubism. It can be said that Cubist painting has fully surpassed visual perspective and foreshortening. If one pursues visual truth, then the so-called perspective or foreshortening becomes a problem. However, based on reason and perception, it is not difficult to get rid of them. Therefore, Cubists have tried to express the intervals of four-dimensional time or objects on a single canvas, using overlapping and juxtaposition. What Cubists perceive is neither visual pleasure of painting, nor the sentiment of painting. It is entirely respect for perception in painting, the extreme driving force of perceptive sensibility.

All the painters of the "Paris School" that have grown from this tendency in painting are emphasizing this so-called perceptive sensibility. For example, Surrealism, although it lacks the doubt and negation of Dadaism, can be said to be making use of perceptive sensibility, even viewing it as a kind of symbol or something symbolic. Surrealism noticeably emphasizes imagination in the process of observing objects, but in fact, it is not only about emphasizing imagination, but also about perceptually transforming the dimension of that imagination. (It is not a deformational depiction like Cubism.) Therefore, its emphasis on imagination should be the opposite of perceptive sensibility, but in fact, there is no relation. What is meant by using imagination to deform the perception of things is nothing more than promoting the realism of perception. Therefore, the spirit of Dadaism and the spirit of Surrealism in painting can both be said to be trends that explore the realism of perception in painting.

This trend can be seen in all painters who create based on Cubism in the modern Paris school. Whether it is George Braque (1882), Chirico (1883), or M. Gromaire, they all have this tendency in common. Among these, we can also distinguish two tendencies of perception:

(1) Although pursuing the truth of perception, it is realistic, that is, it should be called realistic realism of perception (Realite Realistique de Connaissance). For example, the aforementioned George Braque, Gromaire, Chirico, etc., all belong to this category.

(2) Although claiming to be pursuing the truth of perception, it is mechanical, possessing a mechanical tendency, that is, it should be called mechanical realism of perception (Realite Mechanique de Connaissance). Many writers with the general tendency known as Purism can be cited as examples.

### Inscription for Viewing Huangshan Masterpiece

— Zheng Wuchang

The Creator displays divine skill, using the earth to fashion mountains. Day and night, nature rivals divine creation, conveying the sights of the world. In recent times, there were Ma Yuan and Xia Gui; in ancient times, Jing Hao and Guan Tong. Who does not emulate nature, with brilliant, dazzling carriages? Among the famous scholars of Jinan, Yu, Ma, and Ban are counted. He excels in three arts and loves traveling, experiencing countless changes. The Yellow Mountains are especially cherished, reaching the hidden peaks through arduous climbs; the eyes take in the scenery, the heart understands, and the brush captures its essence. The strange pines are especially peculiar, thirty-six in number, like beautiful women with dark eyebrows. In five days, a masterpiece is created, with the imposing force of an arrayed wall. Startling the creatures, a single brush stroke conveys the heart's pity.

### Viewing Yu Jianhua's Landscape Painting Exhibition

Jianhua is a banished immortal, his talent shining brightly. Growing up near Mount Tai, he absorbed its beauty in childhood. Paintings fill his chest, inspiration always at his wrist. He tirelessly wanders great rivers and famous mountains. Since the chaos began, he has dwelt in a corner of the sea. Far from high carriages, he spends his years with a broken inkstone. His mind contains the clouds rising from the peaks, and the wild geese falling on the sandy shore. He kneads his thoughts to trace their origin, opening up his mind to explore their changes. One day, a grand spectacle arises, four walls filled with elegant appreciation. Half a thousand things delight his heart, seen in a dream of the Northern Garden. He paints a giant Yellow Mountain, piling up wonders in successive layers. From afar, one hears the roar of a tiger in the spring, and the tall pines become sights to be observed. The verdant peaks tower thousands of feet high, with a casual freedom surpassing all his peers. He only hates that the chaos has not ended, and his fleeting life has fallen into sorrow and worry. Reading the painting, let us set our minds free, discussing it together. Tomorrow, we will bring wine money, a hundred cups to toast and encourage each other.

### Yu Bingru's Art Exhibition

— Shi Liang

– Tune: Rume Ling –

Comrade Yu Bingru is holding an art exhibition at the girls' middle school located in the center of Garde Road. The pieces are dazzling and beautiful beyond compare. I would not be exaggerating to compare her to the Ming dynasty painter, Ms. Wu Juan. I offer this short verse as my congratulations.

Her brushwork naturally emulates creation, and her artistic conception is fascinatingly surprising.

See the elegance of the water and the heroism of the mountains. Such beautiful scenes are gracefully displayed by you.

Graceful, graceful—her elegance rivals Wu Juan's.

### Four Heroes Painting

— Zheng Renshan

In the early days of victory in the thirty-fourth year, artist Zheng Renshan used a large piece of Jiangse paper to paint four British people, symbolizing the four allies, and to celebrate the victory. It is atmospheric and magnificent, and it is worth seeing. It was inscribed by Ma Gongyu. Recently, with the completion of the Capital's Jieshou Hall, Mr. Zheng generously donated it to show his respect. The meaning of the head of state. The right is a miniature of the painting. (Editor)

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 341

— Ye Jingfeng

Besides this couple, there was also a young servant named Liu Wu, a cousin of Liu's. At this time, he was a strong and vigorous eighteen-year-old lad. Under "Zero Four," he was a well-known troublemaker who knew a few words and followed "Zero Four" to learn how to send and receive telegrams and Japanese. Unfortunately, "Zero Four's" own Japanese was not very good, and he had a stutter, so Liu Wu's Japanese not only didn't improve, but he also picked up the stutter.

Our group of five, posing as "Fifteen," followed the Japanese military train from Beiping smoothly to Changping. In the inn, we didn't have to cook our own meals, so I managed the communications in the inn, and sent Du Er and his wife, "Zero Four," and Liu Wu outside to find out about the local Japanese military's movements and routes of advance.

As soon as I installed this German-style dual-purpose generator, I connected with Beiping. Mr. W told me that half an hour after I left Beiping, he received several reports sent by Yaoqun and Hucheng two days earlier.

Hucheng's report was also said to have been sent from Changping. This time, the information was indeed written in his own hand, but the way it was delivered was quite novel. I don't know if it was his own idea or if he learned it from somewhere, but it had a very secretive flavor. He cut a report in half and sent it to Mr. W's headquarters with two messengers, each carrying one half.

The report was a total of more than a hundred words, and it took Mr. W more than an hour to understand the general idea, which was even more difficult than deciphering a complex code. According to the report, he had found Yaoqun's whereabouts, although they had not met. Also, the people from the Northeast Village, for some reason, did not gather in Zhangbei as planned, but instead ran to Changping and were captured by the Japanese.

The report also said, "Little Tiger expects to see Yaoqun within a day or two."

Regarding Yaoqun's report, Mr. W said he received two items: one was a telegram, using a simple coded language, which was very brief, only mentioning that the work was complicated and that Tiger Chen had misunderstood, leading to inconsistent actions. The other was a postcard, also in coded language, explaining that the work in Tianjin could not be finished and could only be temporarily left alone, hoping that headquarters would send someone to handle it quickly. She herself had already set out to the designated location to contact her subordinates.

According to Mr. W's opinion, Yaoqun's so-called "Tianjin work" probably did not only refer to strengthening the secret organization, but may also have included other temporary events. The numbers marked on this telegram and postcard were not consecutive, so there were probably two or three reports in between that were not delivered or were lost. Mr. W also speculated that Yaoqun was currently lingering in the Jingping area.

After I finished talking with Mr. W, I was busy sending out two secret messages, (1) to Panyang, and (2) to Tokyo, both inquiring about Tsurumi's whereabouts, reporting my current location, and specifying the time and wavelength for sending and receiving reports.

### Daqian and Jianhua

— Fei Su

Yu Jianhua and Zhang Daqian are old friends of twenty years. In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Daqian brothers and Shanzi exhibited their collection of Ming and Qing paintings and calligraphy in the Dafengtang on Ximen Road. Jianhua braved the snow to see it, circling, sitting, and lying down, unwilling to leave. They then became friends. At that time, Jianhua taught at Xinhua Art Academy, and their residences were not far apart, so they often visited each other, and Jianhua often ate at Daqian's house. Jianhua did not like spicy food, but Daqian was from Sichuan, and every dish was spicy. Jianhua closed his eyes and forced it down, and his sweat dripped down. In the spring of the seventeenth year, the Daqian brothers initiated, inviting Huang Binhong, Chen Gangshu, Xiong Songquan, Ma Qizhou, Cai Yimin, Yu Jianhua, and other eight people to meet at Songyin Cottage to form the Lanman Society. Because Binhong was old and highly respected, they jointly elected him as president. Daqian was the youngest, and Jianhua was two years older than Daqian. At the beginning of the Lanman Society, there were various plans, and a volume of Lanman cartoon collections was published. Later, due to personnel changes, the society's affairs could not be carried out. In the past twenty years, Gangshu, Qizhou, Yimin, and Shanzi have passed away one after another. Only half of them remain today. Binhong, at the age of eighty, is traveling to Beiping. Songquan is in Shanghai. Jianhua has just returned from Fujian, and Daqian has returned from a tired tour of Dunhuang. Meeting and talking about the past, it is like a dream.

Each of the eight members of the society had their own expertise. Binhong's landscapes went in and out of the Song and Yuan Dynasties and had a unique appearance. Gangshu's flowers were refined and beautiful, between Bai Yang and Xin Luo. Qizhou was good at everything and liked to write Northern School landscapes. Yimin painted bamboo with the style of Huzhou. Songquan liked to paint animals, especially lions. Although Shanzi was good at landscapes and figures, his paintings of tigers were the most sought after, so at that time, "Xiong's Feet" and "Zhang's Tiger" became their nicknames. At that time, Daqian was fascinated by Shitao and Bada. Jianhua was originally good at landscapes, but he was not known as a family. Shanzi said that for three hundred years, there has been no successor to Bancan, and he often persuaded Jianhua to devote himself to this tradition. Jianhua, with the majestic and bold spirit of Qi and Lu, studied thick and dense paintings, hitting it off immediately, and soon he could even confuse the real with the fake. Jianhua engraved a seal that said "Half of Bancan," which was actually a humble saying.

In the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Daqian and Jianhua agreed to cross the East China Sea to Japan and take in the beauty of Mount Fuji, Hakone, and Atami. Jianhua also held an art exhibition in Osaka, which was highly praised by the art world there. Since then, Jianhua has believed that learning from nature is better than learning from the ancients. He traveled to famous mountains and rivers in the southeast, "exhausting the wonders of the peaks to draft his ideas." He returned and compared his impressions with the works of ancient masters, and he was even more convinced that what he saw was correct. Daqian wrote in his travelogue of Yandang Mountain:

"I heard of the beauty of Yandang Mountain a long time ago, but I haven't been able to travel there for ten years. The scenery of Longqiu north and south, I often seek in my dreams. Yu Zi has a clear interest, and his feet are strong when climbing mountains. Thousands of peaks support the bottom of my eyes, and each one is collected at the end of his brush. I can't get tired of seeing it hundreds of times, and I pity that my wish has just been fulfilled. If I were to raise Ershi, I would clap my hands in praise."

He also said: "After returning from Yandang, he showed me several things in a small booklet. The scenery is strange and precipitous, which is naturally created by nature, and the wonderful use of the brush is derived from Shixi and Shitao. I wrote a few vulgar sentences to make you laugh. Daqian Zhang Yuan."

In the past ten years, Daqian has been immersed in art and has a well-established reputation in the world. Jianhua traveled and painted, his scope of knowledge increased day by day, and his skills improved. Moreover, Jianhua had studied Western painting, so he was especially able to capture the likeness in his sketches. The Yellow Mountain and Baiyue Mountain, Mount Wuyi, and Yandang Mountain that he wrote, those who have traveled to the places, can recognize them at first sight. And the use of brushes, the layout, and the coloring are all in line with ancient methods, but they do not fall into the clichés of the ancients. There is neither the habit of the new school, nor the disadvantages of copying. Is it not Jianhua who is referred to when we say "learning from nature externally and obtaining the source of the heart internally"? Now Jianhua will show his works for the public to enjoy. Daqian happened to return to Chengdu for business and was unable to attend the event in person. Now, I will describe the relationship between the two as an introduction for the viewers.

### A Record of the "Awakening" Tea Party

— Su Honglie

With the enthusiasm of a young person, I dashed onto the main street, already under the scorching sun.

Speaking of which, I also feel deeply apologetic. Since the "Awakening Society" of the Republican Daily was initiated and organized by Mr. Xu Weinan last year, I can say that I have not contributed my due effort, nor have I sent them a piece of writing that they were expecting. But thanks to the care of the host for the fellow members, I was very happy to receive an invitation recently in the midst of his busy schedule.

Holding it, with a hesitant and apprehensive heart, I followed the address. Since Tanggu Road is not very long, it was easy to find the "Literary Retreat" on Xiangguan Road Lane.

Most of the people present were young, including Right, Mao Ling, and Miss Zhu Qianping, who were all young writers who often contributed to the Republican Daily.

Mr. Xu Weinan spoke at the meeting about his expectations for the "Awakening Society" in the future, with many words of encouragement. After the meeting, there were also some entertainment items.

Young people all want to have an interesting life, and I hope that this kind of organization can always emit its brilliance and warmth, so that a group of young people who love literature and art can always have the opportunity to meet and gather.

### Mr. Zhuzhuang Invites Me to View the Huangshan Masterpiece

— Song Daren

Huangshan has its own unique world, and writing it into a painting brings about various special effects. If you do not know the true face of it, even the beautiful clouds and pines will be blurred.

Jianhua has traveled all over the world, and the four paintings create a magnificent sight. The towering peaks are vertical and horizontal, and the clouds are changing and disappearing. How can a painted screen encompass the view of a hundred visits?

The peaks of the Literature Academy and Tiandu are wonderfully created by nature, and the pine peaks show their heroic posture. Like writing with a rubber pencil, it is like a fairyland, which is not allowed to be known by ordinary art history scholars.

I am searching for the strange and unrestrained advances, and I am seeking them in this painting first. For no reason, it seems that I hear the mountain spirit laughing, laughing at me for suspecting that I am pregnant with Suo Qiu.

### Viewing the Huangshan Masterpiece, Following the Poetic Intent of the Old Dan, with Ideas Not Fully Expressed, I Used the Original Sentence to Continue It

— Tao An

I have been to the foot of Huangshan, but I have not climbed the peak of Tiandu. Now, viewing Jianhua's spirit, I begin to believe that it enters into the art of creation. Thousands of peaks compete to show their beauty, and ten thousand peaks pierce the sky. Swords and halberds are arranged in a dense array, and strange rocks squat like tigers and bears. The rugged bird path leads upwards, and winding dragons hang on the crooked pines. The painter imitates nature, and Yu Zi is now called a hero. Both feet tread Mount Tai, and one hand climbs Mount Hua Song. He has traveled all over the famous mountains, and his waist is strong without needing a staff. He returns and competes to wield his brush, and his strokes are as if with the wind. Clouds and smoke change with him, and the mounds and ravines are born in his chest. The two hundred li of Huangshan are all collected in one painting. Cutting off the Yellow King's fetters, he strikes directly at the palace of Dong Yuan and Ju Ran. Ashamed of my inferior brush and ink, I try hard to catch up with his height. Viewing the painting, I sigh three times, and the war drums are rumbling.

I have not seen Jianhua for thirty years, and when we meet on the sea, his hair is mottled. His good son's talent is outstanding, and his brush has a bold and unrestrained artistic conception. I heard that he went alone to Tiantai Mountain. When will we go to the Dragon Cave together? In the Songjiang small abode, we drink wine from the same cup, and I already feel that the poetic spirit has arrived in Yuchuan.

### The Truth About "Flying Saucers"

— Haifeng

Since July 5th, it is said that a kind of fast-moving "flying saucer" has been spotted in the sky in various places. The shape and size of the "flying saucer" and the way it changes shape during flight are inconsistent. A Mrs. Ferson said that the "flying saucer" was like a circular washbasin, with five gaps, and was so large that after falling from the sky, it disappeared without a trace. A university student said that the "flying saucer" was shaped like a pie, with a blue glow. But a pilot said that it looked like a gray clam shell airplane, and the head had a mesh-like top, about fifteen feet in diameter and four feet thick.

And an artist who makes advertisements even called President Truman. He said that the "flying saucers" flying all over the sky are just one of the guided weapons, but because they temporarily lost control, they flew to various places.

Based on the above, it can be known that the various parts of the United States have been in an uproar over this mysterious "flying saucer."

What exactly is the "flying saucer?"

Let's take a look at what some scientists have to say to see what their correct opinions are on the scientific team of the so-called "flying saucer" like a "rocket":

(1) Admiral Brandi, who hosted the Bikini atomic bomb test, and others, do not believe in the existence of "flying saucers."

(2) Wright, the inventor of the airplane, said it more bluntly. He said, "This matter is just a kind of propaganda to support the State Department's current movement, 'to make us involved in another vortex of war, so that people are alarmed at each other, thinking that foreign countries are taking action against us.'"

(3) Another professor of physics at the University of Sydney, Dr. Gordon, used visual evidence to prove the unreliability of "flying saucers." Gordon ordered all students to stare intently at the horizon, and twenty-two students claimed to have seen "flying saucers." Dr. Gordon explained that this was an optical illusion.

(4) The authoritative scientist Einstein expressed even more indifference to this. He only said, "I have absolutely no opinion to express."

As of July 8, the military or scientific community had not made a definite conclusion on the widely rumored "flying saucers." At most, it could only be said to be a most ordinary "weather sounding instrument," as Brigadier General Lee May called it.

Why are Americans making such a "big fuss?" We believe that "flying saucer" should not be a scientific term. It is just that people are afraid of being threatened by war, so that in optical illusions, in a fragile psychological state, they see the phantom of this new weapon.

Or it is just like the "rockets" that were rumored to be discovered over Sweden last October, so some people said that they were controlled by the Soviet Union's Duro.

Now the whole world is very nervous. This illusionary "flying saucer" may be enough to show that humans are suffering from extremely serious neurasthenia.

### A Laughing Matter

— Ge Chunliang

There was a worker in a steel factory who once argued with many other workers. Those other workers not only defeated him in their arguments but also threw him into a small river. When the worker crawled out of the river, he was covered in sewage and mud. Just then, the factory director walked by and asked him what he planned to do about those other workers in the future. He replied, "Just laugh it off with everyone!"

Professor Fairbrother also wrote something like this, "When people hate you, there is no need to be angry and feel pain. You might as well think it's very interesting; because you yourself have honestly done your best, let people do what they want."

Lincoln, the former President of the United States, was indeed able to do this. Once, General John Palmer came to Lincoln indignantly and said, "If anyone had told me that in this critical time of survival, the people would actually choose an unknown, ordinary lawyer from an unknown, ordinary small town to be the President, I would never have believed it." At this moment, Lincoln, sitting in the barber's chair, pushed the barber away with a strong arm, turned the chair around, patted the general's knee and said, "Like you, I simply don't believe it either!" So, John Palmer could find no reason to be indignant.

The tension of the American Civil War, the North-South war, could have caused Lincoln to die from worry and stimulation. However, Lincoln often read jokes and humorous stories before going to bed, and often told his favorite jokes in conversation to harmonize the tense atmosphere in the White House. The famous Emancipation Proclamation, at the meeting on the day it was announced, Lincoln still began his speech with a joke.

Undoubtedly, if you are on the verge of bankruptcy, or if you are facing the terminal illness of stomach cancer, in such a miserable situation, it is simply impossible to laugh. Also, I am not saying that every time we are thrown into the river, we just laugh it off every time, but often, there are many times when we are the ones who bring it upon ourselves and deserve it, so we might as well do it ourselves and bear it ourselves.

Even more often, we are hated by others out of jealousy, or others deliberately slander us in words – and for things like this, we can only laugh it off!

New York's famous broadcaster, James Taylor, often receives thousands and thousands of letters praising him, but he also occasionally receives a few letters attacking him. Does he get angry because of this? No, he thinks those letters are very interesting, and he even reads the letters that scold him on the radio. He especially liked a letter

A woman sent him a letter scolding him as "a speaker, a traitor, a viper, and a stupid log." Mr. Taylor calmly said, "That lady may be joking and flirting with me." A few days later, Mr. Taylor publicly read that letter that scolded him to the point of being completely devastated in front of millions of listeners again – because he received another letter from that lady saying that her opinion was still unchanged at all. Mr. Taylor said:

"So, I am still a speaker, a traitor, a viper, and, alas, God knows! I am still a stupid log!" So, as we laughed along with Mr. Taylor, we admired his calmness, his wonderful handling, and his sense of humor.

Among all the presidents of the United States, very few have been subjected to such severe attacks as the late President Franklin Roosevelt, but during his many years in office, it can truly be said that he never scolded loudly or got angry. How do I know? Everyone who lived with him in the White House for a long time will tell you that this is true.

Roosevelt received many malicious letters attacking him – letters that were simply unreadable, letters that would make anyone burst into a rage after reading them. Often, those letters even had insulting words or cartoons painted on the envelopes. When President Roosevelt received those letters, he just laughed. He kept those envelopes, put them together, and gave them a title called "Bouquets and Brickbats" (the original meaning is fragrance and weapons). After President Roosevelt passed away, those envelopes, along with his famous stamp collection, were auctioned off. You may not believe it, but unexpectedly, those fifty-two envelopes filled with insults were auctioned off for a high price of five hundred and five yuan in cash. Ah, this is the truth!

Alas, the affairs of the world are like floating clouds, why should we bother ourselves with so many things? We might as well laugh it off!

### Three Old Masters of Storytelling with Drums

— Drummer

Northerners like to listen to storytelling. In addition to listening to operas, what can satisfy the enjoyment of the senses is the variety show ground. Among the variety shows, there are many types of magic tricks, etc. The most important is storytelling with a big drum. There are also many types of storytelling with a big drum. The three main ones are: Cuixian Octagonal Drum, Meihua Big Drum, and Jingyun Big Drum. As the saying goes, every profession produces its best. These three types of big drum storytelling have produced three masters, namely Rong Jianyun, Jin Wanchang, and Liu Baoquan. Let's talk about Jin Wanchang first.

Jin Wanchang sings Meihua Big Drum. In literary terms, most of the lyrics of Meihua Big Drum are about romantic feelings, such as Baoyu's illness, Daiyu burning the manuscript, and Wang Erjie thinking of her husband, which is similar to Liu Yong's lyrics that require young women of eighteen.

Some people say that Jin Wanchang has a good voice and sufficient capital, but in fact, his drum skills are superb. No matter what kind of tune, all kinds of stringed instruments, under his drumbeat command, suddenly sound like golden spears and iron horses, suddenly like melancholic weeping, suddenly like a storm, suddenly like a glimmer of hope in the dark. There is nothing that is not melodious and free, high and low as desired. We laymen listen and only feel that the changes are infinite, and experts unanimously praise it, saying that no one can match him. In addition, his voice is broad and bright, able to thoroughly depict the feelings of men and women, sending every word into people's eardrums and stirring every sentence in people's hearts. Isn't he considered the best of Meihua Big Drum?

Let's talk about Rong Jianyun. He sings Shanxian Octagonal Drum. This type of big drum is called Zidishu. It was originally composed by learned people in the Eight Banners for their friends to sing for fun. Especially various pen tunes, such as Wind and Rain Returning Boat, etc., some are about love, some are about grievances, and some satirize society. They are diverse and very similar to short note novels, with extremely beautiful language and deep meaning. Before singing the main song, they must use the pen tune to arouse interest, which is a bit like the introduction recited in a big opera and the opening poem, and also like the poems and lyrics at the beginning of the main text in a novel. The main song sings stories from Shuihu, Liaozhai, and other notes. Such as Song Jiang killing his wife, Yang Xiong getting drunk, Shui Mang Capture, She Xiaoxue, Zhuo Erniang persuading her husband, etc., are what he often sings and plays.

Rong Jianyun can really take the original text from the book, explain it in detail in clear Beijing dialect, and explain it very clearly. He can even explain the implied meaning of the original text, not letting go of a single word. Because he has deep knowledge, a broad mind, and researches it while tapping on the red ivory clappers and singing softly. The drum in his hand corresponds to the rhythm of the Shanxian. It is not pedantic or trivial. There is an unspeakable beauty. Even the most literate people cannot help but applaud and cheer after listening to it. Thinking about it, if they were to go on stage to play and sing, they would definitely not be able to reach this level, and they would definitely not be able to achieve such results. In the Tianjin area, there are also young girls who sing this type of big drum, claiming to be passed down by someone, but they are clueless and only know how to be silly, which is not suitable for refined tastes. Those who appreciate her, unless their intention is not in the wine. Even He Zhichen, who often sings Tianjin drums, is also a famous Shanxian performer, but his knowledge and research are not as good as Jianyun, so he inevitably has a bit of vulgarity. Among them, Xie Ruizhi can be said to be both humorous in his singing and speaking, which is the trendy literary humor that is most popular in Tianjin. If Jianyun's big drum is compared to writing Huang Ting initially, which is just right, it cannot be said to be on par. There is a saying in the south, "A master is born every three years, but a great face is not born in thirty years." I say that Jianyun is the top scholar of the Octagonal Drum. It cannot be said to be an overstatement, right? (To be continued)

·Pigs are Fat, People are Thin·

The warden of the Jian'ou detention center in Fujian also runs a livestock business, owning seven white goats and thirteen pigs at home. Because the livestock have a huge appetite and the current grain prices are expensive, he simply detains the prisoners in the detention center and takes their food back to feed the pigs. The prisoners in the prison are miserable, but the warden's pigs are getting fatter and fatter.

·Waste Utilization·

The Suzhou Silk Weaving Volunteer Police Force

Regulations: Monks, nuns, and Taoists who are selected as qualified will all be appointed as volunteer police.

·Exquisite Article· A close aide to a female staff member issued an order, the original text of which reads: "General Decree No. 32. (The original text was not simplified.) Men and women are different, and their physiology is different. Women are endowed with menstruation, which has a regular order. The tide moistens the embankment and requires implements. Hygiene requires cotton wool. It has been found that female staff members of various bureaus and departments of this prefecture often use manuscript paper instead of cotton during menstruation. This is unhygienic and wasteful. Public affairs are limited and cannot bear this significant consumption. Therefore, a corresponding notice is hereby issued, hoping that the female colleagues under your jurisdiction will be informed to stop it immediately for the sake of public interest!"

### Returning Home Like a Spring Dream

— Li Zhen

A Faded "Spring Dream"

A village girl, because of her vanity, abandons her lover and marries a rich young master, but later she deeply regrets it. But youth is no more, and she finally dies in resentment – such a theme, strictly speaking, belongs to those "Saturday School" works. At the same time, in this script, you simply cannot smell a hint of the atmosphere of the times, only old, faded stories.

The screenwriter and director Zhu Shilin, from "Those Suffering from the Same Illness do not Sympathize with Each Other," "Each Has Its Own Merits," to this time's "Spring Dream," still has not jumped over his old ideas. He wants everyone to be at peace with reality, even if it is wrong, they should endure, endure, and endure a third time. – As a weapon (film) of the education of an era, we cannot but point this out.

Hu Die's performance as an eighteen-year-old girl looks extremely uncomfortable. Her performance in middle age is still steady, but here, Hu Die gives the impression of being old after all. Chen Juanjuan's Xiaofeng is still good, while Bai Chen is too exaggerated. Shu Shi's Ding Qichang has rich acting skills.

Satirical "Homecoming Diary"

Victory has been won, and many people have beautiful illusions about returning home, but how many people have had their beautiful dreams of returning home shattered in the face of reality? The experiences of a young couple in the play after returning to Shanghai after demobilization precisely illustrate that ugly side. The screenwriter and director Yuan Jun has captured a realistic theme to elaborate on, which is also worth introducing. However, in the writing of the script, the insertion of many characters and the development of the story seem stiff. And the play also obviously shows traces of being cut and deleted, so it feels discontinuous to watch.

The director's handling of the play failed to grasp the main theme. In the tense and chaotic scenes, there was a lack of appropriate rhythm, and the use of the camera also lacked flexibility and innovation. Perhaps the director still lacks skilled experience in film technology.

Among the actors, Bai Yang is the best, followed by Lü En, Geng Yun is a bit stiff, and Yang Hua is very fiery.

Technically, photography, recording, and set design are all below par.

Lighthearted Comedy "Stranger Couple"

The theme of "Stranger Couple" is enough to make people feel relaxed and interesting. The development of the story in the film is also arranged quite reasonably. It is probably a morale-boosting film made during the war. The director's handling of the play has no originality, and the results are only mediocre.

Human-like "National Velvet"

This is a good film that is worth introducing. Whether it is the screenwriter, director, actors, or photographer, none of them are below standard. In particular, the story is full of humanity, making you develop infinite love for it.

Speaking of it, the story is extremely simple, depicting trivial matters in a family, but it makes you feel intimate and delicate. The director is Clarence Brown, the director of "The Human Comedy." He brings you excellent results just like "The Human Comedy."

Although Mickey Rooney has an excellent performance in this film, we want to recommend the young star Elizabeth Taylor, who plays Velvet. Her vivid, delicate, and natural acting skills, superb and pure emotions, make you feel her cuteness. In addition, Jackie Jenkins is also a lovely little fellow.

Biographical Film "Magnificent Doll"

"Magnificent Doll" depicts a period of love history between the US Secretary of State Jefferson and his political enemy Aaron around the election of US President Jefferson at the end of the eighteenth century, reflecting the American people's choice between freedom and dictatorship. Although this is "American" freedom, the author's sense of justice is still commendable.

Ginger Rogers has an extremely excellent performance. Although not much attention should be paid to her alone, David Niven's Aaron is too frivolous and lacks the demeanor of a statesman.

The great director Frank Borzage only completed a simple task in this film.
