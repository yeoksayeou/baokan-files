### The Plenary Session Opens Today with Three Major Meetings to Review Politics, Military Affairs, Diplomacy, and Economy; General Chen Reports on Military Affairs at the Second Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The joint Central Memorial Week and Third Plenary Session Memorial Week were held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:15 AM this morning. President Chiang presided over the ceremony and, after leading the attendees in paying their respects, delivered an impromptu speech. He first recounted the arduous struggle of the Party over the past fifty years. He then stated that after the Party ends political tutelage and returns governance to the people, it must still shoulder the important responsibility of national construction. Therefore, he hoped that all comrades would promote Party virtue, establish mutual trust, affection, and sincerity, unite as one, and vigorously practice the Party's ideology to complete the revolution. The ceremony concluded at 9:45 AM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Third Plenary Session is scheduled to hold its third general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th. At that time, Chairman Yu Youren will present a review of diplomacy, military affairs, politics, and the economy. The second general meeting was held at 10:15 AM on the 17th, chaired by Ju Zheng. Two hundred and sixty-two committee members were present. After the minutes of the previous meeting were read, General Chen Cheng delivered a military report, detailing the army reorganization and demobilization over the past year, as well as the communist military disturbances in various regions. He concluded his report at 11:30 AM, and the meeting adjourned.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] General Chen Cheng reported at the plenary session on the 17th that in the past year, under the situation of the National Army being "passively beaten," more than 130,000 communist soldiers had surrendered, and over 70,000 had been captured. This proves that the communist army has lost its self-confidence. Regarding the capture of Hao Mengling and Li Xianzhou, he said that Hao lost contact, and Li's capture was due to a failure in command. This was our negligence, not the strength of the communist army's forces. At the same time, Chen declared that the National Army's discipline was strict. In the past year, more than 50 people were sentenced to death for violating military discipline, and over 200 officers were disciplined.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] General Chen Cheng reported on military affairs at the second general meeting of the plenary session on the 17th. He first explained that the Ministry of National Defense's administrative guidelines for the 35th and 36th years of the Republic (1946 and 1947) were based on the government's policy of peaceful unification: (1) accelerate demobilization work, (2) implement the army reorganization plan, (3) build up the army. The demobilization work was divided into four aspects: First, disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese; second, deal with various puppet armies; third, reward the soldiers who fought in the war of resistance and provide compensation for the officers and soldiers who died in battle; fourth, pacification work. Regarding army reorganization, it was implemented in phases according to the army reorganization plan. Since the Second Plenary Session last year, efforts have been unremitting. Fifty-seven armies have now been reorganized into fifty-seven divisions, with twenty-seven armies yet to be reorganized. Regarding army building, the quality should be improved, and the number of standing armies should be determined according to national defense needs. After the Military Affairs Commission was reorganized into the Ministry of National Defense, it has been improving its operations at any time in the past six months and paying special attention to military education, the training of the army, navy, and air force, the improvement of military supplies, the establishment of a conscription system, and the construction of barracks and fortresses, which are either underway or planned. In addition, there are two things: (1) Improvement of the lives of officers and soldiers, (2) More than 210,000 demobilized officers and soldiers have been settled, and more than 80,000 have been employed or transferred to other jobs, with more than 130,000 remaining. If it were not for the communist party's destruction of peace, affecting demobilization, all could have been completed according to the planned schedule. General Chen then explained the general situation of the communist army and the communist army's attack on the national army. General Chen finally reported that since the communist army's all-out rebellion and the national army's counter-offensive, the recovered areas, except for major cities, are approximately 200 counties. Over the past year, more than 130,000 communist soldiers have surrendered, and over 70,000 have been captured.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] From 3:00 PM on the 17th, the various groups of the Third Plenary Session separately reviewed the proposals.

### "Economic Reform Plan" Enthusiastically Discussed in the Plenary Session Review Committee; Decision Not to List Tax Increase as a Separate Case

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The discussion of the "Economic Reform Plan" in the Economic Review Committee was very enthusiastic. Chairman Chen Lifu formed a separate subgroup to discuss the financial tax system portion and appointed Wei Daoming and Zhao Dihua as conveners of the subgroup. Moreover, the tax increase case in the proposal of the Central Standing Committee, after discussion in the Economic Review Committee, was deemed unnecessary to be listed as a separate case. It was heard that committee members Zhang Mojun and Wang Zhengting spoke several times, believing that it was not necessary to increase taxes to increase the burden on the people. The committee then decided to incorporate the case into the Economic case.

### Measures for Production Loans to be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Discussion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] There are widespread rumors that the government will abolish production loans. Therefore, some private factories have made requests to the government, asking to continue the program in order to subsidize production. It is learned that the government attaches great importance to this and not only has no intention of abolishing it, but is also seeking appropriate and reasonable methods to handle it. Among the economic proposals for the plenary session, it is heard that there are also proposed measures for production loans, which will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. The draft is excerpted as follows: (1) National banks and bureaus shall handle loans to assist in the increased production of agricultural products, necessities of life, and export goods in accordance with the Economic Emergency Measures Plan regarding strengthening the financial business system. (2) After the material supply agencies and cooperative manufacturers conclude a supply contract, the national banks and bureaus may first lend up to 70% of the total order amount to the cooperative manufacturer, and the balance will be paid by the supply agency upon delivery of the goods. (3) If the cooperative manufacturer applying for a loan has not negotiated a pre-sale contract for finished products with the material supply agency, the national bank and bureau shall first notify the material supply agency to negotiate the contract. The supply contracts shall be printed with the words "supply products" and sold by merchants at 90% of the list price. For those that cannot be printed with words, the supply agency shall sell them on the market at any time to stabilize market prices. (4) Material supply agencies shall not pay deposits when ordering from such cooperative manufacturers, and the settlement methods with the national banks and bureaus shall be determined by both parties. (5) National banks and bureaus may first lend 70% of the legal currency amount converted from the foreign exchange certificate for forward exports purchased by the central bank or designated bank to the cooperative manufacturer, and the balance will be paid by the original purchasing bank or deposit bank upon delivery of the products. (6) If the exporter applying for a loan has not completed the sale of forward foreign exchange to the bank (or designated bank), the national bank and bureau shall notify the central bank to negotiate the purchase of its forward foreign exchange and then grant the loan according to the sixth regulation. (7) The settlement methods between the central bank and the lending banks and bureaus shall be determined by both parties. (8) All of the above loans shall be opened in current deposit accounts in the respective national banks and bureaus, and the cooperative manufacturers may withdraw them at any time with a headed check. (9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Financial Policy Innovation Requires Further Restructuring of Institutions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The "Economic Reform Plan," an economic proposal for the Plenary Session, was drafted by Chen Lifu of the Central Economic Policy Research Committee. Its content believes that financial institutions must be fundamentally reorganized, and financial policies must be comprehensively innovated. The key points of the innovation are to promote the capitalization and production of assets. The key points of the fundamental policies are as follows: (1) The loan interest rate of national banks can be temporarily set at a relatively high statutory amount for deposit and loan interest rates in order to absorb idle funds for production. (2) National banks should provide low-interest loans to legitimate entrepreneurs and adopt an order-based loan method. (3) The financial system should adjust its structure. The financial system depends on the economic system, and the economic system is the material foundation of the political system. The three are interconnected. (4) Establish county banks to absorb deposits. (5) Financing for transportation, industrial, and mining enterprises, as well as domestic industrial remittances and discounts, shall be exclusively operated by the Bank of Communications, and the National Bank shall be responsible for foreign trade.

### The Political Group Will Propose a Concrete Reform Plan

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] Only Xinglong Town north of Nong'an still has contact, which may be the communist army's covering force for the retreating troops.

### Party Affairs During the Constitutional Era: County-level Party Headquarters Should Be the Focus of Organization, and Democratic Practices Should Be Implemented in Work

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The plenary session has a detailed plan for the review and reform of party affairs, in the form of a proposal titled "Party Affairs Guidelines for the Current Stage," divided into (1) Review of the Past, (2) Current Tasks, (3) Paths to Reform, (4) Work of Reform, etc. The main points are as follows: First, it states that to implement doctrine, it is necessary to study and promote it, so a thought movement should be launched to innovate and lead thought. It is resolved that to implement doctrine, there must be a strong organization, rigorous implementation of the election system, talent management, work competition, and assessment regulations to eliminate opportunists, wavering elements, corrupt elements, and deteriorating elements at any time, in order to ensure the purity of party membership. Regarding the composition of the party organization, it is believed that it should be based on agriculture and industry. The party's working methods, whether in organization, training, propaganda, or mass movements, must eliminate bureaucratic practices, promote revolutionary style, and rigorously implement democratic style. Finally, regarding the party's structure, it is said that it has always suffered from the defect of being top-heavy and bottom-light, like an inverted pyramid, resulting in an unreasonable distribution of manpower and financial resources. During the constitutional era, local autonomy should follow Sun Yat-sen's teaching that "local autonomous bodies are not only political organizations but also economic organizations." Local autonomy should be based on the county as a unit, so the party should focus on the county-level party headquarters for organizational purposes, thoroughly reforming it so that it can shoulder the tasks of the new era. Also, in the review meeting on the 17th, the relationship between the party and the youth league was discussed.

### Marshall Replies to Soviet Foreign Minister: The US, UK, and Soviet Union Can Exchange Information on the Part of the Moscow Declaration Concerning China

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 16th, United Press] US Secretary of State Marshall, in a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, refused the Soviet proposal that the three countries consult on the China issue. (The above news was reported in yesterday's newspaper.) He also proposed that the US, UK, and Soviet Union exchange information on China in writing before April 1, and send copies to China. Secretary Marshall refused any discussion, whether China participated or not.

[United Press, Moscow, 16th] The US delegation released the full text of Marshall's reply to Molotov: "Dear Mr. Molotov, I acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 11 regarding the implementation of the part of the Moscow Agreement of December 1945 concerning China. Since this issue was raised by you at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, I am honored to exchange information with you and Mr. Bevin on the implementation of the provisions of the Moscow Declaration concerning China during my stay in Moscow, but not at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. As for holding any meeting, whether formal or informal, I am not willing. I hereby propose that we provide each other with written reports before April 1, and each provide a copy to the Chinese government. It is my sincere hope that your Excellency will accept this suggestion." Note: The communique issued after the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers in 1945 stated in a section on China: "The three foreign ministers agreed on the need for a unified and democratic China, governed by the National Government, with broad participation of democratic elements in all government departments, and the cessation of civil war." The three foreign ministers reiterated their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and the US and Soviet Union agreed to "withdraw their troops as soon as possible when appropriate to fulfill their obligations."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 17th] Regarding the China issue, Marshall wrote to Molotov yesterday, advocating that the exchange of information on the implementation of the Moscow Declaration of 1945 be done in writing. He even opposed discussing the China issue outside the meeting, insisting that the exchange of information be strictly limited to mutual obligations, namely the withdrawal of their troops from China. Marshall believes that discussing China's internal problems at the Moscow Conference is not appropriate.

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] British Foreign Minister Bevin is expected to express his attitude toward discussing the China issue to the Soviet government today. Observers here believe that Bevin's attitude will be the same as that of US Secretary of State Marshall.

Editorial

### Reaffirmation of an Open Foreign Policy

Amidst the turbulent international situation of today, especially with the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference convened in Moscow, and at a time when the tension of the Soviet Foreign Minister's proposal to discuss the situation in China is gradually subsiding but the lingering haze has not yet cleared, we welcome the report made by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session. At this time, the people of the whole country hope that our diplomatic authorities can clarify the current international situation and our foreign policy. Now, the report made by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session can at least partially console the hope of the people of the whole country. According to reports, this report can be divided into two parts: one is the written report submitted by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session, and the other is the oral report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session on the 16th. According to news agency reports, the oral report is only a supplement to the written report submitted by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session. Since this written report has not been published, we have no way of knowing its content; and the oral report of Foreign Minister Wang published in the newspapers, with only fragmentary information, may not be the full truth. But based on news reports, we can already glimpse a clear outline of our foreign policy. From the oral diplomatic report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session, as transmitted by news agencies and published in newspapers, it is not difficult for us to understand the diplomatic policy currently held by the government.

This oral diplomatic report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session is straightforward and frank, fully demonstrating our national spirit of believing in love and peace. According to news reports, the foreign policy of our country as clarified by Foreign Minister Wang can be summarized as follows: "That is, to uphold and support the United Nations organization, maintain traditional friendship with the United States, strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty with the Soviet Union, and not take revenge on Japan, but seek full guarantees in the military field to prevent it from invading again." In these few words, the main parts of our country's foreign policy have been explained without omission: our way of establishing the country based on trustworthiness, love, justice, and peace can be seen here. From the perspective of world peace, a strong international organization is necessary. The weakness and powerlessness of international organizations is a major factor leading to this world war. Now that the long period of bloodshed and war has ended, we do not want to see the recurrence of war, and we must do everything possible to support the development of the United Nations, this international organization; only when this organization has power and ability can mankind be spared the misfortune of another war. The oral diplomatic report of Foreign Minister Wang mentioned first and foremost the upholding and supporting of the United Nations organization, which shows the correctness of the path we have taken for the reconstruction of lasting world peace. We should not forget that after the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations was weak and powerless in handling the Northeast incident in our country, which eventually led to the Lugouqiao Incident and triggered the full-scale war of resistance in our country, leading to the outbreak of the Second World War. Having been taught by this painful experience, we have a personal feeling for upholding and supporting the development of a strong and powerful United Nations organization. Therefore, we feel that the restrictions on the use of the veto power, as mentioned by Foreign Minister Wang, and the establishment of the armed forces for the security of the United Nations organization for the maintenance of world peace, are indeed necessary.

Speaking of Sino-American relations, China and the United States face each other across the Pacific Ocean, and their national ideals are somewhat similar: there is a traditional friendship between China and the United States. This traditional friendship has been further solidified by the baptism of blood due to the outbreak of the Pacific War. The depth of mutual concern and affection between the people of China and the United States goes without saying. We regret that in recent times, a small number of people, with ulterior motives, have launched a so-called anti-American movement in China. This movement has other effects and cannot be said to be a spontaneous movement of the Chinese people, and even more cannot be used to represent the general intentions of the Chinese people. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles to explain this. Now that our Foreign Minister has clarified our policy on Sino-American relations, summarizing it into the eight characters "maintain traditional friendship with the United States," we, standing in the position of the people, are even more willing to add: we not only want to "maintain traditional friendship with the United States," but also hope to "increase" it, so that the traditional friendship between China and the United States can become more and more solid.

As for our relations with the Soviet Union, China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and the length of their border is unmatched in the world. We cherish the friendship of the Soviet Union; therefore, we did not hesitate to give up part of our sovereignty and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Since this treaty has been signed, we have the obligation to abide by it in good faith, and the other party also has the obligation to faithfully fulfill it. Foreign Minister Wang's "strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty with the Soviet Union" is a manifestation of our commitment to international integrity and is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. The Chinese people judge the domestic Communist Party issue and the foreign relations with the Soviet Union as two separate matters. The Chinese Communist Party issue is a domestic issue, and the attitude towards handling this issue does not involve the attitude towards Sino-Soviet relations. The Chinese people admire the Soviet Union's efforts to build the country and its heroic fight against Hitler. We cherish the friendship of our great neighbor, and we hope that the relationship between the two countries, based on the new relationship of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, can grow and develop even more in the future.

The non-retaliatory policy towards Japan is another noble expression of our national spirit based on benevolence. This policy has received unanimous support from the people of the whole country. There is something that we must mention here, which is the attitude towards other ethnic groups in Asia; this may not have been mentioned in Foreign Minister Wang's report, but we feel that this is the most important part of our foreign policy. China and India, Siam and other countries have exchanged ambassadors, and have established diplomatic relations and sent envoys to the Philippines, Persia, Afghanistan and other countries: in addition, other ethnic groups in Asia have also been moving in the direction of independence and autonomy; among them, the independence of Burma will soon be seen in fact. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify our policy towards the ethnic groups in Asia. Korea is separated from our country by the Yalu River, and we are naturally particularly concerned about its welfare; how to eliminate the artificial division of Korea, and see reunification again, we and Korea are as close as brothers, how can we not make efforts? Furthermore, India has convened the so-called Pan-Asian Conference, although this is a civil gathering, it seems to be somewhat of a "diplomatic offensive." As an Asian country and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, we should have the significance of representing and leading the ethnic groups in Asia. We hope that the diplomatic authorities can continue to clarify this point, which will be enough to refresh the world.

### MacArthur Advocates Supporting Japan, Emphasizes that a Peace Treaty with Japan Should Be Concluded as Soon as Possible to Expedite the End of the Military Occupation

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur made an important statement to the press corps today, saying: After the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan should not continue to be controlled by force, and the headquarters should be abolished immediately. Judging from the current world situation, the day to begin discussing the peace treaty is ripe. After the treaty is issued, the conditions stipulated in the treaty should be supervised by the United Nations. The reason for the existence of the United Nations lies in this. If the United Nations cannot lead Japan in the post-war world, its organization is meaningless. The United Nations is currently facing important economic problems. Japan's production must be increased to the extent that it can maintain the minimum living standards of the Japanese people. Japan must be rebuilt as a commercial country engaged in import and export trade. Japan's national borders delimited after the war are not enough to meet the food needs of the Republic of China. Japan's arable land has the highest unit area productivity in the world, but it is not enough to support the tens of millions of people in the narrow territory after the war. Therefore, we must allow Japan to engage in foreign trade, and this trade must be carried out by the private sector, and the government's control should be suppressed to the minimum. Some people think that Japan should be economically isolated for fifty years. This kind of opinion is not correct. Regarding the issue of compensation, Japan has lost Manchuria, Korea, and Taiwan, and has paid a huge price. Japan has invested billions of dollars in these places and imported the necessary food from these places. Regarding the reconciliation with Japan, it is unfortunate that the opinions among the United Nations have not yet been unified. Japan has abolished its army and abandoned war, which is commendable. Japan's current economic situation has been extremely exhausted due to the war. If economic blockade is continued, it will increase the burden on the United States, because the United States is the only country that can supply the necessary food to Japan. In order to rebuild export trade, Japan's textile industry must be expanded immediately, and cotton must be imported from the United States, and wool sweaters must be imported from Australia. Japan's compensation and trade control must have some flexibility, because the purpose of compensation is to destroy Japan's war capability, not to destroy Japan's ability to survive.

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur advocated the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and said: After the establishment of the treaty, the Allied countries should no longer have troops stationed in Japan, otherwise the treaty will be useless. Asked whether the United States will lend loans to Japan, MacArthur replied that Japan not only has the ability to pay loans, but is also eager to pay debts. As far as its military and political situation is concerned, the work of removing military equipment has now been completed in both material and spiritual aspects, and its combat potential has been completely destroyed, and it has also learned the lesson that combat is not worth the loss. This can indeed be called the greatest revolutionary spirit in the world. At the same time, Japan's old myths and feudal traditions have also disappeared, tending towards individual freedom. I am not saying that democratic politics has been completed. Democratic politics must seek its gradual development before it can be realized.

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur said: Japan should start paying for the credit loans borrowed from the United States immediately after the establishment of the treaty. Subsequent loans to Japan should be lent to private companies in a private capacity in order to revive Japan's private economic system.

### Foreign Ministers Conference Enters Second Week, Economy is the Focus of Discussion, US Plans for German Provisional Government

[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference continues to be in a stalemate, discussing the procedure for the peace treaty with Germany and the military issues in the German-Austrian peace treaty. The two sub-group meetings are chaired by the United States' Murphy and Clarke. The Foreign Ministers Conference is also scheduled to meet at 4 pm, at which time Marshall will present his plan for the economic unification of Germany and the establishment of a provisional German government.

[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The US delegation has completed a detailed plan for the establishment of a provisional German government based on the economic unification plan, and submitted it to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today. The plan states that the United States does not believe that German economic unification can achieve a consistent and fully self-sufficient basis without the emergence of a German central government. From the point of view of US Secretary of State Marshall, the provisional German government he envisioned is based on the local governments of the German states.

[Our newspaper news] London 17th broadcast: There are many military figures in the US delegation to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, and Truman's speech calling for aid to Greece and Turkey made the Soviet authorities feel the strong posture of the United States.

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] If there is no sudden change in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the four Foreign Ministers will begin to discuss the report of the Allied Control Council on economic principles at the beginning of the second week of the conference. It is generally believed that this part of the report is one of the most important and complex chapters, with a total of eleven items, namely: (1) Industrial standards; (2) Clearing of war industry power; (3) Food rationing; (4) Agriculture; (5) Dissolution of trusts; (6) Imports and exports; (7) Domestic trade; (8) Economic unification; (9) Transportation; (10) Financial bank and financial reform; (11) Transfer of German and Allied property. The key to the overall situation is of course the economic unification issue in item 8. If the four powers can reach an agreement on this point, the consistency of the four powers' actions in Germany can be simplified a lot. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has clearly pointed out that the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on the German part depends on whether economic unification can be achieved. Without economic unification, political unification is just a fantasy. Although the four powers currently support the principle of economic unification, their policies are different and difficult to match each other. It is expected that the prerequisite that the United Kingdom will propose is to allow the unrestricted free exchange of materials in various regions, otherwise economic unification will never be able to fulfill its purpose.

### Facing Difficulties, the Key to Success or Failure

[United Press, Moscow, 16th] The delegations of various countries expect that next week will be the most urgent class of the meeting. Economic unification and compensation issues are considered to be the difficulties of the German issue. The above two issues are related to every other part of the German situation. If these issues can reach an agreement, then other issues are secondary and easy to solve. Otherwise, other issues cannot be resolved. According to a major representative, it is unlikely that an agreement will be reached next week on the German compensation and economic unification issues, but at the end of the economic negotiations, it will be possible to discover whether there is an opportunity for a compromise in this meeting. Whether or not people can spend another week or more to reach common principles. At the end of this week, if it falls into a stalemate, then as far as the German issue is concerned, we can give up women, at least at this meeting.

### Molotov to Host Banquet for British, American, and French Foreign Ministers Tonight

### Soviet Union Opposes Turkey's Participation in Peace Treaty Negotiations

[Our newspaper news] Moscow 17th broadcast: At today's Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union responded for the first time to President Truman's call for aid to Greece and Turkey. First, the US representative suggested allowing Turkey, Mexico, the Philippines, and Iran to participate in the advisory committee on the German peace treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky immediately and vehemently opposed it, saying that Turkey had always adopted a fence-sitting policy in this war, and only declared war on Germany on March 1, 1944. Vyshinsky also cited Wallace's speech, saying that Turkey had benefited from this war.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 17th] British representative Strulang today proposed to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to allow all Allied countries to participate in the four standing committees on the German issue. This committee can include 22 members. The proposal to establish a committee was first proposed by France, with the purpose of discussing (1) Germany's political institutions; (2) territorial issues; (3) economic issues; (4) disarmament issues. Soviet representative Vyshinsky opposed the British proposal, believing that the four powers should bear the responsibility for the peace treaty.

### US Ambassadors to Greece and Turkey Ordered to Return Home for Duty, Aid Bill to Greece and Turkey Formally Submitted to the House of Representatives

[United Press, Washington, 17th] People here expect that US Ambassador to Turkey Harriman and US Economic Mission to Greece leader Porter have now returned home for duty. After arriving in Washington, they will first hold talks with President Truman, and then attend the House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting to discuss the aid bill to Greece and Turkey. The date for the House to debate it will be after the committee submits it, and will depend on its opinions before scheduling a meeting.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] State Department legal experts and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have completed the legislative articles for implementing President Truman's new Middle East policy of aid to Greece and Turkey. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton will submit the case for discussion on the 17th. Committee member Mundt will propose an amendment to limit the dispatch of military personnel for any reason other than military training and advisory groups in Greece and Turkey.

[Our newspaper news] San Francisco 17th broadcast: According to sources from the US Army Department, the US military government authorities in the US-occupied area of ​​Germany will cooperate in building Greece to cooperate with the US aid to Greece plan. Army officers with experience in building railways, highways, and power plants will take on this project, and experts from various departments of the US government will also be employed. It is said that the 88th Division currently stationed in Italy may send a military delegation to Greece to train Greeks to use American weapons. A large number of American military materials left over from the war are still stored in Italy. Before Congress has approved Truman's request for aid to Greece, the Army Department continues to remain silent on the strength and number of US troops preparing to be sent to Greece.

British Cabinet Reviewed Truman's Speech Yesterday

[United Press, London, 16th] The British Cabinet will convene a meeting tomorrow to discuss Truman's speech on aid to Greece and Turkey, and its impact on Britain's future foreign policy, but it will not reach a consensus decision immediately, but only review the reactions caused by this speech. The British Cabinet may wait for Foreign Secretary Bevin to submit the report of the first week of the Foreign Ministers Conference and the Soviet response before it can decide what to do.

[Our newspaper news] London 17th broadcast: At the House of Commons meeting today, Labor Party left-wing members fiercely criticized President Truman's policy of aid to Greece and Turkey, saying that Truman's move not only invaded Southeastern Europe, but also violated the power of the United Nations.

### Moscow Radio Criticizes Truman

[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Moscow Radio's English commentator "Analyst" said: Truman's declaration of aid to Greece and Turkey. It is an expression of hostility towards the countries of Southeastern Europe. Greece and Turkey are now ruled by reactionary governments, and they are abusing oppression against those who resisted Germany. Truman wants to supply these two governments with American gold yuan so that they can add weapons to suppress the country and prepare to invade foreign countries. Judging from the fact that Czechoslovakia's request for reconstruction loans was rejected by the United States, Truman's intentions are self-evident.

### Report that the US Intends to Lend a Huge Sum to the Soviet Union to Urge it to Change its Expansionist Policy, Otherwise the US Will Expand Aid to Eastern Europe

[United Press, London, 16th] According to Washington sources, local newspapers report that the United States may grant a substantial loan to the Soviet Union if it changes its policy of expanding its influence. If the Kremlin rejects this, the United States will expand its aid policy to various Eastern European countries, especially Hungary, to prevent the Soviet Union from extending its power. It is also reported that the United States will send a fleet to the Mediterranean to demonstrate American strength. According to British newspaper diplomatic correspondents, British Foreign Secretary Marshall may seek to hold talks with Stalin himself or Molotov on this matter. It is reported that Marshall supports the conclusion of a treaty of alliance between Turkey, Greece, and Italy, and this is at the request of the United States to provide financial assistance, and if necessary, to arm the three countries to resist aggression. It is also learned that the United States is considering lending six hundred million dollars to Korea.

### Mrs. Roosevelt Discusses People's Livelihood

Mrs. Roosevelt believes that as long as the American people live and work in peace and contentment, communism cannot undermine American democracy, because communism arises from disaster and poverty.

### Welles Accuses Soviet Expansionist Policy

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles, a fervent supporter of the United Nations, declared in his weekly broadcast today: "The United Nations is not yet prepared to prevent Soviet imperialism from developing in the Middle East. The inevitable path to destroying the United Nations and causing war between the United States and the Soviet Union is for the United States to delay and mislead itself, allowing the Soviet Union to rapidly expand its control over Western Europe, the Mediterranean, and Central Europe." Welles also said that if this issue is submitted to the United Nations for resolution, even after some time of negotiation in the Security Council, there is likely to be no opportunity for agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### Alaska Under Soviet Attention

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Gearhart told reporters today that the Soviet Union is paying close attention to Alaska. The Soviet Union now hopes that the purchase of Alaska from the Tsarist government in 1867 was illegal, and the State Department should explain whether the Soviet Union intends to seek to recover this wealthy "strategic area." He will raise this issue in the House of Representatives tomorrow, as it is closely related to President Truman's plan to use money, materials, and manpower to assist Greece and Turkey in preventing the expansion of communism.

### US Communist Party Files Complaint

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] It has been learned that after the constitutional rights of the American Communist Party were restricted and Congress planned to outlaw the Communist Party, the party has sent a telegram to Secretary of State Marshall, who is currently in Moscow, expressing its protest, saying that this action is inconsistent with the democratic principles recently expressed by Marshall in Moscow.

### Soviet Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs, Marshall Plans to Issue Another Note, the US is Determined to Support the Current Hungarian Government

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th broadcast: Marshall is preparing to issue another note to the Soviet Union, accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. It is reported that the content of the second note is divided into three points: first, providing evidence for the accusation in the first note that the Soviet Union illegally interfered in Hungary's internal affairs; second, warning the Soviet Union not to take retaliatory action against the leaders of the Smallholders Party on the grounds that they allegedly plotted against the Soviet occupying forces; and third, explaining that the statements of some Smallholders Party members were inspired by pressure from Soviet officials or Hungarian Communists. Diplomatic sources say that this American note shows that the United States is determined to support the current Hungarian government, but because the Soviet Union has rejected the first American note, it is believed that this note will be in vain.

### Security Council Discusses Three Important Cases, Soviet Attitude is Extremely Notable, the US Opposes Any Amendments to the Trusteeship Plan

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 16th] After the decision of the United States to step into the Balkans, attention is now focused on Soviet representative Gromyko, in order to glimpse the policy adopted by the Soviet Union within the United Nations organization. In the next few days, Gromyko has three major opportunities to speak, which are sufficient to show the Soviet Union's new position. On the 17th, the Security Council will continue to debate the issue of trusteeship of the Pacific Islands. On the 19th, the Atomic Energy Commission will re-discuss the international control report, with Gromyko as chairman. In addition, the Security Council may meet on the 18th to discuss the report on the British accusation of Albania laying mines. Observers believe that although the above-mentioned points are outside the scope of the Balkan issue, the Soviet Union will not hesitate to elaborate on its policy in these troubled times. For example, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was convened to discuss the German issue, but in the first meeting, the Soviet Union raised the Chinese issue. Judging from the attitude of the Moscow government's newspapers, it is still difficult to predict whether Gromyko will condemn the United States for providing assistance to Greece and Turkey without going through the United Nations organization. The 17th Security Council is the first meeting since President Truman's speech.

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] US official spokesmen said that the US will reject the three amendments of Britain and Australia when the Security Council resumes debate on the US's individual trusteeship plan for the former Japanese islands in the Pacific on the 17th. The United States is also prepared to resist the final amendments proposed by New Zealand, India, the Philippines, or the Netherlands. These four countries may obtain temporary seats in the Security Council on the 17th to review the trusteeship agreement. US representative Austin claimed that the final approval of this plan has been delayed due to the impatience of Britain and its dominions and their demand for an "open door" policy. Austin said he hoped the plan could be approved before the end of this weekend.

### If War Breaks Out, Britain Will Move its Capital to South Africa

[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] The "Chicago Tribune" said that officials from the State Department and the military told some senators that the British government is drafting a plan to move its capital to South Africa in the event of the next war, and to move British heavy industry there as well. The development of rocket bombs after the war has made their power more than ten times greater than the bombs used in this war, and they can destroy the British Isles overnight, making them unable to be used as military bases. The trip of the British King and others to South Africa is also one of the reasons, as it is intended to strengthen the unity of the Empire. The reason for choosing South Africa instead of Canada is that South Africa has a better climate and is farther away from Soviet bases.

### Spain is Brewing Restoration, Royalist Leaders Plan to Consult with Don Juan

Some people oppose holding negotiations with General Franco, while others are unwilling to link up with left-wing groups. People in the Spanish government, on the other hand, do not express concern about the Royalists' plans to restore the monarchy.

### Martial Law in the Holy Land is Lifted, but Terrorists are Still Very Active

[Report from this newspaper] London, 17th broadcast: Fifteen days have passed since the British Army implemented military control over Palestine to prevent Jewish underground workers from rioting. Now that order has been restored, the Palestinian government has decided to lift martial law from today. It is reported that since the promulgation of martial law, about 250,000 Jews have been blocked in a corner of Jerusalem and the coastal area. Hours before the lifting of martial law, tens of thousands of Jews were happy and gathered on the side of the barbed wire, waiting for it to open.

The Jewish Public Council bomb affected many houses quite a distance away. This is the first attack on the Jewish organization in history.

### Gandhi Calls for Peace, Willing to Strive to the Death

[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] Gandhi is now in Bihar Province, the site of a major riot last November, studying ways to persuade people to make peace. He met with the Governor of Bihar Province yesterday. The provincial government has ordered newspapers to publish Gandhi's appeals and prayers, advising the two communities of Indians and Muslims to reconcile.

[United Press, Bombay, 16th] According to people close to Gandhi, Gandhi may sacrifice his life as a final effort to end the constant riots in India. Gandhi's attitude has changed from anxiety and distress to a state of "emptiness of the four elements". In the past, even in the most difficult situations, Gandhi was able to remain calm and composed, and repeatedly said that the loss of self-reliance is a sign of weakness. However, the recent riots in Ben Zhebu Province and the attitude of the Muslim leaders in Bihar Province have made the Mahatma lose his self-confidence. Gandhi said in a recent speech that he did not want to live in the world and witness the failure of his "non-violent doctrine".

According to the statistics of the office last year, the number of able-bodied men in the city is about 1.2 million, requiring more than 70 million yuan.

### To Strengthen Transportation Links in the Suburbs, Six New Bus Lines Will Be Added

[Report from this newspaper] Before the war, there were five long-distance bus companies operating public transportation lines between the city and neighboring counties: Shanghai-Taicang, Shanghai-Minhang, Shanghai-Kunshan, Huashang, and Shangsong. However, all of them have been closed during the Anti-Japanese War. After the city Public Utilities Bureau's active supervision for the past year, except for Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company, which has not yet resumed operation, the rest have successively resumed operation and added the Qing-Shanghai line. In addition, in order to strengthen transportation links in the suburbs, six temporary suburban bus lines have been approved. So far, there are (1) Dongchang Road to Shangmiao Line: contracted by Qingfu Service Society, with six buses; (2) Caojiadu to Dachang Line: contracted by Xinyou Transportation Service Society, with six buses; (3) Zhongshan Park to Zhujiajiao Line: contracted by Huakang Transportation Company, with four buses; (4) Xujiahui to Wujiaxiang Line: contracted by Dafu Motor Company, with three buses; (5) Liyang Road to City Center Line: contracted by Weisheng Transportation Company, with six buses; (6) Laoximen to Caohejing Line: contracted by Southeast Motor Company, with eight buses. In addition, there are two lines, Longhua to Daxia University and City Center to Pingliang Road, which are currently inviting merchants to contract, and they will be opened to traffic after being approved.

### Tailor Returns Home, Acts as Traitor Ma Yigen Sentenced to Seven Years

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ma Yigen, a clerk at the puppet police station's Pudong branch, was found guilty of treason. This morning, the High Court sentenced him to seven years in prison and ordered the confiscation of his property, to be used for public purposes. Ma studied tailoring in Japan in his early years. After returning to China, he happened to be there during the "August 13th" Incident. After the fall of Shanghai, Ma, proficient in Japanese, was appointed to a position in the Pudong police station, specializing in liaison with the enemy navy.

### Central Air Transport Corporation Test Flight Postponed to Saigon

The Central Air Transport Corporation originally planned to send a special plane from Shanghai to Saigon and Bangkok on the 19th of this month for test flights in preparation for opening the China-France joint air route and the China-Thailand air route. However, due to incomplete completion of overseas travel procedures, the Central Air Transport Corporation received a telegram from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, postponing the test flight by one week. The company has complied and rescheduled the departure for the 26th of this month. This trip is entirely for test flights, so it will not carry passengers or cargo, except for Chinese diplomats urgently needing to go to Thailand, who will be on board to Bangkok.

[Another Dispatch] According to sources at the Shanghai office of Air France, the company's third special plane from Saigon for test flights to Shanghai is scheduled to arrive at noon today and depart from Shanghai for Saigon on the 20th, carrying passengers and cargo.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Shipping Routes to Resume

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shipping between Shanghai and Taiwan was suspended after riots in Taipei. After nearly two weeks, with the riots quelled, the Taiwan Shipping Company is resuming services. The "Tainan" is loading cargo in Keelung and will arrive in Shanghai this Sunday. The "Taitung" is scheduled to resume services this Friday, sailing from Shanghai to Keelung. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has three ships, the "Haiwan," "Haixiang," and "Haiqian," berthed in Keelung, ready for assignment to Taiwan. The date for the company to resume commercial shipping is yet to be determined.

The China Navigation Company previously purchased three Muller ships. Recently, another Wilhema Muller ship was put up for sale by the Muller Company and purchased by China Navigation Company, which plans to rename it "Tangshan."

The "Changli" returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao last Saturday, carrying a large quantity of cement.

### Whether Public Utilities Will Raise Prices Depends on the Level of Central Government Subsidies for the Final Decision

The issue of increasing prices for public utilities in this city has been brewing for more than a month. However, the authorities believe that it concerns the welfare of citizens and cannot be easily decided, so it remains unresolved. According to the results of investigations by reporters with various public utility departments, the total monthly deficit amounts to a staggering 76 billion yuan. Sources involved also indicate that whether or not public utility prices will rise, or by how much, depends on the central government's decision on the amount of subsidies and whether the subsidies are given to the Fuel Management Committee or directly to the public utility companies. If full subsidies are provided, prices will not be increased. If only partial subsidies are provided, the increase will depend on the subsidy amount. If the price of coal supplied to the public utility departments by the Fuel Committee remains at 145,000 yuan per ton, then the subsidy should be given to the Fuel Committee. If the price of coal supplied is based on the new March price of 210,000 yuan, then the subsidy should be given to the public utility companies. The final decision depends on Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs consulting with the central government on overall planning within the next few days.

### Near Yangsi Bridge Town in Pudong Police Unit Engages in Combat with Bandits Bandits Armed with Automatic and Semiautomatic Weapons Eventually Repelled

[Report from Our Newspaper] A shootout between police and bandits occurred near Yangsi Bridge Town in Pudong the night before last around 9 PM. The standoff lasted until 2 AM yesterday before the bandits retreated. The situation was extremely tense. The bandits, numbering around seven, were armed with automatic and semiautomatic weapons and possessed considerable firepower. However, they were eventually repelled by the combined efforts of the Security Police Brigade stationed in the town and the officers of the South Street Police Station of the Yangsi Bridge Police Precinct. The incident began when the South Street Police Station Chief Huang Dan, following routine, led a small team of officers with Brigade Commander Hong Liang on patrol in the suburbs around 9 PM the night before last. Near the Hengda Yarn Factory behind the district office, they vaguely saw figures in the darkness and ordered them to stop for inspection. The bandits immediately opened fire on the police. Commander Hong, for self-defense, ordered his men to scatter and return fire, while Chief Huang returned to the station to urgently summon police from the brigade and all officers from the Security Police Brigade for reinforcement. By 12 AM, the bandits were forced to retreat. However, not long after, around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, the bandits returned, attempting to storm the town. Ultimately, they were no match for the police firepower and retreated completely after 2 AM. The case has been reported to the Police Headquarters by the precinct, and a search is being conducted in the direction of the bandits' retreat. It is reported that there were no casualties on either side in the engagement.

### Sun Huaming Guilty of Assault Resulting in Death Appeal Concluded Claimed Victims Died from Enemy Maltreatment, Lack of Food and Clothing

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard an appeal case of assault resulting in death, involving the recruitment of Chinese laborers by the enemy during the war to work in mines in Hokkaido, without clothing or food, resulting in death from cold and starvation. Sun Huaming was accused of serving as the squad leader of the third team of the first unit of coal miners at the Hokkaido Rinsei Iron Works. Under his charge were nine workers: Lin Axiang, Wei Min, Li Jing, Xu Guangde, Yuan Liangdi, Lu Yun, Guo Zaibo, Peng Yonggen, and Zhao Yuanying, who were beaten with iron rods by Sun and died from severe injuries. After the Japanese surrendered, a fellow worker, Tu Yutang, returned to China and informed Lin Chunlin, the father of the deceased Lin Axiang. Upon learning the details, Lin reported the case to the Yangshupu Precinct of the Shanghai Police Bureau, which arrested and transferred Sun to the District Court. The District Court sentenced Sun to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life for continuous infliction of serious injury resulting in death. Sun appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, Sun argued in court that the squad leader had no authority to beat people, only the Japanese could beat people at will. The weather in Hokkaido was cold, with snow several feet deep in winter. The Japanese only provided us with six ounces of rice per day, and those who were sick and unable to work only received three ounces. The rice was mixed with bean cakes, soybean residue, radishes, and other things. No cotton clothes or wages were issued, leading to many deaths from cold and starvation. People in other squads also died, and it was not me who beat them to death. Later, two Chinese workers who returned to China on the same ship testified that the death rate was an average of 60-70 out of every 100 people, purely due to enemy maltreatment, and Sun was not at fault. After arguments by the prosecutor and defense lawyer, the court concluded the hearing and scheduled the verdict for 3 PM on the 24th.

### Yang Chitang and Zheng Huai Case Concluded

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Chitang, a Guangdong native, was accused of opening a printing shop at No. 7 Hongxing Lane, Xiamen Road, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, where he printed the puppet "Youth Pictorial" hosted by Xiao Jianggu. Yang was also hired as the manager and publisher and later printed "National Air Defense Propaganda Atlas" for the puppet regime, selling it for profit. After the victory, he was reported and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled for the morning of the 24th.

Zheng Huai, who had served in the puppet army, also had his case concluded in the High Court yesterday morning, with the verdict scheduled for the 24th.

### Library to be Established Within the Municipal Council

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council will cooperate with the Municipal Library next week to establish a library at its new location on Tanggu Road, providing cultural services to the citizens. The name of the library will be decided after discussions between the two parties. Currently, the council is drafting a joint proposal, which will be implemented upon agreement by both parties. The Municipal Library has a large collection of books and originally planned to establish a branch in Hongkou, but it failed due to the lack of a suitable location. The Municipal Council has a building but no books, so cooperation between the two parties will solve this problem. The Municipal Library has agreed to send a portion of its pre-war books to the new library, while the council will purchase post-war publications. However, the council estimates that purchasing new books to a satisfactory level would cost 15 million yuan, which is difficult to raise at once, so it plans to purchase them gradually. In terms of funding, each party will send several personnel and bear their own expenses. Other expenses, such as water, electricity, and miscellaneous costs, will be borne by the council.

### Commemoration Ceremony for Dai Li Held Yesterday

### Social Bureau Official Suspected of Embezzlement Dong Jianhou Detained

[Report from Our Newspaper] Social Bureau official Dong Jianhou was suspected of embezzlement. Yesterday, the Social Bureau sent a confidential letter to the District Prosecutor's Office requesting an investigation and ordered Dong to go to the Prosecutor's Office. Dong, initially unaware of the case, thought he was going on important official business and happily went. After signing in at the reception room, he was led to the courtroom by a bailiff and realized he was a prisoner. According to the Social Bureau's confidential letter, Dong had inspected the accounts of the Daxin Rice Shop on Anyang Road and extorted 500,000 yuan. The prosecutor believed that the crime was serious and ordered Dong's detention.

### Yong'an No. 2 Factory Manager Accused of Occupying Land to Build Roads

[Report from Our Newspaper] Guo Zhuozhao, the manager of Yong'an No. 2 Factory, was recently accused by Li Fugen to the District Prosecutor's Office of forcibly occupying three mu and three fen and five hao of land owned by Li in June of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) to build roads and colluding with the Japanese soldier Bing Tiancheer to falsely accuse Li of being a "思想犯" (ideological criminal). Li fortunately escaped and fled, avoiding harm. After the victory, he negotiated with Guo several times without result and attached certificates from the district chief and Bao Zhang (local security chief). The District Prosecutor's Office will schedule a hearing to question the original defendant.

### Reassessment of Rental Values in Former French Concession Postponed for Further Discussion

[Report from Our Newspaper] The collection of house rent is based on rental values. Recently, many residents of the former French Concession have requested the Finance Bureau to re-evaluate rental values. The bureau also believes that the assessment of rental values in the former French Concession is different from that in the former International Settlement. In order to achieve uniformity, it is proposed to reassess the rental values in the area. The case was discussed at the previous municipal meeting, but due to the high cost of investigations and other expenses required for the reassessment, no conclusion was reached and it was postponed for further discussion.

### Unauthorized Arrest of People to be Prevented Commander Xuan Reiterates

[Report from Our Newspaper] It has been rumored that people have been frequently arrested and gone missing in the city recently. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly stated that it never secretly arrests people or searches residences, except for those who are issued arrest warrants and search warrants in accordance with legal procedures. Yesterday, Commander Xuan reiterated this point again at the headquarters' memorial week, saying that since the withdrawal of CCP personnel, there are indeed many secret agents, but it is illegal to unauthorized arrest people and search residences in the name of the Garrison Headquarters and such actions should be prevented. Xuan also said that no agency within the Songhu area other than the Garrison Headquarters may arrest people, or at least must contact the Garrison Headquarters. In the future, it will pay attention to unauthorized arrests by other agencies and take effective measures to prevent them.

### Central Trust Bureau Solemnly Declares No Special Privileges Enjoyed for Imports Importing Luxury Goods is Absurd

[Central News Agency] Regarding reports that the Yitong Company, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Supply Bureau are currently purchasing and importing large quantities of luxury goods, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau to understand the truth. According to the official, the bureau is a government procurement agency, founded in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), and gold is allocated by the government for its use. Because the bureau does not have a branch in the United States, all procurement matters in the United States are handled by the China Supply Committee in Washington and the New York World Trade Corporation. All imports by the bureau are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Temporary Import Management Committee, and applications for import permits are made without enjoying special privileges. The bureau solemnly denies the report by the Associated Press that it has imported luxury goods such as wireless radios and refrigerators. This can be verified with the customs. The news report also claimed that some luxury goods have been resold by government officials for profit, which is absurd. Also, at the end of the war, before the quota system was established, the bureau ordered a batch of 190 cars to meet the urgent needs of various agencies. The allocation of these cars was entirely in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, and the bureau delivered them to various government agencies at cost price and did not sell them at market prices, so there was no profit.

### Public Transport Insufficient by Half Private Motor Vehicles Increase Sharply Registration Procedures Difficult to Handle Director of the Fourth Bureau of Public Works Reports

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Li Yingsong, director of the Fourth Bureau of Public Works, in his report at the municipal government's memorial week yesterday: Before the war, there were a total of 65 commercial public transportation lines in the city, with 745 vehicles (including buses and trolleybuses). Although active efforts have been made to restore them after the victory, they are still one-third fewer than before the war, while the city's population has increased from more than 3 million to more than 4 million. This is the fundamental reason for the difficulty and congestion of transportation. According to transportation experts, with the city's population of 4 million, an average of 60%, or 2.4 million people, may leave home every day, and most of them rely on public transportation. Assuming that each vehicle can accommodate an average of 2,000 people, the city needs 1,000 public transportation vehicles to meet the needs, but in reality, there are only more than 500 vehicles, so crowding is inevitable. The bureau has hired American experts to come to Shanghai to study the city's transportation problems and believes that good opinions and methods will be available for adoption in the future.

Enemy-Puppet Vehicles Particularly Difficult to Handle

Due to the rapid increase in the city's population, the number of vehicles has also increased accordingly. The number of private motor vehicles has doubled compared to before, totaling more than 22,000. In addition, the number of pedicabs produced after the war has reached more than 18,080. In addition, the number of bicycles and rickshaws has also increased, making it difficult for the Bureau of Public Works to handle vehicle registration. Before the war, the Bureau of Public Works, the British and French Concession authorities handled the registration separately, but now it has been merged into one place. Moreover, after the victory, a large number of motor vehicles came to Shanghai from other ports and inland areas, among which enemy-puppet vehicles are the most difficult to handle.

Transfer Only Permitted with Concrete Evidence

According to the records of the received Puppet Construction Bureau, vehicles in the name of the enemy or puppet regime or transported from other places by the enemy army were never registered in the city. According to the administrative order, enemy-puppet vehicles sold to bona fide third parties before the enemy's surrender are considered valid, so it is extremely difficult to review them. At the time of the takeover, various parties drove vehicles to the bureau to apply for registration, and because the records had not been fully received at that time, a temporary measure was formulated to allow them to provide a guarantee and issue a permit. On the one hand, it facilitates people's transportation, and on the other hand, it avoids fleeing to other areas, but these vehicles must be allowed to transfer ownership only after providing concrete evidence.

General Issuance of Driver's Licenses

Regarding driving tests, applicants must first stamp their fingerprints with the police and designate a municipal hospital to check their qualifications before applying for the driving test. After passing the test, a license will be issued. A total of 9,908 ordinary driver's licenses, 19,786 professional driver's licenses, 8,950 learner's licenses, and 23,000 pedicab driver's licenses have been issued in the city. Twenty-two driving schools have been approved and registered.

### Wang Zhuchen Case Third Trial The District Court Summons Witnesses

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhuchen's case of hiding enemy Long Island foreign firm leftover materials, the District Court yesterday summoned witnesses for the third trial. The witnesses included Wu Runsun (battalion commander of the Garrison Headquarters), Russian Romanberg (manager of Aldo Motor Company), Eparas Laskavicky (Aldo employee), former deputy director of the Putuo Road Police Station Xi Yongxi, and Fan Rongchun (director of the Central Machine Factory), the informant who had Wang hide stolen goods. Wu Runsun was questioned first. Wu was the person in charge of the Wang case during the investigation by the Clearing and Investigation Group. According to him, after Wang Zhuchen was secretly reported, he sent people to Wang's residence to conduct undercover investigations, posing as buyers of auto parts. Wang had issued a list, and the evidence was solid. This list has now been handed over to the Transportation Section of the Garrison Headquarters and can be retrieved as evidence. Aldo Motor Company Manager Romanberg and his employees all admitted to knowing Wang, but claimed that they had never heard of the crime of embezzlement of enemy property. Fan Rongchun said: I don't know Wang Zhuchen. The auto parts were introduced by Teng Yongxi to be stored. Later, an employee, Gu Dingyi, read the newspaper and reported it to the police. It is heard that the District Court attaches great importance to the case, and a collegiate panel will be formed for debate next time.

### Electroplating Workers Petition Misunderstanding Arises Between Labor and Management

Work Distribution for Kiln Cargo Handling

Self-Negotiation After Mediation Fails

[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 70 electroplating workers went to the Social Bureau yesterday to petition, demanding that the employer restore the issuance of salaries according to the index and other four points. The Social Bureau originally scheduled a negotiation between the two parties yesterday, but the employer's representative did not arrive. The four workers' representatives took the bureau's emergency order to the trade association, but a misunderstanding arose between the two parties. The employer reported to the police, and a large number of armed personnel surrounded the scene. After some explanation, the matter was resolved.

Because the employer of Wujin Road Delong Tobacco Company dismissed more than 10 workers who asked for leave on the 15th of this month and did not come to the factory to work, more than 100 female workers of the factory gathered at the Social Bureau yesterday morning to petition, demanding that the factory withdraw its order.

The employees of Jiuchang numbers in the electric bead industry, Maocheng, Qiming, Daxin, Dahua, Daming, Huyinji, Jiangkangji, and Fengbaocheng, etc., have been on strike since the 15th because the bonus for February was not paid, and the Social Bureau is currently mediating.

Regarding the transportation of incoming goods in the Suzhou River kiln industry, disputes previously arose between dock workers and transportation workers. After mediation by the Social Bureau, a work distribution method was agreed upon: dock workers would handle the transportation when the goods arrived, and after a certain distance, they would be handed over to transportation workers for transportation. Afterwards, the kiln industry trade association expressed its opposition, believing that the repeated handling would easily break the bricks and tiles, resulting in large losses. Upon hearing the news, the transportation workers believed that they would have no work to do, so they once again requested the Social Bureau to mediate a few days ago. Yesterday's negotiations still failed to reach an agreement, and the two parties will now negotiate on their own outside the meeting.

The Social Bureau continued to convene negotiations between the two parties yesterday on the decision of the New Capital Hotel to dismiss one-third of the 275 employees, but the dismissal method has not yet been decided.

Coal Industry Petitions City Council to Restore Free Trade

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Hengchuang, Chairman of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, and Wang Zuxun, the association's legal counsel, and seven others, submitted a petition yesterday. Mao Chunpu and Lu Qisheng, representing the group, took the letter to the City Council to request two things: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee to allocate 25,000 tons of various types of coal to the trade association each month at a fair price, and allow the restoration of free trade. (According to the representatives, the Fuel Management Committee has not allocated coal to the association for three months, making it impossible for coal merchants to continue operating). (2) Request that all domestic coal mines allocate a certain amount from their total output to supply the trade association members for free purchase and sale. In addition, the representatives solemnly denied the Fuel Management Committee's claim that the black market price of coal was entirely caused by the coal industry association. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Government and the City Council yesterday, the representatives will also go to Beijing to petition.

### Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries

Repeated Mortgaging

Yu Bieqian asks: (1) Mr. Jia owns seven rooms. In the 33rd year, he mortgaged them to Mr. Yi for 10,000 legal tender for a term of ten years. The mortgage interest was used as rent. Later, he took back two rooms and mortgaged them to others separately. Recently, Mr. Jia intends to absolutely sell the entire house to Mr. Yi, but failed. He changed to sell it to Mr. Bing, but Mr. Bing only wanted three of them and asked Mr. Yi to change the mortgage term to seven years. Mr. Yi naturally cannot agree because the mortgage term has not expired. I don't know what kind of legal protection there is? (2) If the house is absolutely sold to Mr. Bing, how should the 10,000 mortgage payment paid by Mr. Yi be handled? (3) Mr. Bing bought Mr. Jia's house. Mr. Yi still has the right to live in the house for seven years. If Mr. Bing forcibly wants to move in, how should he deal with it? (4) There is another house. Mr. Jia transfers it to Mr. Yi, and Mr. Yi continues to rent it to Mr. Bing. Mr. Yi collects rent from Mr. Bing every month as Mr. Jia's transfer interest. Now Mr. Jia directly sells it to Mr. Bing without Mr. Yi's knowledge. Mr. Bing refuses to pay the rent after occupying the house. At that time, the transfer fee in the 31st year was 10,000 pseudo currency, with a term of ten years. Also, Mr. Jia absolutely sold it to Mr. Bing before the term expired, which is unreasonable. If he seeks compensation for the transfer fee from him, what kind of ratio should be used for conversion?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) Mr. Yi mortgaged Mr. Jia's seven rooms. He also moved into the house to live, using the interest on the mortgage as rent. He has also obtained the right to lease on the mortgaged property. Afterwards, Mr. Yi complied with Mr. Jia's request and re-mortgaged two of them to others, which was originally permitted by law. As for Mr. Jia selling the entire property to Mr. Bing, his exercise of the sale based on ownership is naturally something Mr. Yi can oppose. However, the mortgage rent and lease rights already obtained by Mr. Yi will not be affected by the transfer of ownership. It will continue to exist. If Mr. Bing asks Mr. Yi to change the period from ten years to seven years, and the house from five rooms to three rooms, if Mr. Yi does not agree, he can refuse according to the law. (2) If Mr. Jia sells the house to Mr. Bing, Mr. Yi's mortgage payment can be used to clear his right to be compensated from the proceeds of the sale. (3) After Mr. Bing buys Mr. Jia's house, Mr. Yi still has a seven-year lease term, of course he can continue to exercise his rights. If Mr. Bing wants to forcibly move in, he can refuse according to the law. (4) This situation is similar to the first one, and the answer to the first one can be referred to. If Mr. Yi seeks compensation from Mr. Jia, the mortgage fee can be increased by the court according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after the Restoration.

### Kerosene Mixed with Gasoline is Extremely Easy to Cause Fires The Police Department has Strictly Prohibited it and Hopes Citizens Will Report it

Recently, there have been many fires in this city due to careless use of kerosene stoves. After investigation, most of the reasons are that kerosene prices are high, and unscrupulous merchants are greedy for illegal profits, either mixing gasoline into kerosene or making artificial kerosene for sale, which leads to this situation. It is reported that artificial kerosene is made of diesel, rosin water or various mineral oils mixed with flammable liquids such as gasoline. Its combustion properties are similar to kerosene, but if it is not manufactured properly, its properties are uncertain, and it is extremely easy to cause fires when used. Kerosene mixed with gasoline has a higher flash point than ordinary kerosene. Try pouring a small amount of pure kerosene into a small iron can or porcelain dish, and lighting it with a match. It will not catch fire. If the entire matchstick is immersed in kerosene, the flame will be extinguished instead. You need to use another match to ignite the surface of the kerosene. It is not the same if it contains gasoline. If the gasoline content is 5%, it will burn about three seconds after the match is lit. If it is 10%, the entire surface will immediately catch fire when it encounters a spark, which is extremely harmful and the same as artificial gasoline. The Fire Department of the Police Department has paid close attention to this and prohibited its sale. It is hoped that all citizens will cooperate. If they find that the kerosene they have purchased is suspicious, they should immediately notify the Fire Department of the Police Department or the local branch bureau by phone so that it can be inspected and severely punished.

### The Yunnan Education Department Issued Three Measures to Examine the Teaching Progress of Middle Schools Ordering All Schools to Seriously Implement Them Starting This Semester

[Our newspaper Kunming seventeenth telegram] Wang, the head of the Yunnan Education Department, is quite serious about examining the teaching progress of provincial middle schools. Recently, the department issued the following three measures, ordering all schools to comply: (1) Reviewing the homework textbooks of each subject. Starting from this semester, the department will periodically select homework exercise textbooks for each grade in Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry to examine the teaching results of each subject, and the department will organize a special management agency to handle it. (2) Stipulating class diaries. In the past, teaching in each subject in various schools was heard to have failed to complete the course according to the standards issued by the ministry, which had a significant impact on the improvement of students' levels. In order to clearly understand the teaching progress of each grade in each school and facilitate the investigation of teaching conditions, a class diary format is specially stipulated, ordering all schools to seriously handle it and prepare it for review at the end of each semester so that it can be investigated. (3) In the past, various schools often neglected the management of student records. Since the strict control was implemented at the beginning of the last semester, the effect has been very significant. However, some schools have failed to implement it effectively. Starting from this semester, it is specifically stipulated that all new students and transfer students must submit various documents for review within one month after the start of school to prevent the abuses of skipping grades, and a special person should be designated to be responsible for registration and review to avoid negligence.

### Publicly Funded Student Lecture Held Yesterday at the Ministry of Education Minister Zhu Personally Presided over the Opening Ceremony and Explained the Main Points

[Our newspaper Nanjing seventeenth telegram] The public-funded student lecture was held at the Ministry of Education this morning. More than 150 students who passed the public-funded student examination attended. Minister Zhu personally presided over the ceremony and explained the main points of the lecture. Experts were specially invited to give special lectures and guidance as a reference for studying abroad and to explain the policy on studying abroad. In the past years, returning students have made many contributions to academic culture and national construction. Since the establishment of the National Government, some universities in China have gradually become complete and have trained many talents. It is not difficult for them to compete with universities in Europe and the West, so in terms of theory and practice, university students do not need to go abroad. Now the government's selection of students to study abroad is a policy, not a system. It is not a rigid requirement to send them every year. It will be held when necessary depending on the situation. The Ministry held the selection this time in view of the lack of university teachers after the war. The subjects are "Social Sciences" and "Natural Sciences", with equal emphasis, and also include literature and art, taking into account overall needs. The meeting adjourned at noon. The lectures began in the afternoon. The meeting will last for three weeks and will include lectures and free discussions on "Special Appointment", "Special Submission", "Domestic and Foreign Situation", and "Western Etiquette", as well as symposiums. In addition to government leaders and experts, the lecturers also include ambassadors and cultural counselors from various countries.

This Week's Mayor's Cup Football Match Qingbai Meets Youyou Donghua Faces Jewish

This week's football schedule was finalized and announced by the Football Committee yesterday. There are a total of four games, all of which will be played at Yiyiwei. On Saturday at 3:00 PM, the Mayor's Cup Qingbai will face Youyou. On Sunday, the Group B final will be held starting at 8:30 AM, with Qingbai B playing against the Railway. The Group A second round will start at 10:30 AM, with the Soviet Union welcoming Longjie. The Mayor's Cup semi-final will start at 3:30 PM, with Donghua facing the Jewish.

In the Mayor's Cup semi-final on Saturday, Qingbai will play against Youyou. Since Youyou defeated Jingwu with a score of 1-0 and Qingbai defeated the Railway with a score of 2-0 to advance to the next round. The two sides have tied twice in the league, which shows that their strength is evenly matched. However, Youyou's goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai left Shanghai for Hong Kong last week to join Sing Tao, which has undoubtedly reduced his strength. However, Qingbai lacks Wu Zhenxiang, and there is also a lack of talent to supplement the defense. Once they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.

In the Group B final, Qingbai B will play against the Railway. Players from the former team, such as Zhang Renyi, Jiang Geqing, and Xu Guofu, performed well against the Railway in the Mayor's Cup last week. The latter team forced a tie with Qingbai A in the Mayor's Cup, but finally bowed their heads in the rematch, so their door strength is also not bad. This time, the Group B final is a battle for the championship, and there will be a lively performance.

In the Group A league, the Soviet Union will play against Longjie. In the first round, the Soviet Union defeated Longjie 9-0. This week's second meeting, Longjie intends to avenge their previous defeat and will definitely resist to the death. However, the Soviet Union's recent situation is very good. When they meet, Longjie should be careful to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

The regular season champion of the Mayor's Cup, Donghua, will face the dark horse Jewish in the semi-final. Since the former team has been dominating Group A this season, they have a strong ambition to win the Mayor's Cup championship. The strength of the entire team is extremely strong. The Jewish team is known as the dark horse. This time, they have invited the famous Portuguese merchant player Fu En to help, which has made their strength even more substantial. The winner will face the Soviet Union. The full schedule is noted below:

March 22nd (Saturday)

Qingbai - Youyou (Mayor's Cup) 3:00 PM Yiyiwei

March 23rd (Sunday)

Qingbai B - Railway (Group B Final) 8:30 AM Yiyiwei

Soviet Union - Longjie (Group A) 10:30 AM Yiyiwei

Donghua - Jewish (Mayor's Cup) 3:30 PM Yiyiwei

### Although Proposals for Currency System Reform Have Been Made, Implementation Still Needs to be Discussed; Maintaining Stability is the Top Priority at Present

[Report from Nanjing, 17th] An economist told our reporter on the 17th that the main purpose of the government's current economic measures is to gradually transition the current economy from an extraordinary to a normal state. Before everything is on the right track, the government is not considering issuing new currency. Rumors that the government will change the currency system are completely unreliable. The economic reform plan proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee does have a comprehensive plan for future economic measures, but there is no plan to issue new currency at present.

[Report] Yesterday's newspaper reported that the economic reform plan submitted for discussion at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee included a proposal to reform the currency system and establish a gold standard. When a reporter inquired about this matter with a senior official in the financial sector, he said: "I have not heard of this matter." However, since it is a proposal, it is currently just one opinion on reforming the currency system. According to his personal opinion, now is probably not the time to implement a gold standard. Whether it is suitable to adopt a gold standard in the future when reorganizing the currency system depends on the situation at that time. Otherwise, it may not achieve the expected results. He stated: "The premise of all economic and financial measures of the government is to maintain stability. Now that the new economic plan has just been promulgated, we hope that the domestic economic and financial situation will gradually stabilize. All economic measures that could cause further turmoil, such as the recent rumors of changing the exchange rate, will not be considered."

Furthermore, reporters interviewed several senior officials from the Central Bank and people in the financial sector. They all said that they had not heard of this matter. A senior financial official expressed his opinion: "The current currency system implemented in our country is also known as a managed foreign exchange system. Internally, the legal currency is circulated, and externally, a managed exchange system is adopted. The issuance of domestic legal currency has been somewhat inflated due to the impact of years of war, which has affected the psychology of legal currency holders. Therefore, future currency system reforms should focus on restoring people's confidence in the currency. However, for the convenience of management, when implementing the gold standard, it is not necessary to circulate metal coins. Instead, a fixed amount of substitute banknotes can be issued in proportion to the fixed amount of gold reserves. However, the amount of gold reserves and the amount of banknotes issued must be publicly announced regularly, and social organizations should be entrusted with the responsibility of supervision. However, such currency system reform is not the right time at present. Generally, it is easier to start reorganizing the currency system when fiscal revenue and expenditure are relatively close, the political environment is stable, and transportation order is restored."

### News of Currency Reform Proposals Stimulates People's Hearts; Buying Sentiment Greatly Increases in the Chinese Stock Market; Large Traders in the Industry Still Mostly Sell at High Prices

Chinese stocks were initially weak yesterday but then became firm. Large traders in the industry were actively selling, which was initially very unfavorable. Later, due to a proposal to use the gold standard in the evening news, coupled with rumors of the cancellation of special certificates, the market ended at a high price.

The market opened lower in the morning. No. 223, No. 171, No. 224, No. 218 and No. 143 were sold and bought, respectively. Die Yong Yarn rose from 2,850 yuan to 2,950 yuan. No. 235, No. 89 and No. 198 were offered and seen in the market. New Light and Credit Harmony absorption attracted people, and the upward trend became intense. Die Yong Yarn once reached a high of 3,070 yuan. No. 91, No. 97, No. 186, No. 197 and No. 223 faced high pressure and returned to the flat. No. 171, No. 217, No. 186, No. 14, No. 83, No. 97, No. 152, No. 198, No. 4, No. 235, No. 24, No. 207, No. 183, No. 47, No. 84 and No. 143 were all sold off together, and American Asia Delivery was forced to stop first. After 11:30 AM, retail investors also began to close out positions, and Die Yong Yarn fell to 2,750 yuan. No. 180, No. 218, No. 76 and No. 165 were slightly bought at low prices, and the midday closing was seen in the market. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yong Yarn, Credit Harmony and American Asia each fell by a strong half, China Prosperity, Jingfu, Qinxing, Chinese-French and Xinhua fell, and New Light saw a slight increase due to increased information. Die Yong Yarn and Credit Harmony fell by half in trading delivery, American Asia fell by 10%, Jingfu rose slightly, and New Light and China Prosperity fell slightly. Among the unpopular stocks, China Textile, Unified Profit and Jinglun fell by more than 10%.

In the afternoon, the evening newspaper published a wall newspaper with a proposal to use the gold standard at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which ignited buying sentiment. No. 224 and others bought in, and Die Yong Yarn rose from 2,940 yuan to 3,030 yuan after opening. No. 13, No. 208, No. 232, No. 47, No. 180, No. 186, No. 149, No. 106, No. 236 and No. 231 were sold, falling to 2,840 yuan.

Because the multiples of Yong Yarn were too large, sellers were apprehensive, falling back to 2,820 yuan. Later, there were rumors of the cancellation of special certificates, and people's sentiment improved again. No. 224, No. 76, No. 185 and No. 223 bought in to 2,960 yuan. No. 177, No. 14 and No. 218 and No. 89 were sold, falling back to 2,860 yuan. No. 94, No. 224, No. 89 and No. 73 bought in to 3,030 yuan.

Securities brokers initially sold and then bought, and Guangdong brokers and foreign firms also absorbed under the gold standard rumors. Foreign merchants forcefully bought, and the performance of Industry and Guangdong was the most outstanding.

### The United States Needs a Large Number of Needles

[Report] According to a foreign firm in this city, a Swedish merchant told a reporter that the United States has recently telegraphed our exporters, requesting that we supply needles in large quantities. These needles were originally supplied by British and Czech merchants in the United States. Recently, due to the inability to deliver quickly, the United States is extremely short of them. Our country's production capacity is still abundant, and there is no problem with exporting in large quantities. However, American merchants are only willing to offer prices according to the limits traded by British and Czech merchants, which is US$12 per 10,000 needles. However, our factory quotes a price of US$13 per 10,000 needles, so it is not yet possible to export.

### Representatives of Coal Merchants to Petition in Beijing This Morning, Requesting the Government to Improve Coal Allocation Methods

[Report] More than 800 coal merchants in this city have complained that the Fuel Committee's allocation of coal is uneven and has heard rumors for several months that the source is insufficient. The allocation has been suspended for three months. At the same time, the coal merchants' self-managed coal is forcibly purchased at official prices, and the livelihood of the coal merchants is at risk. They have suggested to the guild that the government should improve these two points, which have been reported in previous newspapers. After receiving the above-mentioned suggestions, the guild has decided to elect Chairman Xie Hengcong, directors Pan Yisan, Bao Zhexiao, Mao Chunpu, Lu Qisheng, and Chen Jinrong, etc., as petition representatives, along with advisor Wang Zuxun. They convened a meeting of all the merchants in the coal industry market at 2:00 PM yesterday to exchange petition opinions. Zhao Renqin, Yu Quan, Mao Ticheng and other 30 people were added as liaison officers for the petition representatives, and they are scheduled to depart for Beijing this morning.

Provisional Measures for Purchasing Allocated Coal

The Fuel Committee previously handed over 8,000 tons of coal to the city's Social Affairs Bureau, which was then transferred to the coal business association for allocation. The allocation and purchase methods have been drafted. Merchants are required to pay within seven days, from the 18th to the 25th. Overdue payments will be regarded as a waiver. The total amount of coal allocated this time is 8,000 tons, including 5,600 tons of train lump coal, 400 tons of Kailuan No. 2 lump coal, 1,550 tons of Tongdeli Xiazi coal, and 450 tons of Great Wall briquettes. Each merchant unit can be allocated 5 tons of train lump coal or Kailuan No. 2 coal, 1.25 tons of Tongdeli Xiazi coal, and 0.375 tons of Great Wall briquettes. After paying on the above dates, they must hold a user certificate (which must be approved by the guild) to obtain the delivery voucher from the guild.

Adjustment of Coal Allocation Prices for Factories

[Report] The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has adjusted the allocation price of coal for factories (Kailuan bituminous coal fines) to 240,000 yuan per ton, starting from the 15th of this month. The original allocation price was 175,000 yuan per ton. Due to the slow arrival of this coal last month, a total of 10,000 tons were allocated. Allocation has not yet started this month, and the quantity may increase slightly compared to last month. In addition, the price adjustments for other types of coal allocated by the association are still under consideration. The briquettes allocated to public officials and teachers are still entrusted by the association to briquette factories using white coal fines. The allocation price is still 220,000 yuan per ton, or 11,000 yuan per dan. The shortfall in costs will be subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Rice and Grain See Slight Increase

Yesterday, a total of more than 9,300 shi of rice arrived from the north and south markets. Prices in the southern production areas were high, and buyers were firm. Early thin rice continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice also increased by 2,000 yuan, and indica rice increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan rose by 1,000 yuan, and yin yuan was stable. However, digestion turned sluggish at the close, and transactions were also few.

Flour wholesale was quite strong, rising by 300 to 1,000 yuan, while bran remained at a flat price. In the oil market, goods from Qingdao poured in, and stores lowered their expectations. Barrel peanut oil fell by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, soybean oil was flat, and there were few changes in clear oil and sesame oil. Soybean cake buyers were not active, and the situation was stable.

### The Flour Manufacturers' Association Continues to Request a Reduction in the Unified Tax on Factory Production

Since the Ministry of Finance issued an increase in the unified tax on flour production by 700 yuan per bag, manufacturers have petitioned for exemption or a reduction, but have not yet received a reply. It is reported that Mao Xin, Fu Xin, Fu Feng, Hua Feng, and Yu Tong factories have followed the order to temporarily comply with the new unified tax, starting yesterday. The ex-factory price is 45,700 yuan per bag (previously 45,000 yuan). The Flour Bran Manufacturers' Association distributes flour to biscuit, cake, steamed bun, tea food, and liquor industries for 47,700 yuan per bag (previously 47,000 yuan). In order to continue to request a reduction in the unified tax, the above five factories and the Fourth District Flour Industry Association have filed petitions to the municipal government, which will be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. If a reduction is obtained, the factory sale price will be changed immediately. It is reported that the above factories previously sent personnel to Subei to purchase raw materials. As of now, a total of 150,000 dan have been received, which can meet the processing needs of more than half a month. According to industry insiders, it is estimated that this year's wheat harvest will be average. It is necessary to wait until after the Qingming Festival before a final determination can be made. However, excessive rainfall last winter may have affected wheat growth.

### The Central Bank Has Approved the Allotment of US Dollars Needed for Cotton Purchases; 40 Million Yuan for the First Quarter

[Report] The Foreign Cotton Review Committee of the Import Management Committee convened a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. As a result of the discussion, the Central Bank has approved the allotment of US$40 million for the foreign cotton quota needed for the first quarter. The Central Bank is currently discussing with the foreign cotton importers to urge them to ship the cotton that has been ordered to China first. The foreign exchange needed will be allotted by the Central Bank in installments. In addition, because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has 200,000 bales of cotton to be shipped to China, the deadline for the US$40 million foreign cotton quota for the first quarter (February to April) has been extended to June of this year. During this period, the foreign cotton needed for replenishment has been widely sought. As for the foreign cotton needed for replenishment in the second half of the year, the standing committee has also indicated that it will find ways to supply the necessary foreign exchange funds to ensure that the yarn factories do not stop production due to a shortage of raw cotton. In addition, at yesterday's meeting, someone suggested that the foreign exchange earned by yarn factories from exporting yarn and cloth should be allowed to be used by the yarn factories themselves to settle the purchase of foreign cotton. As a result of the discussion, it was still considered appropriate to hand it over for unified management.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Price Negotiation List: Textile Control Board Principally Accepts, Transfers to Price Committee for Review

[Our Report] The Textile Control Board, in order to review cotton yarn prices, convened a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 PM in the City Hall conference room.

The list was then handed over to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take to Nanjing for submission to the Price Committee for review.

### Yarn Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market saw brisk sales of coarse plain yarn. Transactions of 10-count yarn remained minimal. Due to rumors of the Textile Control Board raising purchase prices, the market continued to be firm. As there was an extreme scarcity of 42-count two-ply yarn, the price jumped by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan due to slight absorption by weaving mills, ultimately reaching a significant transaction price of 7.35 million yuan.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 2,767 pieces, including 2,413 pieces for factories and 354 pieces for yarn dealers. There were 1,183 applications in total, including 834 from factories and 349 from yarn dealers.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Not Quiet

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continued demand for high-end fine cloth from the Tianjin and Hankou groups, and market sentiment was gradually strengthening. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 157,000 yuan, rising to 162,500 yuan, a jump of 6,000 yuan compared to Saturday. "Blue Phoenix" was priced at 150,000 yuan and "Colored Ball" at 155,000 yuan, both increasing by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Other lower-end goods also increased by varying amounts of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Serge also saw demand from local customers, with the "Four Gentlemen" priced at 155,000 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. "Golden Lotus" gauze was priced at 149,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The 20-count fine cloth from Textile Construction saw active purchase from various groups yesterday. It is said that the quality of this product can potentially replace the raw materials of Hong Kong shirt fabrics, so the price was also brisk, reaching 131,000 yuan to 133,000 yuan. Prices of other bleached cloth, raw cloth, and straight tribute cloth also increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while shilin cloth and blue cloth remained stable.

### Foreign Firm Tea Market Gradually Weakens

Domestic sales of red and green tea have been narrow for a long time, with little progress. Market sentiment is weak despite wanting it to improve. As for the foreign firm tea market, the British merchants closely monitored black tea, and purchase offers were still rampant. However, they were selective on prices, and while sellers were willing to concede, they were reluctant to make excessive concessions due to cost considerations. Therefore, yesterday's transactions did not proceed smoothly, and the situation also showed signs of weakening. Sales of various green teas continued, and the situation remained lively. However, market prices were affected by the declining trend of black tea and were not as stable as last week, making it difficult to maintain a firm foothold.

### 4,000 Tons of Soybeans for Oil Extraction: Central Trust Bureau May Allocate Within the Month

In order to allocate and sell cooking oil, the oil extraction industry in this city, through Mayor Wu, obtained the approval of the authorities to allocate 4,000 tons of soybeans to subsidize the losses of various factories. Because there was no official document to the Central Trust Bureau at that time, the Central Trust Bureau refused to allocate this raw material after recent government personnel changes. After deliberation among the directors of the industry association, Zhang Decheng, director of the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was dispatched to Nanjing to meet with Jiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, to request regular supply of raw materials for oil extraction and allocation, and to discuss the payment of losses by the national treasury after the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory assumed the responsibility for oil allocation to civil servants and teachers. Zhang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and said that the supply of 4,000 tons of raw materials had been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a letter of certification had been prepared by Mayor Wu, and the allocation could be made within the month. Regarding the allocation price, the factory requested the Central Trust Bureau to allocate it at cost, approximately 55,000 yuan per dan. Currently, the total monthly oil allocation to each factory is 30,000 dan, and 4,000 tons of soybeans can only extract 8,000 dan of oil. Manufacturers hope to obtain inexpensive raw materials to revitalize the operations of each factory. Currently, the price limit for cooking oil is 250,000 yuan, and profits are meager. A document has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from the 15/1000ths business tax, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed to consider it.

### No Donations, No Taxes, No Restrictions, No Restraints: The Carefree Nevada

Reno, February 26 (Airmail from our U.S. Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

In the United States, no state is more carefree and free than Nevada. New York is very bustling, but bustling does not equate to carefree. In New York City, you see people who are too busy to catch their breath all day long. California is very wealthy, but Americans in California work to live, and their emotions are not relaxed. Only Nevada is an exception. As you travel through any city or village in Nevada, you see carefree people who seem to never think about what is called work, and they certainly do not know what is called legal restraint!

No Donations, No Taxes, Not Even Police

Nevada has laws, and Nevadans have a slogan: "Live, be happy, obey the law." They never do anything that seriously violates the law. The 150,000 people in the entire state do not pick up lost items on the road, and doors are not closed at night. This is their spirit of obeying the law. However, the restrictions that the law places on their behavior are surprisingly small. Marriage is absolutely free. Divorce and remarriage, and remarriage and divorce, are commonplace. Gambling is not only public but also supported and encouraged by the state government. There are no police officers to be seen in any town in Nevada, and the state government waives any donations and taxes. Of the forty-eight states in the United States, only Nevada has no income tax, no inheritance tax, no excess profits tax, and no consumer goods tax... In a word, Nevada is "a state with no donations and no taxes." In New York City, a pack of Camel cigarettes now sells for nineteen cents at small grocery stores. But in Nevada, it only costs fifteen cents.

Nevada's area is equivalent to three Jiangsu provinces, and its current total population is only 150,000. The United States was originally a country with a very sparse population density, but a proportion like Nevada's is rarely seen. Nevada's "Gazetteer" says: Its population has only increased in the last fifteen years. The time around the First World War was the most desolate period.

Visiting a Gold Mine: A Golden Mountain

I have tasted this terrible "desolation," and that was on the night I stayed in the small town of Virginia City. Virginia City is about ninety miles from Reno. Early in the morning, I took a bus to visit the gold mine there. It is a mining area called "Gold Hill," one mile southeast of Virginia City. Seventy years ago, when the American "Westward Movement" was in full swing, Gold Hill was filled with thousands of outlaws who had migrated from the east. They developed Gold Hill and also prospered Virginia City.

The Civil War promoted the development of the American West. The great President Lincoln, while dealing with the Southern Army, devoted a lot of time to the development of the Rocky Mountain region. These newly captured areas of white people were all supporters of Lincoln during the Civil War. At that time, the Nevada hero General Reno, his name has now become a world-famous place name. The town of Sparks, near Reno, is also named after John Sparks, the governor of Nevada during the Civil War.

In the ten years after the end of the Civil War, the United States completed the most important step in the process of nation-building: the railroad from the Atlantic coast directly to the Pacific coast. In 1868, three years after the end of the North-South truce, railway workers developed Reno. At that time, the small town of Virginia City was already quite prosperous. General Grant, a hero of the Civil War, inspected Nevada in 1879 and was warmly welcomed in Virginia City. I still have many photos from that time. At that time, the foundation of the United States had been largely laid.

However, there is a time when gold is exhausted. As the gold disappeared, Virginia City became deserted. The fugitive laborers left one after another, leaving only five hundred residents sparsely dotted on this desolate mountainside. Springs now flow. Locals say that eggs can be cooked in the hot springs. I asked them: Do you still see gold dust? They shook their heads.

I stayed overnight in Virginia City, a town of dilapidated old houses. At dusk, the streetlights were half-bright and half-dim. As I walked on the wooden sidewalks, I could only hear my own deliberate footsteps. The loneliness of the dead city made me feel timid. It was the first time I saw an old and desolate city in America.

However, even in such areas, it is still carefree. In the small, narrow bars, there were several tables for gambling. Although the sparrow is small, the scale of the gambling is exactly the same as in Reno. Many gamblers looked at me with curious eyes, perhaps they had never seen a yellow person from tens of thousands of miles away.

The owner of the gambling hall bought me a drink. He told me many stories about gold mining here sixty years ago. He said: Now the gold mine in Virginia City is exhausted, but the silver mines near Carson City (the capital of Nevada) are still being mined. The gambling halls all over Nevada use silver dollars, and most of them are minted by Nevada's own mint.

He also said: When the white people invaded Nevada, they fought bloody battles with the Red Indians. The white people fought very bravely to grab the gold mines. Now, the gold is gone, but there are still many mineral products such as copper, nickel, and zinc. The University of Nevada, near Reno, is famous for its mining and metallurgy engineering.

Then, he sighed. This small town of Virginia City no longer has much hope. "Who is willing to come here to spend money in this barren wilderness?" He said: Nevada prohibits nothing, except public prostitutes. However, in order to prosper Virginia City, the state government specially approved the establishment of Virginia City "public brothels," and "the other name for public brothels is red lanterns"!

### Magnificent Ski Resorts: Genoa and Mount Rose

"Freedom" is abundant in Nevada. Because of freedom, Nevadans do not feel lonely because of the desolation. On the way from Virginia City back to Reno, I also visited the "Sky Tavern" for "skiing." Skiing is a crazy hobby for Nevadans. From November in the solar calendar to May of the following year, they often use skiing to embellish their carefree days!

The car turned back and forth on countless mountain slopes before climbing to "Sky Tavern." There, there was excellent skiing equipment, restaurants, music, and countless cars parked. I learned to ski in Switzerland two years ago when I was on a winter tour. This time, watching the Americans play, it seemed even newer and more courageous. A young American girl said: The whole state of Nevada is a good place for skiing. There are even more magnificent slopes at the "Genoa" and Mount Rose ski resorts.

Genoa is in the southwest corner of Nevada, a city that started with skiing. The ski resort is one mile long and one thousand feet high. The annual Nevada and California state ski competition is scheduled to be held on February 23rd and 24th in Genoa. Mount Rose is closer to Reno, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe. There, there is a three-mile-long ski resort with a vertical drop of two thousand five hundred feet. Standing in the distance, the scene is really magnificent. Every year, the University of Nevada and Western College hold intercollegiate ski competitions here.

I didn't make it in time for the competition days. It is said that each competition attracts thousands of spectators from afar. The facilities at Genoa and Mount Rose were built by the same owner. His ski advertising says: Near the ski resort, there are high-end hotels, music academies, bars, and top-notch restaurants. "If guests notify us one day in advance, the restaurant can handle Chinese lunch or dinner for a thousand people"!

Riding, Hunting, Swimming: A Tourist Paradise

Highly developed material civilization has broken the desolation and loneliness. After winter is over, the seasons for spring riding and hunting, and summer swimming, are even more intoxicating. There are two lakes near Reno, Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake. Although they are saltwater, they both have a blue color. Summer on Lake Tahoe is a tourist paradise and a place where romance is created. There are elegant hotels, gardens, forests, and swimming pools. Because I was on a winter tour, I couldn't see the lively scenery. Winter at Pyramid Lake is even more desolate. There are towering, independent rocks in the lake, like Egyptian pyramids.

Gambling and Divorce: Unconventional Life

Nevadans have a famous saying: "There is no conventional life in Nevada." In China, we call it "carefree." Foreigners who come to Reno are either here for divorce or for gambling. (Note: See previous correspondence in this newspaper regarding gambling and divorce.) Gambling and divorce themselves are carefree and unconventional. Nevadans also say: "The day you leave, you have to pay taxes." The basic principle of Nevada law is "tax freedom"; many people transfer funds to Nevada to avoid taxes, which is one of the reasons. In addition, Nevada also has good weather with four distinct seasons. Sunny days account for 78 percent of the year. Therefore, newcomers may find it a little dry, but Nevadans say: Although it is dry, it is invigorating, giving a feeling of vigorous vitality!

The City in the Ridge: Las Vegas

The largest city in Nevada is Reno, followed by "Las Vegas" (second divorce). In recent years, many divorce businesses in several southern states of the United States, and even in Los Angeles and Hollywood, have been snatched by Las Vegas. The highway from Reno to Las Vegas runs through the mountains, and many people take special flights, which cost only twenty-two dollars and fifty cents.

I didn't go to Las Vegas, but I took a trip around several cities in western Nevada. Comparatively speaking, Reno is the most lively. Reno has two newspapers and two weekly publications, half Republican and half Democratic. The Republican Party has a deeper local base in Nevada, and that is because of the legacy of President Lincoln's era. During the Roosevelt era, the Democratic Party also developed more than before in Nevada.

Overseas Chinese Doctor: Nevada Overseas Chinese Leader

The University of Nevada is located in the suburbs of Reno and is known for its mining and metallurgy engineering. It is said that there are two Chinese students studying here, but I did not meet them. The number of overseas Chinese in Nevada is extremely small. An elderly overseas Chinese, Mr. Guan, practices medicine in Reno. He used to be the president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in San Francisco and is now the leader of the overseas Chinese in Nevada. He has not returned to China for more than thirty years. A long time ago, he studied at the Imperial University of Peking and read the Shanghai Shen Bao at that time. Mr. Guan took me to visit the life of the overseas Chinese. There is a gambling hall called "New Star," which is run by a group of overseas Chinese. I saw dozens of black men and women gambling there. The large gambling dens run by white people absolutely do not allow black people and Red Indians to gamble, so this business fell to the overseas Chinese.

The overseas Chinese also have a Chinese Association. Near the association, there used to be a small "Chinatown," but later it became dilapidated due to road repairs. Mr. Guan also took me to see many museums and playgrounds, which all displayed the battles against the Red Indians. Americans will not forget how they defeated the Red Indians, perhaps just as we all know that "the Yellow Emperor defeated Chi You at Zhuolu."

Not Much Production: Mineral Deposits Are Almost Exhausted

Nevada has two major banks: "First National Bank" and "Commercial Bank." This province with 150,000 people does not produce much. Minerals and timber are two major commodities. Now, there are few mineral deposits left. There is no agricultural production on the desert-like soil. Most of the grain is transported from other provinces. However, banks in Nevada still have business to do. Nevada has plenty of investment!

Americans call Nevada the "Desert Empire." In fact, Nevada is not like the Gobi Desert or the Sahara Desert. Nevada is a corner of the Rocky Mountains, 4,500 feet above sea level. Except for a few man-made cities, the wilderness of Nevada is full of bare mountains, messy grass, and desolate hills. You can't see anyone for dozens of miles.

Federal autonomy has created a carefree and deformed society in Nevada. Nevada needs this "carefree" atmosphere to attract tourists from all directions!

### Good News from Guangxi Transportation

— Guilin, August 8 (Airmail from our reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

Recently, what makes people feel happy is the smooth flow of one railway after another, and the construction of one section of weaving road after another. After the opening of the Guilin-Liuzhou section, the opening of the Liuzhou-Y宜section followed, and then the Guilin-Hengyang section was being rebuilt. The construction of Liuzhou-Zhanjiang (Zhanjiang), a bunch of good news about transportation, is like a severely injured person has completely connected the blood vessels, plus a dose of penicillin, and in a little over a year, Guangxi will be a bright sight again. Yuan Menghong, director of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway Bureau, has been repeatedly commended for his hard work. His spirit of hard work is indeed more touching than the Communist Party's labor story about Wu Manyou, and it will become a story of knocking out a railway bridge.

Regarding the article "Questioning the Fees for Repairing Water Pipes" submitted by reader Wang Sheng Song a few days ago: We have received a letter from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau stating: "After transferring the matter to the French Concession Tramway and Electric Light Company for investigation, it has been reported that: 'Our company previously received a notification from the Fa Yuan (transliterated name) Exchange on Ningbo Road, stating that the water pressure in the alley was insufficient. After our company inspected the water pipes outside the water meter, we found that there was indeed a leak, which was repaired on February 18. Since this project was outside the water meter, it should be the responsibility of our company, so it was repaired free of charge and no bill was issued. Furthermore, after investigation, our personnel did not collect any fees from the residents of the alley, whether before or during the project. It seems that our company's employees all have identification cards and badges, and the so-called fees are never collected from residents by our company, but should be paid to our company's collection office. '," please publish this." We hereby publish it as requested.

Advertisements with Head Sores Impede City Appearance

Dear Editor:

It has been found that the walls of streets and alleys in the central district of the city are covered with advertisements for slippery flower and willow doctors who treat head sores, gonorrhea, leucorrhea, and other diseases. This not only hinders the appearance of the city but also deceives patients. It is hoped that the health police authorities will strictly prohibit this in order to beautify the city and prevent fraud (Jiang Huairen).

Dangerous Buildings Being Repaired

A certain reader of this newspaper pointed out the dangerous buildings at 1411-1449 and 1667-1673 Yangshupu Road. After publication, we received a letter from the secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau stating that the bureau had issued dangerous notices separately, ordering the owners of the houses to repair them quickly.

Weekly Forum

### On Currency Management and a Proposal to Issue "Price Index Treasury Bonds" (Middle)

— Li Chonghuai

(3) Regarding the Development of Trade: The government raises exchange rates. Its purpose is to stimulate increased production of exportable goods. However, in just a few days, the price of tung oil has surged past the 400,000 mark, and other export prices are also experiencing slight increases. It is doubtful how much encouragement the export industry is truly receiving as everything rises with the tide. Conversely, other production industries, especially those ordering production equipment or raw materials from abroad, are complaining bitterly. The impact on production recovery and increased production is significant, not to be underestimated. The prices of imported goods are doubling daily. With the prices of import and export commodities rising rapidly, the psychology of the people, who are always sensitive, will inevitably lead to a corresponding increase in other prices. Because the government's increased issuance of currency cannot be managed, the effectiveness of raising exchange rates will soon be negated.

(4) Regarding Commodity Prices, Wages, and the Supply of Daily Necessities: Before currency can be managed, strict price controls are impossible. As mentioned earlier, the people must have an outlet for the money they hold. Besides daily consumption, the people's minimum requirement is to preserve the value of their savings. Bank interest rates are too low, and production investment yields low profits with high risks. Therefore, people resort to lending at high interest rates or hoarding goods. The surface price can be fixed through political controls, but the black market cannot be eliminated, and the quality of goods under price controls will inevitably deteriorate. The government cannot force people to buy what they don't want, and when people want to buy something, restricting them will only force them to find ways to buy it. This is driven by the people's economic instincts. Therefore, even in advanced countries like England and the United States, black markets exist, let alone in our country where the people's education level and law-abiding spirit are so backward. Unified control of the supply of goods is also a factor that drives up prices. Because the government's unified procurement of goods is necessarily large-scale, any significant demand will have a significant impact on the market. The result is that the government is, in effect, replacing the people as the master of hoarding!

7 The Emergence of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"

In summary, political and rigid, multi-pronged controls are not as effective as simple economic maneuvers. These simple economic maneuvers are to find an outlet for the people's surplus purchasing power, which is the best way to manage currency.

Since the gold policy has lost its support (it lost support from the gold supply rather than theoretical support), and public bonds cannot be issued through normal means, it is necessary to find other instruments. These instruments should have two key characteristics: (1) They should have the characteristic of maintaining savings value, which is sufficient to guide the people's surplus purchasing power; (2) They should have sufficient exchange value, so that people can exchange them with the government at any time they need. Based on these two characteristics, I propose the issuance of a type of treasury bond based on a price index. The issuance methods of these bonds, the problem of determining the price index, the people's trust in these bonds, the issue of principal and interest repayment, the functions of these bonds, and the effects and influences they will have are discussed separately below:

8 Issuance Methods of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"

These bonds can be issued in three denominations: A, B, and C, all without face value. On the initial issuance date, these three types of treasury bonds can be listed at 100,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and 10 million yuan, respectively. After that, the listing price will be adjusted weekly according to the price index. When the price index increases, the listing price will be calculated proportionally according to the rate of increase in the price index. If the price index in the current week is equal to the price index in the previous week, or if the rate of increase is less than 6% per annum, then the listing price for the current week will be calculated by adding 6% per annum to the listing price of the previous week, with the intention of protecting the interests of the people. During periods of rising prices, people can secure their savings. When prices are stable, people can also receive interest. At that time, the bonds will be equivalent to public bonds with an annual interest rate of 6%.

The buying and selling prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are generally the same. However, when necessary, the government may slightly lower the selling price or slightly raise the buying price. In any case, the buying price should not be lower than the listing price calculated according to the price index. In any case, the buying and selling prices throughout the country should also be consistent.

The issuance and sale of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should be fully handled by the Central Bank, entrusted by the government. The Central Bank should also entrust other national banks to handle the sales, in order to increase its power to absorb currency. The listing prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" bought and sold by each national bank should be the same as the Central Bank's listing price. The Central Bank may pay a handling fee of a certain percentage or deposit a certain percentage of the cash sold with the bank for business loans. However, the daily net sales and purchases of national banks must be reported to the Central Bank at the end of each business day. National banks themselves are not allowed to purchase treasury bonds, because their funds should be used for production businesses and other national policy loans. At the beginning of issuance, commercial banks and money shops should allocate 20% of their deposit amount to purchase these bonds. Thereafter, they should maintain at least 20% of their balance as treasury bonds. Those who voluntarily increase their holdings are welcome. In fact, banks and money shops will be happy to invest more in "Price Index Treasury Bonds" because they not only offer high interest rates, but also maintain the value of their assets, preventing them from depreciating with the currency. The deposit reserve of commercial banks and money shops in the Central Bank can be calculated by deducting the amount invested in treasury bonds.

"Price Index Treasury Bonds" can be divided into registered or unregistered types, at the purchaser's choice. These bonds can be fully cashed at any time at the local national bank at the current listing price, but cannot be used as collateral for loans from national banks, because the actual interest on treasury bonds is high, while the interest on loans from national banks is low, which may lead to arbitrage by unscrupulous merchants.

The treasury bonds issued in various regions should be stamped with the name of the issuing location. For example, those issued in Shanghai should be stamped with "Issued in Shanghai," and those issued in Hankou should be stamped with "Issued in Hankou." Treasury bonds can be cashed in different locations. However, when cashing, the remittance fee that should be paid between the original issuing location and the cashing location should be deducted, in order to prevent merchants from evading remittance restrictions.

The issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" can also be used to recover gold. Because using legal currency to recover gold puts too much burden on the government, especially at this time, it can exacerbate the crisis of currency inflation. Using these bonds to pay instead of legal currency will have the effect of recovering gold without the drawbacks of issuing currency.

9 How to Determine the Price Index on Which the Issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is Based

I believe that the determination of this price index should be based on the following points:

(1) The selection of goods and weighting methods should be based on the daily consumption of middle-class families. Otherwise, the content should be as broad as possible. The price index should not be too low, as it would not be sufficient to attract people to invest. Nor should it be too high, as it might stimulate the rise of other prices. In short, the price index should be able to represent the general price level. With a benchmark for calculating the listing price of national treasury bonds, it will not cause speculative frenzies like gold. The detailed calculation method can be agreed upon separately by statisticians, but the calculation method adopted by the government should be announced.

(2) The price index should be unified throughout the country. In other words, the listing prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should not differ in different regions. Because if there are differences, it will inevitably lead to abnormal flows of funds and speculative arbitrage, as was the case in the past with the gold market. Because the price index should be uniform, it cannot be based on one location. Therefore, the price index should be calculated from the average of prices in many locations. The base period number is also the same. As for when to use as the base period, the relationship is very subtle. Using the prices in various locations from January to June of the 26th year as the base number is acceptable. Using the price index on the issuance date of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" as the base number is also acceptable. Because the listing price of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is determined by comparing two periods. The locations included in the calculation of the price index may be Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin (or Beiping), Shenyang (or Changchun), Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Changsha, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Xikang, and other places.

(3) The price index should be calculated once a week. The Central Bank in various locations (or the Four Banks Joint Office can handle it. Locations without a Central Bank or a branch of the Four Banks Joint Office can be handled by other national banks) should telegraph the average price of the specified goods within a week to the Shanghai head office every Friday. The head office will collect the data and calculate the price index for the current week and the listing price of treasury bonds according to the announced calculation method. At the latest, it should telegraph the results to the Central Bank and other selling banks in various locations on Sunday. Selling banks in various locations should announce the listing price of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" on the morning of Monday and simultaneously announce the content of this price index in local newspapers.

The publication of the above price index is two days away from the actual price reports. This time difference may cause buyers to lose slightly when prices continue to rise, but it is very limited compared to the actual interest. Because telegrams to and from various locations take time, a difference of two days cannot be reduced further. The reason I chose Friday to Monday is that much of the time from Saturday afternoon to Sunday is non-trading time, so in fact it is only one day apart. For those who hold treasury bonds for several weeks or months, this difference is almost equal to zero.

10 The Problem of People's Trust in "Price Index Treasury Bonds"

The issuance methods and calculation standards of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are as described above. However, the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" does not have physical collateral and is based on the government's credit. However, the current government has repeatedly broken faith with the people. Since the people cannot trust the government, it is doubtful whether these bonds can be successfully promoted to fulfill their mission of absorbing currency.

From an economic point of view, even if the people are skeptical about the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds," the bonds can still be issued and will certainly achieve considerable results. I pointed out earlier that "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should have two characteristics: maintaining savings value and being able to be exchanged with the government at any time. As long as the government can absolutely maintain these two points, excellent results can be achieved, and these two points are not difficult to maintain. US dollar bonds and securities guaranteed by US dollars, and deposits backed by gold are different from this type of treasury bond. Because US dollars and gold themselves have external exchange value, and are absolutely subject to "quantity" restrictions, the government is unwilling to easily sacrifice this property, thus discounting its credit with the people. The repayment of treasury bonds is based on the government's income, but in fact it is legal currency. As far as the government is concerned, as long as the additional legal currency issued during repayment does not cause much harm to the overall economy, additional issuance is not a problem (see the discussion later in this article). As far as the people are concerned, as long as the government preserves their savings value unchanged during this period of rising prices, what more could they ask for? The so-called unchanging savings value, concretely speaking, is that if the money people spend when buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is enough to buy one dan of rice, half a year later (or anytime, anywhere), the legal currency they exchange from the bonds can still buy one dan of rice. This type of saving is better than hoarding real objects. Because hoarding real objects is not necessarily what you need at any time. If you buy five dan of rice this year, you may not finish eating it within a year. If you need clothing at the end of the year, exchanging rice for clothing is not so direct and convenient. Buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is also better than depositing money in banks and money shops. If the people do not trust the government, their level of distrust will definitely not be stronger than depositing money in money shops and lending at high interest rates. People nervously deposit money in money shops or lend it to individuals, why? Isn't it to hope to get some high interest to compensate for the savings losses during the period of rising prices? But the interest on "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is higher than depositing in any bank or money shop. The reason is very simple, because during periods of rising prices, the rate of price increase (which is also equal to the interest on "Price Index Treasury Bonds") is always higher than commercial interest. Because borrowing interest is the most important cost of commerce, merchants must make a profit higher than the cost in order to maintain themselves. If the profit from sales is not enough to pay the borrowing interest, there are three ways to follow: (1) When the supply of goods is less than demand, merchants will raise prices; (2) When the supply of goods exceeds demand, merchants will wait until interest rates are lowered before borrowing; (3) Circulation is not smooth and they are on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, in any case, the price increase will inevitably be higher than the loan interest rate of banks and money shops, and naturally even higher than the deposit interest rate of banks and money shops. The previous article pointed out that the wholesale price in January of this year was about seven times higher than the same period last year, an average increase of about 56% per month, while the loan interest rate of money shops was about 20%, and the deposit interest rate was about 12%, which is enough to prove this point. Since the interest from buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is higher than depositing money in banks and money shops, and is more reliable, people will definitely invest their money in this. Furthermore, banks and money shops will probably also regard "Price Index Treasury Bonds" as a major investment target, because its interest rate is higher than the loan interest rate of banks and money shops, and it is more reliable than credit loans. What is even more beneficial to banks and money shops is that they do not need to hunt for their loan customers and can enjoy the profits while sitting still, and can increase their investment in treasury bonds or convert them into cash at any time and anywhere according to the size of their own position. Most of the capital in our country is the surplus purchasing power of the people and the speculative credit of banks and money shops. Therefore, the issuance of treasury bonds will rapidly contract these surplus purchasing power and commercial speculative credit. Where there is profit, gold and stone can be opened. The sales of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are not a problem.

In order to enhance social trust in the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds," I would like to respectfully propose that the issuance of these bonds should be implemented after being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and the Political Council by the administrative authorities, in order to gain the support of public opinion and the people, and its effect will be obvious.

11 The Issue of Principal and Interest Repayment of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"

This will probably be the most concerning issue for the authorities and the general public, and they want to get the answer. On the surface, the problem of principal and interest repayment that we face will be more serious than any other debt. When prices are stable, the interest we pay is only 6% per annum. It is not a large sum. However, when prices rise, although no interest is added on the surface, the interest actually paid is higher than the general interest, as seen in the previous discussion. How will the government bear such interest?

In fact, this problem is not as serious as imagined. First of all, we should recognize the three characteristics of "Price Index Treasury Bonds": First, the interest and principal of these treasury bonds are not calculated separately. Their principal and interest are always linked together. Therefore, the calculation is not as difficult as other debts. Second, the repayment period of these treasury bonds is not specified. Their issuance is adjusted at any time according to market needs. The government can also decide when to recover them all according to the situation, without restriction. Third, the buying and selling prices at any time are in principle equal. The government sells and buys at any time and anywhere. Therefore, the debt problem that we should discuss focuses on the surplus or deficit of receipts and payments at any time.

The situation of the surplus or deficit of receipts and payments at any time can be roughly divided into four types:

(1) Only selling, no buying. This is the situation at the beginning of issuance. Only "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are released to collect currency. There is no problem of repayment, so there is no need to discuss it.

(2) Issuance is in progress, and the total amount of treasury bonds sold exceeds the total amount bought. This is probably a phenomenon that should occur when prices continue to rise, because people want to maintain the value of their savings. In this case, the government continues to collect currency, with only gains and no burdens, so there is no need to discuss it.

### Bridging Sino-French Culture: The Diderot Prize

— Xu Zhongnian

In the intellectual circles of China today, I'm afraid very few people know about the "Diderot Prize," and even fewer know about its importance. Therefore, I am writing a brief introduction today, hoping that intellectuals will pay special attention.

Let's start with some clarification: The prize is named after "Diderot." Who is "Diderot?" Denis Diderot (1713-1784) was a French philosopher. From 1751 to 1772, for 21 years, he and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783) jointly edited and published the "Encyclopédie," a monumental work of the 18th century and a global one. Every country has an "encyclopedia," and there is more than one in France. So, why does this 18th-century French "Encyclopédie" enjoy such renown? Because of the following two main reasons.

First, because the authors of this encyclopedia were not only experts in various disciplines, but also masters. For example, Voltaire (1694-1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), Montesquieu (1689-1755), Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727-1781)... If even one of these people was willing to write, it would be dazzling, let alone when they collaborated and jointly organized this grand event?

Second, and more importantly, this encyclopedia implicitly contains a spirit that has greatly influenced modern culture, which people call the "Encyclopédie spirit." What is this spirit? It's simple to say, but difficult to create and even more difficult to implement: (1) the pursuit of knowledge; (2) the pursuit of truth; (3) freedom of thought. These three stages are connected: in order to seek "knowledge," we seek "truth"—"knowledge" that is not "true" is not true knowledge—but if thought is not "free," there is no way to obtain "truth." The "Encyclopédie" itself fully expresses freedom of thought: because from an ideological standpoint, Voltaire and Rousseau—these two giants in the philosophical world—were enemies!

The goal and effort of the "Diderot Prize" is to promote this spirit of "pursuit of knowledge," "pursuit of truth," and "freedom of thought."

In 1936, a famous female novelist, Madame Alexandra Roube-Jansky, after obtaining sponsorship from Mr. Li Shizeng of China, established this prize. Her method was as follows: With the assistance of the French government, two journalists from China and France would be exchanged each year (recent changes, see below), with first-class travel and all expenses during their visit to the other country, lasting for six months, all covered by the government. All impressions of the visiting journalists can be written "freely," and the Prize Committee is responsible for introducing and publishing the articles. The selection of journalists is determined by the Prize Judging Committee (Jury), which is co-organized by Chinese and French people.

In 1936, a young French journalist won the prize and came to China, but no Chinese went out. Why? I don't know.

In 1937, another young French journalist won the prize and came to China, but again no Chinese went out. Why? I don't know.

Thereafter, due to the war, the prize was temporarily suspended.

Finally, the Prize Judging Committee was reorganized. From 1947, the organization of the committee is as follows: Chairman: Paul-Boncour (former French Prime Minister); Members: Madame Andre Viollis, a famous writer, Roland Dorgeles, Francis Carco, Pierre Marc Orlan, Georges Huysmany, General Cornigllon-Moilnier, Gerard Bauer, Pierre Descaves, Tooy-Revillon, Georges Charensol, and two representatives from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In view of the fact that too few Chinese journalists understand French, in the future, the Chinese side will not be limited to journalists, but will be based on writers who are proficient in French.

Recently, Madame Roube-Jansky came to China for the third time to plan the restoration of the "Diderot Prize."

If the Chinese government provides sponsorship and the intellectual circles show sympathy, a Chinese writer can be sent to France and a French journalist can be sent to China in 1947. (36, 3, 15.)

City Gate

You are the strangest guest to someone who is used to living in a metropolis.

Every day, you stand at the edge of the city street, watching all the people coming and going; you are used to hearing those sweet words of love and sharp curses; you will not be moved at all, letting the years erode your already terrifying face. How is it that in this era when the world is dressed up so beautifully, you don't even comb your disheveled hair?

Poets place you in poems chanting about the border, painters arrange you in the cold scenery of the setting sun in a border town. It seems that your pitiful fate can only be accompanied by desolation and loneliness forever.

But there is one thing you deserve to be proud of, even in this remote small town? When those people from the countryside, carrying baskets of goods and full of joy, come to the market and pass under your ribs, they are so intimate with you. They squat in front of your knees in groups, telling each other their most concerned thoughts. At that time, you are the most proud hero in this small county.

Living on a piece of land with a trace of warmth in the world, you are not lonely after all.

Warmth

A series of joys escaped from my palm to the sky, and then stopped at the treetop. This, I am symbolizing the wonderful fantasy in this world with pigeon bells.

White wings, red beak tips, although a speck soaring in the white clouds, in the eyes of a laborer meditating by the water and a young woman leaning on the building looking into the distance, this is somewhat the most heartwarming sustenance in the world. Please take the most beautiful and moving words in the world and bring them to those distant soldiers across mountains and rivers!

It is above the Yellow River; it is on the bank of the Yangtze River; it is between the black waters and white mountains; it is on top of skyscrapers; it is in the trap of the cave of suffering and persecution. Everyone looks up at the white clouds in the sky and entrusts a series of hopes to the illusory loneliness. You have pierced this lonely sky with your loud singing, and also pierced the cold hearts of everyone.

Is it that there is too little sympathy given in the world, or is it that those cruel people have smeared pain in the world, but in this remote small town, I have never heard this light-hearted bell.

Village Musings

One spring evening, I walked slowly alone on a narrow path beside the mountain, looking at those plank houses that squatted on the ground like tired oxen in silence, and my heart was filled with a sense of emptiness.

The stream flows murmuringly, but there is not even a washerwoman?

Everything shows so quiet, I seem to be standing on a deserted island counting the shells by the water; who will recognize the series of years that have swept across this land? I feel sad; but at that time, I suddenly heard the laughter of children, as if it came from the planks of the neighbor's door. When I turned my head to look for it, I was greeted by a wave of empty thoughts.

On the way home, I thought like this, no matter when or where, there are people singing lyrical songs, but because laughter makes you shed tears, then, you will realize that where there is joy is also where sorrow is thickest.

My heart is heavy; because I have unintentionally discovered a secret of the world.

### The Joy of Pain

— Lin Cheng

A painful ideal seems to lie at tomorrow's doorstep, yet feels so distant...

Is it the recollection of vanished past years? Or the lingering attachment to discarded love? Or perhaps the continued longing for the arduous journey through hardship?

Those painful emotions accumulated deep within the heart have grown faint through the experiences of life. How many tears have been shed, allowing them to melt away, to vanish beyond the river of memory.

I must not allow past emotions to imprison me, nor let past experiences lure me back. I should establish a foundation of faith in life from the understanding of pain, transforming every painful encounter into strength within my life. I know the road ahead will be even more difficult and the pain will surely increase.

Some say there is no joy without pain, but I have indeed forgotten the pain of the past. If there is still a trace lingering in my heart, it is merely the joy of liberation after a long period of imprisonment. I cannot help but feel joyful for the revival of a suffocated and paralyzed spirit resulting from pain, for the re-ignition of this proud and resilient life intent!

To extract one's emotions from the abyss of pain is like a seed sprouting from frozen soil. From then on, life begins to have new hope and encouragement, but from then on, life will also suffer more devastation and trials. Therefore, I must more clearly open my eyes to survey this vast world, arranging my life in reality to embrace more pain!

Like trampled weeds, growing and spreading tirelessly, yet without excessive dreams that would deplete the wellspring of life, because from reality to the future, there should be a painful journey, and tomorrow's footsteps will never reach the far-off joy!

When Principal Xiong announced that Mr. Wan Jiabao would attend our first literary evening and agreed to lecture on "The American Modern Theatre Scene," a stir of excitement rippled through the audience, and everyone eagerly awaited the arrival of 7:00 PM on the evening of March 9th.

After the audience for "Liang Shang Jun Zi" (a play title) gradually dispersed, everyone began to decorate the venue for the literary evening. The comrades in charge of the lighting made the entire venue as bright as snow with spotlights and cast a halo on the stage.

Many drama-loving students from the law school and Guanghua University, hearing the news, rushed to participate, becoming uninvited guests.

Mr. Wan Jiabao arrived amidst thunderous applause. His refined and frail appearance reminded people of a delicate Chinese scholar. He was dressed in a long gray cotton robe, with the sleeves of his cotton-padded jacket extending an inch longer than the robe. His soft hair was parted naturally on the left side, and he wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses that flashed with sharp and insightful eyes, making people feel the depth of his penetration. A purple-red scarf around his neck gave you an impression of unpretentious and unrestrained elegance.

He taught with passion, often forgetting the end of class. He said he lacked concentration himself, but in fact, perhaps because his thinking was too focused, he never paid attention to the end-of-class bell. When he taught, he usually did not look at the audience, as if deliberately avoiding your gaze, sometimes stroking his temples, revealing a shy expression.

When Mr. Xiong mentioned that he wanted the students who were not taking Mr. Wan's class to admire Mr. Wan's demeanor, it elicited loud laughter. Mr. Xiong said that even he himself, among the current Chinese playwrights, none could match Mr. Wan's achievements, and praised his serious creative attitude: his works, once published, were sure to be astonishing.

Mr. Wan nodded to the applauding audience, indicating his acknowledgement. He began by saying: "I dare not accept Mr. Xiong's praise." Then he said: "It's true that I write slowly, but I'm deeply ashamed that I haven't achieved 'seriousness' yet." Moreover, he modestly admitted that he lacked concentration.

Returning to the main topic, he discussed the American theater scene, with the following key points: (1) He said that the claim that American drama is completely commercialized is not entirely fair based on his actual observations. There are many progressive writers in the United States, and progressive plays also have the opportunity to be staged. Generally, the performances are above par, and the wealthy bosses who invest money do not pay much attention to the content of the plays. (2) There are not many places where American drama can really make money. The main one relies on the "Public Theatre," which has one million members, somewhat like the ticket offices of Chinese Peking Opera. It provides directors, theaters, and actors, not only cultivating the public's interest in watching plays, but also training many new talents, becoming an important pillar of the American theatre scene. (3) There are two types of American professional playwrights: one is passively not acknowledging Hollywood drama, and they believe that they are currently working in Hollywood just to "strike gold." Once their pockets are full, they will write "what they want to write"; the other is an active public educator, they expose mercilessly and enlighten correctly, represented by Wilder. (4) He believes that even though some American writers have incorrect ideologies, their skill in catering to preferences and the thoroughness of their observations are beyond the reach of Chinese playwrights. (5) The United States is currently promoting a "repertory theater" system to correct the flaw of a play being performed for several years—it prevents newcomers from advancing and makes professional plays a commodity. After this theater system is established, it can select some good plays to perform. Last year, these theaters staged plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen, and Barrie.

He ended his speech, and the students responded with warm applause. The entertainment program began, and everyone heard the bedtime bell ringing loudly only when coffee was served. After the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, they were still pondering Mr. Wan's lecture.

### On Poetry

— Jie Ren

If the artistic conception is vague and the archetype is illusory, then the soul and essence of poetry are invisibly lost. Great poems in the world originate from a simple and pure central idea, forming the most powerful story, while being precisely and concretely expressed. And a poem's manifestation should be like a giant standing tall and the vastness of a sea, allowing people to grasp, appreciate, even the shortest poem of one or two lines should possess a complete individual entity.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 198

— Ye Jingfeng

"What a pity..." At this moment, I touched upon another thought; perhaps it was that the secret of "eight" had not yet been satisfactorily answered, and I really wanted to find out the truth from Pingzi's mouth. With this thought, I blurted out the words "What a pity," meaning "It's a pity that I can't ask Pingzi in person; as long as she is willing to be frank and open."

"What?" Mr. W asked me, meaning "What a pity?"

I told Mr. W the idea I had. In my tone, I implied that Tsurumi and Pingzi might be discussing this issue, but unfortunately, I couldn't hear it.

"What a pity!" Mr. W also let out a sigh; "Tsurumi is our friend, he is working and struggling in a position that is ten times more difficult than ours. Respect is unnecessary to say; we should do our best to provide him with convenience, convenience in his work, and we should absolutely not stimulate his emotions; we should encourage him both in person and behind his back, and we should not give him even a trace of blow, whether in words or actions. Otherwise..."

Mr. W paused here. I understood the first part of his words very well, but although I understood the latter two sentences, I did not understand the meaning of his intention. Why did he say these two sentences? Why was there this final turn, "Otherwise..."?

"Otherwise..." I wanted to ask Mr. W to continue. But at the same time, I suddenly had an inspiration and understood Mr. W's intention—"Otherwise, just flip a switch, and we can hear what they are saying"—and nodded knowingly, "I understand... But it doesn't matter. I can do this, I just don't know if it's convenient to use this device now." This "device" refers to the "listening device." By turning on the electric hammer of this device, we can hear the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi.

"If it's convenient, there's no problem... But..." Mr. W frowned, as if he had some unspeakable pain, and there was also some unwillingness in his determination.

I knew that Mr. W didn't want to eavesdrop on the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi because he was afraid of hurting Tsurumi's feelings, fearing that he would be hurt after he learned about it. But I didn't care. Tsurumi and I, we know everything and say everything endlessly. He will tell me about his conversation with Pingzi anyway. Even if he is unwilling to explain it automatically, I can ask him until the seas run dry and the rivers run dry. Mr. W and Tsurumi are separated by a layer after all. So I decided to do it myself.

Because of my stay in Mr. W's house these past few days, I have become familiar with most of the equipment. Only this "listening" item, because I have never seen them use it, I still can't find where the sound transmitter is, how to turn it on, and I don't know where the electric hammer is.

On a personal level, although I can afford to listen to the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi, after deciding on this thought and before actually implementing it, in this moment of distance, a inexplicable "?" symbol also appeared in my conscience.

The work of spies and detectives is generally most unwelcome, and even hated, by a certain section of society: they hate them for liking to pry into other people's secrets or "secrets." According to a certain "moral" of the gentleman's sect, this kind of behavior seems to lack some glory. At this moment, I suddenly had an inexplicable question, probably because this traditional concept of "gentleman" was at work. But thinking back, "Why do I want to take on this kind of work? Isn't it for the sake of the country and for the sake of saving humanity from tragedy that I am willing to risk my life to do this work? With such a stance, my mind should be very frank; with this frank mind, why bother sacrificing this hypocritical 'gentleman's concept'?"

### Regarding the Recent Situation of "The Commercial Press"—And a Report of Good News

— Hei Xing

The magazines of "The Commercial Press" were indeed "popular" before the war. Whether it was the selection of materials or the content, they were indeed up to par, and the only one that has survived and is still published is "The Eastern Miscellany." In order to know their future publishing plans, I made a special trip to their head office on Henan Road, and in the promotion department and publishing department, I obtained the following pieces of news that are worth making people happy.

They are actively restoring the lineup of all past magazines. For example, "Children's Magazine," their "New Children's World" has decided to be re-published on Children's Day, April 4th, and the chief editor is Mr. Shen Baiying.

And "The Short Story Magazine," which used to be famous in the literary world, has now decided to be renamed "Literary Magazine," edited by Mr. Zhu Guangqian, and the first issue of the re-publication will be published in May.

In addition, there is a "Xueyuan Monthly," which is published by the Xueyuan Society and can also be published in mid-May, and "Education Magazine" is also actively restoring its publication.

This should be a great piece of good news for the Shanghai publishing world, which has suffered so much! We hope that "The Commercial Press" can make full use of their existing resources and financial resources to publish several books of academic value for the Chinese publishing world; because whether it is science, literature, or education, the current situation is so barren and so desolate!

According to a person in charge of the promotion department, their "New Middle School Library" is prepared to be published in three, four, and five months. The first issue in March has been published, and they plan to publish on schedule in the future. Before all the books are published, they do not intend to sell them piecemeal. The entire book has a total of 463 volumes, and the pre-order price is 2,336,180 yuan.

I once asked about the recent situation of their Zhabei printing factory and the Oriental Library. It is said that the Oriental Library has now been razed to the ground, and there is no trace of such a magnificent building ever existing there in the past. As for the printing factory, it still retains a part, and they are negotiating for the agency occupying it to relocate.

The Reconstruction Committee of the Oriental Library has been working continuously, and they hope that one day, they will be able to rebuild this palace of learning on the original base that was destroyed by the war!

They have also submitted a request to the government, asking Japan to compensate for this almost irreparable loss, but until now, it seems that they have not been able to get a definite answer. (End)

### Wartime Tragedy of Incest—Reading Feng Zikai's Adventures on the Shu Road

— Xu

Mr. Feng Zikai's "Adventures on the Shu Road" in the second issue of the fourth volume of Wenyi Chunqiu painfully describes that the result of the evil war, in addition to the destruction of families, also has a side effect that makes people laugh and cry.

The fact is this: a middle-aged woman married a man surnamed Fan in her hometown and gave birth to a daughter named Lingjie. The evil war caused their family of three to flee from Jiaxing to Hengyang. In the air raid in Hengyang, her husband, Fan, was bombed to death, so she worked as a servant in Li Xia's house, and Fan Lingjie worked as a maid in the home of a certain regiment commander. In the great fire in Hengyang, Li Xia and his wife first went to Sichuan one after another, and Mrs. Fan followed. It was unknown that several months later, Mrs. Li died of illness. Following Mrs. Li's will, Mrs. Fan became Li Xia's stepmother. Furthermore, Lingjie followed the army to Jiangxi after the army was dispatched in Hengyang. Later, the regiment commander died in battle, and his wife took Fan Lingjie back to her hometown of Nanjing, which had fallen into enemy hands. She changed her occupation to work in a yarn factory. One day, she suddenly encountered two beast soldiers who intended to defile her. At this time, Li Xia's father (Old Li) was working as a Japanese translator and happened to encounter this incident. With the courage of a heroic and righteous person, he called her his daughter to resolve this tragic situation. It was unknown that after Fan Lingjie encountered this danger, she lamented her loneliness and deeply felt Old Li's heroism and righteousness, often giving Old Li gifts to express her gratitude. Later, she learned that Old Li was widowed and had the idea of entrusting herself to him for life. Soon after, she became Li Xia's stepmother. Later, Old Li responded to his son's call to Sichuan, and after meeting, it turned into a family relationship of father, son, mother, daughter, husband, and wife that made people laugh and cry!

"First, let's talk about Mrs. Fan: her husband is also her grandson, her father-in-law is also her son-in-law; her daughter is also her step-mother; now let's talk about Lingjie: her husband is also her grandfather; her former son is also her stepfather; her mother is also her daughter-in-law. Now, let's talk about Old Li: his son is also his father-in-law; his wife is also his granddaughter; his mother-in-law is also his daughter-in-law. Finally, let's talk about Li Xia: his wife is also his grandmother; his stepmother is also his daughter; his father is also his son-in-law."

What a tragic tragedy of incest!

### "Miraculous Skill"

— Lu Chou

I remember that before the war, when the Bai Jin Long cigarettes of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in my country were in their prime, foreign capitalist Wang Yizhe actually used doubled capital of 60 million to fight the national cigarette company head-on; not only did the "She's Still the Best" Hadrin beauty drawing appear everywhere in the advertisements, but also they spared no expense to give away Hadrin unconditionally; and they also bought a large number of Bai Jin Long cigarettes and secretly transported them to the market after they became moldy. As a result, Hadrin became the leader after Bai Jin Long. The national cigarette company stepped down in an instant.

Another example is Japan, this stubborn, patriotic nation with creative imitation, but in the business of typewriters, it has also been drained of an unknown amount of money by the Americans. The facts are even more thought-provoking. At first, the Japanese would rather die than buy things from other countries with their own money, but finally, under the good impression of the Americans' unconditional bonus to the Japanese record-breaking typists and the advertisement propaganda of the public competition of Japanese transcription typists without using typewriters, the purchasers of typewriters in Tokyo were shocked.

With the daily development of the news business, advertising techniques have also become increasingly ingenious, mysterious, and unpredictable. Especially in the United States, the most materialized capitalist country.

These capitalists once fought advertising lawsuits over the curvature and straightness of toothbrushes, and over whether the position of the car pedal was inside or outside. They didn't even care about advocating the functions of sleeping pills, and said that their wives originally refused to sleep with anyone, but now they don't refuse any strangers. As long as you have visited an advertising company, as long as you have accepted the love of a beautiful hostess, you can finally understand how "advertising" occupies the most important seat on the mat for the capitalists to help.

Advertising cooperates with philistine conspiracies, and advertising forms the lackeys and accomplices of capitalist society. The more capitalism reaches its peak, the more "amazing" and "astonishing" advertising techniques become.

Scientific Essay

### The Life of Fish

— Li Li

Moths, frogs, crabs, and snakes all love light. When they see light, they want to approach it. Moths are especially fierce, rushing towards the light, even burning their wings. If they can fly up, they still rush towards the fire. Frogs and crabs, when they see the light, first stand still, and then the frogs jump lightly, and the crabs crawl slowly. As for snakes, if you see the light, they will swim quickly, following the light.

Mandarin fish and other fish in the water also love light. In late spring and early summer, frogs croak loudly in the middle of the night, and we can carry a lamp along the water surface to catch them. When the frogs see the light, they don't jump or escape. The fish float and swim close to the water surface, and they don't escape either. Mandarin fish move in a twisting manner with the movement of the light.

Zoologists tell us that "fish don't have very good eyesight. In the water, they can only see a distance of two or three feet. Once they are out of the water, they are completely blind and can't see anything. At the same time, some deep-sea fish are completely blind even in the water because the environment is dark, and their eyesight gradually declines and gradually disappears."

Since fish don't have very strong eyesight, how do they guard against dangers within a considerable distance that their eyesight can't reach? The waves in the water cause them to be alert and run at high speed. When we are fishing, we often use long bamboo poles to knock on the water to cause large waves, and the fish start to run, so they rush into the net themselves. If you knock on the west side, they will escape to the east, and vice versa, if you knock on the east side, they will escape to the west. Sometimes, the fish have already run into the net. If you pull up the net too quickly, so that the water in the net you turn over becomes more turbulent, the fish will jump back out. Fishermen call this action of the fish "returning the net."

Fish always swim upstream in rapid currents. If they are weak and are spun around by the rapid currents and flow downstream, they will struggle hard after a while, turn around, and swim upstream. Why is this?

Because fish use their gill filaments to breathe, and when they breathe, they always open and close. Water enters from the mouth and flows out when the gill cover opens. If they swim with the current, the gill cover will be held together by the water, making it difficult to breathe. If they swim upstream, water enters from the mouth and then exits from the gills, and the above-mentioned difficulties will be completely avoided and there will be no suffering.

### Walking in the Void—The Burning of the Hardoon Family Temple

— Hulu

The Hardoon Temple Sacrifice is wonderfully unique, alas, the Aili Garden still exists, the wealthy old man did not take a penny with him when he died, and the inheritance is fiercely contested!

Who knows that the fire god Bodhisattva would deceive the Jewish merchant? It is pitiful to live and die as a wandering soul, and the temple is almost reduced to ashes!

Fish mostly like to live in groups. In the summer mornings, we often see groups of fish going out to swim. The large ones are in the back, the small ones are in the front, the large ones are on the surface, and the small ones are at the bottom. Even when they are frightened and escape, they still maintain this order and will not be chaotic.

Fish secrete slippery slime all over their bodies in order to reduce water resistance and also to escape easily from enemies. Eels and fins are especially smooth.

Fish mostly become spindle-shaped. When the sea rages, the head rushes forward, making it easy to break the water and reduce water resistance.

During the mating season, the males of fish near the coast chase the females, forming group swims that even stretch for several miles. This opportunity gives fishermen great convenience. Spreading their nets to catch fish, they will surely return with a full load.

### Art and Literature Circles

The Shanghai art community held its first tea party at 3:00 pm on March 16. More than 100 people attended, including Chu Wen, Zheng Wuchang, Zhang Yuguang, and Wu Qingxia. There were also various entertainments. The next preparatory people were determined to be Wang Yaguang, Xu Weinan, and others.

The "Literary Exchanges" column of the Tianjin Dagongbao had an article at the end of last month that reviewed "Wenyi Chunqiu," praising its rich content, exquisite printing, and lively arrangement, calling it the only spiritual food for literary youths in the Pingjin area.

The novelist SY is still teaching at Sichuan University in Chengdu. His recent work "Water Margin Biography" has been staged and has been well received. However, the author is dissatisfied with the original work and is rewriting it.

### Many Fires in Recent Days

— Qi Lou

Since the great fire on Wuding Road, the fire god seems to have fallen in love with Shanghai, and he is always reluctant to leave. If we use the writing style of a certain predecessor, then we are talking about "fire" changing our complexion, but the fire god is pressing us as his own, and he is deliberately having a "fiery" relationship with us.

Just as theorists find the cause and effect of all phenomena, we naturally have something to say about the many fires. The first is that the weather is too dry; the second is that there are too many flammable raw materials in the construction of houses, such as shantytowns; the third is that there are also big fires burning abroad, and we seem to have an excuse. Recently, someone discovered a fourth reason: hoarders hoarding large things.

For example, as reported in various newspapers, in the early morning of the 15th, a fire broke out on the fourth floor of the British-owned Yuanfang Foreign Firm warehouse on Sichuan Middle Road. The fourth floor was rented by Tongfeng Edible Oil and Grocery Store, so "once it caught fire, it could not be contained." As a result, in addition to all the edible oil and hemp and other items piled up in the store being burned, the medicinal materials piled up in another store were also burned to ashes. At this time, the fire god was still not satisfied and spread to the tobacco leaves piled up in a certain cigarette factory on the third floor.

Edible oil, hemp, medicinal materials, and tobacco leaves are all flammable things, and the arrival of the fire is really "well-founded." What is difficult to understand is that there was also a diesel oil storage on the second floor, but it "fortunately was not affected." If flammable things have the potential to cause a fire, then unless diesel oil suddenly turns into water, there is no reason to be spared.

Where should these flammable things be placed? Is it difficult to soak them all in water?

The title "Many Fires in Recent Days" was added to the front of the fire news quoted above by a certain newspaper. However, the weather in recent days has not been too dry. The places that burned are not shantytowns. And there has been no news of big fires burning abroad in the past few days. I think theorists will definitely appear in the near future, and they will come up with newer reasons.

### Siege City Season

— Qin Shouou

She nodded, but didn't immediately stand up and leave. After Xu Shaoming had entered the dining room, about a quarter of an hour passed before she walked in, accompanied by a burst of children's innocent laughter, this young mother whose heart had been greatly shaken. She held the two lively children, one on each side, with her hands. The one on the left was taller and a girl; the one on the right was about four or five years old and a boy.

This dining room in the Xu household, which had seemed disorganized and desolate due to the impact of the evacuation, immediately gained a sense of life with the entry of these two children.

Old Zhu also resumed his jocular and smiling demeanor, busying himself with arranging seats for the children, trying to make them laugh, and asking them their names.

"The older one is called Jifei, and the younger one is called Rong'er," Guan told him.

The meal was very enjoyable. Xu Shaoming was originally very particular about food, and the table was piled high with dishes, all of which were exquisite. He enthusiastically urged his guests to drink and eat, and Old Zhu accompanied him in drinking four cups of Moutai. Fei Fei and Rong'er ate a lot of food, but the young woman's response remained calm and somewhat wary, making Xu Shaoming feel apprehensive. Later, he stopped greeting her and just drank and joked with Old Zhu.

Seeing that he was four or five parts drunk, Old Zhu suddenly pretended to be very serious and said to him:

"Let me tell you, Lao Xu, Miss Jin has run off with Little Shen! They are now living in our theater troupe and want to leave with us."

The magic of these words was truly potent. Xu Fatty immediately put down his wine glass, his face full of smiles, revealing an eager and excited expression.

"Really?" He was still somewhat skeptical. "Little Shen treated Jin Aili too harshly; I expected that they would eventually fall out. Aili is an old friend of ours too. I've been flattering her since I was in Hong Kong two years ago. That woman has such a good temper, it's pitiful." He turned his body slightly and smiled slyly at Old Zhu. "If she wants to leave, why squeeze in with you? Tell her to come find me!"

The young woman only busied herself with her two children, not caring much about what they were talking about.

Old Zhu suppressed a laugh and shook his head.

"I'm afraid she wouldn't want to! If your wife screamed at the top of her voice, she would scare herself so badly that she'd be half-blind, where would Miss Jin get that kind of temper!" (17)
