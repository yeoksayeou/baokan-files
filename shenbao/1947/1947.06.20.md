### Economic Crisis Looms: Premier Zhang Proposes Reform Plan, to be Discussed at Today's State Council Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Premier Zhang Qun's economic reform plan is scheduled to be presented for discussion at the fifth State Council meeting on the morning of the 20th. This proposal is of utmost importance to the future economic development of our country. The contents are detailed, divided into three major parts: "Explanation," "Economic Reform Plan," and "General Review of Economic Reform." The plan lists fifteen major current issues: (1) Unleashing manpower and increasing production; (2) Increasing material production and stabilizing prices; (3) Stabilizing currency value; (4) Reforming the financial system; (5) Agriculture; (6) Industry; (7) Commerce; (8) Transportation; (9) Finance; (10) Grain administration; (11) Guiding idle capital into the right track; (12) Absorbing foreign capital and strengthening production and construction; (13) Reasonably resolving the compensation of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers; (14) Severely punishing acts of using political power to facilitate private enterprises; (15) Improving economic organizations and explaining reform methods one by one. The full text of Zhang's proposal is recorded as follows:

(Motion) Propose an economic reform plan for public decision.

(Explanation) Our country is inherently poor and has suffered the destruction of a long-term war. Both manpower and material resources are extremely depleted, and the psychology and skills of most intellectuals cannot adapt to the great era of scientific production. Those who should participate are powerless to initiate, and those who should reform are afraid of reform. Continuing the old ways, poverty increases. Assessing today's economy, it is truly facing a serious crisis and urgently needs a specific remedy to determine a reform plan. This proposal is based on the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood and its principles of socialization, defining the future direction for handling all economic issues. With national capital as the center, leading the activity of private capital, taking on difficult national enterprises, and supporting easy private enterprises. All measures related to finance, economy, and finance should focus on the long-term interests of the country. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan respectfully presents the economic reform plan.

### Stabilizing Prices and Currency Value: Public and Private Banks Must be Distributed Throughout the Country

[Attachment 1]: Unleashing manpower and increasing production. (1) Protect existing production businesses as much as possible to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. (2) With an effective plan, gradually increase new production and construction businesses, guiding idle manpower to participate in production. (3) Encourage scientific invention, promote labor service, to change the ethos and encourage the spirit of creative enterprise. (4) Coordinate planned education with planned economy, so that talent cultivation and production construction are integrated.

2. Increasing Material Production and Stabilizing Prices. (1) The government must promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and beans through agricultural production loans or by purchasing at fixed prices, and use part or most of it. (2) The government must promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities by providing raw materials to manufacturers, or through industrial production loans, or by purchasing at fixed prices, and use part or most of it. (3) The government must promote the production and export of export products such as raw silk, ore, tung oil, hides, tea, and pork through export loans or by purchasing at fixed prices, to enrich foreign exchange reserves. (4) The government should first make planned supplies and coordination of daily necessities for officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers in production factories. In addition, the surplus materials should be used to stabilize prices to meet the needs of the city, so that hoarders cannot speculate and achieve the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood.

3. Stabilizing currency value. (1) Quickly handle enterprises that do not need to be run by the state, sell counterfeit properties and surplus materials, and reorganize tax revenue to make up for the financial deficit in the short term and prevent inflation. (2) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system so that it can gradually return to normal. (3) The currency systems in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Xinjiang must be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent.

4. Reforming the financial system. The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policy, with increasing agricultural and industrial production as its main purpose. Financial institutions should each have major specialized businesses so that the phenomenon of general commercialization can be eliminated. Public and private banks must also be planned and distributed throughout the country to make it a systematic financial network, not concentrated in a few coastal cities, especially the corner of Shanghai. The methods are: (1) Taking the county as the grassroots institution of the financial system, supporting the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. (2) The county bank should follow the principle of one bank per county. At the beginning, the capital county accounts for 40% and the central government accounts for 60%. When the county autonomy work is gradually completed, the central capital will gradually decrease, reaching a ratio of 70% in the local area and 30% in the central government. The central government should also provide specialized personnel to provide business guidance. (3) County banks are backed by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on the type and needs of their business. (4) Land finance is long-term in nature. The government must designate special funds and issue land bonds to solve the problem. At the appropriate time, a special bank should be established to manage it. During the transition period, the land finance funds of the Farmers Bank should be enriched to assist county banks in developing their business. (5) The China Farmers Bank operates the warehousing, transportation, processing, and land loans of farmland water conservancy agricultural products to facilitate farmers and support the prosperity of Chen Village as its professional scope. (6) Bank of Communications operates industrial, mining, and transportation loans to develop industries as its professional scope. (7) Bank of China operates domestic and foreign trade lending and international exchange business (including overseas remittances, as its professional scope). (8) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau absorbs people's savings deposits, handles small remittances, and should cooperate with the principle of cooperation cooperatives, the principle of benefiting the countryside and using it in the countryside to develop the rural economy. (9) The Central Cooperative Treasury operates cooperative loans for production and transportation, and supports the organization and development of various cooperatives as its professional scope. (10) The Central Trust Bureau specializes in trust and insurance and is responsible for guiding the public's trust and insurance businesses. (11) The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and its main responsibility is to regulate the country's finances, closely link finance with the economy, and complete economic construction. (12) After the restoration is completed, the Four Joint Offices will be transformed into a design and liaison agency, or merged with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance to establish a Financial Management Bureau, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, to give it special authority. (13) The government should provide reasonable and effective guidance and control over provincial and municipal banks and ordinary banks. (14) Each national bank should implement specialization according to its nature, and be responsible for liaison and guidance on ordinary banking businesses of the same nature. The scope and location of the establishment of its branches should be determined separately according to its business objectives.

### Develop Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce: Support the Entire Country's Finances with the People's Productive Capacity and Total Income

5. Agriculture. Farmers account for the absolute majority, and agriculture is the backbone of China's economy. Agriculture is developed, the countryside is prosperous, and farmers have their purchasing power. Then industry has something to rely on, and society can be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside is the main object of future economic policy implementation. The methods are: (1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land so that it can be fully improved and utilized. The lease relationship should be thoroughly promoted according to the principle of "25% rent reduction", and try to realize "tillers own their land" as much as possible, so that farmers can fully engage in production. (2) Establish collective farms, use new machines and methods to increase production, to demonstrate to farmers, and expand agricultural experiment and research sites to improve production technology. (3) In agricultural reform, water conservancy is important. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of main canals should be actively carried out by the state. Small-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of branch canals should be supervised by the central government and handled by the provinces and counties. It is allowed to issue water conservancy bonds, and the local government is responsible for maintaining the completed projects. (4) Expand the organization of cooperatives and mutual aid societies to facilitate agricultural loans and reduce the oppression of farmers by high interest rates. (5) Actively and universally build a warehouse system to protect the interests of people's production. (6) Establish nurseries and promote afforestation, and effective measures must be taken to maintain their growth. (7) Use agricultural slack to train farmers in techniques such as civil engineering and stonework, and develop rural sideline businesses to improve farmers' lives. (8) Develop animal husbandry and provide assistance and guarantees. (9) Encourage fishing and protect its development.

6. Industry. Without a self-sufficient people's livelihood industry to protect agriculture and enable the exchange of agriculture and industry to help each other, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established. Therefore, the current development of industry should focus on people's livelihood industries. The government must urgently improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and provide industrial loans with the greatest convenience. At the same time, formulate an overall construction plan, determine the scope of state-owned, local-operated, and private-operated, classify, divide regions, and clearly stipulate and supervise the implementation, and predetermine their annual production. The government and the people will work together to establish them in stages. The methods are: (1) In the first phase of developing machinery and chemical industries, we should strive to adapt to the needs of agriculture and forestry and solve the problems of water conservancy projects, chemical fertilizers, farm tool warehouses, and transportation tools. (2) Industrial construction should be located inland as much as possible where fuel and raw materials are cheap. (3) For some industries, start with equipment engineering, purchase some parts from abroad, and gradually develop into a fully manufactured industry. (4) Except for trunk railways, large-scale hydropower plants, steel plants, and mining industries, which are stipulated to be state-owned or locally-operated, the remaining industries should be encouraged as much as possible to be operated by private individuals in a cooperative manner. (5) While encouraging some manufacturing industries, we should also focus on industrial experiments and geological surveys to achieve progress and new inventions. (6) Pay special attention to using agricultural slack to develop rural handicrafts to meet the needs of cities and the needs of the international market. (7) Develop various mineral resources to adapt to the needs of industrial development and export goods. (8) The government should gather public and private banks to organize a Renaissance Financial Company to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machines and raw materials from abroad. (9) The bank's loans to industrial and mining enterprises should effectively supervise their use for production and accept fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery as collateral, and should not limit the loan standard to half of the value of raw materials and finished products, and should not adopt unreasonable methods such as deducting interest in advance and collecting handling fees to increase the burden of industrial costs. (10) The factory equipment dismantled from Japan, except for those that must be state-owned, should be contracted by various industries to dismantle, transport, install, and start construction. The existing enemy and puppet industrial and mining businesses in China that are not sold at auction should be leased to private individuals. (11) Wages should be reasonable. Provinces and cities should universally implement a wage review system to stabilize production order, and labor and management should work together to increase production.

7. Commerce. Imports exceeding exports are a major problem in the national economy. The government should encourage exports by effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade. The methods are: (1) Domestic trade should make full use of the adjustment of financial institutions and the convenience of land, sea, and air transportation to stimulate trade and increase the total amount of trade in the country and promote balanced development. (2) In terms of import in international trade, except for production tools, raw materials, and map instruments, strict restrictions should be imposed to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures, and trade financial institutions should be used as much as possible to encourage and assist private individuals. The foreign exchange deposits of Chinese people abroad should be implemented quickly in accordance with the economic emergency measures plan. (3) Export businesses should be actively encouraged, and the foreign exchange earned can adopt the import and export license chain method to develop import and export business, and various special products should be considered for improvement and expansion to standardize them as major export goods. Rural handicrafts should also be organized and improved in cooperative ways and concentrated on export to balance domestic surplus. (4) The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office should be responsible for contacting the International Cooperative Trade Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and wholesale cooperatives in various countries and try the barter system.

8. Transportation. (1) The central government officially announces which railways are trunk lines and which are branch lines. The trunk lines are fully operated by the central government, and the branch lines are allowed and encouraged to be operated by local and private individuals under the central management system. (2) For highway projects, in addition to the national roads between provincial capitals, the central government encourages the provinces to build them, and the central government assists them with financial resources and manpower. Some branch lines are encouraged by the province to be built by the counties, and highway transportation is encouraged to be operated by the people. (3) Airports are operated by the government, and aviation businesses are encouraged to be operated by the people as much as possible. (4) The trunk lines of waterways are dredged by the central government, the branch lines are dredged by the provinces, and the smallest branch lines are dredged by the counties. Important ports are operated by the central government, and secondary ports are operated by the cities. The waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities are assisted by the central government with financial resources and people, and shipping is encouraged to be operated by the people as much as possible. (5) Telegraphs are operated by the central government, and wireless stations with special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up by themselves under the central management. (6) Long-distance telephone trunk lines are laid by the central government, and branch lines in various provinces are laid by the provinces, with the central government assisting them. County and township branch lines are laid by the counties, with the provinces assisting them. (7) City telephones are encouraged to be operated by the people under the management of long-distance cooperation.

9. Finance. (1) The government should quickly protect and support agricultural production to enrich land tax revenue, protect and support industrial production to enrich direct goods and two tax revenue, protect and support trade businesses to enrich customs revenue, protect and support the salt industry to enrich salt tax revenue. The finances of the entire country should be supported by the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people. (2) The central and local financial revenue and expenditure system revised last year, the county (city) level finances are more abundant than before, while the provincial level finances have less financial resources and huge expenditures, and the revenue and expenditure are unbalanced. The central competent authorities and the provincial governments should negotiate and revise them to ensure that the local financial resources are sufficient to meet the needs of self-reliance. (3) The current direct goods, customs, and salt four tax rates are not suitable for the economic environment at the time. Therefore, they cannot fully grasp the grain tax source and equalize the people's burden. They should be adjusted. (4) Adjust the names of individuals, strictly control the tax source, simplify the procedures, eliminate malpractices, and enrich tax revenue. (5) The unsold false properties and surplus materials should be sold as much as possible. The production and transportation professions that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to the people to operate or sell stocks to enrich revenue. (6) In addition to reorganizing tax revenue, the two treasuries should use the method of issuing securities to obtain from the people and make those with financial resources bear a heavier burden. (7) Based on the needs of national construction, determine the survival and abolition of agencies. Overly large agencies must be streamlined, and redundant agencies must be merged. (8) Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the state and beneficial to production and construction must be saved and stopped.

### Provinces and Cities' Grain Borrowing to be Stopped Starting This Year: Overcome Idle Capital and Bring it into the Right Track

10. Grain Administration. (1) Starting from the 36th year, the borrowing of grain from provinces and cities will be stopped to reduce the burden on the people. The principal and interest of the grain borrowed over the years should be repaid by the central government based on the grain price in various places at the time of maturity, and the rate should be determined by the legal currency, which will no longer be used to offset land tax, so as to clear the debt. (2) In the 36th year, the land tax in various provinces and cities will still be temporarily collected in kind to meet the needs of the country, but the land with poor grain production and inconvenient transportation will be converted into legal currency. The conversion area and conversion standard will be verified and determined by the Ministry of Food based on the circumstances. (3) The part of the land tax collected in kind that should belong to the provinces, cities, and counties will be purchased by the central government in accordance with the conversion standard of the neighboring currency collection area. The provincial and county public grain near the currency collection provinces and counties will still be used locally and will not be purchased. In order to facilitate the overall planning of military food and take care of local support. (4) The land and grain agencies in the currency collection counties and cities shall be abolished. Their affairs shall be handled by the county and city governments. The land and grain agencies in the real collection counties and cities and at the provincial level shall be retained, and their expenses shall be fully borne by the central government. (5) The Changpingcang system must be established urgently. Important locations in the Yangtze River Basin must complete the initial warehouse construction and grain storage plan within this year. The accumulation of grain in the local area should also be strengthened and universally implemented to increase reserves. (6) The China Farmers Bank should actively promote the business of agricultural warehouse collateral and agricultural product transportation and sales, with the financial strength to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surplus and deficiency.

11. Guiding idle capital into the right track. The biggest problem of the current economy is the concentration of idle capital and competitive speculation. The idle capital goes wherever it wants. In order to make the economy into a normal state, we need fundamental plans on the one hand, and overcome the scourge of real idle capital on the other hand. Therefore, guiding idle capital to participate in production is the most important plan at present. The methods are: (1) The national bank cooperates with the production and construction plan to provide low-interest loans and guarantees to legitimate enterprises, so that legitimate enterprises do not need to rely on high-interest loans as soon as possible. (2) Stipulate the highest amount of interest rate. High-interest loans that exceed the stipulated rate will not be guaranteed and will be punished. (3) During the transition period, national banks may as well absorb idle capital with the highest interest and transfer it to production. The government will subsidize the interest difference between the deposits and loans. (4) Allow people to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank at the listed price with gold for the purchase of licensed imported goods, and allow gold to be used as a priority to purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet properties sold by the government. (5) The government designates national banks to conduct gold savings deposits or issue gold bonds, all of which are given preferential interest and guarantees, and a special supervisory committee is organized to supervise them. (6) Crack down on manipulation and establish a sound and reasonable securities market.

12. Absorb foreign capital and strengthen production and construction. (1) The government should welcome foreign capital in a preferential manner to help the development of domestic industry. (2) Some types of industries can also be operated in cooperation with foreign capital. (3) Facilitate overseas remittances, give fair exchange rates preferentially, and encourage guarantees for overseas Chinese investment, and facilitate them to run various domestic industries. (4) Register the foreign exchange assets of nationals deposited abroad and use them for domestic production and construction.

13. Reasonably resolve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers. (1) Implement the rationing system so that officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers can maintain the minimum necessary life. (2) The government is responsible for solving the education problems of the children of officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers. (3) Strictly implement the principle of equal pay for the same job and equal pay for equal work to reduce the phenomenon of disparity in the treatment of employees in various agencies.

14. Severely punish acts of using political power to facilitate private enterprises. When officials and businessmen are not separated, and public is sacrificed for private, a good economic policy can be distorted. If a part of private enterprises in the society receives special treatment, legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises will be devastated. This is a prerequisite for the effective implementation of economic policy and must be strictly implemented.

15. Improve economic organizations. In order to seek cooperation between the government and the people and make economic policies work for the benefit, the economy, finance, and finance are closely connected and form a whole. We must take care of the overall situation and make overall plans. In the past, various ministries of the Executive Yuan governed themselves, and the Supreme Economic Committee was the same as a mere formality. The reaction of the people to economic policies could not be communicated and expressed. In order to remedy this malpractice, the methods are: (1) The government should improve the organization of the National Economic Committee and be responsible for designing, supervising, and implementing economic policies. (2) The society should launch a broad economic construction movement to improve the understanding and interest of the people in economic construction, and use the power of official-private cooperation to eliminate the difficulties of economic construction.

### Northeast National Army Advances on Multiple Routes, Recovering Benxi and Fanjiatun, Fierce Battle at Siping with Communist Army Using Poison Gas

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] General Sun Liren paid another visit to the Chairman on the evening of the 19th. Because some people in the capital have been paying close attention to the Northeast war in recent days, this reporter specially visited Mr. Sun, who said: The Northeast war is not as serious as the rumors suggest, and things depend on human effort. The Northeast is China's lifeline and should not be viewed pessimistically. The difficulties faced by the Chinese Communists are no less than our own. Recalling the difficulties we faced this time last year, they were even greater than today, yet we were able to overcome them safely. Therefore, even if there are difficulties, we must strive to overcome them.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] The core position of Siping was surrounded by two divisions of the Communist army on the night of the 18th, launching a melee. The Communist army charged eleven times, with close-quarters combat, and the fighting shook the heavens, resulting in heavy casualties. However, the fierce fighting is still in progress, and the National Army is determined to defend Siping at any cost. On the 18th, the National Army in Tieling launched an eastward attack, driving away the Communist army from Xifeidi, about eighty li west of Tieling, to ensure the Tieling stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang. Zhou Fucheng's troops fiercely attacked Benxi, southeast of Shenyang, and completed the encirclement of the Communist army on the evening of the 18th. After a night of attacks, they completely recovered Benxi by the morning of the 19th, while clearing out the surrounding Communist army. At the same time, they tracked and advanced to the southwest, recovering Gongyuan (5 kilometers south of Benxi) at noon. On the 19th, the military still controlled the southern section of the China Changchun Railway to Haicheng. However, engineering vehicles had already entered the vicinity of the Fenshui Station north of Dashiqiao to repair a destroyed small bridge and power lines. The Communist army's Independent Division One, Three Regiments, and part of the Twelfth Brigade, totaling approximately 5,000 troops, along with mountain artillery, launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Yingkou City from dawn on the 18th. At dusk, the National Army abandoned its outer strongholds and firmly defended the urban area of Yingkou.

[Central News Agency, Fanyang, 19th] Telephone call from Siping at 8:00 AM: The battle in Siping is still raging fiercely in the city. The Communist army is using all means to seize Siping. In the afternoon of the 18th, they even used poison gas obtained from Japanese prisoners of war. That night, more than 6,000 Communist troops broke into the streets, surrounding the core positions of our defending troops on three sides. The two sides engaged in a fierce melee. The Communist army launched more than ten assaults overnight, all of which were repelled by our defending troops. Fierce fighting was still in progress as of the morning of the 19th.

[Another Dispatch] Telephone call from Siping at 7:00 PM: More than 60,000 Communist troops, with their most elite units and best equipment in the Northeast, have been fiercely attacking Siping for nine days, firing over 10,000 shells and launching over seventy assaults. Our army, outnumbered, has fought bravely and calmly, day and night. From the night of the 18th to dusk on the 19th, the Communist army drove thousands of farmers tied with yellow explosives to launch continuous assaults. A back-and-forth battle is currently unfolding near the Provincial Government and the Central Bank's west building. As of the time of this dispatch, melee combat is still in progress. The fighting in the suburbs has subsided, and no artillery fire has been heard. It is believed that the Communist army's main force has suffered nearly half of its losses and has consumed a large amount of ammunition. They may be awaiting reinforcements. The National Army's southward reinforcing troops are moving very quickly, and it is reported that the northward reinforcing troops have bypassed Kaiyuan.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 19th] The National Army's advancing corps captured Pingdingshan and Xinkaihe, south of Datun, at 6:00 PM on the 18th. The Communist army left behind more than 200 bodies, and the remnants retreated towards the Dongxi Twelve Majiazi Yaotun area west of Datun. One body of a Communist army regimental commander was found. According to a captured deputy regimental commander, they were transferred from the vicinity of Siping.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 19th] On the morning of the 18th, the National Army advanced southwest with a powerful force, making rapid progress. After clearing out the Communist army near Datun, 38 li from Changchun, on the 18th, they defeated the main force of the Communist army, about four divisions, entrenched in the Fanjiatun and Daheilinzi area at 11:00 AM on the 19th, capturing 4,000 troops and then stationed themselves in Fanjiatun, an important stronghold between Changchun and Gongzhuling. According to military sources, this well-equipped and powerful advancing corps is continuing to advance south, conducting a vigorous search for the Communist army fleeing to Gongzhuling.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 19th] The National Army on the Jilin-Changchun Railway has a strong force. On the 15th, they began to clear out the Communist army entrenched on both sides of the Jilin-Changchun Railway. After clearing the area near the Yatong River, they turned to pursue the Communist army harassing the vicinity of Huapi Factory. At the same time, our Jilin-based attacking troops launched a pincer attack. The Communist army, unable to cope from both ends, has been routed and is no longer organized.

### National Economic Council Resolves to Rename Property Tax as National Reconstruction Contribution, Determining Valuation Standards for State-Owned Enterprises

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The issue of the one-time property tax collection, which has attracted attention from all parties, was discussed in detail at the fourth meeting of the National Economic Council on the afternoon of the 19th, and there was heated debate. It was resolved to rename the one-time property tax as the "Special National Reconstruction Contribution," and the collection principles were decided as follows: (1) Raise the starting point for the contribution (possibly starting from 300 million or 500 million); (2) Target wealthy households; (3) Implement in larger cities; (4) Nominate through public opinion organs, and determine the contribution amount after investigation; (5) The detailed methods will be drafted by the Finance Subcommittee and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

The meeting also discussed the issue of selling state-owned enterprises. It was resolved to complete the valuation and sale procedures by the end of July, and a valuation committee will be formed to specialize in valuation work. It is reported that the valuation standard will be based on the price level in 1937, with reference to current market prices.

The issue of subsidies for state-owned enterprises was also discussed at the meeting. In principle, subsidies for railways, highways, post and telecommunications, coal, and coal mines will be canceled. However, in special circumstances, a gradual reduction method will be adopted. It is estimated that the government spends as much as 300 billion yuan per month on subsidies, and canceling them will significantly help balance the budget.

Another important agenda item at the meeting was the method of repaying deposits in banks, money shops, and private individuals before the war. According to the original method proposed by the Ministry of Finance, it would be about 70 billion yuan. The meeting generally agreed that this amount was too small, while representatives of the banking industry believed that it should not be too high. It was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Subcommittee for research, in principle: (1) Limited to the occupied areas; (2) Limited to before the "July 7th Incident"; (3) For original contracts exceeding the limit, the original contract will prevail. Private deposits will be handled in accordance with supplementary regulations for civil litigation.

The meeting also discussed the coal supply and production methods proposed by the Economic Department's Resources Committee. It was decided to find ways to increase production in existing coal mines south of the Yellow River, and to develop new mines south of the Yangtze River. Coal prices will be assessed based on production costs to encourage production.

In addition, Chen Qitian proposed methods for provincial and municipal governments to control prices, and another committee member proposed a plan to prevent price increases after July 1. It was resolved to hand it over to the Price Committee for consideration.

Today's meeting was chaired by Chen Lifu, with Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Wang Xiaoyu, and Tan Boyu attending. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.

### Far East Economic Commission Held Plenary Committee Yesterday, Representatives' Opinions Diverged, Decided to Hold Subcommittee Meeting First This Morning

[Our Newspaper] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first and second plenary committee meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively, to discuss the resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Council that "the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East should be responsible for collecting more information on economic recovery and conducting investigations, and if necessary, also conduct field investigations, and then submit a report on the results to the next Council meeting." Many representatives expressed their opinions, and they were mostly divergent. Finally, the proposal of the US representative Davis was adopted: "A subcommittee should be organized by the plenary committee of this commission to discuss the resolutions of the Council. At the same time, the opinions of the members of this commission should also be discussed. The chairman of this commission should invite the representatives to submit concrete proposals, and the subcommittee should discuss the most important of them to save time."

The plenary committee therefore decided that a subcommittee should be organized by the representatives of various countries at 9:30 this morning to hold a meeting to formulate a work procedure based on the suggestions of the representatives, and then submit it to the plenary committee for discussion and decision.

At the meeting at 10:30 this morning, the Economic Commission will continue to hold its seventh meeting to discuss the temporary rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which have been reviewed by the Review Subcommittee several times.

Indian Representative Raises Questions

After the plenary committee meeting began yesterday morning, the Indian representative Nehru said: The countries of Asia and the Far East are now eagerly awaiting the start of construction work, so all preliminary investigation work should be carried out as quickly as possible. Therefore, he raised the following questions: (1) Why does the United Nations Economic and Social Council need us to collect more information instead of instructing us to take active and direct investigation work based on existing information?

(2) How does the Secretariat's Economic Commission for Europe proceed with this matter? Does the Council also need the Commission to collect more information?

(3) We know that the European Working Group, in summarizing the data analysis, has suggested what supplementary materials the group needs. Is there a similar suggestion for Asia?

(4) When the Council held its first few meetings, it asked the Secretary-General to pay special attention to the short-term and long-term economic assistance needed by countries in the United Nations that had been damaged by the war. Has this been done? Can this committee get a report for reference?

Two Secretaries Respond Separately

Rosenbo, Deputy Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission, immediately replied: The nature of the investigation work and how to start the investigation can be discussed and decided by the meeting of this commission, so the Secretariat should not draft a definite procedure.

Woven, Assistant Secretary-General of the Council, added that the Secretary-General had organized an investigation team to investigate the situation of the countries in the United Nations damaged by the war, and studied it by means of inquiries. At present, the reply on the European side has been submitted to the European Commission.

British Representative Proposes Suggestions

The British representative Crowe immediately proposed: (1) The Secretariat of this commission can ask questions based on the following points: A, the transportation situation in the disaster-stricken areas of Asia and the Far East, especially focusing on railways and waterways; B, the production and distinction of coal, and the possible methods of supply; C, various conveniences for training senior administrative and technical personnel related to economics. (2) Each member state should elect a representative to form an advisory committee to assist the Secretariat in its work. (3) The investigation report should be submitted to the next committee meeting for discussion. He also said that this commission is currently unable to send investigation teams to various places for investigation, but can send a member to any country for investigation to supplement the supply of information.

Soviet Representative Objects Again

The Soviet representative Stitesinko objected to the British representative's proposal, saying: Mr. Woven has explained that the Secretary-General has inquired with various countries, and the reply has not yet been received, so this commission should not repeat it. The scope of the British representative's proposal seems too narrow. The purpose of this commission is broader, and concrete steps should be taken to organize two or three field investigation teams to study the needs of the countries of Asia and the Far East and submit their reports to the next meeting.

Suggestions from Chinese and American Representatives

The US representative Davis said: Before a plan is determined, it is not advisable to start field investigation work. The report of the working group can be used as the starting point for the work plan. He suggested that before starting the research, this commission should instruct the Secretariat to arrange the plan according to the urgency of the work. This delegation will submit a list of the points that need to be investigated to the General Assembly at any time.

The Chinese representative Li Yi said: The Chinese delegation is currently unable to propose complete topics to suggest to the General Assembly. He suggested that it is best to submit a plan to the Economic Commission based on a joint study of the issues that all representatives newly consider urgent to investigate.

The Soviet representative asked: Which countries are the inquiry forms sent to? What kind of questions do they include?

Rosenbo, Deputy Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission, replied: The inquiry forms include economic, foreign exchange, and other issues. All countries in the Far East and Asia that have suffered war losses are among those being inquired. If any representative needs this form, a copy can be issued for reference.

Jiang Tingfu Points Out Two Points

Chairman Jiang Tingfu immediately pointed out: (1) Regarding the collection of information, this commission should give the Secretariat concrete instructions; (2) Regarding the field investigation, the problem is very complicated, and there may not be enough time, so the importance of the issues must be prioritized before choosing the investigation objects. Currently, due to the financial limitations of this commission, it may not be possible to conduct field investigations on all issues.

American Proposal Adopted

The meeting continued in the afternoon. Chairman Jiang Tingfu was absent due to other matters, and was replaced by Vice Chairman Guadeno. The chairman submitted the US representative's proposal, which is to organize another subcommittee to discuss the opinions of the representatives, etc., to the plenary committee for voting. However, the Soviet representative immediately expressed opposition, saying: In this case, the British representative's proposal will be the basis for discussion. Also, why did the chairman submit the US representative's proposal for voting first, while the proposals submitted by the Indian representative and myself were not submitted for voting?

The Australian representative seconded the US representative's proposal. The committee passed it. Then, the chairman asked the representatives to express their opinions on the working group's report. The Indian and British representatives expressed their approval of this report. The committee adjourned at 4:15.

### Guangdong Water Level Approaching Record of 1915, Water in Xiguan, Guangzhou Has Entered Houses, Shijiao Dyke in Critical Condition, People Panic

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] In recent days, newspapers have been reporting on the flood disaster in the largest possible space. In 1915, the Shijiaoyuan dike collapsed, and the losses in the counties along the river were inestimable. At that time, the water in the Xiguan area of Guangzhou was also deep enough to reach the eaves, causing a tragedy that had not been seen in a century. Recently, the counties of Dong, Xi, Bei, and Han Rivers have been suffering from prolonged rains, and many houses and buildings have been submerged. The flood is raging, and the water level is approaching the record of 1915. Many dikes in various places have collapsed, and the most important Shijiao Dyke is also in critical condition. The water level is about to reach the top of the dike. If it collapses or is submerged, the counties in the Pearl River Delta will be completely submerged. In some streets in Xiguan in this city, water has entered the houses. Citizens are making necessary preparations, and some are even planning to flee, as if the tragedy of 1915 is about to repeat itself. The citizens are panicking, and the price of rice has risen by 40,000 per dan compared to yesterday. Mayor Ouyang Ju issued a statement this afternoon, confirming that the Shijiao Dyke is safe (it was rumored on the 18th that the Shijiao Dyke had collapsed), and called on citizens to remain calm and cope. He also said that the city government has made adequate preparations. Even if the flood continues to rise, rescue boats, emergency food supplies, medicines, refugee shelters, and police forces have all been prepared. He hopes that citizens will work together to maintain the overall situation. Mayor Ouyang inspected the flooded areas of Xiguan late last night, and went to various power plants at 4:00 PM this afternoon to instruct flood prevention work. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly also convened an expanded meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss emergency measures.

Editorial

### Establishment of a Civil Servant Retirement and Pension System

This month, on the 12th, the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting passed amendments to the "Civil Servant Retirement Law" and the "Civil Servant Pension Law," which will be promulgated and implemented by the National Government. At a time when the government is vigorously implementing political reform, the personnel administration authority, in order to permanently establish the civil servant retirement and pension system, has made necessary amendments to the two regulations regarding civil servant retirement and pensions, which were promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War, based on the current situation. This is indeed an extremely important measure for personnel administration.

Personnel administration is a new term of the 20th century, and scholars of administrative law expound it as a science. However, personnel administration and practical application should not be neglected, and the practicality of personnel management precedes theory and legal codes. In modern capitalist countries, the application of personnel administration to industrial and commercial management has achieved high efficiency. In democratic countries like Britain and the United States, the application of personnel administration to agency management has established a sound civil servant system and enhanced good administrative efficiency. The term "civil servant" generally refers to personnel engaged in public duties. The British civil servant system is the most perfect. Ministers are "political appointees," whose tenure depends on party affiliation, while administrative officers are "experts," appointed according to law, holding their positions for a long time, being experienced in departmental affairs, regardless of party affiliation, possessing specialized knowledge and administrative experience. Their promotion, transfer, retirement, and pensions are governed by regulations. Any party entering the cabinet respects them equally and rarely discriminates against them. The scope of civil servants in the United States is broader. All personnel classified by position, as well as those not classified by position, such as those who pass competitive examinations, public school teachers, and employees of public enterprises, are considered civil servants, but this does not include the president and political appointees. The meaning of civil servant in our country is also broad. According to Article 10 of the new Criminal Law: "A civil servant is defined as a person engaged in public service according to law and ordinance." Article 24 of the Civil Servant Service Law stipulates: "This law applies to civil servants receiving salaries and other employees of public service institutions." According to this interpretation, all personnel engaged in public duties are civil servants, whether they are political or administrative officials, whether they are hired or appointed, or are local autonomous personnel, they are all called civil servants. Since the scope is so broad, interpretation is extremely difficult. Everything regarding appointment, promotion, transfer, and performance evaluation is confused in terms of customs and legal principles, and retirement and pensions are even more neglected. In 1934, the "Civil Servant Pension Regulations" were promulgated, but upon closer inspection, their content was superficial and impractical. The so-called protection for civil servants was merely empty talk.

The recent completion of the legislative process for the "Civil Servant Retirement Law" and the "Civil Servant Pension Law" by the Legislative Yuan is a prelude to a sound civil servant personnel administration and a key to political democratization. Retirement and pensions are essentially a safety net for the old, weak, injured, and deceased. Retirement pensions, also known as retirement allowances, and pensions are both a system of consolation and relief. They are essentially the state's compensation for civil servants' service and the rights that civil servants should enjoy for being loyal to their duties. The purpose of the state in establishing this system is to promote administrative efficiency, not out of compassion. Civil servants enjoy this benefit, and they and their families have a certain guarantee, so they will be able to concentrate their energy, without distractions, and regard public service as a lifelong career. Therefore, the civil servant retirement and pension system is a modern and good system, worthy of promotion, and can be imitated by all public service institutions. Now that these two bills have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will soon be promulgated and implemented, there are still aspects of their content and matters to be noted after implementation that remain to be discussed. The arguments are as follows, and it is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to them.

1. The Meaning of Civil Servant is Too Narrow. The current laws and regulations in our country define civil servants broadly, while Article 2 of the two bills stipulates: "The civil servants referred to in this law, except for chiefs of police, are limited to those currently employed and whose qualifications have been examined and registered by the examination and appointment agency." This scope seems too narrow and deviates from the meaning of the widespread implementation of the retirement and pension system. Regarding whether political appointees should be interpreted as civil servants, according to the "Civil Servant Service Law," political appointees should be regarded as civil servants. The two bills also stipulate that the provisions for retirement and pensions apply to political appointees, which is to recognize political appointees as a type of civil servant. However, the civil servants referred to in the two bills are limited to those who have been examined and registered. Customarily, political appointees do not undergo examination and registration, so there are doubts as to whether they should enjoy retirement and pension rights or whether the provisions of the two bills apply to them. Therefore, on the one hand, it restricts low-level civil servants and civil servants who have not been examined and registered, narrowing the meaning of civil servant; on the other hand, it gives preferential treatment to political appointees, which is unfair.

2. The Issue of Retirement Age. The British system stipulates that civil servants who reach the age of 65 and have served for more than ten years are eligible for retirement and receive retirement allowances. The American system stipulates that civil servants who reach the age of 60 or above and have served for more than fifteen years are eligible for retirement and receive retirement allowances, both shortening their years of service. Article 3 of our country's "Civil Servant Retirement Law" stipulates that only those who have served for 30 years or those who have served for 15 years and have reached the age of 60 are eligible to apply for retirement and receive retirement pensions, which is too long. It should be noted that if civil servants serve for too long, bureaucratic habits become deeply ingrained, and the common will is lacking, which easily leads to the incompetence of the bureaucratic apparatus. In terms of both theory and practice, the retirement age should not be too long. Furthermore, according to custom and law, administrative officers retire after 30 years of service, and political appointees can apply this provision. But, one must ask, do political appointees in any country in the world today have the custom or law of retiring after 30 years of service? This analogy is not a good policy.

3. Methods of Raising Retirement and Pension Funds. According to the "Civil Servant Retirement Law," retired civil servants are eligible to receive annual retirement pensions and lump-sum retirement pensions, the amount of which is calculated as a percentage of the annual salary based on the monthly salary at the time of retirement. According to the "Civil Servant Pension Law," if a civil servant dies on duty or dies of illness after 15 years of service, their family members may calculate a percentage of their annual salary based on their monthly salary and continue to receive pension benefits within 20 years. However, the method of raising these funds, and their position in the national budget, are not specified in the constitution's basic national policy, nor are they comprehensively outlined or listed in the two bills. There will inevitably be many problems in the future. The common methods of raising retirement and pension funds in various countries are generally of two types: one is the government-funded system, that is, all expenses are borne by government funds; the other is the government and civil servant co-funded system, that is, each bears a portion. The government's portion is allocated from regular expenses, and the civil servant's portion is deducted from their regular salary. Civil servants in our country have meager salaries and often work on an empty stomach. If their salaries are further deducted to prepare for retirement, it will inevitably affect their will to serve. Therefore, the government-funded system should still be adopted for raising retirement and pension funds in the future.

From the above discussion, it can be seen that the establishment of a civil servant retirement and pension system is important. In theory and practice, the parts that should be amended or paid attention to should be considered. It is hoped that the legislative and administrative authorities will preemptively seek remedies and not allow this perfect system to have any regrets. When the two bills were promulgated in the wartime capital years ago, the general civil servants did not pay attention to them, and the personnel administration authorities did not implement them, because there were problems in the content. However, this amendment is more progressive than before, and the points that remain to be discussed can still be effectively remedied, so that this good system can be established, which will not only be fortunate for the civil servants, but also for the country's path towards constitutional democracy.

### Zhang Lisheng Urges the Press to Reduce Publication of Yellow Journalism

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng received reporters at the Lishi Society at 3:30 pm on the 19th, sincerely urging the press to reduce the publication of yellow journalism. Zhang believes that the social news reports and supplementary works of some newspapers recently cater to low tastes, vividly describing events, which has a great impact on customs and people's hearts. He believes that excessive written embellishment leads to suspicion of encouraging immorality and theft. Zhang emphasized in his conclusion that he especially urged all newspapers to pay special attention to legal, moral, and public welfare perspectives when publishing social news in the future, uphold the positive spirit of educating the public, give full play to the true meaning of public opinion, reduce sensationalist stimulation of bad deeds, and engage in more effective discussions. Minister Zhang also specifically pointed out that newspapers in China have a particularly important value for social education.

### Correspondences from Various Locations

Jiangyin

Former Chief of the Grain Section, Qian Yiqing, added an additional tax of 24 cents to the province's reported land tax. According to current calculations, each mu must be charged more than five catties of rice, totaling more than 72,000 shi for the entire county. At the County Council meeting on the 17th, this case was discussed for a long time, and it was decided to strive to get it back before the collection this year in order to reduce the burden on the people.

Jintan

Jiang Shugen, director of the County Health Institute, was accused of dereliction of duty due to opium suppression fraud. He has been dismissed and detained by the county government.

### The United Board of Directors Decides to Pilot Order and In-Kind Loans, Draft Principles to Be Submitted to the Economic Commission for Approval

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 19th] The United Board of Directors held its 346th meeting on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Vice Chairman Zhang. The following were discussed: (1) The government is currently drafting an economic reform plan, with particular emphasis on increasing production and stabilizing prices. In order to cooperate with the government's policy, it is proposed to formulate principles for order loans and in-kind loans and pilot them first. However, the scope of application should be determined by the government's competent authorities, and several kinds of materials should be selected to formulate order or purchase plans separately. In agriculture, special attention should be paid to agricultural water conservancy loans and the pilot in-kind loans for farmland improvement. It was decided to submit it to the National Economic Commission for approval. (2) Export material enterprises need capital turnover for operation and sales, and they have been assisted with loans many times. The "Measures for National Banks to Handle Loans for Exporting Materials Abroad" have been formulated and implemented. However, the current prices are unstable, and some manufacturers, after obtaining loans to purchase and hoard goods, often intend to wait and see and sell at a higher price. When the loan expires, they apply for an extension. If there is no limit, it will lose the original intention of guidance and promotion and will be difficult to avoid fueling hoarding. It was decided that each bank should undertake various types of loans in accordance with the original method. Regardless of the acceptance of bills, the pledged funds should be recovered upon maturity and should not be extended. (3) Most of China's fuel oil depends on imported products, which is a huge drain. In order to achieve self-sufficiency in refining and save foreign exchange expenditures, the government has recently invested in the establishment of the China Oil Transportation Company by the China Petroleum Corporation and the state-owned China Merchants Bureau to be responsible for the overall planning of various oil products required by aircraft and national defense industries. The company is now expanding its business, opening up ocean routes, and equipping oil tankers and adding wharf warehouses to raise capital. It was decided to approve loan assistance.

### Soviet Union Rejects British and French Appeals, Unwilling to Participate in Discussions on the Marshall Plan, Bevin Returns to London Looking Worried

[Reuters, London, 19th] Bevin returned to London from Paris today, looking very serious and worried. He told reporters that there was nothing else to report except for the communiqué issued last night and the Soviet Union's rejection of British and French appeals announced in Paris this morning.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The Soviet Union, through its embassy in Paris, today rejected the invitation from Britain and France to meet together to discuss the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European recovery. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Paris felt that Bevin and Bidault's efforts to obtain continental cooperation would inevitably fail. A communiqué issued by the Soviet Embassy strongly stated that the Soviet Union believed that any European recovery plan launched in accordance with the suggestions announced by Marshall at Harvard University was "impossible." Diplomatic circles here felt sorrowful but not surprised by the Soviet response, which confirmed the views of the Truth Daily that the Marshall Plan was a plan to make Europe a vassal of Wall Street. Before attending a banquet hosted by President Auriol this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Bevin hosted reporters at his residence, announcing that he had reached an agreement with Foreign Minister Bidault to establish a special European Economic Committee to implement the Marshall Plan, with the aim of promoting European recovery with American aid. This committee will set up four technical committees, attached to the European Economic Commission, an agency of the United Nations, to study the four major problems of coal, steel, transportation, and agriculture in Europe separately. Bevin said that he would continue to work hard to seek Soviet cooperation, but if it fails, the British and American plans will still be implemented.

[Our News] London, 19th Broadcast: A diplomatic correspondent for an evening newspaper here said: The Soviet Union may accept the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the European Economic Commission, but may propose counter-proposals to Marshall's suggestions. The Soviet side believes that the European recovery plan should not be carried out under the guidance of the US side, but should be handled by the United Nations European Economic Commission. It is reported that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson held preliminary talks with Molotov today and has telegraphed the results to Bevin. Bevin returned to London today and is scheduled to report to the House of Commons this afternoon.

[United Press, Moscow, 19th] A highly authoritative diplomatic source said: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed great interest in the development of Marshall's European recovery plan, but he refused to make a formal statement before the plan was clarified.

### British and French Foreign Ministers Invite Molotov to Discuss European Economic Reconstruction, If the Soviet Union Rejects, Britain and France Will Proceed Alone

[United Press, Paris, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, after discussing for two days, jointly invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today to attend a meeting on June 23 to discuss the US aid to European recovery plan. The joint request proposes that if the Soviet Union intends to participate, the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can meet at a mutually agreed-upon location. According to well-informed British sources, London and Paris are the most suitable locations for the three-country meeting. Both British and French representatives said that the two foreign ministers did not consider the possibility of the Soviet Union refusing to participate. Reliable sources said privately that if the Soviet Union's reply is negative or inconclusive, Britain and France will ignore it and proceed according to the plan formulated by Marshall.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The attitude of the Soviet Union towards the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the negotiations has become the most concerning issue for political figures here. Judging from the Soviet Union's economic power in Eastern Europe and Marshall's statement that the Europe mentioned in his plan includes all parts west of Asia, the Soviet Union should obviously be one of the leading countries in responding to the Marshall Plan. Observers predict that the Soviet Union may adopt the following two attitudes: (1) In order to avoid a clear resolution, the Soviet Union will hinder the progress of the plan, making the US Congress unable to take action on the plan within the year. (2) If the Soviet Union itself refuses to participate in the Marshall Plan, it may order the small countries of Eastern Europe to participate in the leading organization of the plan to delay or destroy its work. It has also been learned that representatives from Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia inquired with French officials about the Marshall Plan yesterday in their capacity as experts. Some observers believe that this is the first step for Eastern European countries to participate in the Marshall Plan.

### British and French Negotiations Notify the United States and the Soviet Union

[French News Agency, Paris] After meeting in the morning, the Foreign Ministers of Britain and France met again at 5 pm this afternoon. Foreign Minister Bevin is scheduled to have dinner with British Ambassador Duff Cooper tonight, and will return home by plane at 10 am tomorrow morning. Regarding the European economic recovery plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall, British and French officials are conducting negotiations on time to discuss this issue. The French Foreign Minister also met with Soviet Charge d'Affaires Avakubov, informing him of the progress of the British and French talks. In addition, it is learned that the detailed progress of the talks between Britain and France has also been notified to the US Embassy.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 18th] According to responsible sources, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night, informing Foreign Minister Molotov of the British government's views on the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall. In addition, it is learned that French Charge d'Affaires Chambeardier also visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik this afternoon, submitting a memorandum from the French government on the plan proposed by Marshall to Deputy Foreign Minister Malik.

### US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to Office

Will Explain the Marshall Plan to the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 18th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson told reporters today that Marshall's plan mainly concerns the economic reconstruction of countries affected by the war. Therefore, Ukraine and Belarus may participate in the plan independently, just as they participated in the UN relief efforts. Moreover, participation in the plan does not involve commercial agreements. The main need of the countries concerned at present seems to be to provide details of their urgent needs, rather than to talk about what they can supply. The US Ambassador to Shanghai will arrive here tonight. It is expected that he will inform Molotov of the full details of the Marshall Plan so that the Soviet Union can decide its attitude towards the plan.

### Investigating Military Facilities in Hungary, the Soviet Union Rejects the US Request, Britain Will Still Urge the Soviet Union to Report on the Political Situation in Hungary

[Central News Agency, Budapest, 18th, United Press] The chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary (Soviet representative) Viridov has rejected the US request to investigate military facilities in Hungary. The reason is that members of the commission have no right to conduct such investigations, and he said that he will submit this request to officials of the Soviet occupation authorities for consideration.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Minister of State McNeil told the House of Commons that the government is waiting for the report from Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson, continuing to ask the Soviet Union for information on the situation in Hungary. In response to questions from members of Parliament, McNeil believed that it was impossible to send a fact-finding mission to Hungary and Southeastern Europe. He also believed that it was not appropriate to lodge a complaint with the United Nations organization based on the limited information currently known about the situation in Hungary. Regarding the case of the trial of former Hungarian Minister of Reconstruction Mies Terte and 43 members of the Farmers' Party and other parties on charges of treason, McNeil said that the British representative in Hungary is closely monitoring the development of the case, but because the trial will take a long time, it is not convenient to send inspectors to attend all court sessions of the case.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson told British reporters today that when he visited Molotov on Tuesday night, he discussed the opinion letter of the British government on the situation in Hungary with the Hungarian issue as the theme. Molotov seemed impatient with the so-called "continued interference of Britain in Hungary's internal affairs." When I told him that Hungary was still subject to the armistice agreement, Molotov seemed unmoved.

### Hungarian Opposition Party Accuses the Government of Unconstitutionality

Trials of Political Prisoners Have Begun

[Reuters, Budapest, 18th] Opposition MPs today accused the cabinet in the National Assembly of unconstitutional actions by not asking the parliament for a vote of confidence before asking to be granted full powers.

[Reuters, Budapest, 18th] One of the forty-three defendants charged with treason, former Farmers' Party MP Hahn, testified in court today that the special treatment he received in prison caused him to lose consciousness for a week, so he did not know what he was signing. He cannot be responsible for the confession that was read out in court. The confession stated that former Prime Minister Nagy had secretly formed an underground army and established underground arsenals with other Farmers' Party leaders, and the weapons hidden were unknown to the Disarmament Commission. Hungarian Minister of Transport and Communist leader Turo has not appeared in Budapest for two weeks, causing speculation in all quarters. It is said that Turo has gone to France on a special mission.

### Former President Roosevelt Criticized Wallace, Saying He Was Fickle

[United Press New York, 19th] In an article in "Collier's Magazine," Farley stated that Roosevelt had opposed Wallace as a future presidential candidate in 1938, because Wallace's behavior was unpredictable. Farley said that when he spoke with Roosevelt in April 1938, Roosevelt told him: "Wallace might be a presidential candidate, but I (Roosevelt referring to himself) would rather support Ickes, because Ickes can consistently adhere to his principles, while Wallace's behavior is fickle and difficult to predict."

Labor-Management Arbitration Board Decides on Two Principles for Handling Wage Disputes; Strives for Simple and Rapid Resolution of Disputes in Various Industries; Appoints Five Small Groups to Handle Cases Separately

[Report from this newspaper] The 11th meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Board was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday, with over 20 representatives attending and observing. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wu Kaixian. After three hours of discussion, 15 articles of the wage arbitration method were passed and submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for record, but the content was not disclosed. The Arbitration Board appointed five small groups to handle wage dispute matters and also appointed a group to study dismissal methods. Other issues, such as whether the current month's wages should be based on last month's index and retirement benefits for public utilities, were left for discussion at the meeting at 3:00 PM today due to time constraints. Regarding the handling of wage disputes in various industries in the future, the Labor-Management Arbitration Board decided on two principles yesterday: (1) On the proactive side, it hopes that both parties will share the difficulties and achieve a fair resolution. While workers' income is expected to increase, production should also increase to reduce the burden on the factory. (2) On the reactive side, if the factory's economic situation is indeed poor and it cannot afford the increased wages, the Arbitration Board may consider the situation and discount or reduce wages accordingly.

Personnel of the Five Small Groups

The Board also noted the large number of wage dispute cases. Although some were mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, many were still submitted to the Arbitration Board for review. Yesterday's meeting decided to prioritize simplicity and speed in arbitration. The Board appointed five small groups to handle cases according to industry classification. The first group consists of Tian Heqing, Shui Xiangyun, and Zhang Yongqin. The second group consists of Liu Jingji, Zhou Xuexiang, and Gu Zusheng. The third group consists of Xu Jiqing, Fan Caiqiu, and Xu Lin. The fourth group consists of Xia Enlin, Shen Ding, and Fan Zhenbang. The fifth group consists of Shen Baokui, Liang Yongzhang, and Zhao Zuyuan. The personnel of these three-person groups consist of one representative each from the labor side, the management side, and the Arbitration Board. If there are disputes in various industries submitted for review, the small groups will investigate the actual situation, refer to the arbitration methods, and draft an arbitration opinion to be submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion. In cases requiring urgent resolution, the Chairman and Standing Committee members may decide on the handling and implement it first, then submit it to the plenary meeting for ratification.

Studying the Advantages and Disadvantages of Dismissal Methods; Another Group is Appointed for Research

Regarding the request from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to cancel the dismissal method set by the Arbitration Board and to handle dismissals according to Article 27 of the Factory Law, the plenary meeting considered that the method was originally formulated in response to the actual situation. To determine the current advantages and disadvantages, the meeting appointed Li Jianhua, Tian Heqing, Yan Esheng, Shui Xiangyun, Liu Jingji, Xia Enlin, Liang Yongzhang, and seven others to form a small group for research, with Li Jianhua as the convener. The research results will be submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for decision.

In addition, workers from the six major public utilities in the city were advanced 200,000 yuan each by the management at the end of April, and the management requested that each worker repay 20% or 40,000 yuan per month. Yesterday, the Arbitration Board decided that those with a monthly income of one million yuan or more should repay 20% per month, while those with a monthly income of less than one million yuan should repay 10% per month. In addition, it was stipulated that retirement benefits for public utilities exceeding five million yuan should be discounted. Currently, workers, in view of the high prices, are requesting that the actual situation be considered and revisions be made. This matter will be discussed at this afternoon's meeting.

According to attendees, regarding whether the current month's wages can be based on last month's index, the plenary meeting decided in principle that if the company is indeed unable to afford it, the matter can be considered and handled after review by the small group, based on the wage arbitration methods and past practices.

In addition, workers in the hand-operated knitting machine groups in Districts 1, 2, and 3 sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition. They claimed that labor and management had agreed on the 11th that June's wages would be paid at 85% of 23,500 times the base index, but the management suddenly notified them on the 17th that they would temporarily pay at 15,000 times the base index, which is a violation of the agreement.

Cooperative Factory System to Rescue the Industrial Crisis

[Report from this newspaper] After the lifting of the cost of living index freeze, some manufacturers, facing difficulties such as declining production, sluggish sales, mismanagement, lack of raw materials, and high wages, are unable to maintain operations and are forced to close down.

Factories such as Huangpu, Dafeng, Jiangnan, and Antai Machinery Factory, which are unable to maintain operations due to economic decline, will implement this system. The Huangpu and Dafeng factories have already achieved satisfactory results. The cooperative factory system is based on the principle of labor-management cooperation: (1) Open accounting, (2) Reasonable distribution of profits according to proportion, (3) Increase or decrease of workers' wages based on the factory's surplus or loss, (4) Workers may increase working hours when necessary to compensate, (5) During the three-month trial period, labor and management may submit opinions, which will be decided by the Social Affairs Bureau.

Stray Dogs Competing for Food; Foul Odor Spreads

[Report from this newspaper] In order to determine if there were any bodies in the sunken ship, the Feng Shipping Bureau hired five divers yesterday to take the Shenhua ship to the sunken ship and search for bodies in the ship's cabins. Because of the long round trip, the Shenhua ship will return to Shanghai today. Yesterday, a floating body was also recovered on the beach of Chongming Island. The deceased was identified as Yin Hongsen, a passenger on the Dafeng ship. The Bureau has transported the body back to Shanghai and handed it over to his family. The Shishan side also identified a body, named Ju Puxing. There are still more than 20 unidentified bodies on the beach of the Taicang Floating Bridge, which have not been collected. They are lying on the beach, where stray dogs are competing for food, causing the bodies to be fragmented and the foul odor to spread. The Shipping Bureau plans to prepare coffins today to collect the bodies and will request the local government to temporarily bury them. The Aizhou patrol ship, stationed at Liuhekou by the Jiangsu Provincial Coastal Water Police Bureau, has been assisting in the salvage of bodies for several days.

Guan Hongda's Former Lover, Li Hua, Commits Suicide in Qingdao

Hanged in Full Dress Under the Cherry Blossom Tree; American Gold Found on Her Body

[Report from our Qingdao, 19th] Li Hua, a Shanghai dancing girl, also known as Suzhen, arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai by boat yesterday afternoon. That night, she hanged herself in full dress under the cherry blossom tree at the Zhonglie Shrine on Liaoning Road. Her body was discovered this morning, her face still beautiful as if alive. Several photos of a man, a small ingot, a gold chain, gold pieces, US dollars, and French currency worth about seven or eight million yuan were found near her, along with an unmailed letter addressed to Huang Yun, No. 6 Wuling Village, Kangding Road, Shanghai, but containing no letter. The suicide of this young woman who came to Qingdao specifically to commit suicide has caused a sensation in the city. Because photos of Shi Yongji, the dispatch director of the Qingdao branch of the Central Bank, and Ding Zeting, an employee of the Salt Affairs Bureau, were found near her, it was discovered that the deceased had cohabited with the film star Guan Hongda, but had since separated and was working as a dance hostess in various places. In Qingdao, she fell in love with Ding Zeting. She came to Qingdao this time specifically to propose marriage, but unexpectedly, the situation changed, and his heart was as cold as iron. She wandered alone in the middle of the night, with no place to entrust her feelings, and chose the path of suicide.

[Report from this newspaper] This reporter visited Guan Hongda at midnight yesterday and learned that Li Hua was 26 years old and a native of Shanghai. She had lived with Guan for six years. During the period of cohabitation with Guan, she formed a theater troupe with Yin Xiuling and others two years ago and went to Qingdao to perform. However, things did not go smoothly. In Qingdao, a rift developed between the two, and Li requested a separation. Later, the theater troupe returned to Shanghai, while Li Hua stayed in Qingdao and became a dance hostess at the Dahua Dance Hall. After a year, Li Hua met Liu Miao during her dance hostess period, and their friendship eventually led to cohabitation. Although Li had found a new lover, she never forgot Guan. During this period, she expressed regret to Guan's friends.

In March of this year, Li Hua was escorted to Shanghai by her friends and reunited with Guan. They were still deeply attached to each other and thought of rekindling their relationship, but Guan was afraid that the past rift would be difficult to repair, so he said that since they had separated, it was better to go their separate ways. Seeing this, Li Hua knew that the water could not be recovered, so she decided to go to Qingdao again to resume her dance career. Before leaving, Guan gave her 80 US dollars, one million French francs, and two taels of gold to help her on her way. Unexpectedly, Li had the idea of ending her life after leaving Shanghai last Sunday, so she hanged herself at the Zhonglie Shrine immediately after arriving in Qingdao. (The attached photo is a small portrait of Li from her lifetime.)

Construction of Caojing District Hospital Difficult to Complete in the Short Term

[Report from this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Health Bureau, after the Caojing District Municipal No. 8 Hospital was approved for establishment, Director Li Zhonglin actively prepared for it. However, due to the lack of suitable housing in the area, it was necessary to build a hospital building. Later, the district donated a land base of about five mu, and construction is now being rushed after bidding. It is feared that it will be difficult to complete all of it in the short term. In order to serve local residents, the hospital started outpatient services in rented houses from the Suo District Office on April 10 this year. The average number of patients treated daily is about 70. The funds for construction and other expenses of the hospital were allocated by the Municipal Government in April. Due to the current high prices, the original estimated budget is far from sufficient. Currently, it is planned to build seven large wards first, which are estimated to accommodate about 50 beds.

Director of Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau Arrested Upon Arrival in Shanghai by Ship; Cheng Yi Suspected of Improper Handover and Embezzlement

[Report from this newspaper] Cheng Yi, 34 years old, from Suzhou, manager of the Taiwan Provincial Xintai Company and former director of the Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau, resides at No. 30 Daxin Village, Jiangsu Road, Shanghai. The Taipei Police Department telegraphed the Shanghai Water Police Sub-bureau a few days ago, stating that Cheng Yi was traveling to Shanghai from Taiwan on the Zhongxing ship on the 17th and would arrive on the 19th, requesting assistance with his arrest. At the same time, the accounting director of the Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau also received a notice from the Bureau.

Manager of Zhongtai Silver Company Denies Extortion

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Kewen, a native of Zhenjiang and manager of the Guotai Silver Company at No. 479 Sichuan Middle Road, was summoned by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau yesterday afternoon. It is said that at 11:30 AM on the 17th, five unidentified men accused the company of engaging in black market gold trading, went directly to a small room on the third floor, and confiscated several bars of gold on the spot, as well as a bank draft for 97 million yuan that a customer was settling. During the search, one of them stayed in the shop with a calm demeanor, and the search lasted for more than two hours. Afterwards, they took Wang Kewen to a certain place and then released him. However, Wang categorically denied the incident when questioned by the police yesterday. This reporter also heard rumors of this incident and inquired among money changers, who replied that they had also heard about it. It seems that Guotai's experience is similar to the Baofeng case on Nanjing Road on the 12th, indicating that criminals are impersonating public officials to extort money. The authorities are now conducting a thorough investigation.

Taiwan Provincial Glass Industry Representatives Come to Shanghai to Request Machine Allocation

Guo Hubo and Lin Songmo, representatives of the Taiwan Provincial Glass Industry, came to Shanghai from Taiwan a few days ago to request the allocation of glass factory equipment from the Executive Yuan United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). During the Japanese rule, there was originally a large-scale glass factory in Hsinchu, Taiwan, but it was destroyed by the war. Taiwan has abundant glass raw materials and fuel and can be obtained locally, so the manufacturing cost is only one-third of that in the mainland. If UNRRA can allocate machinery and transport it to Taiwan for production, it will definitely be able to produce cheap glass for sale in the mainland. It is said that the two representatives, Guo and Lin, plan to go to Nanjing in the near future to present everything to the relevant authorities.

Dying Without Seeing Each Other; Wife and Children Wail Outside the Gate

[Report from this newspaper] Fu Shishuo, one of the major traitors of the puppet government, was executed by firing squad at the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 10:40 AM yesterday, after being sentenced to death by the High Court on September 28 of last year. This is the third person executed in the Shanghai High Court's Hanhao case.

At 9:30 AM yesterday, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, Luo Shouchang, the chief clerk, Xu Kaisu, and the clerk, Zheng Jinsheng, arrived at the Shanghai Prison and temporarily set up a court in a small courtyard with the warden, Xu Chongwen. At 10:00 AM, the traitor Fu was brought out from the High Court Detention Center. Fu's hair was already gray. He was wearing a beige Palissy long gown, floral striped cloth pants, an ocher-colored lined shirt, and black cloth shoes. Knowing that his death was imminent, his face was pale. Prosecutor Luo first asked about his age and origin. He answered, "57 years old, from Yongjia, Zhejiang." Then he asked, "Do you know that the High Court sentenced you to death in your traitor case, and the Supreme Court has approved the original sentence?" He answered, "I know." He asked, "The court rejected your request for a retrial, and the Supreme Court also rejected your appeal. Have you received this ruling?" He answered, "Received." "Today, by order of the Ministry of Justice, you are to be executed. Do you have anything to say?" He answered, "I have nothing to say, but I would like to write two letters to my family. I don't know if the prosecutor can allow it?" The prosecutor agreed to his request and had him sit at a small table set up next to him. There were several sheets of paper on the table. Fu tried to remain calm, dipped his pen in ink, and pondered, but his body and hands trembled slightly. He seemed to have endless longing for the world. He wrote two letters, one to his wife, Zhang Tu Jun (the niece of Zhang Taiyan), and one to his younger brother. (The original text is below)

Hands Cuffed Behind His Back; Killed with One Shot

The will was written smoothly and neatly. After writing, he carefully looked at it again, correcting the strokes that showed signs of trembling. He handed it to the bailiff next to him and was taken to stand in front of the court again. The prosecutor asked if he needed a morphine injection. He replied that he did not need it. Then he signed the statement and asked not to be handcuffed. The prosecutor did not agree. After his hands were handcuffed behind his back, he was taken to the execution ground. At this time, the traitor walked unsteadily, and two bailiffs supported him. After arriving at the execution ground, he sat on the wooden chair that had been prepared. The bailiff Cai Yunlong raised a pistol and fired it into the back of his head. There was only a loud bang, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his right cheek. The traitor Fu leaned to the right and fell to the ground after a while. This generation of major traitors ended their life at 10:40 AM.

Family Arrives One Step Too Late

Upon hearing the news, his wife led one of her children to rush to the prison. At that time, the iron gate had been locked. Unable to see the last face, she could not enter. But hearing the gunshot inside, she knew he had been killed. She wailed loudly outside, like a madwoman. Later, she called the China Funeral Home and had the body transported away at 12:30 PM.

Before the war, Fu was a professor at Datong University. At the beginning of the organization of the puppet government, he was the first to participate. He served as the puppet Minister of Railways, the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province and concurrently the Commander of the Security Forces, and the puppet Minister of Construction. During his tenure as the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, he assisted the enemy in suppressing the countryside and harmed people's livelihood. After the victory, he was arrested by the military and sent to the High Court for trial.

The Will Shows No Remorse to His Wife and Younger Brother

"Lujun. Now I am saying goodbye to you and my sister forever. Please handle everything in accordance with the will. In the autumn of Zhaomin and Dianjie, the world is full of worries. I am worried about the decline of the country. I have no time to grieve my death. I know it is impossible to do, but I do it for the people. Now I sacrifice for the people, seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence. Please don't be too sad. Spring is always short in this world, and the moon outside the sky is always round. There will always be a time for eternal reunion. Take care and say goodbye. Teaching and raising children is a heavy responsibility. Finally, I urge you to protect the car. I cannot send letters to all relatives and friends. Please extend my regards. Fu Shishuo, last words. 10:10 AM, June 19, 36th year."

"Jian, my younger brother. Our brotherhood has come to an end for now. Please take care of each other at the meeting below. Qingfu is not dead, and the習難 is not over. Later generations must work hard for the country. You must not give up eating because of my martyrdom. The spirit is immortal, and there will be a time to meet again. Everything after death must be simple. It is best to entrust it to Tu Kun and hope that he can handle it. I wish you well. My sister-in-law and all my nephews send their regards. Your brother, Shishuo, last words. 10:10 AM (actually 10:20 AM), June 19, 36th year."

The Case of Guotai's Xiao Fang Dying from Illness Attracts the Attention of the Academic Community; Many Chinese and Foreign Doctors Appear in Court to Testify

[Report from this newspaper] Ke Peiyao, the young owner of the Guotai Clothing Company on Linsen Road and Maoming Road, died last month after receiving electrotherapy for a wart disease. When Dr. Guo Yude of the Nanyang Hospital used a local anesthetic (Novocaine), Ke Peiyao's unique constitution caused a reaction, leading to a heart condition and death. The District Prosecutor's Office has filed a charge of death by negligence. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the case was heard by Judge Cao in the Ninth Criminal Court of the District Court.

Two Police Officers Find Cash and Turn It Over to the Police Station to Await Collection

[Report from this newspaper] Tian Changkui, a police officer No. 2043 from the Old Zha Police Sub-bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, found a bundle of legal currency worth 100,000 yuan on Nanjing Road and Longquan Garden Road at around 3:35 PM on the 17th. The police officer immediately recorded the location and time in his diary and turned it over to the sub-bureau chief. The next day at 2:40 PM, Wang Yueyu, another police officer No. 6873 from the same sub-bureau, also found a package of cash worth 500,000 yuan on Jiujiang Road and Hubei Road. He also took it back and turned it over to the sub-bureau chief to await the owner's claim.

A Fan Store Employee Impersonates a Military Officer

[Report from this newspaper] Hu Yunfeng, an employee of the Zhenxing Fan Store at No. 15 Yu Garden Road, dressed in military uniform and wearing a colonel's rank, was found wandering around in the North Railway Station at around 10:00 PM last night. His actions were suspicious. He was interrogated by military police, and he presented an identity card issued by the Army Independent Third Brigade directly under the Military Commission on May 1, 36th year. However, it was found that the Military Commission had already been revoked, which was obviously forged. He was taken to the North Station Military Police Team, where he admitted that it was all forged and that he was impersonating a military officer. He was immediately sent to the Fast Unit for legal action.

The Request to Return the Racecourse Rejected by the Executive Yuan's Appeal

[Report from this newspaper] In the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Race Club sold the Shanghai Racecourse to the Japanese firm Hengchan Company for 760,000 legal currency. Before the third batch of 360,000 yuan was paid, the Pacific War broke out. After the victory, the relevant authorities regarded it as enemy-puppet property and took it over. The chairman of the club, a British national named Annoji, appealed to the Executive Yuan, disagreeing with the disposition of the enemy-puppet property processing bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area and requesting the return of the racecourse. Now the Executive Yuan has decided: "The appeal is rejected -" The reason for its decision is roughly as follows: According to the appellant, the Japanese firm Hengchan Company did not pay the third installment of the purchase price as scheduled, so the conditions attached to the sales agreement were obviously not met. Therefore, the effect of the agreement should also be lifted, and the ownership of the site should still belong to the appellant. However, according to the original administrative agency (i.e., the processing bureau), the sales contract signed by the appellant with the Japanese firm Hengchan Company in February of the 28th year was not a preliminary agreement. Once signed, it would have legal effect. The various claims made by the appellant are obviously inconsistent with the facts. The effect of the sales contract will not be discussed for the time being. However, since the appellant argues based on whether the attached conditions have been met, according to the explanation, it is clearly a legal act with attached conditions. The issue of the effect of the conditions being met or not met should be resolved by the interested parties by filing a lawsuit with the competent judicial authorities. Now that an appeal has been filed with the Executive Yuan, it is not in accordance with the law and cannot be accepted.

### Clayton Hopes the Soviet Union Will Participate in the Marshall Plan for European Aid

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] Deputy Secretary of State Clayton, a key figure in the Marshall Plan for European recovery, recently stated that the United States hopes the Soviet Union will assist in providing for starving Europe. In a press conference lasting an hour, Clayton elaborated on the Marshall Plan, highlighting two main points: (1) The Soviet Union was previously an exporter of grain, fiber, and fuel, and should therefore also assist in resolving Europe's economic difficulties, especially in aiding countries bordering the Soviet Union. (2) The State Department has received reports of a bountiful rice harvest in the Soviet Union this year. Reporters then raised various questions, but Clayton avoided giving direct answers, only stating that the specific details of the economic aid plan for Europe have not yet been decided, and the final solution will depend on the European countries. Clayton continued: I will now travel to London and then Geneva to attend the International Trade Conference. I hope to hear opinions on the Marshall Plan from all parties during this trip, but I do not intend to hold formal talks with anyone. Regarding Vandenberg's proposal to organize a special bipartisan conference to decide on America's global aid plan, I express my support.

### Universal Disarmament Proposal Faces Major Crisis: Soviet Union May Exercise Veto Power

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 19th] Representatives of various countries in the United Nations believe today that if the Soviet Union exercises its veto power regarding the American proposal for universal disarmament, the UN's disarmament efforts will effectively come to an end. The possibility of the Soviet Union using its veto stems from the UN Arms Commission's passage of the American implementation plan on the 18th, submitting it to the Security Council and rejecting the Soviet proposal. After the meeting, reporters asked Soviet representative Gromyko what he would do when the case was submitted to the Security Council. Gromyko replied, "We will wait and see." Some representatives speculate that Gromyko will use the veto, and believe that if he does, the steps toward universal disarmament within the UN system will effectively be terminated.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] Representatives of the United Nations Security Council reportedly agreed today that pushing for a vote on major issues related to the establishment of an international peacekeeping force at this time would be futile. Attempting to resolve disputes through voting would inevitably lead to the Soviet Union exercising a series of vetoes, thereby damaging the entire plan.

### Eleven "Superfortress" Bombers Arrive in Turkey; British Fleet to Visit Turkey Next Month

[Reuters, Istanbul, 18th] Reliable sources here claim that eleven "Superfortress" bombers purchased by the Turkish government from the United States have already arrived in Turkey. This has yet to be officially confirmed. A few days ago, a Turkish army aircraft, including one "Superfortress" bomber, performed a demonstration flight in Smyrna for American Air Force advisors.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 18th] Turkish newspapers report that two British aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and two destroyers will visit Istanbul next month.

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 19th] The Turkish Parliament announced today that a delegation of ten British Members of Parliament will soon visit Turkey in return.

### Greek Troops Invade Southern Territory; South Protests to the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] The Yugoslav representative to the United Nations today sent a letter to Lie, protesting the invasion of Yugoslav territory by Greek troops and requesting that the letter be forwarded to the Security Council so that it can immediately begin an on-site investigation.

### Soviet Union Has Learned the Secrets of the Atomic Bomb; Walsh Issues Warning

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Walsh, the chairman of the advisory committee appointed by President Truman to handle the issue of compulsory military service, stated today before the House Naval and Air Forces Committee that he is well aware that the Soviet Union has the secrets to manufacturing atomic bombs. The Soviet Union is currently trying to use the United Nations to buy time and will be able to complete the manufacture of atomic bombs within three to four years.

### British Delegation Departs for the Soviet Union Today to Prepare for Important Trade Negotiations; Aim is to Conclude a Large-Scale Trade Agreement

[Associated Press, London, 18th] A spokesman for the Department of Commerce announced today that Overseas Trade Director Wilson will fly to Moscow on the 20th with eighteen advisors to hold important Anglo-Soviet negotiations to conclude a large-scale trade agreement. The government's announcement of this matter is significant, especially as Foreign Minister Bevin is in Paris discussing with France the implementation of Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan. Earlier, well-informed government officials said that whether or not the Soviet Union participates in the Marshall Plan, Britain is willing to sign a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The fundamental reason for Britain's trade negotiations with the Soviet Union is the need for Soviet timber and wheat and a deep feeling that "there is no intention to economically isolate the Soviet Union."

### Political Turmoil in Italy; Former President Agrees to Remain in Office Temporarily Until a New Candidate is Determined; Gasperi Cabinet's Position Unstable

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] President Nicola's intention to resign is firm, but he has agreed to continue to serve until a new president is elected. Leaders of various Italian parties gathered today to discuss this situation. So far, no one has been nominated as the successor to the president, and the fate of the Gasperi cabinet is once again in doubt. The cabinet will ask the Constituent Assembly for a vote of confidence within days. It is not yet known whether President Nicola's resignation will automatically lead to the resignation of the cabinet, but in any case, the president's resignation will inevitably cause a crisis. Although Nicola has agreed to continue serving until a new president is elected, this move has little effect on easing the tense situation. News tonight said that former Prime Minister Bonomi, 76, has the support of the two major parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, and is expected to succeed the president. The Speaker of the Constituent Assembly, Terracini, convened leaders of various parties in the assembly today to discuss the method of electing a new president. Gasperi hopes that the president will resign before the cabinet asks the assembly for a vote of confidence. Gasperi expects the assembly to cast a majority vote of confidence in his cabinet. If this hope is realized, the Prime Minister may submit the cabinet's resignation to the new president, who is expected to reject it. There are various reasons given for Nicola's resignation. Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party insists that Nicola resigned entirely due to physical and mental fatigue. The Socialist and Communist parties, which did not participate in the cabinet, said that Nicola's resignation expresses a lack of confidence in the cabinet.

### U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Partially Resolved

[United Press International, New York, 19th] Mediators for the Congress of Industrial Organizations Pacific and Coastal Maritime Workers Union have accepted a proposal to raise wages by 5%, bringing an end to the three-day maritime strike. However, the West Coast situation remains unresolved.

### British Colonial Secretary Declares Ceylon Will Become a Dominion; British Government Has Begun Preparations

[Reuters, London, 19th] Colonial Secretary Jones declared in the House of Commons today that Ceylon Island will hold a general election immediately, so that the new parliament can be established in October of this year. After its establishment, measures will be taken to make the island a dominion of the British Commonwealth (possibly within twelve months). If the island wishes to secede from the British Commonwealth, it will be allowed to do so. Jones's declaration stated that the British government declared in 1945 its willingness to cooperate with the people of Ceylon to facilitate its dominion status and expressed its intention to complete this goal within a relatively short period. To prevent delays in negotiations with the Ceylon government, the British government has ordered the immediate commencement of preparations to draft the necessary agreements.

### Indian Leaders Confer on Northwest Frontier Province Issue

British King Appoints New Governor of Northwest Frontier Province

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] It is reported that Governor-General Mountbatten, Gandhi, and Jinnah held a meeting yesterday to discuss the possibility of canceling the current plebiscite plan in the Northwest Frontier Province to avoid armed conflict in the province.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] King George VI approved the appointment of Lieutenant General Lockhart as Governor of the Northwest Frontier Province of India today, to succeed Sir Caroe.

### Japanese Zaibatsu Active in Secret; Large Amounts of Capital Engaged in Black Market Trade; Disposition of Zaibatsu Stocks Will Take Two or Three Years

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Although Allied Headquarters recently stated that the industrial, commercial, and financial overlord structures controlled by the Japanese Zaibatsu have been fundamentally eliminated, the Zaibatsu's power remains very active. They still remotely control 80% of the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors. According to well-informed sources, it is easy to find the "Zaibatsu Octopus," whose "tentacles" have only been damaged, while its nerve center remains intact. Although the asset companies are awaiting liquidation in terms of organization and personnel, their subsidiaries are supervised by individuals with deep ties to the Zaibatsu, operating as independent companies and acting according to the orders of their former masters. There is currently evidence proving that large amounts of Zaibatsu capital are engaged in black market activities and making large profits. The banks of the four major Zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, have not been reorganized and are operating in the same way as other "independent companies" connected to the Zaibatsu. Moreover, under the provisions of the anti-trust laws, each shareholder of a company can still hold 10% of the total shares. At the same time, the law cannot prevent stock holders from using different names to purchase more shares to control the company. Although the stocks are sold by the liquidation committee, according to the law, employees of the "independent companies" have the right of first refusal to purchase them. Therefore, after paying property taxes, all dividends are transferred to the Zaibatsu through the committee. In this way, most of the former Zaibatsu capital will still fall into the hands of the Zaibatsu.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The "Law on Adjustment of Disposition of Securities," passed by the former 91st session of the Diet, was decided by the current cabinet to be implemented on the 18th. The Association for Adjustment of Disposition of Securities, organized according to the law, was also established on the same day. Because the dissolution of the Zaibatsu and the reorganization of special management companies will result in a large number of stocks being offered to the market, this association was created to ensure that they are disposed of reasonably and democratically. It is expected that the face value of the stocks disposed of by this association will reach 20 billion yen, and it is expected to take at least two or three years to dispose of them.

### U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission to Meet with Various Korean Parties

[Our Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: U.S. officials announced: The first meetings between the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission and various Korean democratic parties and social organizations will be held in Seoul on June 25 and in Pyongyang on June 30. At that time, representatives of Korean parties will discuss with the committee members the purpose and procedures for organizing a unified provisional government.

### South Korean Military Governor Lerch Returns Home for Duty Report

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] Military Governor Lerch will return to the United States on the 23rd. In a conversation with reporters today, he said: "The purpose of my return to the country this time is to continue to request government assistance for Korea. The scope of assistance includes trade and civilian goods assistance, etc., because Korea lacks coal, salt, and cotton. After I leave Korea, my duties will be handled by Captain Haven."

### French Cabinet Passes New Fiscal Measures; General Confederation of Labor Expresses Opposition

Labor Strikes in Various Industries are Flourishing

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The powerful austerity plan proposed by French Finance Minister Schumann, which would increase tax revenue and reduce military and political budgets, has been largely passed by the French cabinet. The cabinet is scheduled to meet on Friday to make a final decision on the plan. According to reliable sources, Schumann's plan includes abolishing national subsidies for bread, milk, and coal, raising the prices of these goods, and increasing train fares, postage, car taxes, and tobacco and match prices. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) stated today that this plan will add an intolerable burden to the working class. This plan may compensate for part of the budget deficit, but it will inevitably increase the cost of living, depriving workers of the benefits they recently won during the strikes. The CGT has requested that all wages and salaries be revised starting on July 1. If this request is successful, the new efforts to balance the budget will inevitably be severely hit.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The four major department stores in Paris and other department stores in various places went on strike this morning. Banks in Paris remain closed today due to the workers' strike, with the exception of the National Bank of France.

### Liberal Party Launches Offensive; Katayama Cabinet Faces Difficulties; Katayama Reiterates Request to Borrow Foreign Debt

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Observers here generally believe that the Katayama cabinet will be attacked by the Liberal Party in the Diet, but they did not expect that the Katayama cabinet's request to postpone the resumption of the session in order to prepare proposals would be met with a head-on blow from the Liberal Party. Therefore, the general estimation of the Liberal Party's offensive has been greatly increased, and attention is focused on all actions of the Liberal Party. It is reported that the party has appointed Hoshijima Jiro and Kitazawa Kichi to question Prime Minister Katayama's policy address, and Aoki Takayoshi to question Finance Minister Yano's financial address.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: Japanese Prime Minister Katayama recently told reporters that he will propose that Japan borrow foreign debt to help economic recovery, but he refused to disclose whether the Japanese government is prepared to submit a loan request, but said: "I do not believe that Japan can achieve economic recovery without foreign aid."

### Soviet Union Plans to Establish Police State System Around the World; Dulles Comments on Soviet World Policy

[United Press International, Evanston, Illinois, 18th] Dulles, who served as Marshall's advisor at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, stated in a speech to the graduating class of Northwestern University on the 18th that the Soviet Union is adopting a policy of establishing "police states" around the world. If the Soviet Union continues to adopt this policy, it will lead to war. Dulles said: "The Soviet Union is a police state. The rulers of the Soviet Union have great faith in this system and believe that it should be implemented around the world. The Soviet Union is now effectively realizing this belief. Hungary is an example. The Soviet Union's attempt to implement a "police state" system around the world will lead to widespread conflict, even war. Even the Soviet people do not all happily accept the dictatorial rule of a few people. The number of political prisoners in the Soviet Union is greater than the number of Communist Party members. The conflict between police states and free states is difficult to compromise. We should ensure that the United Nations has the opportunity to discuss this matter, which is currently being discussed everywhere."

### "American Arrow" Arrives in Istanbul

[Associated Press, Istanbul, 19th] The "American Arrow," a round-the-world press delegation plane, has flown here from London.

Those who welcomed the plane at the airport included the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson, other diplomatic representatives, as well as the Mayor and Police Chief of Istanbul.

### Shaw Issues Written Statement Supporting Wallace

[Associated Press, Brussels, 18th] Ninety-year-old British literary giant George Bernard Shaw recently issued a written statement to Belgium, praising Wallace's peace movement speech and expressing support for Wallace's candidacy for U.S. President in 1948. He stated that various formulaic platitudes are not enough to avoid a third world war, only a leader with political talent can resolve this situation. The various questions answered by Shaw are recorded as follows:

(Question) Does Mr. Shaw believe that Mr. Wallace's repeated statements regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and other countries are helpful in promoting the peace movement?

(Answer) Wallace's remarks are a great contribution to us and Europe, proving that Americans have a vision that is higher than that of country bumpkins. I hope that enough people will support Wallace to be President next year.

(Question) Can Mr. Shaw propose a formula so that the so-called Western countries can reach a basis for understanding with the Soviet Union to avoid a third world war? (Answer) In today's world, from Stalin to the most impoverished person, no one who is clear-headed and impartial does not recognize that a third world war means bankruptcy and suicide. Therefore, the good times of these few years should be fully utilized and not missed. Formulaic platitudes are useless, political talent can determine the progress of events, but charters, programs, and propaganda organs cannot be effective.

(Question) Why shouldn't the so-called victor nations provide the so-called conquered nations with their better food and supplies? (Answer) Only the goose that lays the golden eggs is worth nurturing, even if it fasts for a day or two a week. The current difficulty is that it is not easy for the victor nations to find food themselves.

(Question) Will Britain remain in India, or will it remain for a few more days? Who cares about this and what is the reason? (Answer) Gandhi, Nehru, Jinnah, Mountbatten, and thousands of unknown people are currently killing each other in Bombay, Lahore, Calcutta, the Northwest Frontier Province, and other places. Others think they care about India, but it is not enough to predict success or failure.

### Discussion on Elementary School Hygiene Teaching Materials

— Shen Songnian

Not long ago, the Ministry of Education issued the "Revised Elementary School Curriculum Standards," which included "Elementary School Hygiene Training Standards," purportedly aimed at fostering hygienic habits. Consequently, the hygiene curriculum for higher elementary grades was eliminated. Currently, the hygiene training standards in schools in Xiashi have not been implemented, and the hygiene curriculum has long been absent. It is likely that the situation is similar in other schools across the country. One wonders how those children of this generation who cannot continue their education will be equipped with correct hygiene concepts and proper hygienic behaviors when they enter society.

Education is the cornerstone of a nation's survival. Hygiene education, in particular, is fundamental to all education, as it is genuinely related to the rise and fall of a nation. A nation's vitality lies in its politics, economy, and military affairs, with education serving as the central hub. Education is divided into moral, intellectual, and physical development, with physical education as the foundation. However, physical education cannot be separated from hygiene. Physical education without hygiene is harmful rather than beneficial. The six arts of ancient Chinese education already encompassed these three aspects. Ancient Greek education emphasized both physical and mental development. It was not until the rise of religious educational thought in the Middle Ages that moral education gained prominence, ultimately forming the three-pronged approach, much later than our country's six arts education. The archery and horsemanship of the six arts served as a practical method of promoting physical education, starting with individual training and progressing to the cultivation of basic national defense skills. For the individual, it meant being "accomplished in both civil and military arts," and for the nation, it meant "those engaged in civil affairs must be prepared for military affairs," integrating national defense with hygiene. In 1936, our 139 athletes participated in the Berlin World Games, suffering a complete defeat! Before the War of Resistance, when the capital recruited military police, only six out of a hundred passed the physical examination. During the War of Resistance, only about 30% of the young people who applied to the Air Force in the tenth to twentieth intakes, and the students who applied to military academies ten times, passed the physical examination. On average, only about 10% of those who passed the Air Force exam were physical education specialists, which is truly alarming! It clearly demonstrates that physical education divorced from hygiene ultimately fails to produce sound physiques. How can we mechanize our national defense and modernize our country with such a situation? How can we become a truly first-class power? Only when the majority of the nation possesses first-class physiques can we have the strength of a strong nation. To raise the national physique to the required standard, we must pay attention to hygiene-conscious physical education. Our country has traditionally neglected hygiene education, failing to promote the national physique to the required standard, resulting in excessive mortality rates, lowered average lifespan, and affecting the nation's decline. According to statistics, there are 16 million patients in our country every day, with an average of one death per hundred people per year. In other words, there are 584 million sick young people nationwide, with 4.5 million dying from illness. Assuming each patient loses the equivalent of one dou of rice (including medical expenses, lost productivity due to illness, mental distress, travel expenses for relatives and friends visiting the sick, and reduced productivity, mental distress, reduced labor of those caring for the sick, and mental distress, increased losses for medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacy staff, and the consumption of national drug supplies and business taxes, etc.), it amounts to 58.4 million shi of rice. This could create a hundred medical institutions for ten years, but instead, we lose a thousand. Assuming each death results in an average loss of 300 shi of rice (including all possible losses due to illness as mentioned above, plus living expenses, special medical and funeral expenses, etc.), it totals 1.35 billion shi of rice per year, enough to create a hundred large-scale factories. With a rice price of 400,000 yuan per shi, that is 5.4 trillion yuan in legal currency. According to the current report of the Minister of Finance, annual expenditures only require 2 trillion. The above sum would be sufficient to cover the national fiscal deficit for 27 years. We can reverse the current economic crisis by recovering just one twenty-seventh of the above-mentioned preventable losses through hygiene education. This is not groundless. During the eight years of China's War of Resistance, the officially announced number of military and civilian deaths was only 3.1 million, but it is estimated that about 4.5 million people died from tuberculosis last year alone. In reality, the mortality rate increases annually, and the loss from a single epidemic cannot be measured in numbers. Moreover, the average lifespan of Chinese people is only 30 years, with most dying before they can make significant contributions. Furthermore, few can be self-reliant before the age of 30, which means that society has wasted resources on their upbringing, and they cannot serve the country. Experts who have been cultivated make few contributions due to their weak health and short lifespans (great statements mostly require decades of accumulated experience and insight to produce the crystallization of their hard work). This is why our country lacks inventors, a truly unlimited loss to the nation and a great crisis for national survival! In less than a century, the nation will perish and the race will become extinct, without the need for foreign invasion. The Founding Father, in the Outline of National Reconstruction, stipulated that hygiene is one of the seven major construction projects, because the popularization of hygiene education and the development of hygiene services can make the people strong and increase productivity, so that the country can gradually become prosperous and can always survive in the world.

It is most ideal for citizens to develop good hygienic habits in higher elementary school. Because primary school children do not have the knowledge to read hygiene books, it is not easy to instill hygiene knowledge. Before education is popularized to the secondary level, higher elementary students are already the backbone of society. After graduating from higher elementary school, the absolute majority of children cannot continue their education and mostly enter society to make a living. If we do not instill all the more reasonable hygiene knowledge and basic medical knowledge in higher elementary school, the future of the country remains bleak! The backbone of society has a latent leadership role. If they still lack hygiene knowledge and medical knowledge, how can they improve society, break superstitions, and popularize scientific medicine to cooperate with the great cause of national construction? In the past, higher elementary hygiene textbooks mostly focused on physiology and anatomy, which was impractical and truly wasteful. As the Ministry of Education revises the secondary school curriculum standards, we feel that the higher elementary hygiene curriculum should be reinstated! We should not adhere to the notion that medical materials should not be included in hygiene teaching materials, because medical materials are far more meaningful than an emphasis on literal understanding and anatomy. The elementary school hygiene training standards should not be abolished, so as to train children's hygiene concepts and hygienic behaviors as much as possible, so that the next generation can earn respect for the country. How fortunate is the great Republic of China.

### Discussion on Hilar Lymph Node Tuberculosis

— Xu Shuping

Hilar lymph node tuberculosis is very common in childhood. Its cause is the transmission of tubercle bacilli. The inhaled tubercle bacilli first cause initial lesions in the lungs, and then spread through the lymphatic system to the lymph nodes in the hilar region. The inflamed lymph nodes swell up, and this becomes hilar lymph node tuberculosis. The most notable symptom is a fever of unknown origin that persists for a long time, accompanied by loss of appetite, listlessness, and fatigue after exercise, and gradual emaciation. As for coughing? Some experience it, some do not, and it is not always certain. Accurate diagnosis requires the use of tuberculin skin tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate tests, and X-ray examinations. These are the duties of physicians and not within the scope of common knowledge, so I will not elaborate. Now, I will briefly explain the methods of treating sick children as follows:

(1) All those who are in close contact with the sick child, such as parents, grandparents, wet nurses, maids, cooks, and drivers in the family, and teachers and sick classmates in the school, are the most suspicious individuals and should be subjected to detailed inquiry and examination. If the source can be found, it must be isolated, because frequent contact with patients with active tuberculosis carries the risk of causing the child to develop repeated infections.

(2) The temperature and humidity of the room must be appropriate, and there must be fresh air.

(3) The patient must rest in bed, and the clothes should be loose and comfortable.

(4) The diet must be sufficient and provide all necessary nutrients, such as orange juice, tomato juice, cabbage water, cod liver oil, and other foods containing various vitamins.

(5) Even if the fever has subsided, any increase in activity must be in accordance with the doctor's instructions.

(6) During the convalescent period, all kinds of acute infectious diseases must be avoided as much as possible. The most important of these are measles and whooping cough, because contracting these two diseases again can aggravate the condition and sometimes even cause the danger of miliary tuberculosis.

In short, hilar lymph node tuberculosis is a primary infection type in terms of pathology and is relatively easy to cure. Therefore, the patient's family does not need to be overly pessimistic. They should always follow the doctor's instructions and focus on recuperation.

Superfluous Words on Prevention

Since ancient times, a good doctor treats illness before it arises; treating illness after it has arisen is the work of an inferior doctor. In today's China, public health is backward, and hoping to discuss treating illness before it arises is impossible. When I first left medical school, my strict father wrote a motto for me to encourage me in my studies. I respectfully record it as follows: "One who knows how to treat illness but does not know how to prevent illness is a mediocre doctor; one who knows neither the method of preventing illness nor the method of treating illness is an inferior doctor; one who not only fully understands the condition and treats it according to the symptoms, but also can clearly understand the pathology and prevent illness before it occurs is a superior doctor; even if we cannot have the reality of a superior doctor, we should also have the ambition to be a superior doctor." Since I was born, several years have passed, and I have often remembered my father's instructions. I dare not abandon myself. Now that summer is approaching and epidemics are about to occur, I cannot sleep deep into the night, so I have drafted this article to repay my debt of manuscripts.

Lao Tzu said: "After a great war, there will inevitably be a year of famine," because of the concentration of epidemic air. The Explanation of Writing said that epidemics are when people are all sick, that is, many people suffer from the same disease, which is clearly a popular infectious disease. The epidemics are epidemics, which are almost referred to as cholera in the summer and autumn. The Chinese people's understanding of cholera, in addition to the foolish people's belief in ghosts and gods, has always believed that it is caused by the feeling of soil qi. It is caused by the improper seasonal qi, which is called the disease of wind and wood hurting the soil. Therefore, the Great Treatise on Qi Transformation of the Plain Questions said that the outbreak of soil depression causes people's diseases, which is called cholera to relieve qi. The Book of Rites said that if you practice the summer order in the late spring, the people will suffer from many diseases; if you practice the autumn order in the early summer, the people will suffer from major epidemics. Now we know that climate can only promote the growth of epidemic bacteria. When Zhongjing said that cholera is caused by eating, saying that donkey and horse meat mixed with pork will cause cholera, and rabbit meat eaten with dried ginger will also cause cholera, the cause of the disease seems to have been attributed to diet, but it is not clear why. Since 1883, the German R. Koch repeatedly examined patients and corpses in Egypt and India, and even found bacteria in water pools outside the corpses. At that time, many drinkers became ill, and it was determined that this bacteria was the root cause of cholera. Other information about the symptoms and course of cholera seems unnecessary to elaborate on in this article.

The optimum temperature for the growth of cholera bacteria is about 37-40 degrees Celsius, so the peak season for cholera in our country is during the six months of summer and autumn. Our country's health administration has not been put on the right track, and health funding is insufficient. It is like looking for a needle in a haystack or throwing it into a void to talk about various health facilities and comprehensive daily epidemic prevention. In addition, the lack of general public health knowledge has led to the so-called epidemic prevention being only a temporary epidemic control work when disaster is imminent and close at hand, such as injecting vaccines, advising the public to be careful about food, and eliminating flies. These are mostly focused on preventing pathogens. Those who only have a superficial understanding think that once preventive injections are given, they can be carefree. However, they do not know that the effectiveness of preventive injections is limited, and their role is only to promote the increase in resistance to pathogens. This is only one aspect of epidemic prevention, not the whole thing.

The population in the sea is dense. Generally speaking, it is difficult to meet the hygienic standards for living and eating. In such a dirty environment, diseases can occur at any time, and few can escape the invasion of epidemic bacteria. However, whether one gets sick or not, and whether one dies or not, depends on the difference in the strength of each person's resistance. As far as I can see, the goal of epidemic prevention is to defend against pathogens, which is a golden rule, but personal health care should not be ignored.

(1) Avoid reckless eating and drinking: Eating and drinking is a great desire of people and an essential element for maintaining life. However, excessive drinking and unregulated eating will not only expand the contents of the stomach and impair the function of the digestive system, but also dilute the stomach acid and reduce the antibacterial effect of the gastric juice. Because cholera bacteria are acid-hating, stomach acid has antibacterial properties, so thin gastric juice is an incentive for cholera. This has been verified in animal experiments. Also, a survey of cholera cases in various countries found that they occurred more frequently on weekends, knowing that it was the result of binge eating and drinking and thin gastric juice. The weather is hot at this time, and people sweat a lot, especially the working class. Drinking a lot of water to quench thirst is most likely to dilute gastric juice, and diluting stomach acid is a major reason for weakening antibacterial power.

(2) Pay attention to cold and heat: On long and leisurely summer days, the climate changes greatly. The temperature difference between morning and evening is significant, so you should pay attention to increasing or decreasing clothes and food and opening and closing doors and windows at any time. Due to the scarcity of houses at sea, people live in small rooms. The heat is unbearable on summer nights, and sleeping in the alleys often leads to diseases. The so-called catching a cold is because people rely on the body temperature regulation function and let it work first. After a long time, they will naturally be exhausted and become ill. Air conditioners and electric fans are most fearful for the body temperature regulation function and should be used carefully.

(3) Appropriate work and rest: This is indirectly related to the first item mentioned above, because excessive labor often causes a lot of sweating, and it is supplemented with a large amount of water, fearing that the stomach acid will be diluted. Appropriate work and rest can increase the body's resistance. The onset of disease, in addition to the root cause, often does not occur without incentives. Can we all agree on this? The root cause of cholera is now known to be the transmission of cholera vibrio. The transmission always requires various appropriate opportunities and conditions. Prevention and attention to opportunities and conditions are important components of the voice of epidemic prevention.

Our country seems to want to complete the miracle of immunity with preventive vaccines alone. Those who prevent it prevent it as much as possible, and those who are sick are still sick. If the epidemic does not occur, the people should celebrate. Once it occurs, they will still be in a panic. The epidemic will not stop until late autumn. Then what is epidemic prevention? It is just a temporary epidemic control.

### Occasional Thoughts on Medicine

— Canglong

Simple Treatment for Infectious Parotitis

Recently, a type of infectious parotitis has become very prevalent. Its symptoms are: "Initially, fatigue, headache, earache, chills, fever, sweating, and possibly nosebleeds. After one or two days, both sides (or one side) of the area below the ears swell up, the cheeks swell, the eyelids become puffy, the outer ear hurts, hearing becomes impaired, swallowing is difficult, and chewing feels difficult. Touching the affected area below the ears reveals a hard lump that is painful. Although the course of this disease is generally good, it still takes seven to ten days to recover. Complications of this disease include otitis media, orchitis or oophoritis, and meningitis, but these are rare. It mostly affects children, and is rare in adults. However, adults who contract this disease are more likely to develop complications, and the fever is also higher. There are often cases of impotence or infertility due to orchitis or oophoritis."

Because the pathogen for this infectious parotitis has yet to be discovered, the treatment methods are always palliative measures such as antipyretics, analgesics, and various poultices. I have recently encountered many cases of this disease. Initially, in addition to using the above-mentioned palliative methods, I tried using sulfonamide drugs and similar products. However, the results were not good, and it was impossible to recover until after eight to ten days. Later, I switched to using gray mercury ointment (Ungt Hycrgyrum Cinereu - 30%) on the affected area. It healed after two or three days. Repeated trials have shown it to be absolutely reliable. However, when using this mercury ointment, it should only be applied once a day, and each application should not exceed five hours to avoid excessive absorption of mercury into the body causing poisoning.

As for the reasons for using gray mercury ointment to treat this disease, they are very interesting and worth recording. I am attaching them below: In our hometown, this disease is called "pig head madness" because of its similar shape. If someone has it, their father or mother will take them to the private school and ask the old scholar to use thick cinnabar dipped in silver to draw a circle on the affected area, and write the character "tiger" inside the circle, saying that the tiger can eat the pig. As a result, this disease heals after writing the tiger character, which is very effective. At first, I did not notice it, thinking it was a coincidence. Later, I practiced painting after diagnosis and studied various colors, only to realize that the so-called cinnabar in silver is actually a compound of mercury. According to pharmacological reports, after mercury enters the body, it often collects in the salivary glands and salivary glands in the mouth under the ears, as well as in the mucous membrane of the large intestine. Moreover, the disinfection effect of mercury compounds is very strong, which doctors already know. Now, the reason why the old scholar's cinnabar pen in the countryside can cure pig head madness is nothing more than that mercury has a special disinfection effect on this disease. Based on the above reasons, I used gray mercury Huagao on this disease, and the result was very effective. All my colleagues may wish to try it to confirm it.

### Palliative Treatment for Pertussis (Whooping Cough)

We all know that pertussis in the paroxysmal stage is really difficult to treat. And for the sick child, we see him coughing dozens of times in a row, with each breath chasing the previous, even to the point where his face turns purple and he looks like he is suffocating to death, which is really pitiful! We have used many pertussis syrups, but they only have some effect in the initial catarrhal stage. We sometimes use some anesthetics, but they can block the mucus and cause terrible pneumonia and breathing difficulties. We sometimes use sedatives, but they often cause the child to become drowsy. Not only are the child's parents very worried, but they often also lead to a dependency on the injection (Acthercum Oleum Ollvarum Lcc).

It is very effective for coughs in pertussis. I have tested it and the results are very satisfactory. If a pertussis patient is injected in the afternoon or evening, then the patient can definitely have a longer period of sleep at night. This medicine is produced in Germany, France, and also in China. Inject once a day, one cc each time (two cc for adults), intramuscular injection. This medicine has a small shortcoming, that is, it is very painful when injected, and there is inevitable discomfort within two or three minutes.

### Free Vaccination Injections (Reported by this Newspaper)

### Medical Q&A

— Answered by Dr. Liang Houqing

Your bold and uninhibited "will to live" is truly admirable! However, I must honestly tell you that a person is, after all, a person. No matter what, we cannot treat ourselves as test subjects to test unproven drugs. If side effects that endanger your life occur due to the use of drugs, then you will regret it too late. Therefore, I advise you never to take such a big risk to try. Although you said that after taking "Sutolipan" for three months, many symptoms have been reduced and your appetite has improved, this "Sutolipan" drug is still in the experimental stage, and the Health Bureau has banned its sale (and many patients have reported failures after taking this drug). It can be seen that the efficacy of this drug still needs to be further tested and cannot be considered perfect. Also, as I mentioned before, chaulmoogra oil has the effect of treating laryngeal tuberculosis; this is just a report provided for everyone's reference. But after you saw this news, you immediately tried it, and bought chaulmoogra in Chinese medicine to grind into powder and take internally, regardless of whether it has toxins that harm the body and side effects that stimulate the stomach. This bold approach is truly shocking to hear.

What is admirable is that your bold attempts may provide some valuable dawn for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis! I also said in the Q&A column in the previous issue: "The properties of tubercle bacilli and leprosy bacilli are very similar. Because chaulmoogra has a very therapeutic effect on leprosy, Dr. Li Gang and I have tried it on laryngeal tuberculosis (because laryngeal tuberculosis is surgical, and using chaulmoogra oil to apply to the affected area can reduce its toxicity or side effects), and the result is considered very effective, so it is made public so that patients can discuss the application of this method with their attending physician according to their condition. However, you boldly bought chaulmoogra in Chinese medicine to grind into powder and take it internally. Fortunately, you did not poison yourself, and you also benefited from it. This is truly a miracle! If the medical community can continue to study and find a special medicine for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, then you are the greatest adventurer."

Regarding dietary health, I think you still have to pay attention to it carefully. All hard and indigestible foods are on the prohibited list. You must take easily digestible and nutritious foods for a long time. Vitamins A, B, and C are even more indispensable. If it is practically possible, you may wish to inject a large amount of glucose, calcium, and vitamins C and B. If you can treat and heal for a long time and lie still for a long time, then your disease can be cured.

Finally, I must incidentally tell the readers; "The condition described by Ye Jiewu Jun and the treatment methods I provided are only for everyone's reference. I hope everyone will not blindly follow them!" As for the internal use of "Sturitolimexin" that you mentioned, I think it is wrong because it completely loses its effectiveness after being used as an internal preparation, so why spend so much money (each bottle is worth more than 400,000 legal currency) to do something that is useless?

Spring and Autumn

### To Jie in the Collapsed Da Feng Steamer

— Xu Xun

Jie: Today marks six days since you left home. For us, these are days as long as many years! Thinking of you, all I can do is weep.

Jie, I never imagined that our first separation after marriage would be a final farewell. Didn’t you say that you would be back in no more than three days? Yet, six days have passed, and you are still nowhere to be seen. Today, the bleak wind and bitter rain continue. Where are you, drifting about?

In the past two days, during my moments of confusion, I often believed that you would return. I imagined you being swept by the waves to a sandy beach, where a kind old fisherman would rescue you. One day, you would suddenly appear at the door, wearing ill-fitting clothes. Thus, whenever I heard footsteps outside the door, I thought it was you. Although I could discern that it wasn’t you, I couldn't help but raise my head to look out, even though all I saw was emptiness.

These past few days, I've received no news of you anywhere. Jie, I no longer have the courage to hope for your survival. Others try to comfort me by saying, "Maybe you were rescued by a sailboat." But what are the chances of that happening, even one in ten million? You can't swim, and you're not physically strong. Even if you had a wooden board, you couldn't possibly hold on for long. Moreover, although young, you had such a detached view of life and death that you might not even struggle desperately. And you were meticulous. If you had safely reached another place by sailboat, even if you couldn't return immediately, surely a letter would have arrived by now.

It was because you were afraid of the Hangli steamer that you took the Da Feng. Who knew that it was many times older than you, its machinery long obsolete, its hull long decayed, and that it should have been taken out of service long ago? Moreover, when the Yongzhang oil tanker signaled for help, none of the crew members could understand the flags. How could such a ship still be allowed to sail? Jie, you were innocent. It is the corruption of the maritime administration and the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants that caused you all to be unjustly submerged at the bottom of the river. The passengers who escaped said that many people were simply locked in the cabins, with no chance of survival. Now, the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Association has risen to uphold justice and properly handle the aftermath. Jie, rest in peace. Soon, your grievances will surely be brought to light. If you cannot obtain redress, then countless others will continue to suffer.

You left in such a hurry to see your father, who was ill. On the afternoon of the eighth, you hadn't yet planned to return. After going to your second sister's house and learning about your father's serious illness, you immediately bought medicine and decided to return to say goodbye. To catch the steamer that night, you left in such a hurry. I poured you a cup of tea, but you didn't even wait for it to cool before taking your clothes and leaving. You didn't want me to tire myself out, so you wouldn't let me see you downstairs. I saw you to the door, wanting to take you to the pier, but you refused. It wasn't your first time traveling back and forth between the north and south of the Yangtze, so I let you go alone without much worry. At the door, watching your back disappear into the alleyway, I turned around and went upstairs to sleep soundly. In the middle of the night, the storm woke me up. I only thought that you were wearing such thin clothes and would catch a cold tomorrow. On the morning of the ninth, the wind and rain were even heavier. Around seven o'clock, on my way to school, I thought, "You probably won't disembark at Rengang. You must be going to Tianshengang." I was worried about whether you would catch a cold and get sick, so I immediately wrote a letter to Nantong, never knowing that you would never see it.

You boarded the ship around ten o'clock, and it is said that the wind on the Bund was already very strong at that time. Your heart was set on going home, and you insisted on leaving. Now, I only hate myself for not seeing you off. Usually, I cared about every little thing about you, but this time I was so careless and negligent. If I had seen you to the pier and seen how treacherous the wind was and how high the waves were on the river, I would have kept you from going. It was I who let you go alone, which led to this unexpected tragedy. Jie, I will regret this for the rest of my life, and I will never be able to ask for your forgiveness.

Jie, you were such a filial son to your aging father. That year, when the puppet army arrested him, you went to take his place. Usually, when your father had a minor illness, you couldn't sleep or eat in peace, let alone now that he is seriously ill. You also loved children so much, no wonder your nephews and nieces all adored you. Every time you went to your second sister's house, the first thing you did was hug her little Shanghai. Three months ago, we returned to Nantong together, carrying many things. You were mindful of the safety of the fetus, and when going up and down the piers, you not only carried things yourself but also supported me, telling me to be careful. When I went out to take the streetcar, you would always say, "Be careful, don't squeeze on if it's too crowded." When I was tired from doing things, you would ask, "Are you comfortable?" Your heart was filled with the joy of becoming a father. Who would have thought that by the time the child was born, he would no longer see his loving father? Some people feel sorry for me because of this, but I am grateful that you left me this little memento. When you left, you said, "Come home early after school, don't squeeze on the streetcar, and take good care of the child." We both laughed when you said the last sentence. Who would have thought that a joke would become a prophecy, and that it would be your only will? Now, what you are most concerned about is still your father and your child. I will serve your father as you would have done. I bought the medicine he needs yesterday. I will also do my best to raise this child who is about to be born to comfort you—the father who suffered misfortune for his grandfather. We had wanted to give him a good name. Now, no matter what the sound is like, I want to name him "June Ninth." On the one hand, to commemorate his grandfather's sixty-ninth birthday this year, and also to commemorate the day of your tragic event, June 9th!

Jie, I never imagined that our separation in life would be so tragic, and that our separation in death would be so swift! Everyone who knows us feels saddened, and even my students are shedding tears. We had even dreamed of celebrating our silver and gold wedding anniversaries one day, but who knew that we would only be together for nine months? In the ci poem you wrote on our wedding night, you said, "The journey is long, let us steer the helm together from today." Who knew that our boat of shared life would not even reach halfway before I was left to sail alone? Originally, a person's life and death are not a big deal, especially in this era, it is even more common. But you were too young, you were only twenty-three years old; you would have graduated from Jiaotong University in one year, but what you learned could not be put to use—and you left so suddenly, so tragically. I doubt myself that I am dreaming. I don’t believe that someone as upright and pure as you would be swallowed by the waves.

Jie, have you come home to see me these past few days? But I haven't been able to bring myself to go back. I can't bear to look at anything in the house. Every item is filled with deep memories, and whenever I see them, tears well up in my eyes.

My older brother and brother-in-law have been running around all day, but I no longer have the courage or strength. Jie, I only ask that I find you soon, so that I can see your face one last time, so that I can prostrate myself beside you, cry bitterly, and lay you to rest in a place where you can sleep peacefully. From now on, I can only imagine that you are a traveler far away, wandering in an unknown foreign land. Though near, yet so far, may we meet in my dreams, may we reunite after my death. Following this letter, I will continue to write to you to entrust my unentrustable emotions and to comfort your lonely heart.

The day before yesterday, I found some of your books, manuscripts, and letters at my second sister's house. I didn't think much of them when they were lost before, but now they are so precious. When I am in a better mood, I will organize them together with the things at home. Jie, your soul will live on with these things, and you will always live in my heart, in the hearts of many relatives and friends. I'll talk to you again, Jie. (June 14th)

### Symphony in White

— Hui Sile

Hui Sile (J. Whistler 1834-1903) was not a truly British painter. Because he lived in Britain, historians included him in British art history. Throughout his life, he yearned for the East, and his style was rich in Eastern sentiment. His colors had a musical effect, and his painting titles often used musical terms. For example, this painting, in which a white-clad woman leans against a white stone fireplace mantel, he named "Symphony in White." Other representative works include "Arrangement in Grey and Black" (i.e., the portrait of his mother), "Nocturne in Blue and Gold," etc. These works were met with ridicule and mockery at the time, but today they have become world-famous masterpieces and are treasured in the British Royal Art Museum.

### Offering

— Mo Qin

When the trumpet creeper once again flashes its blood-red flowers, it will have been a full year since you passed away.

A few sprigs of snapdragons, your favorite flower in life, several bouquets of fresh flowers, and a sincere incense offering have all been brought to your grave. This is all I can do for you now.

You let others bury you, but why didn't you take my thoughts with you? Your voice and smile constantly and deeply pierce my memory. I will not forget these harmonies of life. Yes, I know that I caused you some unhappiness in life, but a reasonable person like you, a wise person like you, must understand my true feelings. If you didn't think of it the way I did, let me state myself again here.

I have never had the desire to live long. I have only been in this world for over twenty years, but the coldness of humanity has already chilled my heart. So-called happiness is merely a patch of cloud in the sky during the rainy season. The appearance of these clouds is merely a prelude to the coming storm. Once the storm passes, they dissipate. Before the smile after grasping happiness has subsided, one is already crying for destruction. Why let human affairs play with our emotions? Limited joy is the source of infinite sorrow. Therefore, I don't want others to enter my circle of life. Wouldn't it be better for me to swallow my pain alone? Life is merely a debt. By using up years, and enduring all kinds of ancient difficulties, one can find peace. I cannot create happiness for others, so what reason do I have to ask others to share my pain? You said you could make me happy, and of course I trust you. However, I don't trust 'happiness' itself. In order to avoid future troubles, let happiness live forever in fantasy. Therefore, I did not accept your offer. I don't need to explain in words how much my heart hurt when I silently met your doubtful and condemning gaze. Let time be my witness. Who knew, who knew that you would live even shorter than I did? You ultimately couldn't wait for my explanation!

When you finished your studies and went to the mainland, at the pier, I said a lot to your gloomy face: "Be more open-minded, don't be too narrow-minded in your feelings; too narrow-minded feelings will only cause pain, and it's not clever to take life too seriously; change your goals, change your path, and it may make you more fortunate. Lift your head up and give me a bright smile! We will always, always be good friends." You smiled and waved your handkerchief as expected, and I reluctantly felt relieved and smiled with you. I never thought that this would be the last time I would see your smile, and that this smile would turn into tears.

Along the way, you told me about many of the situations along the way, and even wrote down the strange customs in a relaxed style. This was my comfort. I felt at peace and joyful, as if I had been pardoned. You arrived at the mountain city, and you had a good job. Naturally, you had your well-positioned father there, and your path wouldn't be too rugged. You said you often played poker and stayed up all night in clubs; you also attended parties, you drank alcohol, and smoked cigarettes. I was really worried about your drinking. Also, these behaviors were very different from your habit of loving snapdragons. How much I hoped that you could maintain that simple, unadorned nature of the past.

I hoped that you would live a regular life, I hoped that you would walk your own path well, and I hoped even more that you would find a fellow traveler and develop a satisfying living environment. I hoped and hoped, but thousands of hopes fell through! You came back, and what came back was a soulless body. After receiving the news of your father's setting up a memorial altar for you, I didn't have the courage to come to pay my respects. How could I bear to see your father's white hair and your mother's tearful eyes? Your younger sister also gave me a resentful look. Of course, I don't blame her at all. She wouldn't understand my original intention. The affection between siblings always outweighs the friendship between classmates. Whenever I saw the black gauze on her arm, I always lowered my head in pain. In order to avoid future misfortune, I created a deeper trauma instead. I let the emotions I held back destroy your life. If I had known this, I shouldn't have been so selfish. How do you want me to wash away this guilt in my heart?

The flowering crabapple in Kaiyuan Temple is blooming again, and the new lotus in Canglang Pavilion has sprouted through the water. However, there are no longer any traces of our travels here. The color of my youthful smiles has faded. In order to atone for you, I am willing to endure all kinds of punishments.

You weren't lonely when you were alive, and you aren't after death; life must be repaid with life. Then, give me another bright smile! (June, the thirty-fifth year)

### Dusk

— Chen Pei

The room began to darken. I put down my pen and stared out the window in a daze.

How many days, on that misty river, a faint new moon lined the blue sky, hazily covering the distant mountains, the water flowed, the wind sang, and the boats dreamed silently... I! A wanderer, spending several dusks.

Once upon a time, I had abandoned that life on the water, accompanied by a pen, a few sheets of paper, letting the dusk carry loneliness, gnawing at a bleak heart.

Reminiscence

Under the lamp at dusk, facing a dried peach blossom, I unfolded my reminiscence.

I brought it from the distant Jialing River, and now it has been two years, and I still keep it.

It brought me a string of dim days, and it also brought me the labor of daytime, and even more, it brought me many poems, in these full two years.

Sometimes, it can also allow the light of my thoughts to shine on my beautiful girl, think about the rising moon, and send distant reminiscence.

Ox

I dreamed: I turned into an ox,

Running laboriously, panting heavily, whip on the back, sweat on the face, until I died.

Awake! I thought: Those who control people and those who are controlled, the dreams of the day and the dreams of the night, are the same.

Life is originally an ox plowing life! Ah!

### Song and Dance Girls of the Tang Dynasty

— Dong Meikan

The Li Tang dynasty inherited the song and dance of the previous dynasties, and created many new tunes. The musical and song parts of dramas became more complete in this dynasty. Because Emperor Gaozu of Tang followed the old system of the Sui dynasty and used nine music ensembles at the beginning of the Wude period, and later set up the Jiaofang (music bureau) in the forbidden palace, which was responsible for teaching music and managing the actors and musicians. Emperor Taizong established the Ten Music Ensembles of Hao Yanle, and the sounds and lyrics tended to be complex. There were fourteen modes and two hundred and twenty-two tunes recorded. In the second year of the Kaiyuan period of Emperor Xuanzong, this music-loving emperor set up the Jiaofang next to the Penglai Palace, and set up left and right Jiaofang in the capital, dividing the music into sitting and standing departments. There were eight standing performance teams and six sitting performance teams. The Jiaofang system continued until the Yongzheng period of the Qing dynasty before it was abolished. In addition, Emperor Xuanzong also set up the Liyuan (Pear Garden) to teach actors and musicians with eleven short-piece songs and twenty Yunshao songs.

Emperor Xuanzong not only loved music and promoted it, but he was also a musician himself. Wang Dang of the Song dynasty said in his "Tang Yulin":

"Emperor Xuanzong was proficient in music, both in string and wind instruments, all of which he mastered with great skill. He created many tunes at will, as if without effort; he especially loved the jieqi and horizontal flute, and said that the eight tones were the leaders, and other music could not compare with them..."

Therefore, he cannot be compared with those emperors who encouraged song and dance only because they loved entertainment. There were many measures related to this at the time, of which the establishment of Jiaofang and Liyuan was naturally the most important. In the early Tang dynasty, all elegant and popular music was under the jurisdiction of the Taichang Temple, which managed rituals for the imperial ancestral temples. In the second year of Kaiyuan, Emperor Xuanzong designated Taichang as the Ritual and Music Department, which was a more solemn official office and should not manage actors and musicians. Therefore, he set up the left and right Jiaofang next to the Penglai Palace, and each had its own specialty.

Cui Lingqing of the Tang dynasty wrote in his "Jiaofang Ji": "The Right Jiaofang of Xijing is located in Guangzhai Fang, and the Left Jiaofang is located in Yanzheng Fang. The right side is good at singing, and the left side is good at dancing, which is a habit..."

From these words, it can be inferred that the Jiaofang situation at that time must have been that one side specialized in teaching singing and the other side specialized in teaching dancing. In the Jiaofang, most of them were beginners called "zongtan jia" (all-around players). It seems that the Liyuan had a bit of a comprehensive teaching nature. The Jiaofang and Liyuan were certainly the same thing, but perhaps there was a distinction between elementary and advanced levels. If this guess is correct, I believe that the Jiaofang was the elementary level, teaching ordinary palace women ordinary singing and dancing skills; while the Liyuan was the advanced level, concentrating some palace women who already had expertise or some who had particularly good qualities, and Emperor Xuanzong himself taught them. Would the female musicians of the Jiaofang only be called Liyuan disciples after they had been promoted in rank? According to what is recorded in the Treatise on Ritual and Music in the Book of Tang, it seems to contain this kind of meaning. The book says;

"Emperor Ming knew music and loved Faqu. He selected three hundred disciples of the sitting performance team to teach in the Liyuan. If there was any error in the sound, the emperor would be able to correct it. They were called Emperor's Liyuan disciples. Several hundred palace women were also called Liyuan disciples, and they lived in the Liyuan of Yichun Courtyard."

The same book also says: "In the eleventh year of Kaiyuan, Shengshou Music was first created, and women were ordered to wear clothes of five colors to sing and dance. The female teachers of Yichun Courtyard could perform on stage in one day, but the zongtan jia could not complete it in a month. On the day of the performance, the emperor ordered the people of Yichun Courtyard to be the beginning and end, and the zongtan jia to be in the middle, learning their gestures..."

From this, we can see that there was a difference in skill between the zongtan jia and the Liyuan disciples. I think it was also the difference in the ranks of Jiaofang and Liyuan. There were many musical pieces sung and danced at that time, but it is impossible to say for sure whether there were as many as Bai Juyi exaggerated, "thousands of songs and ten thousand dances are uncountable," which is unbelievable. The "Tang Liudian" and "Wenxian Tongkao" recorded more than fifty pieces. Therefore, each performance must first advance the names of the pieces for selection, because there were too many, and they could not all be performed completely. The "Jiaofang Ji" says:

"Whenever a song is performed, the officials must first advance the name of the piece. The emperor dances to the ones marked with ink, and not to the ones not marked. The advance of the tune is called jindian ri. When the inner musicians perform the dance, the Jiaofang people can only dance Yizhou Wutian Chonglai Die, and they cannot leave these two pieces. All the rest is left to the inner people." (The same book says: "When a prostitute enters Yichun Courtyard, she is called 'inner person,' or 'front person,' because she is always in front.")

Moreover, the scale of the songs and dances at that time was also very large, with as many as nine hundred people in some cases, and no fewer than one hundred and forty people in others. The Old Book of Tang's Musical History once said: "In the first month of the second year of Changshou, Empress Wu Zetian personally offered sacrifices at the Wuxiang Temple. Before this, she had created the Great Music of the Divine Palace, and the dance used nine hundred people. At this time, they danced in the courtyard of the Divine Palace." It also said: "Shengshou Music was composed by Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu. The dancers numbered one hundred and forty people." Using so many people cannot really be considered a lot before the Tianbao era. Du Fu said: "The late emperor's palace maids numbered eight thousand," and Bai Juyi said: "The harem had three thousand beauties." The New Book of Tang also said that there were probably forty thousand people. Then, there were at least the number Bai said, and selecting nearly a thousand people from several thousand beauties can still be considered a careful selection.

### The Forgotten Island - Ryukyu

— Ya Yi Translation

After Japan surrendered, there were calls throughout the country to "return Ryukyu." Ryukyu is indeed the eastern wall of our country. Didn't Japan first jump over this wall before looking for a way to break in? Didn't the US military pay the price of 35,000 casualties in Okinawa? Its importance can be imagined. Recently, it is said that Japan has requested to co-manage the islands with the United States. When the Chinese people heard this, they were outraged. The status of Ryukyu is still being decided. We have a layer of separation from Ryukyu, which has been away from the embrace of the motherland for sixty or seventy years. Furthermore, domestic reporters rarely go there to report, so I will give a brief introduction:

The fierce battle fought by the US military in the southern part of Okinawa two years ago still leaves a trail of wreckage behind. In Naha, there used to be 65,000 people, and foreign trade was still fairly developed. Today, it is also covered with rubble. There are two military highways connecting it to the US military bases on the island.

In the northern mountains, it is believed that many small numbers of scattered Japanese soldiers are still hiding. Venturing into old bases, broken walls, or other dangerous places often results in being killed by Japanese landmines or traps.

Organized Japanese forces were wiped out after eighty-two days of fierce fighting, until June 11, 1945. In that battle, the US military suffered 15,000 deaths and more than 20,000 injuries, including the commander of the US Tenth Army, General Buckner, and a war correspondent, Bell.

For two years, no better houses have been built. The US military lives in temporary huts, while hundreds of thousands of natives live in shacks that are unfit for human habitation. They only eat food that the United States shipped in previously, because there is a lack of fertilizer, fishing boats, and other equipment.

The officials in Washington who will determine the fate of the island are now paying attention to the situation in Europe.

"Post-war Okinawa has been forgotten," a local US leader told a reporter. "When a senior official happens to fly from Washington to Tokyo or Shanghai and passes through this place, he may say that Okinawa has no strategic value to the United States, but unexpectedly, he doesn't say anything."

US military leaders are unwilling to make public statements, but it is clear that they all hope to clarify the status of the island and announce the plans set by the United States as soon as possible. The local government has done its best, but its effectiveness has not been great due to a lack of funds and limited authority. Several coral roads have been completed, and the wartime airport is being improved and expanded. Furthermore, there are already many wooden houses to supply US military families who are permitted to come here.

The most glorious place on the island, and the one that busy traveling reporters cannot visit, is the five large tombs of the martyrs. That pure place shows their bravery and heroism even more. The majority of loyal souls will forever sleep in a foreign land, and the troops stationed on the island can also be proud to guard these loyal remains.

"These martyrs are forever accusing us, the most sympathetic accusation." An old military officer said to me: "We feel that the majority of brave young men, if they have souls, must think that this place is the best place, and we are certain that this place will become a permanent American shrine."

### Adventure at Yangguan - Story Three of Hasa

— Piao Yuan

Hasa is a Muslim. I don’t know why, but he seems to have a deep hatred for Muslims in the interior. He doesn’t touch them unless necessary, but when he does, he kills them!

In the 31st year of the Republic of China, Lei Yuchen, an alumnus of the Art Academy, went to Dunhuang with the Northwest Cultural Relics Investigation Team. Because of the investigation, he wanted to go near Yangguan. The county magistrate of Dunhuang said: "That won't work, right? There are Hasa tribesmen there!" Lei-Jun, perhaps in addition to adventuring for the Northwest cultural relics, he may have been planning to take a chance for the frontier ethnic groups. He must go. The county magistrate had no choice but to send four armed policemen and a surveying staff member to go with him.

“Sure enough,” Lei Jun said with wide eyes, as if he saw the Hasa coming from afar, “We had been there for not long. We were laughing to ourselves, laughing at those who had intentionally exaggerated. Weren’t we coming? Where? Where are the Hasa?” Hey, someone yelled out, yelling so scary, saying the Hasa were coming, bang, bang, bang... Before I even had time to see, the police who came with us opened fire, and already, one was injured and one was dead!”

"At this time, it seemed that I also saw that there were three or four horses behind, with people with bird feathers in their heads sitting on the horses. There's no question, these were really the Hasa! The police were still fighting them, and we ran! Ran, ran, ran so hard that we couldn't catch our breath, didn't stop at all, all four policemen were killed, and three Hasa horses had already caught up! Bang, bang, bang, they kept shooting from behind. I thought: It's over, I'm going to die this time no matter what!"

"Fortunately, I only knew one sentence of Hasa language! Seeing that they had already caught up, and the surveyor had been knocked down by them, I didn't care about anything, raised my hand and said in Hasa: "I am a Han Chinese!" I don't know if it was the effect of this sentence, or if the camera that my companion was carrying attracted their attention. I seemed to see them get off their horses and walk towards my companion. I didn't care about life and death and ran away in a flash!"

After Mr. Lei finished speaking, he let out a long breath, as if those three Hasa had just run away.

These stories made me believe that the Hasa, though they have a stupid and ugly appearance, have a smart and beautiful soul; if they can be properly educated, they will have their golden age.

### A Small Teacher's Life

— Han Guang

On June 3rd, I read a dispatch from Shou County in a certain newspaper, about Sun Jianru, a Chinese language teacher at Shou County Middle School, who wrote a couplet: "Deceiving ghosts with writings, cheating people with career; shouting on the streets is but a begging life." I couldn't help but feel deeply moved; hence, I picked this topic to write about trivial matters.

I am currently working as a primary school teacher in a certain town in northern Jiangsu. Since the beginning of the semester until now, it has been over four months, and I have only received 50,000 yuan and two shi and eight dou of rice. I have a wife and a child at home, and the seven necessities of life are all indispensable. We have been out of rice for a long time, relying solely on borrowing money to survive. Unable to borrow, we have no choice but to sell our belongings. The day before yesterday, after discussing it with my wife again and again, we reluctantly sold our wedding souvenir: a good mirror and two new chairs, at a low price, for a total of 48,000 yuan. Yesterday, I bought over twenty jin of firewood and one dou of wheat, which has already used up half; the rest, I can see, will soon be used up. If I have to sell again, there is only a leather suitcase for clothes left. But, how much can it be worth? And how many more days can it support us?

### Overpopulation

— Dan Meng

Malthus's explanation of the population problem is generally considered to have explored the secrets of mankind. However, his conclusion is very pessimistic, and not only temporarily pessimistic but eternally pessimistic, expressing the most irresistible depression about the fate and destination of the entire human race. Since he established this theory, a shadow of terror has been planted among all nations, and psychologically they have never been able to relax. At the same time, inherited wars and famines seem to prove it. For half a century, this has been a fact that people have hesitated to deny, making wisdom and power feel useless and incapable.

China's vast land and abundant resources have comparatively diminished in value today. The only thing that can still be boasted about is its large population, which reminds people of the genius Malthus and his worrying theory.

Before our eyes, a series of unpleasant scenes are erupting and spreading. Unemployment, displacement, suicide, and even abandoned houses, commodity prices, and other problems are mostly believed to be due to the severely harmful effects of population size. From countless symptoms, some believe that besides Malthus's explanation, it seems that we have grasped the crux of our circle, and it is difficult to find other reasons.

Therefore, the followers or admirers of Sanger are calling out with compassion to good men and women, advocating birth control, saying that this is a necessary measure to care for the second generation. But in this difficult environment, besides a small number of people who are well-fed and comfortable and can still reproduce their "excellent" children, most people are probably already regarding childbirth as the most frightening misfortune in life. The rates of infanticide and abortion in China remain high.

Furthermore, judging from the recent rice-snatching incidents in various places, we cannot help but wonder whether it is overpopulation or the isolation of the population from food supplies that has caused these tragedies. Magnificent garden mansions are only inhabited by one family and their servants, while each person in the poor people's burrows has only three or four square meters of space. Shops in China are stocked with goods or clothing and other necessities, but there is a lack of sales channels, and even scantily clad women and children fill the streets. Is it overpopulation? China's population density is not higher than that of certain wealthy countries.

Resisting Malthus's theory is "mutual aid theory," which is optimistic and gives hope to humanity, and even more gives people cooperation in line with the future. If we continue to use overpopulation as an excuse and allow all kinds of unfair evils to continue, it is shameful, and this is not a reason for mankind to evade responsibility. We should say that the population is not excessive, but the spirit of mutual aid among the population has not been fully developed. Malthus, a defender of human misdeeds, must not introduce his fallacy into our already unfortunate circle!

### The New Imperial Envoy: An Interesting Play about Meixian, Guangdong

— Dong Liu

When Gogol wrote "The Government Inspector," he certainly had a basis. This satirical play exposed the truth of the officialdom of 19th-century Tsarist Russia. Its effect may not be less than China's "A Record of Officialdom Exposed." Comparing Gogol's realistic technique with Li Boyuan is somewhat inappropriate, but the attitude between the two is somewhat similar: both hold a burst of grief and indignation in their laughter and scolding.

In the real society of China, interesting dramas similar to "The Government Inspector" have often occurred recently. A barber-like person, blinded by money, fantasized and even invited a few tea servers and mud workers to northern Jiangsu to impersonate "commissioners." This news caused a sensation last year. There was also a dismissed staff member of the Salt Affairs Bureau in Hangzhou who borrowed the business card of a certain director, and went around spreading rumors and swindling, saying that he was about to become the county magistrate of a certain county. Whoever was willing to pay a certain amount of money, he could appoint them to official positions such as "section chief" and "director." He also had a letter of introduction from the celebrity Shen Junru, and his conversation was also quite elegant, so quite a few people were deceived. Similar news, once published, was always titled "'New Imperial Envoy' Appears," which shows that Gogol's satirical play is very familiar to Chinese intellectuals.

Recently, a Guangzhou correspondent of Ta Kung Pao provided another story about a "new imperial envoy." Although the incident is ordinary, it is also very typical. It turns out that there was a person named Zhang Xuehong, who was originally a retired staff member of the Personnel Section of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Not long ago, he arrived in Meizhou with two fashionable girls, claiming to be an inspector from the Personnel Department of the Provincial Government. Yang Youmin, the Speaker of the local county council, wanted to take this opportunity to sue the Meixian County Magistrate. He held a grand banquet, inviting local gentry to accompany him. After the banquet, he handed over a secret letter to Zhang "inspector" to be forwarded to Chairman Luo Zhuoying, and gifted him travel expenses. Unexpectedly, the county government had also learned that the provincial inspector was visiting the county, so it could not help but quickly make some new arrangements, preparing to receive him. If someone had not discovered that the two girls Zhang "inspector" brought were originally famous local prostitutes from Xingning County, our "inspector adult" would have had many more days of happiness. Unfortunately, clowns are only suitable for playing five-cent roles. When the matter was exposed, the "inspector adult" had no choice but to be imprisoned.

Realistic satirical plays, although based on real stories, still have exaggeration, emphasis, and criticism. However, in the hands of artistic masters, this exaggeration and emphasis are not noticed by ordinary people. In fact, in Gogol's eyes, "Inspector Zhang" of Meixian is a very humorous figure. He has unwittingly revealed the secret of bureaucracy prevalent in China with his personal account.

What is strange is not only the "inspector adult's" flaunting of prostitutes, but why did Speaker Yang want to "hold a grand banquet" and even "gift travel expenses"? If the Meixian County Magistrate really had illegal behavior, as the Speaker, he could follow judicial procedures and file a lawsuit. If it was just for a little personal grudge, wouldn't the Speaker's banquet and travel expenses become the object of people's criticism? On the other hand, the Meixian County Magistrate did not start from the aspect of governing, but when he heard that the "inspector" was coming, he "quickly made some new arrangements, preparing to receive him." It can also be said that he was deeply poisoned by bureaucracy. In this report, the most embarrassing figures are the two local prostitutes from Xingning County, and the most novel feeling is also for these two prostitutes. Just imagine how respectful they were of the officialdom at first. When they discovered that there were such muddled things in the officialdom, wouldn't they turn from "astonishment" to a mocking smile?

### Butcher

— Xu Xiaonan

On June 17th, Langmi Cun Chunxi of Changshu was executed by shooting in Shanghai, sending condolences to Mr. Gong Qiren, who suffered greatly from the wolf disaster. The short bandit did not know this day of his death. Tens of thousands of people emptied the streets to butcher the wolf; the blood debt of Yushan was finally settled, and he should regret his tyranny in those years.

### Plastic Music Cries

— Guo Hua

It is obvious that what is called plastic here is the kind of material made of plastic that has been popular all over the world in recent years. Because most of them are as transparent as glass, we call them plastic. Some people think that calling plastic glass is a bit "old-fashioned." In fact, this name is not unique to Chinese people, even the most fashionable Americans have this name themselves.

Let's say that in 1939 there was a steel musician and band leader named Billy Glass who went to visit the New York World's Fair. In the "Glass Palace," the crystal products made him amazed. Therefore, he suddenly had an idea that if there was an orchestra, all of whose instruments were made of glass, and led by a musician named Glass, how interesting would that be? He dreamed of a "Billy Glass's Glass Symphony Orchestra," and visited plastic manufacturers and musical instrument companies, hoping that they could manufacture this kind of instrument, but they regarded it as absurd and ridiculous and ignored it.

But Mr. Glass persevered. He bought many glass raw materials himself and hid in the kitchen to start manufacturing. He used a high heat of two to fifty degrees to create the first violin. The sound of this plastic violin is comparable to that of a wooden one, its only disadvantage being that the volume seems less rich. After that, he manufactured five more violins, as well as other guitars, trumpets, drums, and other instruments. Hollywood and manufacturers began to become interested in these plastic instruments, but it will probably take considerable time and improvement for these instruments to become popular and replace wooden Stradivarius violins.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

Old Zhu was really taken aback. When he pressed the water bottle to Feifei's mouth again, both of his hands were trembling violently. In this desolate wilderness where there was no one around, and the time was close to midnight, no matter how brave he was, he couldn't help but worry about the child's illness.

Later, Feifei took a few sips of water, which finally made Old Zhu breathe a sigh of relief.

He calmed down and thought: According to the old villager, it was only twenty-four li from Guanxi to Nandan if you took this shortcut. Even if you add some, and count it as thirty li, then he must have walked at least half of it. If he walked faster, he could probably finish the other half in three hours. Judging from Feifei's current condition, it was really necessary to get to Nandan as soon as possible. So he stood up without hesitation, first took out the more valuable and necessary small items in the box one by one, and stuffed them randomly into every pocket of his clothes and pants. He decided not to take the remaining items and the leather suitcase, because he dared not let Feifei rest on his back again. He was prepared to carry her in both hands and "walk on the road."

He ran desperately on the dirt road like a defeated soldier, while also having to lower his head from time to time to pay attention to Feifei in his arms.

Feifei seemed to have fallen asleep again. Old Zhu gently took the bronze male rabbit from her hand, fearing that such a heavy thing would damage Feifei's heart.

He hid the steel rabbit and tried his best to cheer up, walking one step at a time; sweat drenched his whole body. He would occasionally free up his right hand, randomly pull out something from his pocket or pants pocket - maybe it was a undershirt, or even pants, he had no time to distinguish - and wipe his face and neck randomly.

The time was already past midnight.
