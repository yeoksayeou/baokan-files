Qingdao, Ju County, and other important strongholds also have strong troop deployments. To realize the new deployments, the National Army has made strategic retreats in some other areas.

### Threat to Xi'an Lifted

Reports of National Army Attacking Yan'an Are Inaccurate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Recently, there have been rumors that the National Army is launching an offensive towards Yan'an. This reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the situation. According to the spokesperson, the Communist forces in Shaanxi attacked the National Army in the Tongrun Town area west of Chunhua on January 25th and captured the town on February 2nd. They then regrouped their forces in an attempt to threaten Xi'an. Furthermore, the Communist forces have recently been using Malan Town as a base to sell drugs within the National Army's territory, forcing the National Army to counterattack. The fighting lasted for three days, from the 18th to the 21st, and the aforementioned threat has been lifted, and the fighting in that area has come to an end. The rumor that the National Army is about to attack Yan'an is inaccurate.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] Since the Communist Yan'an headquarters issued a general mobilization order for the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 20th, in addition to actively expanding military strongholds in western Shanxi and southern Suiyuan, its troops in the Guanzhong District, with Malan Town as the center (where the Communist Guanzhong Special Commissioner's Office is located), have been developing in the east, west, and south directions, completely exposing their attempt to seize Xi'an and Xianyang. As evidenced by the general mobilization order from the Yan'an headquarters, this action is a planned invasion. The National Army began its counteroffensive on the 18th of this month and, after days of fighting, recovered Malan Town, the capital of the Communist Guanzhong region, on the 20th, effectively sealing off this pocket-shaped area.

### Freight Train on the Beining Railway, Jin-Yu Section, Derails After Being Blown Up

### Communist Li Xiannian's Forces Attempt to Flee to Sichuan Unsuccessful

Repelled by Garrison After Reaching Wuxi

[Our Chengdu Dispatch] After being repelled by the security forces in Badong, Hubei, Communist Li Xiannian's forces recently showed a trend of sneaking into Sichuan. Over 2,000 of their vanguard troops have sneaked into Wuxi, Sichuan. They were immediately defeated by the 28th and 29th Regiments dispatched by the 10th Division of the local garrison and have now retreated to the border area between Wushan and Sichuan-Hubei. According to Wang Yuanhui, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Government Security Department, in a report at the expanded commemorative week of the Sichuan-Kang-Qian-E Border Pacification Headquarters, Li Xiannian's forces are weak and unable to flee to Sichuan. Currently, the National Army in northern Sichuan has advanced to the Shaanxi and Hubei provinces, implementing strict defense. The troops of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei Border Pacification Headquarters have also extended their defense lines, separately defending against possible infiltration routes of the Communist forces. If the Communist forces attempt to move towards Sichuan, they will undoubtedly be annihilated.

He was then dispatched to Nanjing as a staff officer, and after arriving in the defensive areas of Yuhuatai, etc., he confirmed that his research was correct. When asked "Was Tani Hisao the first to enter the city?" he replied that the Zhongshan Gate was breached first, and then the Zhonghua Gate. At this time, the defendant Tani again requested permission to summon Japanese witnesses, otherwise there would be no fair trial. The presiding judge said: Is the defendant's unit responsible for the Nanjing Massacre? The court has not yet ruled on whether the defendant is responsible for the killing of more than 300,000 people in Nanjing. How can it be said that it is unfair?

Glimpses of the Truth in the Besieged City

A powerful piece of evidence was then presented, which was sent by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, a book titled "Tears of Blood in the Fallen Capital" written by Guo Qi, who is now at the Army University. It described the facts of the massacre in the city. Guo participated in the battle and struggled to escape from Nanjing for three days. The killing situation was roughly as follows: (1) More than 30 civilians were forced into an ice-covered pond to catch fish. If they obeyed, they would freeze to death in the pond. If they did not obey, they would be killed; (2) An old man was hung from a tree with a rope and used as a target, and the old man was shot to death; (3) After the Japanese army raped a woman, they forced her son to rape his mother and clapped and laughed beside them; (4) A 17-year-old girl disguised as a man to leave the city, but was discovered. She was immediately raped. At the same time, a Chinese person passed by, and they were ordered to rape her. When the four people refused and were begging, a monk passed by, and they immediately ordered the monk to rape her. The monk refused and was killed with a knife; (5) Every night, the Japanese army would form groups of three or five, cross the safe zone, residential areas, and climb over walls to rape, which was called "fishing"! (6) Women were deliberately lured out, and then at night, they would go to their residences to rape them, which was called fishing. Then Guo Qi was summoned to testify about what he had witnessed at the time.

Investigation of Japanese Army Atrocities

The presiding judge then announced the Japanese army atrocities investigated by the International Committee, totaling 425 cases. There were 190,000 people who were collectively massacred, more than 100,000 people who were sporadically massacred, and 816 cases with records, including 368 cases in the Zhonghua Gate area. The defendant Tani quibbled, saying that there was fierce fighting at the time and that there were no residents in the Zhonghua Gate area at all, let alone women. The presiding judge immediately asked if he could guarantee that he had not killed a single person during his time in Nanjing. The defendant Tani had no answer. It was already 12 o'clock, and the judge announced a recess.

Tani Quibbles Persistently

The court resumed at 2 PM. The defendant Tani first responded, speaking for two hours, quibbling throughout. Summarizing his meaning: (1) The area was not within his defensive zone, (2) There were no residents during the period of fierce fighting, so no massacre could have occurred, etc., with seven points of argument, using "fabricated," "untrue," "vague," and "deliberately forged" as adjectives, and insulting the court, calling this unfair trial unprecedented in the world. Finally, he insisted that summoning Yanagawa was a sacred matter, and that this situation was simply a stain. The defendant could not accept it willingly. Throughout his entire defense, he repeated the sentence, "At that time, there was fierce fighting in the Zhonghua Gate area, and there were no people at all, so this could not have happened!" eleven times. The presiding judge stopped him from speaking.

Lawyer Argues for the Death Penalty

Lawyer Mei Zuguang then argued on behalf of the prosecution, stating briefly: The defendant was one of the unit commanders and could not be held solely responsible for the crime of the massacre. It could not be said that he had committed the crime of destroying peace and violating humanity. Prosecutor Chen Guangyu then responded to the various points quibbled by the defendant, mainly as follows. The defendant made the following points in his defense: (1) He was leading troops in China, (2) His military discipline was good, (3) He did not know about the massacre in advance, (4) He was not responsible for his defensive zone, (5) It was vague and uncertain, (6) There was no one in Zhonghua Gate at that time, etc., but (1) the orders of the Dharma were not to be obeyed, (2) if the defendant's military discipline was good, whose military discipline was not good? (3) Was the defendant responsible for the killing of more than 300,000 people in Nanjing? (4) Was the defensive zone designated in advance? Was there an order? Was there a document? (5) The documents we presented were not forged, so the defendant was indeed guilty of violating humanitarian crimes, destroying peace crimes, and war crimes, and we argue that he should be sentenced to death. It was already 6 PM, and the presiding judge announced that the debate would resume at 2 PM on March 3rd.

### After Signing and Responding to My First Note, the Philippine Foreign Minister Reaffirms His Position; Whether to Resume Negotiations Depends on China's Attitude

[Associated Press, Manila, 25th dispatch] Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino declared today, after the Chinese Envoy to the Philippines delivered the reply note, that it is reasonable for the Philippines to request the inclusion of a reciprocal clause in the draft treaty of friendship. According to his disclosure, the Chinese government insists on including a most-favored-nation clause in the draft. If so, all the advantages granted to China in the treaty will force the Philippine government to grant the same conditions to other third countries at the same time. However, the Chinese note has already recognized that the benefits granted by the Philippine government to the United States and its people should be treated separately. Quirino said that the Chinese Envoy opposed the reciprocal clause with the following wording: "Under similar circumstances, if China allows the same benefits to other third countries, these benefits should be given to the Philippines under the same terms and conditions." Quirino insisted that the clauses supported by the majority of Filipinos were proposed after careful consideration of our desire to eliminate disputes. He solemnly stated: If this proposal cannot be accepted by China, we hope that China will consider the reasons for the rejection based on the merits of the proposal, and not say that the negotiators on the non-government side lack sincerity.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th dispatch] When Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Averica was asked by this agency's reporter whether there was any possibility of resuming negotiations now that Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino had stated that the Philippine government's "attitude towards China is extremely friendly" and that it was prepared to resume negotiations to reach a treaty that would satisfy both countries, he replied: "Whether to resume negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty depends on the Chinese government." He said that "the Chinese government is the one who stopped these negotiations." When discussing the four Filipinization laws that discriminated against overseas Chinese mentioned by Chinese officials in the press, Aversa argued that only one of the four laws had been finalized as law.

### Saigon Fire

It Was Someone Who Deliberately Set the Fire

Overseas Chinese Request the Consul to Intervene

[Reuters, Saigon, 24th dispatch] A fire broke out in the Jiang'an district of Saigon last month, leaving 18,000 Chinese and Vietnamese people homeless. After the incident, overseas Chinese found incendiary bombs at the fire site, which proved that someone deliberately set the fire. Therefore, the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese have petitioned the Chinese Consul General, requesting him to negotiate with the French side for protection. According to Dai Kuisheng, Vice Minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of China, who inspected Nanyang and arrived here, 8,000 overseas Chinese suffered significant losses in the French-Vietnamese negotiations in Vietnam. In the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations in Indonesia, thousands of overseas Chinese died. Dai said that during his visit to various countries in Nanyang, he also discussed issues such as immigration restrictions with Myanmar and Siam.

### There is Only One Doctor for Every 80,000 People in Our Country: United Nations Expert Elso Speaks

[United Nations, San Francisco, 24th dispatch] United Nations medical expert Elso, who spent a year and a half in China, returned here today. According to him, three-quarters of the deaths in China can be saved at an extremely low cost. The remedies are nothing more than promoting hygiene, improving nutrition, and increasing the number of doctors. Elso believes that the situation in China is "terrible," with only one doctor for every 80,000 people, while in the United States, there is one doctor for every 1,500 people. The United Nations' medical assistance to China is not being handled properly. American food in Shanghai is cheaper than here, especially canned meat, biscuits, and the like, but it is still not within the purchasing power of ordinary Chinese people.

### After Negotiations, Most of the Chinese Ships Detained by the Dutch Navy Have Been Released; Negotiations are Still Underway for the Remaining Three Ships

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Regarding the detention of Chinese ships by the Dutch Navy in the coastal waters of the Dutch East Indies on the grounds of violating anti-control regulations, according to relevant sources, there are two batches of ships detained. The first batch consisted of 22 ships detained successively from July last year, and the second batch consisted of 12 ships detained successively from the end of December. Although most of the ships were registered in Singapore, our government has always done its best to negotiate. The person in charge of this matter is Chiang Chia-tung, the Consul General in Batavia, while Wu Bosheng, the Consul General in Singapore, is responsible for liaising with the local authorities in Singapore and negotiating with the Dutch representatives in Singapore.

### The Supreme Court Rejects Zhou Fohai's Appeal, Providing Reasons

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Zhou Fohai's appeal was previously rejected by the Supreme Court. On the 24th, the reasons for the rejection were sent to the High Court, which forwarded them to Zhou on the same day. Zhou's wife, Mrs. Yang, previously raised three grounds for appeal: (1) Witnesses Peng Chun and Cheng Kexiang have not yet been brought to justice, (2) When the enemy army attacked Dushan, the defendant provided central intelligence, (3) He had set up a secret radio station to provide central intelligence, and after the surrender, he was the captain of the Shanghai Action Team, etc. Although the original trial sent a letter to the Central Organization Department to investigate, it proceeded to a verdict without receiving a reply. The main points of the Supreme Court's reasons for rejection are as follows: On November 4, 1939, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court had already issued a clear arrest warrant for Zhou. According to the Regulations on the Trial of Traitors, one must surrender before being discovered. Zhou had already surrendered after the clear arrest warrant was issued. Even if Cheng and Peng were brought to justice, it would only be a reference for sentencing. As for the provision of central intelligence, etc., it is also a matter of sentencing and cannot be used as a reason for requesting a retrial.

Commentary

### Some Thoughts on National Education Funding

— Zhou Shang

Recently, educators in Nanjing held a gathering specifically to discuss national education funding. We deeply feel that national education funding has reached its end, and national education is on the verge of bankruptcy. We really cannot understand why education, which is most urgently needed in China, is so weak. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly called for "Education First." Regarding constitutional governance, he said, "First, the people who exercise political power must have the ability and habit to grasp and ensure political power." This ability and habit must be cultivated through universal education to prevent being manipulated by ambitious individuals and to avoid encroachment of administrative power on political power. Only then can administrative leaders be supervised by the people, and their stay or leave be determined by the people. Whether for resisting war or building the nation, whether for one-party politics or multi-party politics, the indispensable prerequisite is an educated populace. Only when there is equal opportunity in education and everyone receives education can the country and society have a modern foundation.

We regret the fragility of economic and financial policies and, even more so, that educational policies, though existing, are equivalent to nothing. National education has gone from anemia to a state of blood poisoning, not only lacking the strength to nourish and assist but even being intentionally or unintentionally damaged from time to time. The reports and discussions of various experts are indeed enough to worry us. During the late Qing Dynasty, part of the primary education funding came from school properties managed by the mountain education promotion agencies, which were well-managed. After the establishment of the Republic of China, it was placed under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau, which dared not touch it even during the warlord era. When implementing the new county system, the Education Bureau was abolished, and finances were unified in collection and expenditure. Local education funding plummeted from 30-40% to 5%. This year, the situation has worsened further. County budgets only list central national schools, and the funding for general national schools is to be raised by the townships and villages themselves. How can the impoverished townships and villages today afford it? Schools have no choice but to close down. Speaking of the establishment of central national schools, it does not follow the rule of one school per township. Often, there are multiple deductions, and the county magistrate's performance evaluation only accounts for 5% in education. Even if all the schools in the county close down, it still cannot shake his "good words I do it myself."

This year, the central government's education budget is 340 billion yuan, accounting for 3.6% of the total national expenditure. The Ministry of Education can only stipulate 400 million yuan to subsidize national education, which is a drop in the bucket. Moreover, there are more than a dozen national education experimental zones waiting for this money. The Ministry of Education seems to have decided not to subsidize national education funding in each county anymore. They also considered that school land and properties are often pocketed by local bullies and gentry. There is no problem with the central subsidy reaching the province, but problems arise when it reaches the county. It is unknown how many deductions will be made.

This situation has created a phenomenon where, on the one hand, universal education is advocated, and on the other hand, people cannot attend school even if they want to. According to the Ministry of Education's report to the Legislative Yuan, in 1946, the number of out-of-school children nationwide reached 60 million. This loss is more serious than the abandonment of 600 million mu of good farmland. What can be used to redeem this loss? In the same year, the number of literate people nationwide was 87,572,464, and the number of illiterate people was 286,332,536, with illiteracy accounting for 76.58%. The situation is even worse than in 1942, 1943, and 1944. In these three years, the percentage of literate people was close to 50%. These are the figures from the "National Education Statistics Compilation," which should be roughly correct.

In places that claim to have developed education, such as Shanghai, there are over 400,000 school-age children. The 222 municipal schools can only accommodate 81,904 children, and the 952 private schools accommodate 189,823 children. There are still about 200,000 children out of school. Nanjing currently has 108 public and private primary schools, which can accommodate 50,000 children, and there are still 50,000 children wandering the streets without schools to attend. Only one-fifth of the children in Jiangsu Province are enrolled in school. Guangdong Province has a population of 30 million, with over 4 million school-age children. Currently, there are 5,000 national schools, and only over 2 million children enjoy the blessing of attending school. The other 2 million children are excluded from the school gates. The Yellow River flood limits the seven provinces, and the Yangtze River disaster stops at nine provinces. However, the disaster of out-of-school children caused by the backwardness of schools is especially severe for first-graders who have just entered school. However, today, they must take exams. After taking exams at one school after another, they have lost several pounds of weight, and their eyes are sunken. How can fragile children withstand this kind of exam burden?

It would be fine if they could pass the exam, but the result is that they dare not take the exam. Therefore, parents follow behind the principals, begging bitterly, tears streaming down their faces. Many primary school students have cried their eyes swollen for admission, and many parents have broken their hearts for their children's admission. They continue to go through connections, speaking of favors. Schools cannot bear the name cards and introduction letters of people and dare not openly enroll students, resulting in the so-called "educational black market" and "favoritism in education." Even for children who can attend school, it is not a comforting thing. Because education is currently regressing. The main reason for the regression of education is the regression of teachers. In 19 provinces, unqualified national education teachers account for 46%. There are a total of 620,000 primary school teachers nationwide, but only 82,000 are graduates of normal schools. There are 85,000 primary school graduates teaching in primary schools. The treatment of teachers is not as good as that of office clerks. Who would be willing to stay self-defensively and suffer, suffer, wither, and die in the education field? Under this situation, will today's children not become "tomorrow's vagrants"? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad. Everyone is busy solving the problem on their shoulders. No one is willing to take care of the century-long plan of education. Precisely because of this, I want to launch an educational atomic bomb! Bombard out funds to save the next generation, act illegally to save this old country. My opinions are:

1.  The central government must thoroughly implement the policy it has already set down. Avoid having policies without methods or having methods without implementation. Even more, avoid this order overturning that order, this resolution overturning that resolution, and this person's method changing to that person's method. Avoid encroaching on urgently needed funds to decorate the façade.

2.  In reality, the central government should account for 15% of education expenditures, the provinces 25%, and the localities 35%. The central government should account for one-quarter of the subsidy for national education funding, the provinces one-quarter, and the localities two-quarters.

3.  Finance is the mother of all administrations, and finance is the redistribution of people's income. Under the system of unified collection and expenditure, we cannot advocate "independent education funding" alone. However, the money allocated to education should pay attention to precedents and regulations. At least, the education funding taken from school land and properties should still be used for education. If this cannot be done, there is only the movement for independent education funding.

4.  Fiscal and economic policies must be closely coordinated, using finance to cultivate the economy and using the economy to increase finance. When the people are poor, wealth must be exhausted. To enrich the country, we must first enrich the people. The government cannot only focus on increasing tax revenue and ignore the cultivation of tax sources. Only by cultivating tax sources can education funding be secured.

5.  Improve the tax system. Ensure the concentration of authority. "Reforming taxes is more important than increasing taxes." Those who have not yet started levying taxes should do so as soon as possible. Those who have already started levying taxes but are pocketing the money should be clarified as soon as possible. This will not only increase taxes but also increase the people's sense of obligation. Only by doing this can education funding avoid being at a loss.

6.  School land and properties are mostly controlled and occupied by local bullies and gentry, which affects education construction. It is urgent to clean them up with the help of upper-level agencies and public opinion organizations. Capable educators should participate in public opinion organizations, overthrow local bullies and gentry, and unite the good forces to form a trend everywhere and confront the evil forces openly.

7.  There are currently over 44,000 normal school students and 110,000 simple normal school students, less than 160,000 in total. Assuming one teacher teaches 25 children, we should urgently train 2 million teachers to universalize national education. At the same time, the county magistrate's performance evaluation should account for 30% in education, so that he has concerns and is afraid of them. The Education Bureau should be restored and its organization strengthened.

Fichte said: Everyone should receive education, and everyone should manage education. Now is the time for the people to receive education and for the people to manage education. I remember that the Director of Education of Georgia, USA, Gu Linsi, because the treatment of teachers was meager, had already had 6,699 teachers change careers and retire in 18 months. In January of last year, he asked the Legislative Yuan to increase teachers' salaries by 50%. At that time, all newspapers called Gu's move an "educational atomic bomb." He pointed out that this matter was difficult to handle because education expenditures already accounted for half of the state's revenue. Soon, the parents of farmers, workers, and businessmen from all walks of life painfully grasped the pros and cons and printed small booklets for publicity by teachers donating two yuan each. Fighting until January of this year, they finally achieved their goal. It can be seen that things are done by people. We hope that this atomic bomb can also exert its power and blast out a bright future from the dead end.

### Soviet Union Conscripts 500,000 Young Men in Occupied Areas of Korea, Hodge Reports on the Truth of the Korean Situation During His Return to the United States for Duty, Rhee Syngman Advocates Armed Implementation in South Korea

[This News Agency, Washington, 24th] General Hodge, Commander of the U.S. Military in Korea, stated here that the Soviet military authorities in the individual occupied areas of Korea are currently using the Chinese Communist army as the core to recruit Korean young men aged 17 to 25, attempting to form a large Korean army. It is estimated that there are about 500,000 eligible young men in the Soviet-occupied area. The weapons previously seized from the Japanese army are about to be used to equip the army. However, there is no reason for Korea to recruit any army. Regarding the negotiations between the US and Soviet military authorities, the future seems to hold little hope. The Soviet Union has an iron curtain in the occupied area, making it difficult for us to learn the inside story. This is what Hodge said to reporters after discussing the situation in Korea with President Truman today. According to Army Secretary Patterson, Hodge was summoned back to the country to assist the Army Department and the State Department in drafting a report on the situation in Korea, so that Secretary of State Marshall would have a basis when he went to Moscow to hold a four-nation foreign ministers meeting to discuss Korea. According to State Department officials, Hodge's report on the local situation did not change the US policy toward Korea in the slightest. The two policies that the United States is now pursuing are: (1) consolidating the economic development of South Korea; (2) establishing agreed legislation, which is the best way to promote Korean politics. It is also learned that the meeting between Hodge and Marshall was very brief and did not discuss the Korean issue to be discussed in Moscow. Hodge spent most of his time in the Army Department, discussing the issue of managing Korea with relevant officials.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Rhee Syngman, chairman of the Korean Committee who recently returned here from Korea, today demanded that the United States arm the people of South Korea and allow them to conduct military training. Rhee also said: When the Soviet Union is training a large Korean army in North Korea, how can the people of South Korea be deprived of the right to implement arms and conduct military training! Rhee continued: "If people are not allowed to organize their own government, we will see a Korea that believes in democracy being ravaged by the Communist Party."

[United Press, Moscow, 25th] Rhee Syngman, the leader of the South Korea Alliance, and Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, both accused the Soviet Red Army of recruiting Koreans in Washington. The Soviet Labor Organ newspaper, Trud, said in an editorial today, although not directly responding to the words of the two, it pointed out that Rhee Syngman intends to obtain weapons from the United States to start "military operations" against the Communist Party in North Korea.

South Korea's Independent Government Established on March 1

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, recently announced that South Korea will establish an independent government on March 1. He now intends to ask the Congressional Budget Committee tomorrow to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the work of occupying Korea. He continued: People in North Korea often attempt to cross the US-Soviet demarcation line and are mostly arrested by the Soviet side.

[United Press, Seoul, 25th] Ye Loo, an observer from Korea attending the United Nations General Assembly, announced today that he has asked US Secretary of State Marshall to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow. According to the report of General Hodge, Commander of the Southern Korea Army, the Soviet Union has admitted to conscripting Koreans in the Soviet-occupied area of Korea, and Hodge's words are completely true. If the United States and the Soviet Union cannot negotiate a solution in Moscow, the Korean issue should be submitted to the United Nations. If the current situation in Korea does not improve, there is a possibility of civil war. Ye Loo assured Marshall that Korea only wants peace and also made this guarantee to the Soviet Union. Korea has no military intentions toward the Soviet Union but does not want to be a puppet of the United States or the Soviet Union or any country. South Korea is currently occupied by the US military. Ye Loo said that Marshall has formulated a practical plan for the military government. It is said that if the negotiations on unifying Korea have become hopeless, as Hodge said, then 30 million Koreans will die of starvation, but the negotiations are not actually hopeless.

### US Interior Secretary Meets MacArthur Yesterday to Discuss Administrative Issues on Pacific Islands, Acheson Visits Marshall Again Before Returning to Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] US Interior Secretary Krug met with MacArthur here on the 25th to discuss the issue of the governor of Guam and other Pacific islands for about two hours. In the afternoon, Krug and his team went to the war crimes trial to listen. At the same time, Lieutenant General Ergenbrock is scheduled to host a banquet for Krug tonight. Krug will fly to Wake Island and Hawaii within days.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] US Congressman Poulson and others accompanied Secretary of the Interior Krug to inspect here. MacArthur declared to them today that the peace treaty with Japan should be signed as soon as possible. The democratization of Japan is more promising than that of Germany. The delay in concluding the peace treaty with Japan is enough to hinder Japan's recovery of normal trade, resulting in excessive reliance on the United States. The future of Japan is actually the most advanced cemetery for American democracy and Christianity. Once the peace treaty is established, normal trade will develop accordingly, and American taxpayers can greatly reduce the burden. Japan now has the ability to govern itself, and there is no harm in concluding the peace treaty immediately.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] MacArthur's political advisor Aitcheson is scheduled to fly back to Tokyo on the 25th to resume his position as chairman of the Four-Power Control Committee for Japan. Aitcheson met with Secretary of State Marshall this afternoon but declined to comment on the content of the talks.

### Allied Industries in Japan Are Not Used for Compensation

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] The Allied Headquarters has instructed the Japanese government that 100% of the machinery and property enjoyed by the people of the Allied countries in Japan before December 7, 1941, will be retained and not used for compensation claims. If the property belongs to the Ford Matsuda Company and the Tonggong Mada Company, it will be incorporated into the Japanese Army Arsenal after being recorded in Japan. It is 100% the property of the Allied countries, and the property will be removed from the compensation form.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Republican Congressman Hilhar today submitted a bill to Congress requesting the annexation of Greenland and Iceland on the Arctic frontier. The bill proposes authorizing the President of the United States to invite Iceland to become a state of the United States and to negotiate the purchase of Greenland. Keith said, "The time has come.

### Report on the Reorganization of Germany Nears Completion

Will be Submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers for Discussion

[French News Agency, Berlin, 25th] The report on the reorganization of Germany prepared by the Allied Coordination Committee is 1,500 pages long, divided into nine parts and thirty-two desires, including the elimination of Nazism, disarmament, implementation of democracy, extradition of people, revision of territory, and dissolution of Prussia. It is currently being studied by the Four-Power Control Conference on Germany. If it is considered appropriate, it will be sent to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. Although the content has not been announced, it is said by well-informed sources that opinions are extremely divergent, but agreement has been reached on several important points, such as the dissolution of Prussia. According to reliable American sources, American and Soviet opinions were extremely inconsistent when drafting this report, which caused fierce debates at the time. Finally, the British representative Robertson mediated to avoid quarrels.

### As the Four Foreign Ministers Conference Approaches, the Soviet Union Spends Money to Repair the Venue

The walls of each room in the hotel are newly wallpapered, and new furniture is being transported in one after another. Repairs are also being carried out throughout the city. The venue for the foreign ministers meeting has not yet been officially announced, but it is generally not in the Spiridonovka Palace, but in the Hall of Columns. The former is the venue for the previous two foreign ministers meetings, and the Hall of Columns used to be a noble club.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Minister Bevin and his entourage of more than 100 people plan to leave London on March 4 for Moscow. He will take a special train from Calais, France, via Brussels, Berlin, and Warsaw, and is expected to arrive in Moscow on March 9. The Foreign Ministers Conference will open the next day.

### End of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Discussing the Drafting of the Report

[French News Agency, London, 24th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the draft peace treaty with Germany this afternoon for five hours and has in fact ended. The issue of reporting and consulting with Allied countries other than the four powers has once again become an obstacle to the Foreign Ministers Conference. A special committee has prepared a report, but Soviet representative Gusev declared that he would rather submit this issue to the Moscow Conference for discussion. Therefore, American representative Hefti proposed a report drafted by the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France, and another report drafted by the Soviet representative. After a long discussion, it was decided that each country's representative could submit their suggestions and opinions. In addition, the draft peace treaty with Austria has in fact completed all preparations, and only several economic clauses remain to be discussed.

The British Navy Clears Mines in the Corfu Strait (British Information Office)

### Corfu Incident: The United States Plans to Support Britain, the Soviet Union Defends Albania

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 24th] Regarding the illegal laying of mines by Britain and Albania in the Corfu Strait, the US representative today plans to support Britain's accusations, but the Soviet representative supports Albania's defense, arguing that the Security Council should stop discussing this case. At today's Security Council meeting, US representative Chamberlin said that the evidence presented by Britain "seems credible." Johnson then expressed his support for Australia's suggestion that a small committee study the various evidence in this case. Soviet representative Gromyko heard this and showed opposition to Australia's suggestion, supporting Albania's position and condemning Britain for destroying other countries' territorial waters. According to Britain's accusations, the case is based on the explosion of two mines in the Corfu Strait in October of last year. At that time, two British ships were destroyed, and 44 British naval officers were killed. However, the Albanian representative now denies that the country laid mines to destroy British ships.

### Atomic Energy Commission Discussion Topics Should Be Separate from Disarmament Commission - Ambassador Koo's Speech at Rollins College

[United Press International, Winter Park, Florida, 24th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, V.K. Wellington Koo, received an honorary doctorate from Rollins College today and stated in his speech at the college's "Mid-Winter Convocation" that the discussion topics of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should be separated from those of the Disarmament Commission. Safeguarding the authority of the commission to handle the issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy is extremely important for peace and for the ultimate success of general disarmament efforts, so that it can handle the effective system of supervising and controlling destructive weapons as a closely linked part of an overall whole. The establishment of an international police force, disarmament, and the abolition of atomic weapons are all interconnected issues, and although they are handled by three different organizations, the final consideration will rest with the Security Council. Unless an agreement can be reached on the implementation steps of the resolutions, the hope of establishing a collective security system to ensure world peace will be shattered, and world peace will remain elusive.

### Control of Atomic Energy – US-Soviet Disagreement

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th: The Security Council is scheduled to complete the current stage of atomic management discussions within this week.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th Radio: Some members of the US House of Representatives oppose the United States selling equipment for the manufacture of group destruction weapons to the Soviet Union until the United States has obtained evidence indicating that the Soviet Union has signed an agreement on international inspection of atomic energy.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] This morning, some US officials criticized the recent Soviet proposals regarding atomic energy as "unacceptable" and stated that they should be returned to the Atomic Energy Commission for further discussion. US Chief Representative Austin will also present the same views in the Security Council, which will decide on the steps for an international atomic energy control system. This is the first time the US delegation has attacked the Soviet proposals on atomic energy. Whether Austin will elaborate on the US position at the afternoon meeting will depend on how the meeting handles the differing opinions. Gromyko hopes that the Security Council's discussion of the Atomic Energy Commission's report will be limited to the American proposals agreed to by the Soviet Union. The other member states hope to discuss the entire report. The atomic issue is one of the Security Council's important tasks this week. Other major issues include the dispute between Britain and Albania over the Corfu Channel and the US request to unilaterally administer the former Japanese mandated islands.

### US Decides to Assist Jews in Migrating to Palestine

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] President Truman stated today that the US government advocates allowing 100,000 Jews to migrate to and reside within Palestine, and he will make every effort to achieve this goal.

### Eisenhower Strongly Advocates Strengthening Defense - Truman to Ask Congress to Extend the Selective Service Act

[Associated Press, St. Louis, Missouri, 24th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower stated at a civilian reception here today that the United States should not neglect defense because it possesses the atomic bomb. In his indirect appeal against reducing military spending, Eisenhower did not directly mention the atomic bomb, but stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes adequate defense. Our military thinkers have conquered the world by controlling the potential of the universe, but I will condemn those who carelessly place their security in a weapon that can kill millions overnight. Those who measure security solely by offensive capability distort the meaning of security and mislead people.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th Radio: Eisenhower warned the American people today that atomic bombs alone cannot guarantee security, and the United States should not abandon other defensive weapons because it possesses atomic bombs.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced to the press today that President Truman will submit a proposal to Congress in April requesting an extension of the Selective Service Act.

### British Parliament Debates Indian Issue

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 25th Radio: The British House of Lords debated the issue of Indian independence today.

British Prime Minister Attlee stated that if India wishes to remain under British rule, it is welcome. If India wants to secede, Britain is willing to negotiate with it.

### Mountbatten Slightly Injured in Car Accident

According to railway inspectors, 178 people died, but the exact number may not be clear until after the wreckage is cleared.

### Far East Tribunal Continues Trial - US Lawyer Makes Strange Argument

Claiming Japan Never Prepared for War

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th] At the Far East International Tribunal, American defense lawyer Logan today defended the defendant after Kiyose. He opposed the prosecutor's accusation that "from before and after the Northeast Incident, Japan's politics, economy, and education were all intentionally prepared for a war of aggression." He stated that not only was there no conspiracy among the defendants, but there was also opposition. Japan never made any economic preparations for war, nor did it ever engage in propaganda sufficient to incite war and crime.

### Thousands of Nazis Arrested

[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, 24th] It was announced here that British military police have captured nearly 1,000 German conspirators in the British occupation zone, equivalent to 80% of all conspirators.

### Communism in South America

—Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department

…Communism is already at the back door of the Americas. If Uncle Sam does not act quickly to recover the lost defensive barrier…

Today, the Communist Party is not only the fastest-growing force in South America, but also a political force that exists universally in various South American countries. This is very important to Americans because, like what happens in the United States, it has a direct bearing on the American people.

The United States has always regarded South America as its restricted area, where no country outside the Western Hemisphere can compete with it for supremacy.

Past Situation

In the past, all threats that could endanger American interests in Latin America mostly came from outside the boundaries of the continent; for example, Japanese fishing fleets operating on the sea near the west coast of South America, the possibility of German submarines establishing fuel supply stations on the east coast, and the danger of the intrusion of German aerial power that had already established an aviation network in South America.

Current Situation

But today, the threat comes from within—the intrusion of Soviet power into South America, on the one hand, comes through the front door, and on the other hand, it sneaks in secretly.

The so-called entering through the front door refers to the diplomatic relations that the Soviet Union established in various South American countries after its victory in the war. For example, the organization of the Soviet embassies stationed in Venezuela and Colombia is larger than the organization of the American embassies stationed in the same countries, which is an illustration.

The so-called sneaking in secretly refers to the Communist parties in various South American countries. These Communist parties have obtained legal status in most countries, and although it has only been a few months, they have spread like wildfire.

Political Economy

The Communist Party simultaneously possesses both political and economic power in South America. In the political aspect, the Communist Party has already used its full strength to elect the current government of Chile, and at the same time, it has established the position of opposition party and future successor in several other countries. In the economic aspect, the Communist Party has already gained a dominant position in the major labor unions in South America. For example, the Panama Canal is the central point of the American two-ocean defense system. When the American navy needs it strategically, it can transfer from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through it. But the Communist Party now controls the most important labor union in the Canal Zone, which has 18,000 workers. In the event of war between the US and the Soviet Union, unless the United States sends troops to protect the Canal and occupy the nearby areas, how much the United States can utilize the Canal is indeed a question.

The Communist Party of Chile has already controlled the largest labor union in the country. Chile is a country that produces nitrate, and nitrate is indispensable to the American war chemical industry. The leader of the Chilean Communist Party recently issued a statement saying: "In the event that the United States goes to war with the Soviet Union, Chile will stop shipping anything to the United States."

Brazilian Communist Party

The unions under the leadership of the Communist Party in Brazil recently demonstrated their power by using a general strike to seal off the port of Santos, the world's largest coffee export market. Later, three more unions launched strikes involving trams, telephones, gas, and electricity, almost paralyzing the entire capital of Brazil.

Americans often think that the Communist Party is a rabble, but when the Brazilian government allowed the Communist Party to participate in the election last year, it made a stunning appearance, winning more than 600,000 votes, meaning that one out of every ten voters in the country voted for the Communist Party. In Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, the Communist Party received 116,000 votes, which is not much different from the 147,000 votes won by the victorious General Dutra.

The Communist Party is not only gaining power in voting. When the Communist Party and the Brazilian government clashed over domestic politics, they could control the most powerful unions in the country and launch nationwide strikes. Although the government can use guns and cannons to suppress the strikes, the result only deepens the rift between the upper and lower classes.

Chilean Communist Party

The Communist Party won the election in Chile with a superior number of votes. President Videla immediately adopted a portion of the Communist Party's plans and included three Communist Party members in the cabinet, serving as the Minister of Transportation and Public Works, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Minister of Colonization.

South American Public

The people who support the Communist Party in South America have no goodwill towards Western democracy. They regard Americans as imperialists and do not treat them as friends. The reason is very simple. For example, in Venezuela, the average worker's daily wage is only thirty cents, but it costs twelve cents to buy an egg, ten cents to buy a pound of corn, thirty cents to buy a loaf of bread, and thirty-five cents to buy a quart of milk. These workers mostly work on land owned by Americans, and therefore resent Americans.

The second reason is that the South American public has a low level of education, and American ideas are not easily instilled into their minds. In countries such as Bolivia, 80% of the people are illiterate, so it is impossible to influence them with writing. But illiteracy does not hinder the Communist Party. Their spokespersons are all indigenous leaders who speak directly to the people. At the same time, illiteracy is not an obstacle to voting. Voters in Venezuela used colored cards to vote: white represented the Democratic Action Party, and red represented the Communist Party.

For intellectuals, the Communist Party has established a news network in South America, sending more than 10,000 words of news and propaganda telegrams from Moscow every day.

The Communist Party has indeed become overwhelmingly dominant in South America. An American writer sighed: "Our honeymoon with Latin America is over!"

American Countermeasures

What can the United States do now to prevent the complete secession of South America? The most essential step is to find a way to bridge the gap between the upper and lower classes in South America: take economic actions to create a stable middle class. The method is to increase the purchasing power of the common people, so that a portion of the people can jump from the laboring masses to become small businessmen, small shopkeepers, small factory owners, and self-reliant farmers.

Industrialization cannot solve the entire South American problem. If industry is just a large-scale enterprise that employs a large number of workers and pays them meager wages, then communism will absorb many new believers. But if it can help Latin America establish its inherent small businesses, then it can establish an economic foundation for democracy. That is to say: in helping South America industrialize, one should not only focus on large enterprises, but also provide loans to small industries. In addition, technical training should be implemented for South Americans to cultivate management talents and instill in them industrial and commercial skills. At the same time, the middle class relies on a well-off salaried class to survive. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the treatment of ordinary workers at the same time. Only in this way can the confidence of South Americans in the United States be restored.

Improve Life

Therefore, if the goal is to maintain American interests in South America, it can be achieved not by force but by friendship. But the so-called friendship is not enough to rely solely on propaganda. It must be manifested with facts that improve the lives of the people in order to be effective.

"The New York Times" once published a dispatch sent by Whitt from the Brazilian capital, stating: "According to recent facts, the Soviet Union is launching a hegemonic offensive against the world, the intensity of which is no less than the most active era of the former Third International."

Communism has arrived at the back door of the Americas, and the United States is on the verge of losing the defensive barrier of South America.

### Director of Qinghai Provincial Government's Shanghai Office Embezzles Public Funds to Speculate in Gold - The Fourth Supervisory Committee Investigates and Reports, Chairman Approves Strict Punishment - Ministry of National Defense Sends Personnel to Assist in Investigating Military Personnel's Gold Speculation with Military Pay

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Regarding the figure mentioned in yesterday's newspaper about incumbent officials using public funds to purchase gold during the gold rush period, the reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that it was the Director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's Shanghai Office. This person has now left Shanghai and may have returned to Qinghai. The total amount of public funds embezzled was 1 billion National Currency, of which 350 million has been confirmed to have been used to purchase gold, and the use of the remaining 650 million is unclear. If calculated based on 350 million, the gold purchased is still less than 100 bars, which is still considered a "fly" in the entire financial turmoil. However, because he is a civil servant who used public funds to seek illegal profits, which violates the law, the supervisory committee investigated and reported to Chairman Chiang this time, who approved "strict punishment according to the law." It is now learned that the four supervisory committee members have completed their work and returned to Nanjing yesterday. The case has been drafted and will be submitted for impeachment in the coming days. Once the impeachment is established, it will be transferred to the judicial authorities for severe punishment.

[Another Dispatch] It is rumored that some military personnel used military pay to speculate in gold during this gold and currency rush. It is learned that the Economic Supervision Group found that a certain unit's office overdrawn 3 billion yuan from the National Treasury. Whether this large sum was used for gold trading is still unknown. The Economic Supervision Group is still thoroughly investigating. Yesterday, the Ministry of National Defense specially dispatched Zhong Ying, an army quartermaster supervisor from the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yi Wei, a major general senior staff officer from the Ministry of National Defense, to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. They have established close ties with the Economic Supervision Group.

Import/Export Firm Speculates in Gold

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Economic Supervision Group has been investigating the accounts of various firms and banks for days. Yesterday, they discovered an import/export firm, Tai Shen Zhan, operating gold and US dollar mortgage loans, similar to an underground bank. Group members Gan Qingshan and Ha Yinpu found that the firm was operating with approximately 80 gold bars and had torn out several pages of its account books recording gold and currency transactions in an attempt to destroy evidence. The Economic Supervision Group summoned its manager, Chen Keda, a Guangdong native, and ordered him to post bail. He will be handed over to the court for punishment according to the law.

Inside Story Difficult to Ascertain - Tiger Difficult to Catch

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] After ten days of investigation by the Economic Supervision Group, the inside story of the gold rush has not yet yielded any surprising discoveries. Although the person in charge has repeatedly expressed the determination to "catch tigers" and stated that they have obtained clues as to who was manipulating the gold rush, and are only awaiting the Chairman's approval before making it public, according to the reporter's compilation of information from various sources, the rumored so-called blacklist has not yet been confirmed to have been submitted to the Chairman. It is not easy to identify the real "big tigers." Even if rumors spread widely, these behind-the-scenes figures did not personally engage in speculative manipulation and creating disturbances, so there is a lack of evidence to bring them to justice.

[Another Dispatch] The second group affairs meeting of the Economic Supervision Group will be held at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss expanding the organization. It is learned that the focus will be on supervising the stabilization of prices, and it may become a permanent institution.

### Three Factories' Gold Speculation Case - Responsible Persons Summoned for Questioning on a Scheduled Date

Now that the end of the month is approaching, how the workers' wages for this month should be paid is an urgent issue to be resolved. The central government specially telegraphed Wu Kaixian, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, to Nanjing yesterday for discussion. Wu departed for Nanjing on the night train last night and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. Before his departure, he told reporters that he believes that the quantity and type of goods distributed to workers should be based on the quantity used when compiling the cost-of-living index, in order to be reasonable.

### Three Price Control Agencies Discuss Unified Implementation Measures

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The agencies in this city that enforce price controls are the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau. In the past, because the coordination was not close enough, there were cases where one party had already arrested merchants who violated price limits, while the other party still wanted to summon them. In order to unify the enforcement of controls, a meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room yesterday afternoon to discuss measures. Wu Kaixian, Gu Bingyuan, Ji Mingzhai, and Zhou Weixin from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Yamin from the Garrison Command, and Xu Youzuo from the Police Bureau attended. Director Wu suggested that contact should be established in the future, and if there is a summons, the other parties should be notified.

### Labor-Management Dispute at International Hotel - Waiters' Salaries Reduced - Implementation Temporarily Postponed After Negotiation

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A labor-management dispute occurred at the International Hotel yesterday. The employees of the hotel are paid in two ways. The waiters who come into contact with customers are paid half of the salary of other employees because they can get tips from customers. Later, the management department considered this method inappropriate. Since December of last year, the salaries of all employees have been uniformly regulated, and a 10% tip is added to the room bill, which is divided equally among all employees. Waiters are not allowed to ask residents for tips, and if found, they will be dismissed. This method was originally intended to be tried for three months, expiring at the end of this month. During this period, it was found that waiters were still asking residents for tips, so the hotel manager Lin Mianzhi plans to restore the method before March 1, reducing the salary of the room department waiters by 40% and the salary of the 14th floor waiters by 50% to reduce income and subsidize other employees in the engineering department and kitchen. The 120 waiters in the room department and on the 14th floor heard the news and believed that since tips are not allowed and salaries are reduced by half, a dispute arose, and slogans were posted yesterday.

### Subsidy Issue Before Start of Rationing System - Municipal Authorities Discuss Effective Measures - Price Difference to be Monetized and Implemented Soon

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the central government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures Program, it has been generally recognized that although the gold rush has subsided, if there is no proper and effective way to suppress price fluctuations, freezing the cost-of-living index will inevitably cause unrest among salaried people. The reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday. Wu said that the recent surge in prices in this city was indeed affected by the gold rush. Since I took office more than a year ago, the price increase has not exceeded more than one-fold, but after the gold price jumped sharply, prices rose in a straight line. Now that the central government has restricted gold trading, I believe prices can be stabilized. For rice, I am even more confident. The government has a sufficient amount of rice reserves, which will definitely be able to control rice prices. The mayor also said that recently several rice merchant representatives visited to request the city government to allocate rice. Although the city government has abundant rice reserves, and 17,000 tan arrived yesterday, their request was not granted because the amount of rice needed in this city is 10,000 shih per day. If more rice is allocated, it may cause hoarding and manipulation.

Regarding how to subsidize the lives of employees before the rationing of goods begins after the cost-of-living index is frozen, Mayor Wu said that he has discussed effective measures with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, which is to monetize the difference between the market price of the planned rations for this month and the market price of last month, and issue it to employees in cash. Mayor Wu also believes that this measure is extremely fair and can be implemented after approval by the central government. President Ning called Mayor Wu long distance yesterday for this purpose. According to Wu, this method is expected to be implemented from the 28th of this month.

When asked about the fact that the in-kind rationing method formulated by the central government is limited to public education personnel, and other cultural circles and the huge working class cannot be popularized, and that people in the press are also equally unable to benefit from it, which will make the freezing of the cost-of-living index the biggest threat to them, Mayor Wu replied that he would suggest that the capital implement the aforementioned differential subsidy method. He also said: I will discuss it with the persons in charge of various newspapers soon, so the press can allay their fears.

### Grave Excavation Case Settled

Except for Hai Qi's part being rejected, Jin and Zhang were also judged by the Land Court in December last year, believing that there was insufficient evidence of guilt, so they were declared innocent. However, the Wang family's excavated ancestral graves and lost parts have been repeatedly mediated by the Land Court's President Lian Zong, Jackson, etc., for several months. Finally, on the 24th of this month, the Director of the Executive Yuan, Sai Shu, allocated 18 million for Wang Detang and others to receive, and the settlement was concluded.

### Municipal Finance Annual Revenue Budget Increased by Over 51.7 Billion Municipal Senators' Meeting Resolution on Budget Committee

[Report from our Newspaper] The Budget Committee of the Municipal Senate held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Senate to continue discussing and finalizing the city government's fiscal year 36 budget revenue. He Yuanming served as chairman. Senators Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Qu Bo, Zhu Fujiu, Zhou Feicheng, Zhu Wenqi, and others, as well as Min Xiangfan, director of the Accounting Department of the Municipal Government, Zhang Rentao, deputy director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and accounting supervisors from various bureaus attended. As a result of the review, in addition to the previously determined 23.1 billion yuan increase in the financial sector, a total of 28.66 billion yuan in revenue was added to the budgets of various bureaus, totaling over 51.7 billion yuan with the previous increase. The increases in various departments are recorded as follows:

Public Utilities Department: The increase is relatively large. Except for a few minor items, the total increase is 21.554 billion yuan, including: a 50% increase in public utilities fines, totaling 13.6 million yuan; a 50% increase in the franchise fee for private ferry services, totaling 49.38 million yuan; a 25% increase in advertising registration fees, totaling 71.66 million yuan; an additional 7.8485 billion yuan in compensation fees for various electric power companies; an additional 510 million yuan in compensation fees for the French Tram Company; an additional 1.507 billion yuan in compensation fees for the British Tram Company; and an additional 11.55 billion yuan in public utilities surcharges.

Health Department: A total increase of 4.43366 billion yuan, including: an additional 30 million yuan in health fines; an additional 400 million yuan in health registration fees (including livestock inspection); a doubling of health testing revenue, adding 124.2 million yuan; a doubling of cemetery revenue, adding 430.56 million yuan; an additional 70 million yuan in slaughterhouse revenue; a 50% increase in cleaning revenue, adding 3.1464 billion yuan; and a 25% increase in confiscated livestock revenue, adding 232.5 million yuan.

Police Department: A total increase of 327 million yuan, including a 300 million yuan increase in administrative fines and a 50% increase in administrative fees, amounting to 15 million yuan, and a doubling of fire department revenue, adding 12 million yuan.

Civil Affairs Office: No increase was granted temporarily because although 8,000 more national identity cards were added for citizens aged 14 this year, the fee issue still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval.

Social Affairs Bureau: The budget revenue, such as industrial and commercial registration, metrology inspection fees, business license fees, and agricultural income, totals nearly 200 million yuan. However, this budget is already higher than the actual amount that can be received, and the agricultural aspect is still in the development stage, so there is no way to increase it.

Education Department: Apart from business, there is no income, so there is no increase. The collection of health and health education revenue will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.

Public Works Department: A total increase of 284.4 million yuan. It was decided to double the registration license fees for construction factories (including construction costs), from the original budget of 38.4 billion to 76.8 million. The highway maintenance fee of 120 million will be doubled, adding 120 million. The park admission ticket will be increased by 50% from the original 162 million to 81 million. The park stadium rental fee will be doubled, adding 3.6 million. Because the number of bicycles has greatly increased, the park bicycle parking fee can also be doubled to 3 million.

### Soaring Prices, Insufficient Expenditure Various Bureaus Add Budgets One After Another Report Already Sent to the Senate

[Report from our Newspaper] The Budget Committee of the Municipal Senate has completed its review of the city government's budget revenue, and the next meeting will discuss the expenditure section. Currently, various bureaus of the city government believe that due to the recent soaring prices, the originally listed budget items are insufficient to cover expenses, so they have added budgets one after another.

### One Spiritually Depressed One Eloquent and Persuasive Two Monks of Jing'an Temple Desmijia Retrial Request for Bail Instructions to Await Collegiate Court Decision

[Report from our Newspaper] Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Mijia of Jing'an Temple were retried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being traitors. Dewu's bald head was covered with black hair, and he was wearing a black monk's robe, looking quite depressed. Mijia wore glasses and a gray monk's robe, speaking eloquently and persuasively. Many monks came to listen, their bald heads and robes presenting a unique sight.

Dewu confessed: "I have been the abbot of Jing'an Temple for 30 years, and I invited Mijia to serve as supervisor. The Pseudo-Shanghai Buddhist Association is a religious organization composed of various temples in Shanghai. Mijia was elected as the standing director of the association. The Dobun Japanese Language School was run by the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple, which forcibly occupied two school buildings of Jing'an Temple Elementary School. I have never been the chairman of the board of the school. The principal was Monk Zhifeng, and his whereabouts are now unknown. The pseudo-report stated that I was the chairman of the board of the school and attended the opening ceremony, which is not true. The Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly was initiated by Rongzeng Kanbu, a Tibetan Lama, and held at the address of Jing'an Temple."

Mijia confessed: "The Buddhist Association is a trade association. I was elected as a standing director and had to participate. I had no relationship with the Japanese. The Japanese monk Yumoto came to China, and the Buddhist Association sent me to welcome him. There were no symposiums held. The Greater East Asia Memorial Service was initiated by the Japanese. Because Chu Minyi was a Buddhist, he was listed as one of the initiators. I have never served as the principal of Dobun Japanese Language School. The news reported at the time was not true."

Finally, the defense lawyer presented many pieces of evidence favorable to the defendant and requested bail. The court ordered a written application to be submitted for a decision by the collegiate court. The case was adjourned for retrial, and the two monks were still detained in the Zhongjian Prison.

[Report from our Newspaper] Yang Ruijun, the righteous brother of Liang Renda, went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to meet with Mayor Wu at his request. The reason why the mayor repeatedly urged him was purely to warn him not to expand the funeral, so that gangsters could take advantage of the opportunity to act. However, the family insisted on holding a large funeral. Yang said yesterday, "People always have to hold a funeral when they die. If the Municipal Government is afraid of disrupting public order, it can send police along the way to protect it." The mayor said, "We can protect it if there are few people. If you expect only a few hundred relatives to participate, but thousands of people come, how can we protect it? I already know that many schools have printed slogans and leaflets, so standing in the position of the government, I have to come out and warn you!" Finally, Mayor Wu suggested: "The date of Liang Renda's funeral can be decided as soon as possible. At that time, in addition to family members, the number of people participating in the funeral from various organizations will be restricted, and the use of any slogans and leaflets will be absolutely prohibited." After Yang Ruijun agreed, he expressed that he would discuss it with the Liang family funeral committee before making a decision.

[Another Message] According to Mayor Wu's report to reporters: Regarding the Liang family's pension fund management committee, Wu has contacted Guo Lingshuang, general manager of Wing On Company, and Guo has agreed to be responsible for the custody. As for the committee members from the Municipal Government, Mayor Wu has appointed Qian Jianqiu, a counselor of the Municipal Government. Mayor Wu said: "Fundraising has been actively launched. After the family members' candidates are determined, the management committee will be formally established."

[Report from our Newspaper] The Oriental Pharmaceutical Factory at 375 Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Intersection, suddenly had six bandits at about 6:30 PM the day before yesterday. One person stood guard at the door, and the other five rushed into the room, intending to rob. At the same time, one bandit stepped up to the second floor, intending to cut the telephone line. At that time, the factory manager Zhang Yijin and the staff and apprentices had been imprisoned in one room. Fortunately, a certain Zhang Zi, saw the bandits' actions and hurriedly flew to the roof of the fourth floor and blew the police whistle wildly. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was nearby. Chief Zhou Weiting and Deputy Chief Wang Huachen, upon hearing the report, personally led Section Chief Yu Shu, Section Member Liu Boyuan, and Judicial Section Police Lu Jianqiu to surround the factory. At this time, the bandits downstairs and the guard outside the door saw the police officers coming and knew that they had lost the wind, so they went out and escaped into the crowd. One of the bandits on the upper floor was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession: Wang Zuping, 29 years old. Based on his confession, his accomplice Wang Yimin, who lived in the Andong Hotel on Shunchang Road, was also arrested.

### List of Places Without Burial Space Both Burial and Cremation Have Problems

[Report from our Newspaper] It is reported that the mortality rate in the city, according to the statistics of the Health Bureau last year, averaged three deaths per thousand people per month. If the city is calculated with a population of 4 million, then an average of 12,000 people die each month. At present, there are more than 100,000 coffins accumulated in the city, and most of the general cemeteries are full, with only a few vacant spaces in the Hongqiao Cemetery and others. In order to solve this problem, in addition to actively clearing accumulated coffins, the Health Bureau has requested the city government to allocate 500 acres of public land for burial purposes. It is estimated that each acre can bury 100 people, so 500 acres can be used to bury 50,000 people. However, if calculated according to the above mortality rate, the 500 acres of public land will be insufficient in the short term. Although the general public intends to solve the problem with cremation, given the current facilities of the Jing'an Temple Cemetery in the city, only three cremations can be performed per day, so even if more than 100,000 accumulated coffins are cleared, it will take a long time to complete.

### Fuxing Island Mystery: The Truth Comes to Light; Li Yunpeng and Others Accused of Embezzlement and Public Prosecution for Stealing and Selling Supplies; Allegations of Gold Hidden in Bathtub Proven False; Wang Qianli and Others' False Accusation Crimes Meet Amnesty Conditions, No Prosecution

[Report from this newspaper] The Fuxing Island mystery, after four months of investigation by the District Procuratorate, has finally been revealed. Before the victory, the island was occupied by the Japanese as a naval base. When the enemy surrendered, they left behind a large amount of supplies. The first batch of reception personnel who entered the island were indeed suspected of colluding to steal and sell supplies. However, the allegation of hiding gold in a bathtub was merely a rumor that spread due to personal conflicts and malicious accusations, making the case increasingly mysterious and complicated. The defendants, Wang Qianli, a specialist from the Agricultural Committee of the Executive Yuan, Zheng Ziping, the chief foreman of the Fisheries Administration Office, Zheng Guodong, Wang Jindong, Zheng Weixin, Chen Jiahui, and others, were suspected of false accusation, but their crimes occurred before December 31, 1946, meeting the amnesty conditions under item A of the amnesty decree, therefore, they were not prosecuted. According to the non-prosecution document written by the investigating prosecutor Gu Hongbiao: After the victory, the navy was stationed on Fuxing Island, and Wang Qianli was the initial person in charge of the office established on the island by the Executive Yuan. Wang then boasted of his

Difficult Negotiations, intending to seize the position of Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of the institution. Later, because the Agricultural Committee was subordinate to the Fisheries Administration Office, Wang harbored resentment and indignation. Furthermore, Li Yunpeng, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Fisheries Administration Office, was introduced by him, and Wang Songqian and Jin Zhensheng, were his relatives and followers, respectively. Wang believed that his confidants were everywhere, and he could use the workers to expand his own power and secretly plot to undermine others, which was not a new occurrence. Later, two white porcelain bathtubs were found buried in air-raid shelters on the island, and rumors spread that they were

Full of Gold Bars. The worker who discovered them, Wang Kui, was originally a henchman of Li Yunpeng. Because Li wanted to steal supplies, he secretly colluded with Niu Chunling, a platoon leader of the navy, and conspired with Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui to transport supplies out. The news inevitably spread. Wang Qianli, considering that Li was introduced by him and should be at his disposal, hinted that Li should resign from his position as head of the General Affairs Section, intending to sabotage his plan. Unexpectedly, Li, for the sake of his own interests, feared the loss of his position and turned against him. As a result, the two sides harbored deep hatred, and Wang instigated Zheng Ziping and others to issue

Anonymous Accusations, doing their best to attack Li Yunpeng and others. After identification, the anonymous letter under the pseudonym "Bai Zhicai" was written by the defendant Zheng Weixin. Although the anonymous letters under the pseudonyms "Yang Biting" and "Yang Bitang" could not be attributed to anyone based on handwriting analysis, clues were found indicating that someone was incited by Wang Qianli. Li Xiangyuan, the recommender of Wang Qianli, was a technical officer of the Executive Yuan and the director of the First Group of the Agricultural Committee. His nephew, Yang Xiyao, also known as Shunyao, had sought employment on the island but failed. Yang Xiyao and Wang Qianli were undoubtedly in cahoots. The meaning of "Yao Shun Yu Tang" and the usage of "Heng Bi Xi Mou" were clearly derived from

The Yao Dian in the Book of Documents, making it undoubtedly a false accusation by Yang Xiyao. However, regarding the part about colluding to steal and sell supplies, Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were the first to be stationed on Fuxing Island. At that time, the supplies left by the enemy on the island had not yet been sorted out. Li and others took the opportunity to collude with Niu Chunling, the platoon leader of the Third Platoon of the First Company of the Third Battalion of the Marine Corps, who was responsible for defense on the island, and gradually smuggled supplies to Taikoo Wharf and Nicheng Bridge on the Suzhou River for sale. On June 24th of last year, Li and others sold 295 old lead sheets, a motor, 20 boxes of metal locks and door hardware, and collapsed cart frame iron pipes to Ma Jiliang, Han Shunrong, and others, with Niu responsible for transportation.

The Plot Was Discovered and seized by the Garrison Headquarters. After interrogation, only Niu Chunling was sent to the naval military court for punishment. After Niu was detained, Li Yunpeng, fearing that he would reveal the truth, pretended to visit Niu once and gave Niu's family 30 taels of gold. Therefore, the defendants Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, and Jin Zhensheng are suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. Zhu Kui is suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law, the lower paragraph of Article 1, Section 1, and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Poverty and Corruption. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated.

### Reader's Inquiry: Medical and Health

(1) Itching and Ulceration of the Feet

Chen Qiren asks: My daughter is 14 years old and weak. Last winter, blisters suddenly appeared on the sole of her right foot, which quickly festered and spread to multiple areas, causing unbearable pain and itching. Western medicine injections of serum and 606 were ineffective. What is the disease? What medicine can cure it?

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your daughter's feet may be suffering from what is commonly known as athlete's foot. You can wash them with a 1/1000 potassium permanganate solution. Before the blood test confirms syphilis, it is not advisable to inject 606 casually, otherwise accidents may easily occur.

(2) Mental Depression

Qi Renlu asks: I have several medical questions, please answer them; (1) If sleep is slightly insufficient, the left ear buzzes and the mind is depressed. (2) When sleeping or after exertion, the heartbeat is very fast. (3) When tired late at night, the brain seems to rumble, and memory declines. (4) Standing up after squatting often causes dizziness, blurred vision, and blackouts.

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] This is neurasthenia, caused by excessive mental exertion or multiple stimuli. First of all, pay attention to mental cultivation, get enough sleep, and brain tonics and other calming medicines can only be used as auxiliary treatments.

### Self-Funded Students Went to Various Ministries and Departments Yesterday to Petition

[Report from our Nanjing, 25th] More than 80 self-funded students, including Du Du, who were admitted here, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 25th. First, Vice Minister Hang and Assistant Tong, Secretary Qu met with them. Later, when Minister Zhu arrived at the Ministry, they talked again. The main points were summarized and explained: (1) In order to cultivate talent, the Ministry of Education handled the self-funded study abroad examination and the self-funded study abroad regulations clearly stipulated that the expenses would be borne by themselves. (2) The Ministry of Education has the authority to examine, but the economy is beyond its authority. (3) It is well known that each student has economic difficulties, but the emergency foreign exchange measures are a government effort to save the economic crisis. Each student should be aware of the difficulties faced by the authorities. It is impossible for this Ministry to settle foreign exchange at 3350 [Report from our Nanjing, 25th] More than 80 self-funded students who were admitted in 1946 went to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Executive Yuan and other agencies to petition on the 25th. They successively met with Jiang Menglin, Zhu Jiahua, Li Tang, and others. It is heard that the relevant agencies will discuss the foreign exchange settlement methods for self-funded students. It is feared that the students' proposal to settle foreign exchange at 3350 cannot be done, but 12,000 is also unaffordable for them. The number to be decided in the future may be between the two. In addition, the students held a press conference at 5 pm.

### The Capital's Various Departments Hosted British Educator for the Blind Yesterday

[Report from our Nanjing, 25th] Representatives from the Ministry of National Defense Education, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the two Administrations of Relief and Health held a meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs on the morning of the 25th to host Sir MacKercher, a British expert on the blind, and discuss the education of the blind. Mr. MacKercher put forward many opinions from three aspects: hygiene (such as paying attention to wiping hands), school education (such as civic training and the transmission of knowledge and skills), and occupations (such as many factory jobs that require the blind to work). He also said that the UK's education for the blind has been very effective. The US has failed to concentrate talent to handle it, and the results are inferior. According to my country, there are currently 30 schools for the blind nationwide, and Guangdong Province has 8 schools. Concentrated training of talents has achieved remarkable results, so relevant departments will concentrate into one institution to promote it. Mr. MacKercher visited Jing City's Education School on the 26th, flew to Chongqing on the 27th, and will come to Shanghai in mid-March, returning home at the end of March.

### Cao Yu Recounts What He Saw When Visiting the U.S. to Study Culture, Praising American Movies

China's famous playwright Wan Jiabao (Cao Yu) recently visited the United States to study under the State Department's cultural exchange program and has now returned to China. He has praised both Broadway and Hollywood, saying that many hard-line scripts are currently being staged in American theaters, which has disproved the saying that Broadway and Hollywood are extremely commercialized. The general public's understanding of Broadway's music is also largely inaccurate. In Hollywood, Mr. Wan observed that American film writers and producers are very enterprising and have a long-term vision. Mr. Wan discussed the issue of Chinese writers at the Hollywood Film Writers Association and felt that they were happy to exchange opinions with him. At the request of the Film Writers Association, he wrote an article on the issue of Chinese writers for publication by the Association. During his ten months in the United States, Mr. Wan visited the drama and literature departments of various universities and lectured at various universities, including the University of Washington, the Catholic University of Washington, the University of Chicago, the University of California, the University of Colorado, and Yale University. He also visited the Chinese Research Institute at Yale University. In New York, he lectured at City Hall at the invitation of Ms. Pearl S. Buck and broadcast the situation of Chinese theater to Europe and his impressions of American theater to China through the State Department's International Broadcasting Department. He also attended the National Theater Conference in New York City. At the invitation of the University of Denver, Mr. Wan attended the National Humanitarian Conference at Estes Park, Colorado, and then attended the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and Atomic Energy Conference held there. The drama department of the University of Colorado performed one of Mr. Wan's plays, "Beijing People." Mr. Wan also attended the Pacific Northwest Writers Conference in Seattle, Washington. At the invitation of the Canadian government, he stayed in Canada for a month. Mr. Wan returned to China at the end of December last year and is now translating Eugene O'Neill's play "The Iceman Cometh."

### U.S. Elementary School Teachers Strike; Authorities Order Schools to Close

### Elementary Education Federation Hosted Reporters Yesterday

Appealed for Rationing of Supplies

[Report from this newspaper] The Elementary School Teachers United Advancement Association hosted reporters at Xiangxue Garden yesterday afternoon and appealed for the right to ration supplies to private school teachers and for the dispute over the dismissal of teachers at Guanghan Elementary School. Chairman Ge Zhicheng said that the government provides daily necessities to public school teachers and staff but ignores private school teachers and staff, which is considered quite unreasonable. Last year, the government shouted the slogan that education does not distinguish between public and private. Public and private school teachers and staff have equal educational responsibilities, so this rationing of supplies should not be different. Some people say that private school teachers and staff have better salaries than public schools, but in general, there is not much difference. It cannot be generalized because of a few special cases. Private school teachers and staff should have the right to ration supplies, and there is a precedent to follow. Private schools can also apply for allocation and sale at the current Public School Staff Items Allocation Office of the City Government. In terms of the situation in this city during the enemy and puppet period, the puppet government also rationed supplies to private school teachers and staff. The government should pay more attention to this point. The Elementary Education Federation plans to unite with private secondary school teachers and staff, cultural figures, and private school teachers and staff in Nanjing to jointly fight for the right to ration supplies.

The second year of the construction plan for the Nanshi Daji Road Branch of the Municipal Stadium is being accelerated. The office building will be completed in two weeks. There are also two mobile gold houses, which can be installed within a month. Over the past month or so, it has been heard that over 33 million has been secured for the above expenses, with over 20 million still short. The stadium director is trying every means to find a solution.

Spring is coming, and the track and field season is about to begin. After building the track, the stadium plans to purchase 70 sets of standard three-purpose new-style hurdles for use in various sports meets held in late April and May and June. The stadium is currently estimating the cost and raising funds separately. It is expected that the stadium's appearance will be significantly different before the Double Ten Festival (October 10th). The turfing of the field will be left to next spring.

Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Education, visited the Nanshi Stadium in person the other day and was deeply impressed by the stadium's spirit of "creating something from nothing, and multiplying one into two," actively reviving the stadium and striving to surpass the past. Deputy Director Li said that the most difficult thing is construction, and there is no problem in starting activities, but funds must be found.

The Mengxian Cup Small Football League is held in the stadium. The stadium is being borrowed and the following points are being followed: (1) No tickets will be sold. (2) The league is limited to four weeks. If it is not finished by then, it will have to borrow another stadium. (3) The schedule will be changed when the stadium itself has a match. (4) Efforts will be made to maintain discipline and prevent various bad habits on the football field, which would affect the stadium's future development.

As soon as the Football League is over, the Nanshi Stadium will cooperate with the Sports Association Football Committee to host the Industrial and Commercial Cup Invitational Football Tournament, and will invite enthusiastic sports people to jointly undertake some obligations, hoping to achieve mutual understanding and recognition in the work, and to seek thorough unity in the sports community.

The stadium's work this year has links with the Municipal Gymnasium. The stadium and gymnasium will cooperate to promote the project, and all plans have been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau's Social Education Department. Director Wang Ruchang and Section Chief Qiao Wenquan were very interested and strongly supported the project.

In addition to cooperating with the sports community in this city, the stadium is also working closely with the National Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, the All-China Sports Federation, and the Hong Kong Football Association to divide the work and cooperate to promote sports.

### Exports Sold on Consignment - Time Limit for Settling Foreign Exchange - Designated Banks Should be Responsible for Timely Settlement

[Our Reporter] The Business Bureau and the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank yesterday jointly issued three circulars to the designated banks, making some regulations on consignment sales of exports. The following is an excerpt and translation:

Circular No. 85 states that Circular No. 12 issued on March 14, 1946, is hereby rescinded and replaced by the following regulations: Regarding the measures for designated banks to purchase export or transit exchange bills and endorse proof under Chapter VII of the Interim Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade, it is hereby stipulated that if the export is a consignment sale (that is, goods not shipped with a letter of credit), it should be handled according to the following steps: (1) The words "consignment sale" should be noted in the amended CBC8a format table. (2) The foreign exchange must be settled within the following time limits: (A) For exports to Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines, the limit is 30 days. (B) For exports to India, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia, the limit is 60 days. (C) For exports to places other than those mentioned in (A) and (B), the limit is 90 days.

(3) When the amended CBC8a format is issued to the exporter, the exporter should guarantee to the designated bank that the relevant export exchange bill will be settled to the designated bank within the above-mentioned time limit. If this guarantee is not fulfilled, the exporter must further guarantee to sell the export at the highest price under his own name in the shortest possible time. (4) The designated bank should be responsible for settling the foreign exchange obtained from the consignment sales of exports referred to in this circular to the Central Bank in a timely manner. (5) Designated banks should be very cautious in handling the documents of consignment sales of exports. At the same time, they should pay attention to the fact that the goods listed in the invoices are accurately valued, and should pay attention to settling the foreign exchange to the Central Bank.

Circular No. 86 states that the following measures for the foreign exchange settlement of existing consignment sales of exports are based on the clauses that continue to be effective in Circular No. 12: (1) Unless otherwise stipulated by the Central Bank, all foreign exchange from goods exported before November 7, 1946, must be settled to the Central Bank at the official exchange rate in effect before February 6, 1947. In such cases, it is necessary to apply for a special permit from the US Affairs Bureau of the Central Bank before March 15, 1947. (2) If the exports were shipped between November 7 and November 16, 1946, and the foreign exchange has been settled between November 6 and November 15, 1947, they are entitled to enjoy the export subsidy. (3) For exports shipped between November 17 and February 6, the foreign exchange settled can be calculated according to the exchange rate in effect on the settlement date, but the foreign exchange must be settled within the time limit stipulated in Circular No. 85. Otherwise, it will be calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of foreign exchange settlement. Circular No. 87 instructed each designated bank: (1) Starting from February 24th, a report of purchased export foreign exchange (format CBC22b & 24) should be prepared weekly, together with the invoices related to each export exchange bill, and submitted to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. (2) For consignment sales of exports, the relevant invoices and the guarantee letters submitted by the exporters must also be submitted to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank.

### Foreign Stock Market Calm

There was not much change in foreign stocks yesterday. Large stocks were still sluggish, while small stocks were still stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, British United Rayon Yarn fell by about half a percent, shipping and steel rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.

Public debt transactions were still limited yesterday, and the market was stable. The opening price of Unified C was 6,600 yuan. Although 3600 yuan was sold for 6,300 yuan, 503 and 552 rooms took the opportunity to buy at low prices, rising back to 7,300 yuan and then turning around. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B each rose by 300 yuan, C and E recovered by 500 yuan, and Unified D rose by 400 yuan. The transaction volume was 4 million yuan.

### Small Four Banks - To Be Converted into Commercial Operations

The original model for the four small banks in this city (i.e., China Commercial Bank, Siming Bank, China Industrial Bank, and National Goods Bank) was a joint government-business venture. The authorities have now decided to sell the government shares and convert them into commercial operations. It is said that the principle has already been decided, but the technical aspects are still under discussion. Because the original par value was quite low, and there is a huge difference from the current actual value, it is still being carefully reviewed how to calculate the price.

### White Sugar Opens Up 10,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was tight, and the spot white sugar, which was in short supply, was even stronger, rising by more than 10,000 yuan. The association's price for Peruvian fine sand was 230,000 yuan, and other prices also called for increases. For example, the price of Xinghua White opened up 210,000 yuan to 256,000 yuan. Xinghua Red was 150,000 yuan to 147,000 yuan. Shunde Green was 140,000 yuan to 137,800 yuan. The price of Dazhuang Green was 143,000 yuan, and the price of cotton red was 151,000 yuan. Dozens of packages of Jianbang open white sugar were sold, priced at 200,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan. The price of Diao Green was 138,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. A total of 500-600 pieces were sold.

### Selling Pressure Envelops the Market - Yarn Prices Fall Step by Step

The yarn market was even more sluggish yesterday. From the opening, it was always enveloped by selling pressure. There were few buyers, and the selling prices of various counts fell step by step. Although the market authorities had listed the prices of various counts sold by Fangjian on the 24th on the blackboard one by one, and repeatedly warned the industry to add only 5% as a legal profit, the actual transaction price was often lower than the price issued by Fangjian, and there were still few buyers, which shows the general downturn in transactions. At the close, the various prices were down another 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and people's minds were still extremely tired.

### Cotton Cloth Prices See Downstream

The cotton cloth market was initially stable yesterday, but the market was sluggish. It was heard that the Cotton Cloth Association would decide to carry out inventory registration, which made people feel tired, and people in the industry scrambled to sell, and floating households sold off one after another. The initial opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 140,000 yuan, then it retreated to 136,000 yuan, and finally it was 139,500 yuan. The price of Wufu once fell to 132,000 yuan, and finally it was 137,000 yuan. The prices of other colored cloth and Tulin cloth also saw downstream. In addition, Fangjian Company opened and sold various cloths as usual. The listed price of Wufu fine cloth was 137,000 yuan, and the listed price of Sijunzi and Jinyin Zhigong was 136,000 yuan.

### Cotton Transactions Stagnant

Cotton transactions were still stagnant yesterday. Only Xin Xin No. 6 Factory purchased 100 bales of Hankou fine lint cotton at a price of 560,000 yuan per dan. In addition, Xin Xin No. 2 Factory purchased 100 bales of Lingshi cotton at a price of 830,000 yuan.

### Grain Prices Stable - Oil Market Retreats, Miscellaneous Grains Step Up

Yesterday, a total of 15,200 shih of rice arrived at the market. The Nanshi market was stable in the morning and tight in the afternoon, while the Beishi market was strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice had little rise or fall and was in a stable position. White yuan and yin yuan also had little fluctuation, and xian rice was similar. The transaction price of high-quality goods was 110,000 yuan for white japonica, 100,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan for thin rice, 104,000 yuan for early rice, and 101,000 to 3,000 yuan for yang xian rice. The price of white yuan was 118,000 to 125,000 yuan.

The price adjustment for the oil market is under discussion, and the distribution of oil is in progress. A telegram from Qingdao reported that the market was tired and the shops were watching and waiting. The prices of all oils retreated by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The soybean cake was discontinued in various ports, and the price fell by 2,000 yuan.

The entrepot trade of soybeans was stagnant, and the street was quiet, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were rising and fixed, broad beans were fixed, mung beans were tired, and corn was stable in Qingdao, but firm in secret. Red sorghum was similar, raw peanuts were lively in the Guangdong and Nanyang markets, and continued to rise by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Sesame was fragrant and dry in the Nanyang market, and the price stepped up, reaching a high point and rising by another 10,000 yuan. Cotton cake fell by 2,000 yuan, cotton seeds were stable, and dried sweet potatoes were downstream with little trading.

### Promoting Foreign Sales to Southeast Asia: City Chamber of Commerce Collects Samples

The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild, with the aim of expanding cotton cloth exports to Southeast Asia, has sent letters to its members to collect samples of various patterns. These samples are being sent to the City Chamber of Commerce for collation. The majority of the samples have already been collected, with cotton-silk blends being the most numerous. The Chamber is currently numbering and affixing them, and they will be sent out soon. The City Chamber of Commerce is initiating this promotion of exports to Southeast Asia for a wide variety of goods. All types of domestic products for which the domestic cost, combined with transportation to the region, can achieve a balanced export market price, are welcome to submit samples for joint dispatch. The Chamber is currently in discussions with various guilds.

### Silver Exchange Guild Continues to Petition for Permission to Operate Small-Amount Deposit Business; Drafts Seven Articles for Resumption of Business

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Money Exchange Guild yesterday again submitted a petition to the Central Bank, seeking permission to operate small-amount deposit business. Jiang Yuncheng, chairman of the guild, and standing directors Li Lansheng, Liu Xichen, and others, are scheduled to visit Central Bank Governor Bei today to represent the industry in their appeal. The guild's submission to the Central Bank is recorded as follows: "Submission regarding the continued request for permission to resume operating small-amount deposit business, in order to maintain livelihoods. Since the implementation of the three temporary measures for trading American dollars last autumn, our industry has been brought to a standstill, and maintaining operations has become difficult. On November 1, 1946, we submitted a document with proposed improvements, requesting approval. Now that the government has promulgated emergency economic measures, prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currencies, our entire industry has been brought to a standstill, and our lifeline has been cut off. The guild has over 200 members. There are many employees, and even more who rely on it indirectly for their livelihoods. If they lose their jobs, the public will be alarmed and unable to live in peace. Changing to another industry is neither what they are accustomed to, nor without difficulties. Therefore, after a meeting and discussion, it was decided that resuming the pre-war operation of small-amount deposit business is the most appropriate solution. It does not interfere with the government's financial control, and it also provides assistance to small businesses, industries, and ordinary people. The unemployment problem can also be solved. The benefits are numerous and appropriate. However, the previous proposal is not suitable for the current situation. We respectfully submit seven new articles for your review. You, in your position as Governor, oversee the economy and manage finance. We humbly request that you consider our situation and grant your approval. This would be a great service. Respectfully submitted to Central Bank Governor Bei."

Attached are the "Measures for Resuming Small-Amount Deposit Business": 1. Adjust the capital amount. 2. Comply with deposit reserve requirements. 3. Comply with all regulations regarding financial management. 4. Standardize the accounting system to facilitate audits by the competent authorities. 5. Change the name of all businesses to "Silver House" to ensure uniformity. 6. Limit membership to existing members. 7. Prevent the transfer of licenses and prohibit the replacement of key personnel.

### Representatives of Silver Shop Guild and Employees Petition Mayor Wu Yesterday, Requesting Him to Convey Their Grievances to the Relevant Authorities

[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of the Silver Shop Guild, including Qiu Tianshi, Yao Yunwen, Yao Guiqing, Lao Tian[name unclear], Qiu Yunmin, Sun Jiejun of Lao Feng Xiang, and Fei Baihong of Qingyun, along with Zhang Dejun, chairman of the Employees' Union, and many representatives from Nanjing, Ningbo, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and other places, went to the Municipal Government at noon yesterday to petition Mayor Wu, personally delivering a written petition. Mayor Wu received them in the reception room. The representatives stated that the reason for repeatedly petitioning the authorities was due to economic hardship, adding that "those in the industry with heavier family burdens will soon face panic. The silver shop industry has always been law-abiding. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the emergency economic measures, it is tantamount to a death sentence. Therefore, we hope that the central government will allow the free buying and selling of decorative gold, so that the silver shop industry can continue to survive." After reviewing their petition, Mayor Wu stated that "the central government's promulgation of emergency economic measures was a last resort. Therefore, I hope the silver shop industry can consider the government's perspective and sacrifice themselves for the overall situation. Regarding the requests you have made, I am not the competent authority and have no power to respond. Currently, I can only suggest that you temporarily respect the central government's orders, and at the same time submit your requests to the relevant authorities." The representatives stated that they had visited Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi, but without success. They therefore appealed to Mayor Wu for assistance, requesting him to forward their petition and speak on their behalf, so that their plight could reach the higher authorities and rescue the silver shop industry from its dire situation. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his sympathy and said that he would do his best to help.

Yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, the Shanghai silver shop industry, along with representatives from other cities, gathered at the New Capital Hotel to discuss the situation. They resolved that starting today, all petitioning representatives, more than seventy in total (including representatives from all over the country and labor representatives from Shanghai), would travel to Nanjing in batches to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant ministries, requesting changes to the six articles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the livelihoods of over a million silver shop employees nationwide.

### Statistics on Quantity of Second Batch of Silk Weaving Raw Materials Issued

[Our Newspaper's Report] The application for the second batch of raw materials from the Silk Weaving Joint Operation Company was submitted yesterday to the Business Management Office of the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Association. The second batch involves a total of 318 looms, requiring 40 bales of spun silk and 53 bales of rayon. The first batch of raw materials, totaling 200 bales of spun silk and 300 bales of rayon, has already been issued to 203 silk weaving factories, involving a total of 1,632 looms.

### Export of Eggs Basically Approved in Principle; Tung Oil Export Target of 50,000 Tons This Year

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the export of eggs from our country has been approved in principle. Once the details are finalized, exports can begin. The main destination for our country's egg exports is currently the United Kingdom, and will likely start with frozen eggs. Before the war, our country's export volume of frozen eggs reached 40,000 to 50,000 tons annually. This year, approximately 9,000 tons can be shipped, equivalent to about 1.8 million British pounds. As the weather gradually warms, egg prices are also expected to gradually decrease. As of February 15, the market price for frozen eggs was approximately 230 to 240 British pounds per ton. The current price is around 210 British pounds, which is close to the British offer of 200 British pounds.

Experts estimate that based on last year's export situation for tung oil, it is expected that the export target of 50,000 tons can be achieved this year. Shanghai is expected to account for 70% of these exports, and Hong Kong for 30%. However, the current price of tung oil abroad is only 38 cents per pound, equivalent to 500,000 yuan per picul in our currency. While our current market price is 450,000 to 500,000 yuan per picul, making it difficult to initiate exports.

### Domestic Scented Tea Prices Rise

Various types of domestic tea have seen increased activity from local shops and traders from Suzhou, especially jasmine-scented tea. There is a considerable quantity currently being inspected. However, sellers are demanding exceptionally high prices, reaching 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan per dan, which might make smooth transactions difficult. As for the foreign-operated tea market, British export companies are still inquiring about Keemun black tea, but are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the current high prices. There are still transactions and stable prices for other varieties such as Special Fine and Fine Hyson.

### Coal Sales are Sluggish

Due to the warmer weather, sales of white coal are relatively weak. Due to the scarcity of supply, sellers are trying to maintain prices, resulting in sluggish transactions. Sales of bituminous coal have been picking up at lower prices, so prices have stopped falling and turned firmer. Supply and demand for firewood and charcoal are balanced, and prices are very stable. Due to a shortage of key raw materials, the quality of briquettes has been repeatedly reduced, and factory prices continue to rise. Users have mostly switched to other alternative fuels, so sales have slightly declined compared to before.

### First Batch of Jiaozuo Coal to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, has completed his inspection of coal mines in Taiwan and left by ship yesterday, expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow. Since the decision to allocate coal to public school teachers and staff, the monthly demand in Shanghai is 7,000 tons, and in Nanjing, with more civil servants, it is 8,000 tons, totaling 15,000 tons. It is understood that the Fuel Management Committee, in order to increase supply, sent a large number of personnel to the Jiaozuo coal mine. The transportation problem on the Pinghan Railway has also been resolved, so the first batch of Jiaozuo coal is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late March. The current unrest is hindering the effort to increase coal production. For example, the Fuel Management Committee was planning to send personnel to the Chuanshan coal mine, but the city had already fallen before they arrived. The Zhongxing coal mine has also been started twice but was destroyed.

### Flannel Prices Rise Across the Board

Fine wool flannels, both for suits and overcoats, and for men's and women's robes, which are in demand for spring, rose further in price yesterday. Both wholesale and retail prices increased across the board. Light gray colors were selling relatively actively, with local merchants making some purchases. Although most transactions were for single pieces, the trading was quite lively, as it is currently very difficult to place orders given the exchange rate, and costs invariably exceed market prices.

### Melton Cloth Prices Decline

The market for Melton cloth turned downward yesterday. Some sellers were willing to sell at 480,000 to 490,000 yuan to raise cash. Although it will be difficult to order this product in the future, and the cost would be 700,000 yuan based on an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan per US dollar, demand has decreased due to the warmer weather and the end of the selling season. Holders, due to interest costs and the need to turn over capital for other goods, had no choice but to cut prices and sell, otherwise they would be stuck with the goods for months.

### Flour Mills Utilize Loans to Purchase Wheat for Rationed Supply; Losses in the Past Will be Discussed for Subsidies

The rationed flour supply in Shanghai, which began on the 22nd, is being supplied by the five major flour mills – Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong – using flour made from wheat purchased with a 2 billion yuan loan from the Joint Relief Association and 1.5 billion yuan raised by the mills themselves. Previously, it was agreed with the Municipal Government to purchase 50,000 shi of wheat from producing areas at a price of 5,100 yuan per dan for transportation to Shanghai to meet civilian needs. Now, because the supply plan for public school teachers and staff will be implemented in March, the purchase volume will be increased to 110,000 bags, which can last until the end of the month, requiring the funds to be turned over twice. Purchases are currently being made in three regions: Wuxi for Maoxin, Shanghai for Fuxin, and Taizhou for Fufeng. It is estimated that there are still 100,000 dan of stored wheat along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line, so there is no concern about procurement. Wheat from the Wuxi area has already begun to arrive in Shanghai, and the total amount received to date is more than 50,000 dan. The price per dan ranges from 70,000 yuan to the current purchase price of 82,000 yuan. The cost of producing each bag is 58,000 yuan. The controlled price in Shanghai is 30,000 yuan per bag for the factory and 31,500 yuan for retail. Losses for February will be 6 billion yuan. Representatives from the mills are currently in discussions with Mayor Wu. It is reported that the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Food are discussing subsidizing the losses by discounting the value of flour reserves. Details are pending. Furthermore, after the wheat ordered from abroad by the China Trust Bureau arrives in Shanghai and is unloaded in late March, other preferential measures will be determined, allowing the mills to choose between acting as processing agents and purchasers. In March, because public school teachers and staff will be the primary beneficiaries of the rationed flour, the amount sold to general consumers by noodle shops and other businesses will be greatly reduced. Several members of the fried dough stick and pancake industry, as well as the noodle industry, are privately reselling rationed flour on the black market, earning exorbitant profits. The Social Affairs Bureau is investigating the retail books of various stores and will impose punishments if offenses are confirmed. From August 19 to December 31 last year, the five flour mills supplied a total of 2.35 million bags of flour. This year, the number is 600,000 bags, totaling 2.9 million bags. Government subsidies consisted of 5,000 tons of wheat allocated by the China Trust Bureau, equivalent to 170,000 bags of locally produced wheat, and 160,000 bags of foreign flour. Because of the ban on exports from Shanghai and the controlled prices of flour, the mills are experiencing difficulties in maintaining profitability. However, along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line, there are more than 50 small and medium-sized flour mills that are profiting greatly by taking advantage of transshipments to North China.

### Tea Merchants Request Central Bank to Increase Purchase Prices

Regarding tea purchase matters, tea merchant representative Sun Xiaocun went to the Central Bank yesterday afternoon to submit the Tea Merchants' Association members' general meeting resolution, requesting higher purchase prices, or allowing tea merchants to take back and export their products themselves, and granting a three-month grace period for repayment of past loans. According to a responsible person at the Central Bank, the request for higher purchase prices is unlikely to be approved because there was a previous agreement and it has already been reported to the central government. The tea merchants' request for an increase due to the current exchange rate adjustment does not seem reasonable. Regarding self-export, there will certainly be no problem if the Agricultural Bank loans are repaid. A three-month grace period for repayment of loans is also impossible. It is reported that the Central Bank will respond to the association today based on the above two reasons.

### Rayon Prices Rise Again

Rayon prices rose again yesterday. Due to widespread rumors that allocation would be suspended and allocation prices would increase, prices rose sharply immediately after the market opened. 120-count Takayama bright rayon opened at 7.1 million yuan, and then rose immediately. The closing price at noon was 7.4 million yuan. Prices were higher in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 7.7 million yuan, and then sold at 7.55 million yuan. Dealers traded among themselves at 7.5 million yuan. The mill business was quiet yesterday. There were no transactions by foreign firms. Users made transactions for 10 dan of D-grade rayon, priced at 7.8 million yuan. Dealers offered another dan at 6 million yuan, but there were no transactions. The silk goods trade was sparse, and prices were similar to the previous day. Only Hua Jin crepe saw an increase of 2-300 yuan due to the rise in rayon prices.

### Rayon Staple Fiber Approved for Import

The Tianyuan Industrial Corporation, the exclusive agent for American Viscose Corporation's rayon staple fiber, previously requested permission to import it from the Executive Committee of the Import Temporary Management Commission. It is now reported that the request has been submitted by the Commission to the joint meeting of the Reclassification and Appeal Issues Subcommittee and the Tariff Issues Advisory Committee for their second meeting. The decision was that rayon staple fiber is to be treated as rayon and classified under tariff item 130 for import.

### China Trust Bureau Temporarily Suspends Allocation of Rayon

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Trust Bureau originally planned to allocate rayon on Monday, but temporarily suspended it due to unresolved pricing issues. Yesterday, the price of Takayama rayon had already reached a high of 7.5 million yuan. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau's rayon allocation is still awaiting President Song's approval of the allocation price before allocation can proceed.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Petitions Today for Relaxation of Import Quotas

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Guild, in order to request the relaxation of import quotas for Western medicines, has appointed Gu Keming, Chen Fenghao, Ge [name unclear] Sheng, Wu Zhiwei, Huang Suifeng, Ni [name unclear] Fu, and Chen Mingshan as representatives to petition the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee today. In addition, because the Western medicine quota for February to April of this year has been temporarily suspended, they are requesting that the Western medicine quota be included in the chemical quota for calculation.

The industry has also submitted a request to the Department of Health, requesting: (1) That 20% of the Western medicines allocated by the Materials Supply Bureau be paired with domestically produced Western medicines. (2) That there should be no distinction between Chinese and Western medicines when testing finished medicines. (3) That the finished medicines that have already been submitted for inspection should be certified as soon as possible.

### Conservation of Foreign Exchange Resources; Difficult to Fulfill Requests for Relaxation

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a responsible person at the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee: (1) The regulations of the office for the import quota of various items in the second category were carefully discussed and determined in advance by experts and people of insight from all parties. According to reliable statistics, the total value of imports of certain raw materials and machinery this year will reach US$472.59 million. However, the total foreign exchange resources available from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese for the whole year are only US$200 million. Therefore, in order to conserve foreign exchange, it will be difficult to fulfill requests from various industries for relaxation of quotas. (2) The import quota for newsprint is quite large among the import quotas for various items. However, the cultural sector still feels that it is insufficient. They will try to consider improvements in the next quarter. (3) The quota for tobacco is relatively large because the Ministry of Finance is considering the substantial tax revenue, which supplements the overall national income.

### Coconut Oil Prices Continue to Fall

[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the large amount of arrivals of small Luzon coconut oil last year, the market price once fell from 320,000 yuan per dan to 130,000 yuan. Last winter, due to the prohibition of exports from Southeast Asia, import merchants suffered losses on most orders. Arrivals were scarce and sales increased sharply, so prices once rose to 800,000 yuan per dan. It is now reported that a certain merchant has imported more than 1,000 barrels of coconut oil (400 pounds per barrel). Due to the recent decline in actual sales, the asking price on the market yesterday was 400,000 yuan per dan, but there were no buyers.

### New York Hog Bristle Market Weak; Casing Prices to Be Discussed Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a cable received by hog bristle exporters in Shanghai from New York: The hog bristle market is quite weak. Chongqing bristles for delivery in New York are priced at US$2.70, Hankou No. 17 hog bristles at US$3.95, and Shanghai No. 17 bristles at US$2.00. New prices for hog bristles were seen in Shanghai yesterday. The new price for Chongqing bristles was 4 million yuan, Hankou bristles 5.6 million yuan, and Shanghai No. 17 bristles 3 million yuan.

### Kaifeng, 18th [Day] Air Dispatch: Battle of Zhengzhuang Village

— By Our Correspondent in Bian [Kaifeng], Wang Shoumei

General Wu Shaozhou's Battle Garments Stained with Blood: New Victory Stabilizes the Overall Situation in the Central Plains

At a time when the situation in the Eastern Henan battlefield was unimaginably tense, General Wu Shaozhou, who had long been renowned on the battlefield, led his reorganized 85th Division to the vicinity of Yejigang on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, joining the combat sequence to protect Eastern Henan. It was precisely because of the arrival of this elite force that the Communists were even more determined in their plan to focus on attacking the main forces of the Nationalists. And it was precisely because the Communists wanted to realize this plan that the Nationalists achieved this unprecedented great victory, which was the Battle of Dengzhuang Village from the night of the 12th of this month to 1:00 PM on the 13th. In this battle, in terms of results, the Nationalists achieved unprecedented success, with the Communists suffering over 15,000 casualties and prisoners, abandoning countless corpses and weapons, and losing their so-called "strong" fighting will. In terms of its value to the overall situation, it was a great victory, not only turning the precarious situation in the Central Plains from danger to safety and lifting the threat to Xuzhou, but also fundamentally shaking the Communists in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region. However, this battle was too tragic, too tragic to be described with pen and ink, so fierce as to be unbelievable. The Communists stormed into the village and occupied the courtyard directly across from General Wu's divisional headquarters. The Communists' storm-like grenades killed officers and soldiers around General Wu, and blood stained General Wu's battle garments. However, he still maintained a firm and calm command, achieving the expected results. This news, as soon as the battle ended, spread like a gust of wind to the besieged city of Kaifeng. Because there were no trains, and the Nationalist forces were still clearing the battlefield, it was not until sunset on the 15th that this reporter finally arrived at Zhengzhuang Village, four miles south of Yejigang – a very, very small village.

Reporting the Battle Situation in the Military Headquarters Tent: Trembling with Fear, Unable to Bear to Hear It

After getting off the train, stepping over corpses, and jumping into a jeep, amidst the rumbling of vehicles and the neighing of horses, [we] drove into the battered 85th Division headquarters in Zhengzhuang Village. After taking photos of the senior generals of the divisional headquarters amidst the bomb shrapnel and scattered firewood in the courtyard, I entered a small military headquarters tent with General Wu and others. The short, stocky, and courageous Deputy Division Commander Ni Zuyao began reporting the battle situation to me in a machine gun-like tone. He seemed to be in the midst of combat as he recounted the course of the battle, the tragic details of which made me tremble with fear and unable to bear to listen:

They were transferred from Northern Henan to Yejigang on the 9th and got off the train. As soon as they got off the train, the Communists treated them as their primary target. The 6th and 7th Columns attacked Zhengzhuang Village from the north of Suixian and Qixian, the 3rd Column attacked Zhengzhuang Village from the west of Minquan, and the 1st and 2nd Columns, under the command of Liu Bocheng, attacked from Wangqiao in the north towards the south. All distances were less than thirty li. Seeing this situation, General Wu, in order to seize the initiative, under these circumstances of "the mountain rain is about to come, and the wind fills the tower," dispatched the 67th Regiment of the 23rd Brigade eastward on the 10th to strike west of Minquan. After fighting for more than a day, they eliminated more than 700 Communists and captured more than 100 Communists. This was the prelude to this great battle.

Flesh and Blood Flying, Ghosts and Gods Weeping: Soldiers Throw Down Their Guns and Surrender

The small victory west of Minquan was the proximate cause that accelerated the outbreak of this great battle. On the 11th, the Communist forces on all fronts launched active offensives. Although they suffered strong resistance, in the face of overwhelming numerical superiority, they had approached the vicinity of Zhengzhuang Village.

On the night of the 12th, the brewing of this great battle reached its climax. Liu Bocheng summoned cadres above the regimental commander level in Wangqiao and gave a speech, saying: "This time we must capture Zhengzhuang Village, we must annihilate the 85th Division. If we defeat the 85th Division, I will invite everyone to Kaifeng to see a show. Everyone must strive to be worthy." In the darkness of the night, they were inspired by the god of war and mobilized like madmen. At this time, the Nationalist forces' deployment was as follows: the 85th Division headquarters was stationed in Zhengzhuang Village, with the exception of a company directly under [HQ], there was also an engineer battalion and an infantry battalion. The 23rd Brigade of the division was stationed in Linzhuang, three li west of Zhengzhuang Village, the 110th Brigade was stationed in Zhuzhuang, four li east of Zhengzhuang, and the friendly 72nd Division was stationed entirely in Yejigang. The Communist forces used a part of the 1st and 3rd Columns to attack the 72nd Division in Yejigang. In addition, the entire 2nd Column, with six reinforced regiments, and the entire 6th and 7th Columns, fiercely attacked Zhengzhuang Village. A part of the 3rd Column attacked the 110th Brigade in Zhuzhuang, and the 5th Column attacked the 23rd Brigade in Linzhuang.

The battle began at 11:00 PM that night. After discovering the enemy situation, the Zhengzhuang Village defenders began firing artillery. Then the Communist forces in the south had forced their way into the firing range of the Nationalist machine guns. From then on, a network of fire was formed on and outside the village walls. Rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, hand grenades, and mortars all fired continuously, with firepower reaching its peak. Men shouted, horses screamed, ghosts cried, and gods wailed. People fell one after another, and flesh and blood flew. Under the cover of intense firepower, the Communist forces outside the village crawled forward. They jumped into the village moat but were blown up in the water by hand grenades from the village walls. They climbed up the village walls but were stabbed and rolled back into the village moat. The war became more and more tragic. In the firelight, countless attackers were seen falling to the ground, and one after another, the village walls were seen collapsing. However, no one wavered. At 3:00 AM, the north village gate was once broken through by the Communist forces, but after the defending troops eliminated them, they blocked it again. At 3:30 AM, the artillery fire thinned slightly, but after a burst of bugle calls, in the firelight, the Communist forces, like a surging tide outside the village, desperately ran towards the southwest corner of the village. In an instant, the firepower was concentrated on the southwest corner of the village, like a violent storm, unstoppable. At 4:00 AM, the 16th Regiment of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Column of the Communist forces, led by Regiment Commander Song Dongxu, under the cover of strong firepower, after five or six failed attempts, finally used ladders to storm into Zhengzhuang Village. An even more tragic battle unfolded inside the village. Corners of walls and rooftops all became battlefields. A road and a house were all being contested with flesh and blood. Every minute and every second was performing a tragic and heroic drama. Only machine guns and hand grenades roared and exploded wildly, and other weapons had lost their effectiveness. The two sides jumped back and forth on the slopes of the houses and moved around in the holes in the walls, attacking and defending each other, advancing as the other retreated, like a seesaw, like grinding a millstone. After fighting bitterly like this for more than an hour, the Communist forces finally advanced fifty meters and occupied the courtyard across from the divisional headquarters. This was the location of the 85th Division's staff office, less than ten meters from the divisional headquarters. The courtyard of the divisional headquarters became the overall target of the Communist hand grenades and machine guns. General Wu's staff officers and guards were killed one after another by the explosions. However, the Communist forces could not advance any further. The defenders began using fire attacks. Under the command of General Wu's radio, the 23rd Brigade and the 110th Brigade outside the village also narrowed the encirclement and concentrated their forces inside the village. As a result, the Communist forces who had not entered the village, under heavy pressure, scattered, abandoning corpses everywhere and throwing away their helmets and armor. The Communist forces in Yejigang also retreated under the strong attacks of the 72nd Division. The Communist forces inside the village, seeing that they were insurmountable and knowing that their escape route was cut off, also wavered. Soldiers wanted to lay down their arms, and officers wanted to surrender. Therefore, in that most urgent situation, the officers above the company commander level in that regiment held a meeting. After analyzing the situation at that time, Regiment Commander Song did not express his opinion on retreat and surrender because the political commissar was present, but he conveyed this opinion to the company commanders with his eyes. The first company commander took the lead in advocating the surrender of weapons, but the political commissar shot him dead first. Seeing this situation, Regiment Commander Song was forced to lead the attack again, but Regiment Commander Song was the first to be killed in action. The rest also fell to the ground one after another. Only the political commissar was still supervising the battle, but by 8:00 AM, the political commissar was also killed by his own men. The remaining three hundred officers and soldiers still resisted in the houses. Among them, a small number of soldiers who were no longer monitored and oppressed by the officers threw out their guns and surrendered. At this time, the Nationalist forces' fire attack made the remaining Communist forces unable to advance or retreat, unable to fly away even if they had wings, and many were burned to death.

At 9:30 AM, the 110th Brigade was the first to send a battalion into the village. By 11:00 AM, the Communist forces in the village were completely annihilated. Scattered battles outside ended at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

Splendid Victory and Pride: Who is Harming Compatriots?

In this tragic battle, the Nationalist forces achieved a glorious victory. 2,100 corpses of Communist soldiers were found. 4,567 wounded Communist officers and soldiers were captured. 900 Communist officers and soldiers were taken prisoner. The total number of Communist deaths in the battle was approximately 15,000. 397 rifles, 30 light machine guns, 10 heavy machine guns, and 15 artillery pieces of various sizes were captured. From the perspective of the war alone, this victory was extremely glorious. However, after Deputy Division Commander Ni finished his report, General Wu Shaozhou said in a somber and sincere tone: "The tragedy of this battle is unprecedented. Although this division, in cooperation with the friendly 72nd Division, achieved this victory, we do not want to boast or be proud. On the contrary, we feel very saddened because those killed were all our compatriots. Who is harming them? We really don't want to fight them!"

Pitiful Bones on the Edge of Zhengzhuang Village: Still Yearning for Loved Ones in Spring Dreams

In the dim twilight, accompanied by a staff officer from the divisional headquarters, the reporter climbed the village walls to inspect the battlefield. The earth was filled with murderous intent, and the cold wind drove people back. Looking out over the fields, corpses were piled up, and small fires flickered. Looking down at the village moat, red water had formed ditches, and floating corpses were piled up. The tragic scene was simply unbearable to look at. Filled with grief, my mind recalled two old lines of poetry: "Pitiful bones by the Han River, still yearning for loved ones in spring dreams!" With tears in my eyes and gritting my teeth, I was forced by the sad emotions to descend from the city walls.

Broken Walls and Ruins Like a Land of Ghosts: Searching Everywhere for Bloody Rags

Inside the village, there were corpses of humans and animals everywhere, and broken walls and ruins everywhere. Not a single resident was seen, not a single chicken or dog was seen, not a single intact tree was seen, and there was no place that was not covered in blood. Bullet marks were scattered everywhere, and shrapnel was piled up everywhere. Tree branches lay scattered horizontally and vertically, and bloody rags were everywhere. In ordinary people's homes, there were walls but no homes, rooms but no windows, windows but no doors, doors but no people. Those who died had died, and those who had not died had fled. The human world had turned into a land of ghosts.

### New Scenes of Fuzhou: Air Dispatch from Fuzhou, 10th [Day]

— By Our Special Correspondent, Chen Zhengyu

Black rats and white rice have caused an uproar in Fuzhou and have become the news center of Fuzhou. Death and famine, who doesn't fear them! Last year, Fuzhou suffered a major plague of rats. Because prevention was not thorough, how many people died under the rats is unknown. There is still lingering fear. Therefore, this year, the epidemic prevention agencies have prepared various necessary measures for rat prevention early, such as universal injections and rural mobile epidemic prevention publicity, with the intention of fighting the rats with their backs to the city. A grand health exhibition was held in the city a few days ago, displaying various dead rat specimens, which was shocking. The number of visitors reached 30,000, showing how deep the impression of rats is on the people of Fuzhou.

Returned Overseas Chinese Gathered: Sighing for No Ships

It is heard that most of the overseas Chinese in the eastern counties are from Gutian. With the assistance of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration (行總) and the United Relief Administration (聯總), hundreds of overseas Chinese from Fuzhou and its surrounding counties were sent back to their old places to restart their businesses by the Wanfu Shilin [ship] at the beginning of last month. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office复会 [met again] with the Executive Yuan Relief Administration’s Fujian Office to handle the repatriation of overseas Chinese from various parts of Myanmar. In recent days, more than a thousand people have registered, and about five hundred have been approved to come to Fuzhou for gathering. The special transportation for repatriated overseas Chinese was originally scheduled to arrive in Fuzhou in mid-month, but it has recently been heard that it will have to wait until next month before ships can be allocated to come to Fuzhou. These nearly five hundred overseas Chinese are now gathered in the city of Fuzhou, and they are all worried because they hear that they cannot leave in a short period of time. Recently, vehicles with the words "Special Vehicle for Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country" can be seen traveling back and forth on the streets, probably because they live in the city, and special vehicles are used to send them to the Taijiang District for meals every day. This is inconvenient for the overseas Chinese themselves, and it also places a heavy burden on the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and the United Relief Administration authorities responsible for the repatriation. An overseas Chinese told the reporter that the Executive Yuan Relief Administration should not have gathered them so quickly before being fully prepared, as this increases their travel fatigue.

Prices Are Skyrocketing: Long-Distance Phones Busy

Recently, prices have soared, with grain prices taking the lead. If luxury goods are expensive, you can do without them, but when you are hungry, how can you not eat rice? The price of rice in Fuzhou is like a wild horse, uncontrollable. Not only is the price different in the morning and evening, but it also changes in an instant. At the time the reporter wrote, the price of rice had climbed to a high of 160,000 yuan. As usual, when the price of grain rises, the municipal government holds meetings with relevant agencies to discuss and resolve to suppress the price of rice, or releases a small amount of grain at a low price. However, without grasping the core of the problem, the results are minimal. The press in Fuzhou criticizes the municipal government, saying that poor management is the fundamental problem, and we must face reality.

Because of the rising price of rice, many people in difficult circumstances have switched to eating coarse grains. Moreover, the rice [sellers] took the opportunity to raise the price of coarse grains as well. When they can't afford coarse grains either, they can only wait for the misfortune of famine to strike. The general public is worried about the price of grain, and the municipal government is helpless, and the common people are even more helpless. Only the activity of the rice weevils can be seen. They have murderous looks on their faces, as if they are facing a great enemy, strategizing in the military tent. The long-distance telephone business in Fuzhou has been particularly brisk recently. Eight or nine out of ten people waiting to make calls are wealthy merchants. With their orders, they have seized many opportunities! They are almost fighting the municipal government.

Poor Households Account for 60,000 of More Than 80,000 Households

According to vague statistics, poor households account for 60,000 of the more than 80,000 households in Fuzhou. Of course, these poor households are divided into small poor, big poor, and extremely poor, but the circumstances of poverty are not too different. At first, they had full hopes for the relief efforts carried out by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, but the facts repeatedly disappointed them. Taking winter relief as an example: the long process of meetings, discussions, and reviews goes from winter to spring and is still "about to be distributed soon." These poor households are in an increasingly miserable situation of hunger and cold in the face of the biting north wind and high prices. The reporter inspected the slum areas, and they were all gathered in groups of three or five in dilapidated houses, using scraps of branches and wood to make fires for warmth. Whether old or young, they were all withered and lacked human form, making a living by begging for leftovers or picking up rotten vegetable leaves to cook and eat. Most of the elderly are no longer willing to move around and are not afraid of death. They have little interest in the so-called "relief." When winter relief is mentioned, they mostly look indifferent, which is truly shameful for the gentlemen of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration.

Everyone knows how the relief efforts in Fuzhou are being handled. After Lin Rongsen, the former deputy director of the Fujian-Zhejiang branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, was dismissed for embezzlement and dereliction of duty, the institutions and personnel of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration in Fujian underwent a major change. However, administrative efficiency has not improved, and the bureaucratization of personnel and the officialization of affairs are the focus of criticism.

Plans as Decoration: Boldly Laying Off Staff

The 36th year of the Republic is a new year, and all agencies will inevitably come up with a grand administrative plan. Roads are to be repaired, water conservancy is to be developed, and industry and commerce are to be managed. It seems that all kinds of government affairs are to be handled. However, it is best not to mention money, like "a horse that can run fast and not eat grass." This year's provincial government budget is only 30 billion yuan, of which 23 billion yuan is needed to eat. There is little left. What can be done? Therefore, the plan is a plan, just for decoration. The provincial fisheries bureau's annual operating expenses are less than one million yuan, which is one example. In this era, being able to maintain the status quo is a first-class role, and everyone encourages each other with this.

Various agencies are laying off staff and reducing government expenses with great fanfare. The provincial party headquarters laid off three-quarters of its 204 employees, leaving only 45 people. The provincial government laid off staff last September, and the municipal government is already considering laying off staff. There are dozens of female employees in the municipal tax bureau, and the mayor said that the city's financial support today is limited, so they might as well take on family relief work as well, and the female employees are likely to be the first to be on the blacklist. As soon as staff is laid off, the unemployment line is strengthened day by day. The unemployment problem in Fuzhou today is quite serious.

Power Outages, Petty Thieves Emerge, Lamenting Songs, No Meat to Eat

Mentioning the Fuzhou Electric Company is a headache! Fuzhou does not have running water facilities. The only modern public utilities are cars and electric lights. The old and ailing motors of the electric light factory are a major cause of power outages, and the company's mismanagement also provides an opportunity for criticism. The Fuzhou Electric Company says that the reason why the power goes out repeatedly is that too much electricity is stolen by special classes, and the motors cannot bear the load. Moreover, the electricity bills are repeatedly raised, and some users have to pay as much as a thousand yuan per kilowatt-hour. It is unfair for general users to bear the electricity bills for the electricity-stealing class. When the power goes out at night, it is the time when petty thieves are active. Many cases of theft have occurred in the dark. For example, the Dajianguo Western Clothing Store in Nanmendou had dozens of bolts of woolen cloth stolen during a power outage. The people of Fuzhou all have complaints about the Electric Company.

Fuzhou newspapers report that so-called special classes are causing trouble by forcibly purchasing pork, causing butchers to strike. They have not tasted meat for five days. Who are these special classes? Everyone knows it but doesn't say it, as if they are masked heroes. Because the butchers have been on strike for five days, the municipal government has lost nearly ten million yuan in pork tax. Butchers in Linsen County transport pork to Fuzhou City and sell it at black market prices, which creates a new problem of unclear boundaries between Linsen County and Fuzhou City. The people of Fuzhou sing in lament: "No meat to eat, insufficient nutrition; no car to ride, difficult to walk."

### Complex Political Situation: A Complete Picture of Liaobei in Thailand; A Heavy Task of Reconstruction

— Aired from Changchun on the 12th, by our reporter Zhao Zhan

Liaobei Province, on the new map of the nine northeastern provinces, is a long corridor running northwest to southeast. It borders Andong to the east, Jilin, Nenjiang, and Xing'an to the north, Chahar to the west, and Rehe and Liaoning to the south. Liaobei governs a total of ten counties: Changtu, Hailong, Liaoyuan, Lishu, Kaiyuan, Xifeng, Xi'an, Dongfeng, Tongliao, and Changling; as well as eight Mongolian banners: the Front, Middle, and Rear Banners of the Right Wing of Horqin, the Front, Middle, and Rear Banners of the Left Wing of Horqin, the Jalaid Banner, and the Ghorlos Banner. Its area is 89,021 square kilometers, with a population of 3,864,321. The administrative problems of Liaobei are quite complex. On its narrow map, the area of the Mongolian banners accounts for half. Going northwest from Tongliao, one enters the hinterland of the Mongolian nomadic people. (The Mongolian banners within the Northeast and Rehe are collectively known as "Eastern Mongolia.") "Eastern Mongolia" is a region whose social state is isolated from the interior and whose political situation is complex.

I remember in mid-February of this year, when the fervent student patriotic movement spread across the motherland, and the ranks of patriotic youth parading and demonstrating showed a new Great Wall of flesh and blood, the so-called Eastern Mongolian People's Autonomous Army was stirring up a whirlwind of perverse actions on the Mongolian grasslands. These descendants of Genghis Khan have historically experienced many "storms." The command post of "Eastern Mongolian Autonomy" was located at the Wangye Temple in the Front Banner of the Right Wing of Horqin, and Liaobei contained the nerve center of this alienated part.

Liaobei, as a province, can be said to be another society, another political unit, and another economic unit. In "administration," both aspects must be taken into account. The reconstruction work in Liaobei is much heavier than in other provinces. Since the National Army entered Liaobei in February of this year until now, Liaobei has gradually recovered, and the outlook for this year's provincial administration is worth mentioning. It is divided into civil affairs, finance, education, construction, and Mongolian banners, and each item is described below:

Civil Affairs Work: Initial Foundation Laid

Since the National Army stationed in Liaobei until now, the counties and cities have been taken over one after another. However, in recovering the counties and cities, with the exception of Siping City, Xi'an, and Lishu, which were completely taken over, a small number of streets and villages were occupied by the Communist Army, disrupting the local area. The Communist Army took over the three banners of the Left Wing of Horqin, and the remaining five banners are still under the control of the Communist Army. The most noteworthy thing is, of course, the Mongolian banners. The Communist Army once gave them a propaganda talk, inciting the centrifugal force of the Mongolian people.

The establishment of the initial buds of local autonomy in the post-liberation administration work has involved two important tasks: one is the establishment of public opinion institutions below the provincial level, and the other is the election of local public officials. The establishment steps of public opinion institutions are to convene village class people's congresses in rural areas, organize temporary street village district people's congresses, and discuss matters of reform. This work was completed in early August last year. The preparations for the municipal, county, and banner temporary participation conferences were hastily and sloppily handled. Some counties were taken over very late, and the election of representatives inevitably had some accusations. Many vacancies are still reserved for later candidates. This kind of temporary participation conference is only to awaken the attention of the people. Each county was established from mid-September to mid-October. For the sake of a solemn ceremony, Chairman Liu's three instructions of "opening," "meeting," and "closing" took the lead. The form looked like democracy from top to bottom.

The provincial temporary participation conference was elected on November 5 and announced its establishment on November 11. The situation was roughly the same as that of the county, city, and banner temporary participation conferences. From December 15 to 22, the first meeting was held for ten days, comprehensively reviewing the provincial administration work and making various suggestions. It was the initial foundation for local autonomy. The public was very indifferent to the election. On the one hand, it was the result of the enemy's and puppet's fourteen years of high-pressure politics. On the other hand, with today's raging war, the people's livelihood is uncertain, and the public is groaning under the high pressure of life and has no time to take care of politics.

Secondly, land administration work is quite cumbersome and complicated. In the months from after "August 15" to February of the 35th year, drastic land reforms like a storm attacked the countryside. Chinese people took back the land from the Japanese, and the Communist Party divided the land from the landlords to the poor. The society had no laws to follow, and all the methods were unconventional, and the rural order was very chaotic. Farmers tumbled in the land turmoil and did not get any benefits. The fruits of land production were all swallowed by rioters, and the countryside was rapidly going bankrupt, with a lack of labor and barren cultivated land. The Japanese left, and the Communist Party left, leaving behind a bad land debt to be cleared up. The Liaobei Provincial Government divided it into three items: 1. Organizing land registration maps, 2. Handling land administration cases that have not been concluded, 3. Formulating various regulations and methods related to land administration matters to adjust land administration and resolve land ownership disputes.

Frequent Wars, Difficult People's Livelihood

"Poor people and exhausted wealth" is the host of Liaobei today. Since the restoration, it has experienced turmoil, and people's livelihood has reached its extreme. As a result of the Communist Army's occupation and disruption of Liaobei, local security work is difficult. Judging from the ratio of provincial and county financial expenditures, the allocation of security local team recruitment and regular expenses is a large amount. The total budget for the province in the 35th year is about 1.05 billion yuan, and the expenditure of security teams accounts for 560 million yuan, accounting for more than one-half. Administrative expenses are second, and subsidies for counties, cities, and banners are second. Therefore, the expenses of the province, counties, cities, and banners are very difficult. At that time, the Xingyuan only provided 4 million yuan per month, which was not enough to maintain the provincial administration. The provincial finance is subordinate to the central government and has no independent tax source. The counties, cities, and banners form their own system. Since most of the rural areas have been recovered, the people are in dire straits, and commerce and industry are declining. The source of tax revenue is exhausted, and the expenses are extremely difficult. Some county and banner chiefs are not very affluent in their travel expenses to take office.

After the National Financial Conference closed in June last year, the land tax and business tax were assigned to local tax collection. This is the two major sources of provincial and county funding. The handling situation is described below:

The standard for land tax collection in kind is based on the amount calculated by combining the regular and supplementary taxes in the twelfth year of the puppet Manchukuo (ie, the 34th year of the Republic of China). The old tax quota is 30 city pounds of sorghum for every yuan, and each pound is discounted at 5 yuan in circulation coupons. After Liaobei is fully recovered, it is expected to collect 3.1 billion yuan throughout the year. The actual income last year was only 1.3 billion yuan. The sharing standard at all levels is that the central government gets 12%, the province gets 16.8%, and the county (city banner) and street village get 71.2%. The land tax collection in kind failed to reach the predetermined amount due to the exodus of farmers and the barren cultivated land. Compared with the collection standards in Guannei, the Northeast is lower, but considering the tragic destruction of the Northeast, even the lower burden is felt to be serious. The farmers in Zhizhu Village, Lishu County, Liaobei took the lead and formed a petition group at the end of last year to request the provincial government to exempt land tax. Chairman Liu agreed to reduce it by 60%, but the representatives were not satisfied and decided to petition the Northeast Xingyuan. This is the wave that farmers are boiling up in pain.

The total amount of business tax to be taxed in the 35th year is about 1.435 billion yuan. According to the current business tax rate of 1.5%, the total amount of business tax revenue is 66 million yuan. Because the province's commerce is declining and most of the stores are closed, only 60% can be calculated, and the actual income is more than 39.9 million yuan.

Liaobei is known as a warehouse area, and grain stone tax is also one of the most promising tax revenues. The provincial government has drafted collection methods and submitted them to the Xingyuan for approval before implementation.

The financial needs of counties, cities, and banners are huge, but the source of tax revenue is not abundant. The Xingyuan stipulates that the original tax items of the puppet Manchukuo should be collected first, and no new taxes should be added in order to be considerate of the people's difficulties. However, due to the tragic destruction of the counties, the tax revenue is very difficult, and the income and expenditure of each county are not enough, and the losses are very large.

In addition, the local taxes such as the use of spleen license tax, livestock donation, and fruit donation are increased in accordance with the price index, which greatly benefits the local finance. The immovable property acquisition donation, fishery tax, special product donation, and land tax are all abolished.

Mongolian People's Economy: Extremely Frustrated

The situation in half of Liaobei has not yet stabilized. The Mongolian banners are too deeply isolated from the interior, and the Mongolian people have their political demands and are tempted and influenced by external factors and violence. At present, only the army can enter the Mongolian banners, and ordinary people cannot enter the Mongolian banners. The government's takeover of the Mongolian banners is still led by the army. This is due to the special situation in Inner Mongolia, but the failure of political and economic coordination with the demands of the Mongolian people is a major shortcoming. Chairman Liu Handong has limited knowledge of the Mongolian banners. When I asked Mr. Zhang Jia'ao about the economic problems of the Mongolian banners, he also said that he had not studied them. Today, the two major problems of the Mongolian banners are the land disputes between Mongolians and Han Chinese. According to the Mongolian people, the grassland belt they have conserved is the last lifeline, and the resettlement of Han Chinese has threatened their life money. "If you die of hunger, you would rather fight for the sheep" has become a political slogan. Secondly, the livestock fur of the Mongolian people cannot find a market in the turbulent Northeast. Due to the interruption of transportation, the problem of entering the field has become a major problem, which has caused heavy losses to the Mongolian people. The demand to break the economic depression is an important factor in political impulses. Today, the primary problem in Liaobei lies in this.

Another Call for Abandoned Corpses by the Roadside

Editor: The avenues that we must pass to and from work are Lyuban Road and Luban Road. Luban Road is an unclean street. In the section between the shops and the Chaohui Villa (cemetery), it was originally an open space. Last summer, a group of refugees came and built some thatched huts in this open space by the roadside as their residences. Their lives are simple, and the thatched huts are full of darkness and dirt. The roadside is covered with sewage and garbage, and no one cares. Further south from this thatched hut, outside the wall of the Chaohui Villa's southern end, that place can be said to be an open-air mortuary. Many people abandon corpses in that place. Most of these corpses are infant corpses, so they are all wrapped in broken straw mats and bags. Some are exposed with their hands and feet, and there are very few wooden boxes. I think there must be some who starved to death, but I am afraid that more died from infectious diseases. Moreover, it often takes three to five weeks or more for no one to collect them, which is a great threat to the nearby people. As the weather gets warmer, the danger is unimaginable. Our agency previously informed the local police and the Municipal Health Bureau by letter. After more than two weeks, those corpses were still piled up. Our agency usually has foreign consultants coming and going. When I think about what would happen if they found this situation, may I ask if this is adding to our society's stains?

Therefore, I am using your newspaper's space to expose this inhuman and unsanitary living hell. I believe that the municipal authorities should strictly prohibit the common people from abandoning corpses at will, and should send people to check at any time, and immediately bury the abandoned corpses. (Shi Yiming) Editor's Note: On the 14th of this month, Wen Shengjun made a similar appeal, which has already been published. Today, Yimingjun made the above statement again, which should be disclosed again for the health authorities to check and improve.

Spring and Autumn

### Turmoil

— Xiang Peiliang

It is said that history is cyclical. This is a very cruel prediction. Everyone wants to deny it, but it seems that no one has the courage to firmly deny it. "Take the past as a mirror, and you can know the rise and fall." History originally wanted us not to take those old roads, but in fact it stubbornly clings to some long-standing human suffering and teaches us to taste it. And the cycle of history seems to have become an iron fact.

At the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, there was already a strong accusation against political insecurity and the turmoil of the times. "Big rat, big rat, I will leave you." This is the cry of a fugitive. "I entered from outside, and the people in the room all accused me." This is the cry of a small public official. "I look around, and I am at a loss where to go." This is a common saying of someone who is worried about the times. Although these were written by people more than two thousand years ago, do we not feel that these are the languages that we heard people say just yesterday!

Far away seventeen hundred years ago, there was a woman named Cai Wenji who was captured by the chaotic soldiers of the civil war. She wrote a poem with tears and blood, titled "Grief and Anger." Although Chinese poets teach gentleness and sincerity, when they experience the most tragic circumstances, they have no choice but to be both resentful and angry. The "Grief and Anger" poem, recorded over seven hundred years ago, is still vividly in our minds.

"Zhuo's army came under the car, and the golden armor shone with sunlight. On flat land, people are weak, and the soldiers are all Hu Qiang. In the wild, the cities and towns, all that passed were destroyed.斩截 no survivors, corpses supported each other. Hanging people's heads beside the horse, carrying women behind the horse. Driving west into the pass, the return route is dangerous and obstructed. Looking back at the vast distance, the liver and spleen are rotten. There are tens of thousands of people who have been captured, and they are not allowed to gather together. Some have flesh and blood together, but they dare not speak. If they are unhappy, they will say that they will kill the surrendered captives. They will be cooked with a knife. 'I will not let you live.' If you dare to cherish your life, you cannot bear the suffering. Or they will add extreme punishments, and poisons and torments will be used together.

"And then they cry and walk, and at night they sit and grieve. They cannot die if they want to, and there is nothing they can do if they want to live. What is the crime of the blue sky, that they should encounter such a disaster..."

Almost at the same time as "Grief and Anger," Wang Can wrote his "Seven Sorrows" poem, recording what he saw when he went to Liuzhou from Chang'an at the age of seventeen, which was just the Dong Zhuo Rebellion.

"The western capital is chaotic and without images, and jackals and tigers are plotting against each other. They abandoned China again and entrusted themselves to Jingman. They abandoned China again, and friends chased each other. There was nothing to see when they went out, and white bones covered the plain! There was a hungry woman on the road, holding her child and abandoning it in the grass. She heard the sound of crying and sobbing, wiped her tears and did not return. 'I don't know where I will die, how can I complete both?' She drove her horse and abandoned it, unable to bear to hear this sound. She climbed the bank of Baling in the south and looked back at Chang'an. She realized that the people under the spring were sighing and hurting their hearts."

In times of great chaos, mothers even abandon their children, sadly saying: "I don't know where I will die, how can I complete both!" These ten words are truly written with infinite fresh blood! Everyone who fled west through Xianggui in the 33rd year must have engraved in their hearts the meaning of this poem. At that time, I was fortunate to be traveling south, carrying my three-year-old daughter out of the 600-mile Lian Mountain. But I saw the tragic scene of white bones covering the plain in more than one place. When I passed through a prosperous city that had tens of thousands of residents not long ago and could not find a complete old house, my mood was like Wang Can looking at Chang'an.

In the 31st year, I passed through the area of Xiangtan, Changsha, and Liling, just when the farmers were busy. Women were often seen working in the fields. In that area, the custom was that women never went to the fields. So I remembered the nursery rhyme during the reign of Emperor Huan: "The wheat is green and the barley is withered, who will be the one who does the work? It is the wife and the aunt. You have a car, please drum the dragon flute for you!" And Du Fu also had a similar sentence: "Since there are strong women holding hoes and plows, the seedlings are born in the ridges without east or west." But what describes the most tragic conscription is Chen Lin's "Drinking Horses at the Great Wall Cave": "There are many strong men and few young men in the border city, and there are many widows in the inner house. Write a letter to the inner house, and marry and do not stay. Serve the new mother-in-law well and always look at my old husband!" How few such letters of blood and tears have there been in the past ten years!

The one who wrote the most poignant description of turmoil is Du Fu. His Three Officials (Shi Hao Official, Tongguan Official, Xin'an Official) and Three Separations (Separation without a Home, Separation after Marriage, Separation in Old Age) should be included in the world's most realistic tragedies. He himself narrated what he had experienced, such as "Going to Fengxian to Sing about My Feelings," "When I entered the door, I heard wailing, and my young son had already starved to death." I was fortunate not to have reached that point. But like "Tonight the moon in Fuzhou, the woman in the boudoir only looks at it alone, remotely pitying the young children, who do not understand to miss Chang'an," like "Wife and children were surprised that I was there, and after they were surprised, they wiped away their tears. In the middle of the night, they held candles and looked at each other as if in a dream," like "All my brothers are scattered, and no one asks about life and death," like "The pampered child does not leave my lap, but is afraid of me and goes away again," etc., are all things that make me cry every time I read them. The "Peng Ya Xing" writes about the journey in the midst of turmoil, carrying his wife and children, stumbling on a difficult road, which is really a portrayal of my escape into the Jinxiu Yao Mountain in the winter of the 33rd year. I think today there will still be countless people reading this poem, feeling sad about the past and the present, and crying sadly.

"I remember when I first avoided the thieves, I went north through dangerous difficulties. Deep in the night, the Peng Ya Road, the moon shone on the White Water Mountain. I walked for a long time in the painting room, and I often met people with thick faces. The valley birds sang in disorder, and I did not see the returning wanderer. The foolish girl bit me because she was hungry, and cried for fear that the tigers and wolves would hear. I covered her mouth in my arms, and she turned and scolded me in a low voice. The little child tried to understand, so he asked for bitter plums. It had not rained for ten days, and the mud was slippery and we stumbled on each other. Since there was no rain gear, the road was slippery and the clothes were cold. Sometimes we went through hardships, and we only traveled a few miles all day long. We filled our stomachs with wild fruits, and we made roofs with humble branches. We drew water on the stones early in the morning, and we slept in the smoke on the horizon at dusk..."

Even Li Shangyin, who is famous for his beauty, has the following sentences: "Children and grandchildren are not yet born, and they are abandoned without grief. They will no longer discuss where to go, but only wish to die in the mountains." Han Wei, who wrote boudoir poems, also sadly chanted, "The water flows slowly and the sun slants, there are no chickens or dogs, only the cries of crows. Thousands of villages and thousands of houses are like cold temples, and you can only see flowers but no people!

Eight years of resistance against Japan, one year of demobilization, and the civil war, which we do not know when it will end, make us reread the works of people a thousand or two thousand years ago, as if they were living in this era again. Western legends say that a ghost will come back to life after death: sin will be repeated again and again. But if history is really cyclical, then the fate of Huang Chao, An Lushan, and Dong Zhuo has already been doomed.

Did the ancients not already say: "Heaven's way is good to return." And also said: "Only soldiers are ominous." And also said: "A soldier is like fire, and if he is not cheap, he will burn himself." And also said: "It can carry a boat, and it can overturn a boat." When it reaches a certain limit, the ancient ignorant and docile people will also say: "When will the sun perish, I will perish with you!" One day, the docile sheep will become fierce lions.

This era is dyed with blood, and the blood is flowing more and more vast. I will borrow the sentences of the ancients to describe this period of turmoil. High hall peeps, white hair is mottled. I dare not say whether I still have the strength to write new poems, but I firmly believe that there will be such poems, and I can read them. (February of the 36th year)

### Love

— Soviet Union. He Gaier

### Writing My Thoughts

— Yang Mou

Lifting up my head and opening my eyes, it's a series of annoying, boring, cunning, and deceitful things... Life is like a net, life is like a prison, and it buries life without hesitation.

No words, everything that needs to be said has been said. If I were deaf, blind, and dumb, I believe it wouldn't necessarily be painful—no, I believe it would be happiness. The fabricated world must be much stronger than this ugly real world.

I love freedom, I like to soar. I'm stubborn, I'm stubborn. Alas, to this real world, I'm angry.

Tolstoy said: "For the sake of love, one should live for others." Yes, living for oneself is for the satisfaction of love, but what is it for if life is only for consuming some boring moments? I want to ask, what is it for?

There is no right or wrong, no black or white, this is the world. The flood of desires, the struggle for profit, this is society. I will also light a cigarette, whistle a cheerful tune, and pretend to be happy, but to vent my anger in leisure, it will only add more sorrow.

Only thinking is free, but because of this, I am even more afraid to think. The silent thoughts are like venomous snakes, pouring bitter sweat into life. Blessed people, close your thoughts!

Anger is like a spark, even if it is suppressed, it is still burning and brewing a greater brilliance. Is that so, truth is eternal—it is eternal, I wish it eternal, for its sake, I have restrained my anger, we must live and fight bravely.

### Candlelight

— Jiang Dun

Candlelight, burning itself, giving light to the world.

The lamp went out. I drew back the sky-blue curtain, gazing at the starry sky, quietly indulging in thoughts. How many times on nights like this, I have transformed all my beautiful ideals and hopes into silver stars! Scattered across the sky, letting my faith face the starry sky, always so firm, so devout!

"Use your fingertips to caress the stars in the sky!" This symbolizes the lofty ideals of all scientists, philosophers, and poets! And us people, people born on the earth, looking up, yearning for the starry sky, allowing all those struggling in pain to obtain immortal faith and infinite hope! To obtain amazing discoveries and inventions, and endless creations and creations.

Facing the starry sky is human instinct and will, and man, man on the earth, his destiny is forever a shining candle, burning himself, to pursue that immortal light. May we be like a star in the sky! Because, in the world, that candlelight is just the final ashes!

A candlelight, when it is bright, tears through a piece of darkness! When countless candlelights are lit, even on a cold night, it is warm! Be a candlelight, and all those who are struggling in the darkness, burning their youth, their lives, the torment of blood and tears, not only warms yourself, but also warms countless people. Not only illuminating your own heart, but also illuminating countless pure souls.

Everyone is like a candlelight, emitting warmth, emitting light! Everyone wants to be a star, and everyone, in the world, will also be an eternal star

I pulled up the sky-blue curtain. Every friend I miss is like a bright star, shining in my heart! I lit a candle, and on this long winter night, I wrote poems to bless them! My life is burning because of countless people...

The golden candlelight reflects the crystal tears, which is the suffering of heaven, but also endless joy!

I am burning myself, I am giving light to the world!

### Centipedes and Others

— Meng Nong

(I)

The poet Lu Fangweng said, "To learn poetry, one should look beyond poetry." This is a valuable piece of advice based on experience. By extension, to learn how to write, one should also strive to learn from outside the realm of writing.

Understanding this principle, one can also understand why many teachers are not necessarily writers, and why many grammar experts are not necessarily great literary masters. One can also understand why modern writers advocate reading beyond the confines of books, and why they do not encourage young people to read novels and other similar books as a shortcut to writing.

There is no shortcut to any learning. The only way is to start walking, step by step, continuously. Even if there is no path at the beginning, as long as one keeps walking, one can still forge one's own path.

(II)

The British zoologist Lankester was a scientist who was deeply thoughtful and skilled in observation. He once cleverly cited a fable to illustrate that a centipede is a multi-legged animal that can walk, but it doesn't know how to walk at all. However, this does not affect its ability to walk. There is a poem to prove it:

A centipede went out for a leisurely stroll,
When a toad jokingly asked him:
"Please tell me, which leg goes first? Which leg goes last?"
This question brought all sorts of doubts to the centipede's mind,
Until later, exhausted, exhausted, it fell into the gutter, still not knowing how to start walking.

(III)

The centipede's doubts are obstacles and stumbling blocks on its journey. Once it falls into the gutter, it becomes a laughing stock for the toads.

Old scholars tell young students that to write well, one must cite the classics. New literary talents teach young people that to write well, one must study logic or dialectics. In reality, if you listen to the former, you will at most only be able to cite classics, but your writing may not necessarily be "beautiful and impressive." If you listen to the latter, your consciousness may be correct, but your writing will always be full of slogans, which are dead things rather than living works. In fact, there is no difference.

Such "writers," apart from falling into traps or new gutters, seem unlikely to find another way.

### Inscription for Daqian's Scroll Painting of Sichuan Mountains and Qin Trees for Muhann

— Xie Wuliang

My brother Muhann traveled north the year before last, taking in the sights of Jianmen Pass. Daqian painted the mountains and rivers he passed through. Many famous figures wrote poems for it. I have been asked to write an inscription many times, but have not yet done so. In recent days, I have been delighted to hear the news of the defeat of the fierce enemies. I am even more mindful of the difficulty of Muhann's grand tour before this. I write this song in haste to send to him, hoping for his correction. Fifth day after the Autumn Equinox, Year of Yiyou.

Master Zhang stands tall at eight feet,
With bright pupils and a broad forehead, not ordinary.
Although he assists among hundreds of officials,
His ambition is always to soar to the clouds.
When the fierce bandits suddenly invaded from the east,
Thousands of riders patrolled the west.
The temporary capital was grandly established,
Making Sichuan shine.
Supporting each other, they rushed to help.
How could Master Zhang refuse to serve?
Yet because of official duties and limited salary,
He freely visited the mountains and rivers:
He explored Yu's Cave, gazing at the vastness,
The spring grass fragrant beside Kuerping.
Qingcheng is secluded, like a sky-high barn,
Emei's peaks soar high, summer frost flies.
He only heard the Buddhist and Daoist masters open the altar,
Raising his head, he couldn't help but feel emotional.
From ancient times, setting up defenses was the way to govern the country,
Relying on the northern route to connect Yong and Liang.
After the Qin army entered, the Five Strong Men fell,
Protecting the country originally relied on good planning.
Curious and nostalgic, he could not forget,
The Jianmen Pass plank road clings to the cliffs.
He also invited worthy companions Huang and Zhang,
(Referring to Junbi and Daqian)
By land and water, they advanced together, observing yin and yang.
The rise and fall of the Han and Tang dynasties are countless,
The Thousand Buddha Passage is magnificent.
The traces of the flying immortals have disappeared.
The bottom of Mingyue Gorge is cool and clear.
Chaotian Post Ridge is connected to the Qiang people,
The shape of the mountains and the flow of the water rise and fall together.
Creek villages hide under false names,
The old danger of Qipan Pass has been lost.
Riding in the same carriage, drinking wine, happy and unrestrained,
The night rain in Wulian rustles.
Wu Daozi once painted the Jialing River,
Daqian's paintings are inspired and fly high.
Now the whole world sees that we have recovered,
Master Zhang hurriedly prepared to return south.
He smiles at the painting, putting away his official duties.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 184

— Ye Jingfeng

People who have not done intelligence work generally have two kinds of mentality towards intelligence operations. One mentality believes that this kind of work is extremely mysterious, so they are inevitably surprised and astonished by the effectiveness of this kind of work, and regard the people who do this kind of work as swordsmen and heroes who come and go without a trace. The other kind of mentality thinks that this kind of work is not worth mentioning, but some conspirators secretly make plans, take advantage of people's unpreparedness, and take ruthless measures. So they think it is just the tricks of demons and ghosts in the dark.

However, these two kinds of views are just the words of laymen, not scratching the itch. They don't know that intelligence operations are like evenly matched opponents. They also need to plan carefully in advance, need proper command, need sophisticated equipment, and need officers and soldiers to do their best and strive for the lead. And the especially difficult point is that intelligence is different from military affairs, because there are many operations that are carried out by individuals alone. Therefore, if the members are complex, lack loyalty, lack faith, are poorly trained, and are of poor quality, it often happens that the entire army is wiped out because of the dereliction of duty of one person.

Since I met Mr. W, I have seen him handle several important operations with my own eyes, and I think he is a genius: not only in intelligence. If you ask him to use the energy and wisdom he used in intelligence work in military affairs, he will definitely become a famous general; if he uses it in politics, he will definitely be a first-class politician; if he uses it in science, he will definitely be an inventor or an explorer of new theories; if he uses it in business or industry, he will definitely be a leading expert.

At a little after eight o'clock, I and Hucheng went upstairs to Mr. W's office and met him busy giving orders. There were a dozen people standing in the room, and one or two were sitting. It turned out that he was arranging the assault work at this time, assigning groups, and issuing instructions.

Most of the dozen or so comrades who were standing quietly were around 30 years old, and there were also one or two university students in their twenties, and two or three people from the professional world in their forties. But everyone was full of energy and calm.

Mr. W's organization has one peculiar feature. It seems that there is no distinction between the core members and the supporting actors, just like the organization of a Kunqu opera troupe. Whoever takes turns to be the protagonist is the protagonist. When it's not their turn to be the protagonist, they also play supporting roles, and they also play the big gong on the stage. It seems to have a sense of equality. However, there are also different levels, but the standards for ranking levels are not only based on qualifications, but mostly based on the performance during training, the efficiency during the trial period, and the merits during formal service, rising or falling. The salary is completely in accordance with the military treatment. Although the treatment of higher and lower levels is slightly different, on the whole, everyone can only get a little meager living expenses.

Because I have been living here recently and have more contact with him, I know a lot about Mr. W's subordinates. At this time, among these dozen or so comrades, there was a strong man in his forties who used to be a police officer in Beiping and was most familiar with the Beiping area. His duties tonight were all arranged by him, and even the highest-ranking officer in charge of the operation had to listen to his orders.

When we entered the room, Mr. W just nodded slightly as a greeting, and then continued to give orders. His voice was not loud, but his pronunciation was accurate and his sentences were concise and powerful. An order was only issued once. If the person receiving the order had any vague points when repeating it, Mr. W would definitely repeat the order again. As long as you listen quietly by the side, you will know that Mr. W really has great talent. His pronunciation is clear, and his thinking is quick and systematic. Just this one small assault command, but listening from the side, you can also feel that it is complex and chaotic, with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands. However, he was able to unravel the threads and keep everything in order, which proves that he is truly meticulous.

### Reading "San Mao Joins the Army"

— Li

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the progress of cartoons was obvious to us. In today's world where illiteracy prevails, a good cartoon is far more functional than a profound and pungent essay. However, with the instability of the social environment and the reduction or contraction of publications, our opportunities to read cartoons have also decreased. - Not to mention the magazines that specialized in war cartoons before the War of Resistance Against Japan that we cannot see today, even the cartoons published as inserts in color versions, how many magazines can we see them in today? Continuous cartoons such as Ye Qianyu's "Mr. Wang", Zhang Leping's "San Mao", and Huang Xiao's "Bull Nose" are even more...

However, not long ago we finally saw Zhang Leping's "San Mao Joins the Army" in this newspaper again, which is really a pleasant surprise.

"San Mao was a figure from ten years ago. In theory, after ten years, he should have grown into a talented person, but I am still drawing San Mao now, and drawing the old San Mao, because I feel that San Mao's living environment has not changed at all in the past ten years. Ten years ago, San Mao picked up garbage and slept on the road. Ten years later, San Mao has still not improved. The only slight difference in spirit is that ten years later, San Mao learned to be like an adult, doing business on the road, smoking American cigarette butts, and shouting 'Hi! Joe!'. Since San Mao has so many problems, I feel that I can't finish drawing him and can't finish writing about him."

The author said this in the "Preface" in the first volume after compiling his military notes "into a book".

"No change in ten years", is this San Mao's misfortune? Or the author's cruelty? Or is it the sorrow of those of us who are alive?

The content of the first volume of "San Mao Joins the Army" does not need my introduction, because it has already been published in this newspaper. I am a layman when it comes to cartoons, so of course I can't talk about the technical advantages. What I can report is that a volume I had has been taken away by my little daughter who is just in the first grade of elementary school, and has become a treasure to brag about to her friends. There is no explanation in the picture, but she can still draw it in a methodical way.

My opinion is that I think San Mao can retire from the army. The pain of war is already too much for us to bear. Regardless of whether San Mao has grown into a talented person or not, let him put down his gun first. Although he may still return to the life of "picking up garbage and sleeping on the road", the most important thing is to put down the gun in his hand now so that he doesn't have to "pick up garbage" and doesn't have to "sleep on the road"!

### "For the Record"

— Ye Heng

Application for "Production Loan" Retrospective

Last year, I and several friends operated a small factory. At the end of the year, we saw the news in the newspaper that the authorities had specially lent 2 billion in "production loans" to help the struggling industries and businesses in Shanghai. At the same time, our factory was being troubled by high interest rates, so we were overjoyed and rushed to the Joint Savings Society to inquire about the loan procedures.

The Lunar New Year is the end of the year for every merchant. If this business cannot settle all its debts at this time, then it may be stranded. It was precisely because of this reason that we regarded obtaining this "production loan" as the fate of our factory, and I was specially appointed to be responsible for applying for the loan.

The first time: I stepped into the grand hall of the Bank of China and found Room "2118" on the second floor. It was already crowded with people. Everyone had a hopeful heart, the same anxious face, and was inquiring about the form-filling, investigation, mortgage, and deadline issues that they urgently wanted to know from the reception staff. I stood quietly by the side, not wanting to ask questions, and at the same time it was difficult to interrupt to ask questions, so I withdrew like this.

The second time: I chose a time close to the break and went straight to their office, took out the business card of our factory, and sincerely and humbly asked for all the points I wanted to know. The result: the forms had not yet been printed, and I had to wait for three days. I ran out of the Bank of China's grand hall in disappointment. Three days later, I got up especially early and rushed to the front of everyone who wanted to get the form. In the state of being crowded, though not in a line, I was lucky enough to get a set of forms. I treasured them and carefully returned to our factory - this was the third time.

After several people repeatedly deliberated and filled out the application, compiled the factory's balance sheet, listed the inventory of pledges, and wrote a letter of request for a loan with earnest words, I went to Room "218" for the fourth time. Several people's faces were too familiar; because they and I were pursuing the same goal, it can be said that their joys and sorrows were consistent; I handed the completed form to a staff member, who glanced at it lightly and said, "15 million!" I took it and said, "Yes! We are small businesses." He pointed to the mailing office, and I understood and solemnly sent it to the mailing office and took back the receipt.

The newspaper said that after accepting the application, someone would come to investigate within a week, and the loan could be received after ten days. We summoned all 20 workers and explained that if someone came to investigate, your spirits should be invigorated, the factory should be tidy and clean, which can prove that our factory is not big, but it is very orderly and also very hopeful. After waiting until the sixth day, which was only two days before the end of the year, the day when the workers asked for a rest, the investigator came. We hurriedly checked the account books, raw materials, and inventory one by one, and offered cigarettes and tea, hoping for the success of the loan.

The next day: Another investigator from an agency came and asked for this and that in the same way. We skillfully complied, and as a result, he also left as if he had gained something. The day after that was New Year's Eve, and I couldn't help but run to the Joint Savings Society to inquire whether our loan would be approved? When will it be available next year at the earliest? A simple answer was that they didn't know either, so I counted it as my fifth trip.

After the New Year, I made my sixth trip on the fourth day of the new year, and ran into Room "218", which had already been completely changed. It turned out that the "production loan" had ended. I heard that only 20 of the thousands of applications investigated last time had been approved. Then, we, and the small loans like us, I'm afraid there will be no hope. But, just in case, the committee members of the review committee happen to be in a "good mood", maybe there is still hope. I left the office in a daze and met the people who came to apply together last year in the corridor.

The second month of the lunar calendar has already begun, and the "production loan" seems to have disappeared without a trace. With a desperate heart, I still reluctantly recalled the six trips to the "Bank of China".

This is the general process of our application for the "production loan". Now, although the "production loan" has become an ear-piercing term in the golden tide, I am always willing to record the process of our application as above for the record.

### Fish that Escaped the Net

— Sheng Jie

Why Isn't Li Xianglan Extradited?

According to a faithful report from a Chinese reporter stationed in Tokyo, Li Xianglan (Japanese name: Yamaguchi Yoshiko), a Japanese female spy who was once active in Shanghai and Northeast China under MacArthur's control, has reappeared on the streets of Tokyo, and is relying on her beauty to enter and exit social venues, becoming very familiar with the officials. Her activities in Tokyo are even better than her actions in China in the past. In order to protect our country, this female spy Li Xianglan, who once helped the enemy kill our compatriots, should be immediately extradited back to China. Otherwise, letting this fish that escaped the net roam freely overseas will cause a great disturbance in the future.

### More on Tiger Hunting

— Ma Jin

Recalling that the XX regiment of the XX Day travelled east and west, busily travelling among the major cities in the recovered areas, at that time it made a bold statement: "We should hunt more tigers and swat fewer flies." How long has it been? The words are still there, but the facts are completely different.

With a grand and majestic momentum, in the end, it is inevitable that the flags will be lowered and the drums will be silenced, which is embarrassing. It is appropriate that the tiger's power is increasingly shaking in China, and those flies can also buzz in the world.

Extending this further, there is this gold rush.

A few days ago, the Inspection and Supervision Group of the Relief Agency, at the group's meeting, spoke frankly and earnestly: "We must have the determination to hunt tigers and strike at those who manipulate the financial situation." The victims who feel disgusted by this are really praying for good fortune.

But to hunt tigers, we must strike at their key points. If the tiger is killed, the flies will surrender without being swatted. This is also the principle of catching the bandits, first catch the king. Unfortunately, according to reports, the authorities seem to still be busy catching two or three small flies on the road to make a snack. The so-called tiger hunting will probably end up scaring the snake and hesitating to kill the rat.

However, we common people are waiting to see the magical powers of the tiger-hunting generals.

### The Wild Crane Has No Food, But The World is Wide - One Bird Series, Three

— Zhuguang

There are less than twenty bird shops in Shanghai, most of which are located at the corner of Five Horse Road and Zhejiang Road. Generally speaking, the shops are very small, so they seem even more messy. In addition, the sound of birds is noisy. If you are not a true bird lover, you would not dare to come in just because of these things.

Bird shops, in addition to their names and selling birds, also sell birdcages and food containers. It is said that birdcages are also very particular. The most common are bamboo cages, each ranging from thousands of yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. More sophisticated ones are made of rosewood, and even more lavish ones have colored jade stones inlaid on the rosewood cages. In addition, for business convenience, they also sell other animals, such as rabbits, squirrels, toads, and洋鼠 (commonly known as "洋老蟲" -- foreign mice).

The customers who visit these bird shops every day are not the ones who come to buy birds or cages, but the ones who come to buy bird food. Speaking of bird food, the most common are millet, grain, wheat, and rapeseed. In addition, there are also the so-called "皮蟲" (bark worms) and "桑蟲" (mulberry worms), which are worms on the bark of trees that are used as food, saying that they have a "nourishing" effect, just like humans taking cod liver oil.

This elegant industry is now truly at the end of its road. Right now, there are no birds coming from outside at all. Not to mention Southeast Asia and foreign countries, even the goods coming from Changzhou, Yangzhou, and the Hangzhou and Shaoxing areas of Zhejiang are scarce recently, so it is difficult to get goods.

In the past, old masters played with birds for entertainment. Now, it is completely different. People can't even get enough to eat, so where do they get the free money to raise birds? Those people who carry birdcages to tea parties and bird fairs, although they seem leisurely, who knows if they are unemployed people with no work? Who knows if they are full of worries? Therefore, business is cold and clear due to weak purchasing power.

The less than twenty bird shops are eking out a living in this situation of being at the end of the road. No wonder a young shop assistant said: "Once birds are locked in cages, they will never be free. In fact, aren't we the same in this society? -- They are not even as good as them, being fed by someone!"

I understand the meaning of these words, but I dare not agree with his last sentence. The difference between humans and animals lies in this, doesn't it? As the saying goes:

"Caged cranes have food and soup nearby, but wild cranes have no food, yet the world is wide!"

### Xi Feng's Burnt "Juanzi"

— Zhuguang

Burnt "Juanzi" is too unappetizing. Don't blame the poor quality of the flour; blame your wife for lacking managerial experience and culinary skills. Now, the only remedy is to re-blend the flour, scrub the pot, and try a second time.

Xi Feng, nicknamed "Spicy Goods," is eloquent and used to telling witty remarks. Every time she speaks, it is either grotesque and funny or full of wit and humor, making people jealous and loved. Every time I read "Dream of the Red Chamber," I like to read the tone of this humorous beauty the most. A cascade of jokes is vividly active between the lines, making people reluctant to put it down.

"We are a pair of burnt "Juanzi," I am only fit to mess around with him (referring to Jia Lian)." This is Xi Feng's self-deprecating remark to someone on one occasion. The explanation of the tone is nothing more than that burnt "Juanzi" is not made of good material. Buying such a useless person only means she is fit to mess around with him.

The more humble and self-deprecating Xi Feng is, the more she shows off her affected manners, acting coquettishly and foolishly, vividly portraying a beauty with a clever and witty tongue. The burnt "Juanzi," after being spoken by this humorous beauty, and with the addition of Cao Xueqin's brilliant writing, is not a useless thing at all; it has simply become a light and delicious fragrant snack!

Now, when we are holding a piece of burnt "Juanzi" that is difficult to swallow, and look around at the domestic situation, today, after victory, the country's situation should be like a freshly steamed bun, thriving. However, industry and commerce are suffering from recession, the economy is in distress, everything is expensive, and inflation and business closures have become a widespread and prevalent cholera. The sight is a mess, and it cannot be cleaned up. This situation is not like a fragrant steamed bun at all; it is simply no different from a piece of burnt "Juanzi."

The "Juanzi" has already been "burnt." How can we re-blend the flour and try again? (Xu Xiaoting)

### Questions

— Bei Tian

Respectfully to the City Council

(I) The city's cinemas have recently raised prices without authorization, violating regulations, affecting the entertainment of the common people. The Social Affairs Bureau turns a blind eye. Why doesn't the City Council stop it?

(II) In order to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff, municipal schools collect academic advancement subsidies, which are clearly a disguised form of teacher appreciation money, going against the City Council's resolutions and increasing the burden on citizens. The Education Bureau actually approved it. Why doesn't the City Council stop it?

Respectfully awaiting the City Council's reply.

### Thoughts Can Maintain Youth (Part 1)

— Translated from Study

No matter what age you are, the fear of aging often attacks you at any time and place. Because I am a consulting psychologist specializing in the study of age-related issues, I have found that among my many clients, most of them are ladies around thirty years old. They are truly troubled by the increasing age and want to learn methods to avoid aging. Therefore, I am telling them here that if you are between seventeen and seventy years old and feel interested in maintaining youth, please read on slowly, perhaps it will be of some benefit to you.

Before I tell you the methods, it is best to explain a few theories first:

First, age cannot be calculated by years, because the time expressed physiologically by humans often does not match the time on the clock. The physiological aging phenomenon of humans slows down with increasing age. That is to say, the older you are, the slower your age becomes, and the slower you get old. In fact, from thirty to forty years old, your physiological changes are always slower than your physiological changes from twenty-five to thirty years old, and from fifty-five to seventy years old, it is even slower than from forty to fifty-five years old.

Another reason why the calendar cannot represent the true age of humans is that the rate of aging of various tissues in the human body is also different. Generally speaking, human vision is fully developed in the teens, hearing is fully developed in the twenties, and by the thirties, muscles, physical strength, reproductive power, and metabolism in the body all develop to their peak. But at the same time, your mind, even at fifty years old, is still young and continues to grow. As for human brainpower, it takes another ten years to fully develop. The efficiency of the brain only gradually declines from the age of sixty, and by the age of eighty, your intelligence is still the same as it was at thirty, and a new kind of thinking power is produced. Although the memory of the elderly fades, their thinking power is not restricted. On the contrary, the older they are, the richer their knowledge, the farther their vision, and the more accurate and abundant their judgment and reason. These past experiences can help us solve difficult problems. In short, we have gained wisdom. This tells you why those old doctors, experienced lawyers, and experienced craftsmen can still compete with those young and strong youngsters.
