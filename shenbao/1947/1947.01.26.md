### Government Reorganization Plan Still in Initial Discussion Phase; Lei Zhen Visits Shanghai Again to Consult with Various Parties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The capital has been experiencing continuous rain and snow. Discussions regarding peace talks and government reorganization have both stalled. Lei Zhen traveled to Suzhou on the 24th and then to Shanghai, but there have been no further activities.

[Our Dispatch] Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, will arrive in Shanghai this morning to consult with the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic League on matters regarding the reorganization of the government. According to insiders, it is likely that various parties will participate in the government through collective action. This would present a fresh image both domestically and internationally. The possibility of a single party joining the government is quite slim. Furthermore, the scope of the government reorganization is also a key point. The various parties not in power attach considerable importance to participating in local governments. Another important consideration for each party is whether they can seamlessly cooperate with lower-level government personnel after participating in the government.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] When Shao Lizi was asked by reporters on the 25th about the rumors that the government would be reorganized on February 1st, he replied, "February 1st is a new era, the lunar calendar. The lunar calendar even has a February and a leap month, so this year there are three first days of February. Which one are you referring to?"

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] On the 25th, reporters visited the American ambassador to seek his personal opinion on the prospects for peace talks and government reorganization. The ambassador smiled and nodded repeatedly, saying, "I have no opinion. I won't say anything." When reporters inquired about the content of his previous meeting with Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League, the ambassador replied, "We talked about many issues." When asked if it involved the Democratic League's participation in the government reorganization, the ambassador replied, "This is China's internal affair, and I cannot say anything." When reporters further asked whether the government's determination to reorganize in the shortest possible time would be good or bad, the ambassador said, "I have no opinion."

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] According to sources close to the government, although the government's reorganization has been decided, the set date is still too early. The main purpose of the reorganization is to share power with all parties, including the Communist Party, thereby breaking the current political deadlock. If the opposition parties continue to maintain a lofty attitude, then the reorganization will be meaningless. The participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party depends on the outcome of consultations between the two parties in Shanghai, but overall, optimism is possible. Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province is about to return to the province to handle some political affairs. The duration of this trip is unknown.

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting at Fanwei at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wu Xianzai, Wan Renqian, Xu Chuanlin, and the Standing Committee members in Shanghai attended. Chairman Zhang Junmai first reported on the detailed process of the negotiations with government representatives in Nanjing. This was followed by a discussion of the policies that the Democratic Socialist Party should adopt in the current situation after the breakdown of peace talks, as well as the basic principles for participating in the government. Due to differing opinions during the meeting, no concrete decisions were made. It was decided to continue discussions this morning.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 25th] Government authorities claim that the government's reorganization may not begin on February 1st as planned. The reorganization plan is still in the initial stages of discussion. It is thought that there will not be any continued development in the next three to five days before the end of the month.

### CCP Launches Propaganda War; Sets Guidelines for Political and Military Propaganda

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] A reporter has learned from relevant sources that the "Propaganda Department of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP" has issued propaganda guidelines for the 36th year of the Republic, totaling over 10,000 words. Excerpts of the more important points are as follows: (1) Because Communism has lost public faith in both rural and urban areas, it should henceforth be referred to as "Democracy" to facilitate propaganda. (2) Propaganda regarding "Marxism-Leninism" should also be stopped in the current situation. To suit the environment, facts should be sought to support the Three Principles of the People, and Sun Yat-sen should be used to win people's faith. (3) The activities of "militia" and "guerrilla units" in various places should be renamed "civil unrest movements." It is reported that these propaganda guidelines have been issued to CCP propaganda organizations across the country for strict implementation. Furthermore, a dispatch from Chongqing on the 25th stated that a certain individual close to the Xinhua Daily said that the CCP Central Propaganda Department, in order to control military news, specifically sent a telegram to Xinhua News Agency branches and journalists across the country on the 7th of this month, instructing them on the following matters that should be noted in future military news reports: Recently, newspapers have published many facts that expose our weaknesses and undemocratic propaganda, which should be corrected urgently. Therefore, the following ten points should be given special attention in the future: (1) Ideologically, it should be determined that our news work should seize the opportunity to work on the psychology of the general public, and fulfill propaganda responsibilities independently. (2) Every military news report, regardless of its success or failure, should first be measured for its benefit to our side. Any military secrets must not be published under any circumstances. (3) For every battle, the battle results on our side should be reported as much as possible. Even if we are forced to retreat, it should be framed as exchanging for value. Battle results can be expanded in propaganda to make society doubt the strength of the "stubborn army." (4) Anything that indirectly exposes our military secrets must not be published. In order to implement the above, it is necessary that: (a) Information on battle situations must be approved by the local command before it can be released. (b) Local military leaders must review every military news report before it is published. However, in the future, the propaganda department should take the initiative, as propaganda is indeed a weapon of war.

### Democratic League's Participation in Government Denied by Zhang Dongsun

Restoration of Peace Talks Also Impossible

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic League held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, during which it extensively discussed internal organizational personnel matters and the selection of heads of valley areas. However, as these matters are confidential, they will not be released to the public. As for the working policy, it was decided to work hard in accordance with the political declaration. Regarding the stalled peace talks, both sides are too far apart, and there is no capacity to mediate. As for reorganizing the government, it is not even considered for discussion.

[Central News Agency, This City] Secretary-General Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League yesterday denied rumors that some members of the Democratic League would also participate in the government. He said that the Democratic League's internal opinions are consistent, and it is impossible for anyone to participate in the government alone. When reporters asked him whether the government had responded to the Democratic League's three prerequisites for resuming peace talks, he replied, "The government is trying its best to do well in this regard." He believes that there is no possibility of restoring peace talks in the short term regarding the prospects of the overall situation.

Including Lin Yutang's Daughter

Prior to this, the Chinese ambassador had sent a letter requesting consideration of diplomatic etiquette, but it was not effective. The two young ladies will be traveling to Washington and New York within days. Consul General Zhang said afterward, "Everything has been resolved smoothly.

### Prohibition of Local Apportionment of Donations; Executive Yuan Promulgates Five Supplementary Measures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently promulgated five "Supplementary Measures Prohibiting Local Apportionment of Donations" as follows: (1) The expenses required for central and provincial affairs should be allocated with special funds by the entrusted agency for verification and issuance. (2) If new local undertakings need to be carried out after the budget is approved, a supplementary budget should be legally processed first and submitted for approval before they can be carried out. (3) All non-statutory collection agencies shall not directly collect any money or goods from the people. Even if it is a statutory collection agency, it shall not collect illegal taxes or apportioned funds from the people. Violators shall be dealt with in accordance with criminal law. (4) If county magistrates and mayors condone, harbor, or fail to supervise illegal apportionments of subordinate grassroots administrative institutions, they shall be jointly liable after verification of people's complaints. (5) If any county government, township, or pao-chia personnel arbitrarily apportion local funds, the people may list the facts and evidence and directly submit them to the provincial government or the central government. After verification, they will be severely punished.

### Play Troupe Among Companions; Possible Reason for Detention

Our Embassy Has Not Yet Received a Report

[United Press, Washington, 24th] When the "General Gordon" ship arrived in San Francisco, Lin Yutang's daughter and Li Jun's daughter, a consultant to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were detained along with other Chinese passengers. The Chinese Embassy here today stated that the matter was likely a misunderstanding. The State Department said that it had not received any protests regarding this incident. The Chinese Embassy believes that the Chinese play troupe on board may be the reason why all Chinese passengers were detained, as the play troupe required a special bond. However, people like the two young ladies Lin and Li should not be prevented from landing. The embassy has not yet received a report from Consul General Zhang in San Francisco.

### Communist Forces South of Songhua River Have Been Defeated; National Army Advances in Fan Shape; Actively Clearing the Periphery of Dalian

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] The Communist forces that crossed the Songhua River to invade have been completely defeated. After recovering Qitamu, Ergou, Jiaojialing, Dafangshan, and Dajiagou, the National Army has formed a fan-shaped position on the south bank of the Songhua River, from the Sino-Chang Railway in the west to Baiqitun on the east bank of the Songhua River. On the 23rd, the National Army advanced on all fronts. The western route advanced along the Sino-Chang Railway to Qijiazi and has made contact with the National Army bridgehead position (south of Taolaizhao) on the north bank of the Songhua River.

### British Labour MP Lindsay's Remarks are a Misconception; Minister Peng Responds to Foreign Reporters' Inquiries

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] When reporters inquired with Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei about the British House of Lords' debate on the China issue, he replied, "Apart from newspaper reports, I have not yet been able to read the original text of the British House of Lords' debate. Labour MP Lindsay is unaware of the situation here, and I cannot attach importance to his remarks. Fortunately, most leaders in the UK have a true understanding of the situation in China, which is what a great power with keen discernment and rich common sense should have. Mr. Lindsay's advocacy of interfering in China's internal affairs is a mistaken view of the times, indicating that he misunderstands China. He does not know that China was at the forefront in the war against Japanese and Nazi aggression."

### US Marines in Qingdao Have Not Received Withdrawal Orders

But Will Send Back a Portion of Officers and Soldiers

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] During a reception hosted by Admiral Cooke for leaders from all walks of life in Qingdao on the 25th, this reporter asked a senior US Navy officer stationed in Qingdao about two matters. (1) What impact would Marshal Marshall's return to the United States to assume a new position have on the US Navy and its Marines stationed in Qingdao? He replied, "Marshal Marshall's return to the United States to assume the important position of Secretary of State is proof that the United States attaches even more importance to China. Therefore, the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is not affected by his return. On the contrary, its mission will soon be increased. Qingdao is an important seaport in the Pacific region. In addition to assisting the Chinese government in training and strengthening the Chinese Navy, the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is also responsible for guarding the Pacific. Therefore, no orders have been received for the US Navy to withdraw from Qingdao, but the US Marine Corps is currently planning to send back a portion of officers and soldiers." (2) What is the general's opinion on the American soldiers sentenced to "completed rape" in Beiping? He replied, "This is a legal issue, and there will be a reasonable legal solution. I cannot rashly express my opinion, but I have instructed the troops stationed here to strictly observe discipline."

### Civil Aviation Administration and Air Force Headquarters to Negotiate the Division of Airfields

Investigation Reports on Two Airline Plane Crashes to be Released Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The establishment of the Civil Aviation Administration is a new undertaking in our country, so all work remains to be planned. However, the main task is to assist the development of civil aviation. It is reported that the Administration plans to negotiate with the Air Force Headquarters on the division of airfields because there are only five airfields in China that can be used for civil aviation, such as Beijing and Shanghai. Others are mostly used jointly by the military and civilians, resulting in unclear responsibilities for airfield managers. Currently, the Air Force intends to hand over airfields that are not military strongholds to the Ministry of Communications for management.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the issue of responsibility for the plane crashes of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, the Ministry of Communications previously sent Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to investigate. The report has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications. Dai told reporters on the 25th that the full investigation will be released by the Ministry of Communications within one or two days. As for the main cause of the accident, it was still due to poor weather.

### French Troops Land on the Xisha Islands; We Are About to Issue a Statement; Minister Bai States the Islands Belong to China

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense Bai stated to the press today: The Xisha Islands belong to our country, and of course our country will send troops there. History proves that the islands belong to China. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wang declined to comment on this issue, saying that he will issue a formal statement in a day or two to clarify China's position. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Nuo emphasized that the Xisha Islands issue is not currently under any negotiation, nor is there any need for negotiation.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry stated: France intends to request sovereignty over the Xisha Islands on behalf of Annam (Vietnam).

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] According to senior official sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the reporter for this agency has been informed that China is conducting diplomatic negotiations with France in order to seek the withdrawal of French troops from the Xisha Islands. Formal negotiations between China and France are being conducted separately in Nanjing and Paris. China's position is that China will never discuss the issue of sovereignty over the islands if French troops remain stationed on the islands. Only after the French troops withdraw can this issue be discussed. Another senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that China and France are negotiating the Xisha Islands issue, but declined to clarify whether the current Sino-French negotiations involve the withdrawal of French troops or the discussion of sovereignty.

The official also reiterated that sovereignty over the Xisha Islands belongs to China, because the islands have always been Chinese territory and the inhabitants of the islands are also Chinese. Only recently did France begin to dispute China's sovereignty over the islands.

According to a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, he had not heard of the dispatch of reinforcements to the Xisha Islands, but he emphasized that this matter seemed to be handled by the Navy. According to his personal knowledge, when French troops first attempted to land a few days ago, a battalion of Chinese Marines was stationed on the islands.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A senior official close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today confirmed that China could accept the proposal of international arbitration on the Xisha Islands issue. It was emphasized that the current issue is the withdrawal of French troops from the islands. China was very willing to consider the suggestion of international arbitration before, but after the French troops landed on the Xisha Islands, the entire situation has changed. Until the French troops withdraw from the Xisha Islands, China cannot consider the suggestion of international arbitration.

### The CCP Persists in Its Prejudices; The Du-Huang Talks Yield No Results

Xue Dubi Explains the Reasons Why the Project Cannot Be Stopped

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the situation of blocking the Yellow River and the benefits and harms of suspending the blocking work, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) convened relevant parties on January 17 for discussion. Present were Director Huo Baoshu, Water Conservancy Commission Chairman Xue Dubi, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office Director A.S. Eddington, Deputy Director Bliss, Engineering Advisor Todd, and CCP representative Dong Biwu, among others. Dong Biwu stated that the CCP region had not built any river blocking or risk prevention works, no relief had been provided to residents in the river channel, and that water had been released into the old channel on the 27th of the previous month without notifying their side, etc. After Chairman Xue gave a detailed explanation, Dong stated that the blocking of the river needed to be suspended for three to five months, and no results were achieved in the talks. Afterwards, on the 20th, an informal meeting was held, and the central government agreed to postpone the closure of the river until February 15, while the work of throwing stones would continue. Dong also believed that the opinions of the two sides were far apart and that a decision would have to wait until instructions were received from Yan'an, so there were ultimately no results. Regarding the benefits and harms of suspending the Yellow River blocking project, Chairman Xue stated that intensifying the throwing of stones at this time would be beneficial to the project itself and would not harm the downstream area. On the contrary, if it were suspended for three or five months, and the river were blocked again during the peach blossom flood or a major flood, it would be extremely dangerous for the project and would not be beneficial to the downstream area. The reasons are as follows: (1) The stone dam for blocking the river has reached a critical stage of success or failure. It is currently bearing extremely high water pressure. If the work is stopped, there is a risk that the stone dam and the temporary bridge will be completely washed away. To avoid all efforts being in vain, it is necessary to rush to throw boulders day and night to fight the flood and seize every moment. Recently, the work of throwing is being actively carried out, and there are still incidents of wooden stakes being washed away from time to time. The arduous nature of the project proves this even more. (2) Since the diversion of the river began to flow back into the old channel on December 27 last year, even before the water outlet stone dam is thrown out and closed off during this winter period of low water, the old channel flow is estimated to be no more than 500 cubic meters per second, and the flow rate is also very slow. During this period, the dike works that have not yet been repaired downstream can have time to be repaired. (3) After eight or nine years of drought in the downstream river channel, once water flows in, whether the old dangerous and flat works will still maintain their original state in reality, or whether changes will occur, and to what extent, cannot be determined until the actual water flows through. The current flow of water is small, which is an opportunity to make the necessary observations and plan countermeasures, which is of great benefit to the downstream area. If it is delayed until the flood season, the flow will be too large, and if a flat work becomes a dangerous work, it will be too late to take action, and a breach is to be feared. As for the CCP's request to suspend the river blocking project for five months, it is using the excuse that the downstream dike works have not yet been completed and the residents of the river channel have not yet been relocated. However, the other party (the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office) issued a notice on November 11 last year, informing the residents along the river to relocate and rush to repair the winter defenses, which shows that they have some preparation. Even if the dike works have not yet been completed and the residents have not yet been completely relocated, the current water flow is very slow, and it is possible to rush to handle it.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] At noon on the 25th, Director of the Repair and Prevention Office, Kong Lingrong, and others went to Luokou to wait for the Yellow River water head. At 5 pm, the Yellow River water passed Yangzhuang (20 li west of Luokou) belonging to Changqing. At 9 pm, it would reach Luokou. The depth, flow, and speed of the water could not be measured due to the wind. The Yellow River has changed its course for nine years, and the dikes have not been repaired for many years. Currently, the national army garrison has been reinforcing them day and night. However, there is no contact with the communist army garrison, and there is a shortage of stone materials downstream, so the reinforcement situation is unknown. It is expected that there will be no worries during the peach blossom flood season, but there will inevitably be major risks during the summer flood season, so prevention must be accelerated.

### UNRRA Airlifts Relief Supplies to the CCP Area in Western Hebei; The US Sends Three Aircraft to Undertake the Transportation, Starting Tomorrow

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] UNRRA will airlift a large number of relief supplies to help the people in the CCP area in western Hebei. According to an announcement by the headquarters of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps today, the UNRRA relief to the poor people of Zaoping and Laiyuan under the control of the Communist Party in western Hebei has decided to hand over more than one million pounds of valuable items, including old clothes, blankets, medicines, etc., to the US Marine Corps for airdrop by plane starting on the 28th of this month. At that time, the Marine Corps will send three giant transport planes to undertake the airlift. Each plane will take off from Tianjin twice a day, transporting 40,000 pounds a day, which can be completed in 25 days. The national and communist forces in the area near Fuping and Laiyuan have all received notice of this agreement, and the flight routes of the planes have also been specified and notified to both sides. In addition, both sides have also signed a ceasefire agreement to ensure the safety of the Marine Corps personnel, guaranteeing that pilots can pass safely and return to the nearest Marine Corps base in the event of a forced landing. Colonel Kearney, the person in charge of the First Air Wing, stated that all medicines will be dropped using cargo parachutes, while clothes and blankets will be packaged into 90-pound bundles and dropped. It is understood that the area for dropping relief supplies is one mile long and 300 feet wide, and has a white cross flag as a sign. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 people in the area who urgently need relief, some of whom have several people sharing one blanket. After being disturbed by the Japanese army, they have been unable to obtain clothing due to the economic blockade during the state of war. After UNRRA sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections of these miserable situations, it decided to actively provide relief. Afterwards, UNRRA will have two representatives stationed in each dropping area to ensure proper distribution.

### All Lama Temples in Chengde Have Been Destroyed by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] The Eight Great Lama Temples in Chengde, which were first built during the Kangxi reign, are mostly modeled after the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and are the most magnificent in scale. Since they were destroyed by the Communist army, many of the statues of the Yab-Yum (Buddha of Bliss) have been pushed down, and the thousand-hand, thousand-eye Buddha carved from a single 7.2-zhang (approximately 24 meters) wooden trunk has also been shot at, with bullet marks clearly visible on its face. The temple walls are ruined and desolate, without any signs of life. Only 78 lamas remain in the temples, lacking clothing and food. If they were not listed as refugees and received relief from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), they would have already fallen into freezing and starvation. Kunxi, the abbot of the Great Buddha Temple, whose post is in Lhasa, was specially sent here by the Dalai Lama as the general Kanbu, ranking first among the lamas in the north. He is now also exhausted and implores relief agencies to provide assistance.

### Guangdong to Release Prisoners; Can Be Completed Within Ten Days

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The long-awaited amnesty order was only received by the High and District Courts here on Lunar New Year's Eve. At that time, the staff of the two courts were immediately tense, and busy conveying this order. Even on New Year's Day, they did not rest. The prisoners were even more surprised and overjoyed upon hearing the news. It is estimated that there are one thousand prisoners in the First Prison and Detention Center here who meet the amnesty regulations. Currently, releases are being processed by severity of crime and precedence, and more than 300 people have already been released. Processing will continue daily and will be completed within ten days. However, some prisoners who have no home to return to fear that they will have no food or clothing after being released and ask to remain in prison. The court, citing the major national order, has no authority to make such a decision and can only politely decline.

### Xinjiang Daily Newspaper Suffers from Fire; Printing Presses Completely Destroyed

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 25th] The printing presses of the Xinjiang Daily newspaper caught fire on the 17th. As a result of the efforts of the newspaper's employees, publication was resumed on the 18th, but only a small sheet was produced. The newspaper originally published in both Chinese and Uyghur versions. Subsequently, due to the demands of Uyghur people for an independent Uyghur version, this factory fire occurred after the Uyghur version became independent. Both printing presses were completely destroyed by the fire. Therefore, the newspaper is currently borrowing the printing presses of the Security Command to temporarily resume publication.

### Guangzhou Gathering of Elders

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The gathering of elders organized by the Guangzhou Municipal Social Service Office is scheduled to be held on the 28th. Participation is extremely enthusiastic. Four hundred people have already qualified after review. To date, the oldest is a woman named Lu He, who is 103 years old.

### Japanese Culprits in the Shibuya Incident; Three Police Chiefs Actually Declared Not Guilty; Our Representative in Japan Will Request a Retrial

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The American three-person committee that judged the three Japanese police chiefs involved in the Shibuya Incident today declared the three defendants not guilty after a brief trial. The three police chiefs are Tsuchiya, the director of the Shibuya Police Station, Heito, the assistant director of the Shibuya Police Station, and Miyaji, the assistant investigator of the station. They were accused of acting in violation of the objectives of the occupying forces. People from our delegation hinted that they might request a retrial on behalf of compatriots because Taiwanese compatriots believe that this trial was not entirely fair and impartial. The Shibuya Incident occurred in July of last year when Taiwanese compatriots and Japanese police clashed in front of the Shibuya Police Station. As a result, six Taiwanese compatriots and one Japanese policeman died, and about 20 Taiwanese compatriots were injured. The Japanese police fired a total of 242 shots in the conflict, and 36 Taiwanese compatriots were sentenced to imprisonment and deportation by another three-person committee.

### Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses; Disarming Japan Economically; Japanese Industry Should Be Limited to the 1914 Standard

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated today that the ministry is currently reviewing various plans from prominent economic experts across the country to disarm Japan economically and industrially, and to lay the foundation for lasting world peace. Experts believe that Japan's aggression was triggered by unlimited economic development, especially during World War I. Therefore, the United Nations should limit Japan's peacetime industry to the standard of 1914, i.e., the beginning of World War I. The United Nations Far Eastern Commission's proposal that Japan's production should be restored to the level of 1928 to 1930 is too lenient, because Japan took advantage of the recession in various countries after World War I and had already established a prosperous economy by 1930, preparing it for aggressive war. While disarming Japan, the United Nations should also strictly limit Japan's light and heavy industries, which can be transformed into wartime industries at any time, so they must be restricted to thoroughly destroy its war potential. Japan's textile, silk, rayon, cement, and paper industries all need to be restricted. Except for the minimum needs of the Japanese people, all equipment and machinery should be allocated to the countries most severely damaged during the war as compensation. Japan's foreign trade should be restricted as much as possible pending the establishment of formal relations with the United Nations, so that Japan cannot use the excuse of conducting foreign trade to engage in political conspiracies. Japan's fishing industry should be monitored and fishing areas should be designated to prevent the secret growth of its naval power. Finally, the Japanese government should not be allowed to take any measures to continue encouraging population growth. In order to correct the economic conditions of the Japanese people in general and to prevent overpopulation from causing another war, the Japanese birth rate must not exceed the average birth rate of other countries.

### More Than 300,000 Japanese Residents Evicted from Taiwan Province Last Year

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The Japanese Residents Management Committee here announced today that the total number of Japanese, Ryukyuan, and Korean residents sent from Taiwan Province in the first and second periods of last year was 319,680, including 302,805 Japanese residents, 14,901 Ryukyuan residents, etc., and 1,974 Korean residents.

### Incident of Overseas Chinese Victims in Palembang; Indonesian Deputy Governor Isa Admits Troops Acted Recklessly; Arrested Overseas Chinese Are Being Released

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] Dr. Isa, Deputy Governor of Sumatra, Indonesian Republic, declared at a press conference that the civilian casualties in the recent Palembang incident were 500 dead and 1,000 injured. Injured Indonesians: 140 people. Isa denied Dutch accusations that Indonesians had premeditated the Palembang incident. Isa arrived here yesterday. (Another dispatch) Chen Yuanju, our consul in Indonesia, commented today on the figures released to the press by Isa regarding the losses suffered by overseas Chinese, saying that he believed his own figures were accurate. He also said that the Indonesian claim that overseas Chinese were Dutch spies without providing concrete or even on-the-spot evidence was pure fabrication. He asked, if they were spies, how would one explain the women and children who were victimized? Chen told reporters that Indonesian people in Palembang even referred to Chairman Chiang as a Dutch spy, simply because Chiang's photo featured three colors (red, white, and blue) on his medal. We have already explained that these three colors have nothing to do with the Dutch flag. Isa admitted that Indonesian troops had arrested a large number of Chinese civilians and were trying to release them. Responding to reporters, Isa said that Indonesian troops may have committed atrocities, but the Indonesian government absolutely opposes such crimes and will investigate them specifically. Isa also said that the Palembang conflict was caused by a Dutch soldier firing a shot into the air during the New Year, followed by blind shooting, which killed a major of the Indonesian army, causing public outrage among the Indonesian people. The incident escalated, and the authorities were unable to suppress it. The Indonesian army's losses were 30 dead.

### Proposed Tunnel Between Hong Kong and Kowloon

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 25th] The Hong Kong Telegraph Office recently discussed a plan to build a tunnel connecting Victoria Island and Kowloon with a technical expert. The cost is estimated at approximately 16 million Hong Kong dollars.

### Supervisory Personnel Are Not Afraid to "Strike Tigers"; It's Just That Corrupt Officials Have Too Many Clever Tricks; Heartfelt Words of Supervisory Committee Member Qiu Niantai to Reporters in Guangzhou

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] Supervisory Committee member Qiu Niantai was recently dispatched to Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan to inspect administration. Qiu recently hosted reporters here, first soliciting their opinions on local administration. Qiu also expressed his heartache about the corruption situation in various places, saying that it is not that supervisory personnel only swat flies and are afraid to strike tigers, but that corrupt officials have too many clever tricks. Qiu then published the recent situation in Taiwan from the perspective of a Taiwanese compatriot. Qiu is the son of Qiu Fengjia, the former temporary president of the Republic of Taiwan. It is said that since Taiwan Province was taken over, the political situation has bred a sense of alienation internally and between superiors and subordinates. Although governance in administration is quite intense and planned, it is a pity that it has not adapted to popular sentiment and the current situation, and a small number of corrupt practices brought from the mainland have caused dissatisfaction among Taiwanese people. However, Taiwanese people are forward-thinking and pure, and mostly lean towards the Three Principles of the People. Qiu concluded: Taiwan has abundant industries, with rice, sugar, tea, bananas, camphor, pineapples, timber, fish, and shrimp in agriculture, and coal, gold, oil, and light industrial manufactured goods in industry. Although construction has gradually progressed, there are still 500 factories that have not yet recovered, and there is also a great shortage of talent. Therefore, it is hoped that the industries of Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan can establish links, which will greatly help the construction of a new China.

### The Taiwan Education Inspection Group Returns from Inspection; General Review

Guo Lianfeng, Assistant of the Tibetan Education Department, Tells Our Reporter

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Education previously sent the Taiwan Education Inspection Group, consisting of Cheng Shih-feng (member of the Education Research Committee), Guo Lianfeng (assistant of the Tibetan Education Department), and Chen Wen-deng (supervisor), to Taiwan in late November of last year to inspect education at all levels. Cheng, Guo, and Chen have recently returned to Beijing and gave an oral report to the Minister of Education on the inspection process last Monday. A detailed written report on their observations is being compiled. Cheng Shih-feng has gone to his hometown in Nanchang. Our reporter recently visited Assistant Guo Lianfeng and asked about the inspection of the education situation in Taiwan Province. Guo said the following:

Overview of Schools: In Taiwan Province, there is one National Taiwan University, as well as two provincial agricultural and industrial colleges and a teachers college. The original law and commerce college has now been merged into National Taiwan University. The private Yanping College is currently submitting an application to the province's education administration authorities for review, but it has not yet been approved. There are more than 100 normal, vocational, and other schools at the secondary education level. There are also many national schools, and education is quite developed. The inspection group went to Taichung, Taipei, Tainan, and other places. After completing each inspection, they convened the local education administration and teaching staff to hold seminars to review the implementation of education, study and research, and discuss issues that should be reformed. Later, after completing the inspection in Taipei, they held two larger-scale seminars, which were also attended by Taiwan Province's education administration authorities, for a general review of the new educational facilities in Taiwan Province. The inspection group put forward 73 suggestions, and after exchanging opinions, the results were satisfactory. The three-person group originally planned to return on January 7, but the planes were grounded, and they inspected several schools in nearby areas, waiting until the 17th to take off. They arrived in Shanghai last Friday and returned to Beijing on Saturday, reporting back to the Ministry of Education last Monday.

Characteristics of Education: The school buildings and equipment for teaching experiments in Taiwan Province's secondary and higher education are quite large in scale, which cannot be compared with those of schools on the mainland. There are several characteristics of education: (1) The political situation is stable, and people from all walks of life regard education as important and cooperate to carry it out, so education is progressing considerably. (2) Teachers have a strong service spirit and can concentrate on their work. Teachers and staff at all schools arrive at school every day and work for eight hours. They can manage students at school before and after class, and there is no phenomenon of leaving immediately after class. This is because teachers are all full-time, and it is forbidden to engage in other part-time work. (3) Teachers have a very practical, non-superficial research spirit, and have achieved many results. (4) Schools have parent-teacher associations that are closely connected with families. Parents contribute a lot to the school's funding and equipment.

Shortage of Teachers: All levels of education in Taiwan Province are experiencing a shortage of teachers. Taking Taiwan University as an example, there are still 80 Japanese professors employed. Most primary and secondary school teachers are also substitutes. The reason is that during the Japanese occupation, although education in Taiwan was quite developed, it was mostly set up for Japanese education, and Taiwanese people had fewer opportunities to receive education. Therefore, there is a lack of talent, and teachers are often recruited at a lower level. Now that the area has been restored, one ten thousand Taiwan dollars is equivalent to three hundred and fifty thousand national currency. Those who work in middle schools in the province and hold teaching positions earn a maximum of ten thousand Taiwan dollars per month, which is already the highest treatment. Locals can reduce expenses due to housing and other conveniences, and can support themselves. Therefore, although the treatment of teachers is not high, their lives are extremely stable. If people from the mainland go there, the cost of sending money home to support their families is insufficient, and because of the distance across the sea, not many are willing to go. Therefore, relieving the shortage of teachers is the most pressing issue of current concern.

Abundant Funding: Because the administrative authorities in Taiwan Province pay attention to education, they raise sufficient funds for provincial education expenditures. However, the education expenditures of some counties are slightly stretched due to tax system reforms. During this inspection, the inspection group agreed with the provincial authorities to open up tax sources and increase surcharges starting this year to increase the income of education funding, and the future is even more optimistic.

### Overseas Chinese Holding Visas Encounter Many Difficulties Upon Entering the Philippines

Our Consulate Negotiates with the Immigration Bureau

[Central News Agency, Manila, 25th] Many overseas Chinese from our country who have obtained passports from the US Consulate in Shanghai have recently been unnecessarily detained by the Philippine Immigration Bureau upon arriving here. Some overseas Chinese hold 1947 passports, and they have apparently not taken note of the announcement issued by the Philippine Foreign Minister on January 10 of this year. The announcement states that the annual immigration quota cannot be accumulated. Other detained overseas Chinese are being detained simply for extortion. It is believed that the Chinese consulate here has negotiated with the Immigration Bureau to allow these overseas Chinese to enter the country. However, this case has now reached the legation here because some overseas Chinese are suing the Immigration Bureau for illegally detaining them.

### Nephew Attempts Rape and Fails; Chops Aunt with Cleaver; Heinous Parricide Bloodbath Occurs in Beijing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] On the evening of the Lunar New Year's Day, a shocking bloodbath occurred at No. 8 Youfu New Village, Youfu Street, Beijing. The murdered victim was Zhang Meiying, the wife of Sun Rongsheng, a captain staff member of the 18th Garrison Department in Hankou. She was stabbed with a cleaver, injuring vital parts, and died that night after the incident. After three days of investigation by the police, the murderer has been identified as Li Yanchang, Sun Rongsheng's nephew-in-law. Because Li was studying car driving in Beijing, he was allowed by his uncle to live with another friend in Sun's house. Li, young and lecherous, had long harbored inappropriate thoughts about his aunt, who was alone in the house. At about 10 o'clock on the evening of the incident, Li's friend was in another room, so Li took the opportunity to enter the deceased's bedroom and forcibly attempted to rape her. When Zhang refused, he became angry and ashamed and used a cleaver to seriously injure Zhang. Outsiders heard the sound and rushed over, and Li was still standing blankly in the room. He was arrested by the police. After three days of interrogation, he confessed to the attempted rape and murder. In the past year, many obscene tragedies have occurred in Beijing, such as the murder of the young girl Zhu Lanlu in Bailuzhou in April of last year, which has not yet been resolved. The Central Daily News published an editorial on this matter today, calling for "the establishment of a new defense between men and women" to rectify social ethics.

### Zhou Ni Fohai Still Hopes to Delay Death; Yang Shuhui Petitions Higher Court for Retrial; Decision on Approval Expected Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The death sentence for traitor Zhou Fohai has been finalized, and the review judgment was delivered to the Nanjing Higher Court on the afternoon of the 25th and immediately forwarded to Zhou and his family. Although there are some indications that the execution order may also have been issued simultaneously, this cannot yet be confirmed. However, according to Article 423 of the Criminal Procedure Law, "A petition for retrial does not suspend the execution of the penalty, but the prosecutor of the court having jurisdiction may order a suspension before the ruling on the retrial." Even if the execution order has already been issued, its execution may be temporarily suspended. Zhou's wife, Yang Shuhui, upon learning of the review result the day before, hurriedly sought a retrial. Her petition for retrial was also submitted to the Higher Court on the morning of the 25th. Court President Zhao Chen, to demonstrate impartiality, forwarded it to a criminal court panel other than the Jin (Shiding) and Ge (Zhi) panels, which had previously assisted him in the trial of Zhou's case, for deliberation on whether her reasons were sufficient and legal and to decide whether to grant a retrial. Zhou's wife cited two reasons in her retrial petition: (1) Cheng Keqiang and Peng Su have both been released by the Military Intelligence Bureau and can testify that Zhou had surrendered himself and should be summoned again; (2) The victory at Dushan was due to Zhou's strategic planning, which the previous trial did not value, and should be investigated again. However, according to those familiar with the case, both of these reasons are difficult to establish and cannot be considered new evidence. Regarding the first point, Cheng and Peng submitted detailed reports to the Higher Court after their release, which did not prove that Zhou had surrendered himself. Regarding the second point, the Ministry of National Defense had previously replied that it was unrelated to Zhou. Therefore, Zhou's reasons for petitioning for a retrial are very weak and are unlikely to be affirmed. According to Article 46 of the Criminal Procedure Law, "A death sentence shall be executed within three days of receiving the order approved by the highest judicial administrative authority." If Zhou's execution order has already been issued or may be issued within days, the decision on whether to grant a retrial will certainly be made in the near future, and Zhou's end is approaching.

### Evidence of Traitor Ding Mocun's Crimes Completely Investigated by the Court

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Zhao Chen, President of the Capital Higher Court, stated that the investigation of the evidence of traitor Ding Mocun's crimes has been completed and a public trial will be scheduled soon.

### Tani Hisao to be Tried Next Month; Investigative Hearings Begin Yesterday

Victim's Remains to be Exhumed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, has been scheduled for a public trial by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense from February 6th to 8th. To facilitate the reporting of crimes by victims or their families, the tribunal has specifically set up a temporary investigation court at the Eleventh District Office on Yuhua Road outside Zhonghua Gate from the 25th to the 28th, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, to handle investigation matters. On the morning of the 25th, Court President Shi Meiyu, accompanied by Judges Ge Zhaotang and Ye Zaizeng, personally went to the district office. District Chief Zhang of the district first convened a meeting with the families of the victims and issued more than 200 summonses. More than 40 people reported and recounted their experiences at the time, with elderly women crying about the murder of their sons and young women complaining about the murder of their husbands, all extremely aggrieved. An elderly man named Wu Zhonggui, 72 years old, reported that his mother, over 80, and his brother-in-law, over 70, were both killed that year. More than ten people were once blocked and killed in a cave in Yangxiang, and the way they were killed is difficult to describe in detail. According to Liu Decai, the leader of the burial team of the Red Swastika Society and Tongshan Hall, and Ge Changgen, the deputy leader, there are more than 2,000 massacred bodies buried at the foot of Yuhuatai Mountain, and more than 5,000 bodies burned to death at the Jinling Arsenal, and 700 poor people drowned in the Qinhuai River, buried along the river, all of which can be excavated. The court originally planned to exhume the remains on the afternoon of the 25th, but it was postponed due to rain. Tani Hisao's crimes are as numerous as mountains, and it is impossible for him to escape death.

### Editorial: The Obligation to Abide by Treaties

Ancient countries that closed themselves off and were self-sufficient had no possibility of external conflict because they did not interact with neighboring countries. As transportation developed and international relations became frequent, countries became more and more interdependent, and opportunities for friction increased. Friction that could not be resolved satisfactorily led to war. Western philosophers, with a compassionate heart, advocated international law as the rule of international relations, as a common standard for all countries to abide by, which invisibly eliminated many international disputes and laid the foundation for international peace. However, international law does not prohibit war. In other words, if there are disputes between countries, they can still resort to war as the final solution. International law is only a set of general principles, and the detailed regulations on specific matters still depend on the conclusion of treaties between countries for mutual observance. Therefore, in terms of protecting the forces of international peace, the function of treaties is actually higher than that of international law. If all countries could abide by the treaties they have agreed to sign, the possibility of war could be reduced fundamentally.

A treaty is established between two or more countries regarding their mutual interests, and its purpose is to achieve a common desire. Each country that signs a treaty has an obligation to abide by it. Taking a peace treaty as an example, the defeated country signing clauses unfavorable to itself is certainly out of necessity, but once it is signed, it takes effect, and there should be no attempts to renege on it due to changing circumstances. Tracing the origin of treaties, they existed long before international law came into being. In ancient times, countries, based on religious and moral concepts, regarded them as sacred and inviolable, and could not be abandoned unless both parties agreed. Otherwise, they would fundamentally lose credibility and find it difficult to gain a foothold on the international stage. In modern times, international relations have become increasingly complex, and the need for and binding force of treaties have become even more important. At the time of the outbreak of World War I in 1914, countries had signed as many as 8,000 treaties, many of which had become invalid because the purpose for which they were signed had been achieved or their time had expired, but the number of treaties added after the war was also considerable. From the sheer number alone, one can gauge the relationship between treaties and international peace. The outbreak of World War II was directly due to Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, and therefore bears the responsibility for destroying international peace.

After the war, politicians from various countries worked hard to rebuild peace. Since the passage of the United Nations Charter, treaties have been signed with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. Peace treaties with Germany and Japan should also be initiated soon. On the side of the victorious countries, alliances have been signed with each other for mutual assistance. In the Security Council, a general disarmament plan is being discussed, and multilateral treaties may be signed in the future to provide guarantees. On the surface, it seems that international peace can be permanently established. However, whether international peace can be maintained in the future depends largely on whether countries have the sincerity and determination to abide by treaties. Recently, two major international events have occurred that are related to the binding force of treaties: one is the Soviet Union's request for joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands, and the other is the issue of China's recovery of Dalian.

According to the Spitzbergen Treaty signed in Paris in 1920, sovereignty over the archipelago belongs to Norway, but no fortifications or naval bases may be established. Article 9 of the treaty clearly states: "Norway, by virtue of its accession to the League of Nations, assumes all the rights and obligations pertaining to it. Norway undertakes not to construct any naval base in the territory specially designated in Article 1 of this Treaty, nor to allow any other country to establish any naval base, nor to construct any fortifications in the said territories which may be used for warlike purposes." The original signatories to the treaty were the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Soviet Union later joined, and is therefore bound by the treaty. Because the Soviet Union wanted to strengthen what it considered a vulnerable point in its northern defense line, it requested joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands, which has been opposed by the United Kingdom and the United States. The reason is that if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States reach any agreement to modify the treaty, the opinions of all the signatories should be solicited in advance, and unilateral decisions to abandon it should not be made. In the future, the issue of joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands will undoubtedly become one of the major international disputes, and perhaps if it cannot be resolved properly, the United Kingdom and the United States may propose a discussion by the international security agencies, and the sanctity and inviolability of treaties will undergo a rigorous test.

The Spitzbergen Treaty is multilateral, but the issue of China's recovery of Dalian is based on the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between China and the Soviet Union. Dalian originally belonged to China, and was then leased to Russia, and after the Russo-Japanese War, it was transferred to Japan. In terms of sovereignty, the transfer was originally illegal, and after Japan surrendered, it should have been returned to its original owner and received by China. In the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty's agreement on Dalian, the Soviet Union solemnly declared that it would guarantee respect for China's sovereignty over all of the Three Eastern Provinces, regarding them as an inseparable part of China, so Article 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that the administrative power of Dalian belongs to China. The Chinese side agreed to declare Dalian a free port, open to trade and shipping from all countries, and detailed arrangements were made to guarantee the Soviet Union's interests in importing and exporting goods in Dalian. Looking at the content of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty as a whole, it actually contains the basic spirit of mutual concession and mutual benefit. However, although the treaty had long been in effect, Dalian still could not be recovered. The Soviet Union certainly has the sincerity and determination to abide by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, so the return of Dalian should not be delayed for so long as to become an international problem.

Abiding by treaties is the basic obligation of all countries and an important factor in maintaining international peace. We hope that politicians from all countries will look at the big picture and start from the immediate situation, and not repeat the mistakes of Germany and Japan, and be responsible for destroying treaties!

Five-Year Economic Plan

The five-year economic plan has been approved by the Chairman and submitted to the Executive Yuan for implementation. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Washington: A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank stated that if China wants to obtain the $500 million loan already designated by the United States, it must rectify its economy within five months. In other words, the Chinese government must submit a detailed plan by June 30, explaining how to use the loan, and so on. These two news items, not early and not late, happen to be published at this time. We have no way of guessing whether there is any connection between them. According to common theory, the drafting of this five-year plan started as early as 1944, so it has nothing to do with the $500 million loan. In terms of reality, since the so-called $500 million loan is a reconstruction loan and requires a detailed plan, then there may be some connection. Because this five-year plan is actually a reconstruction plan. Even if we start from scratch and rewrite it, it may not be able to completely break away from its framework, which is conceivable.

The content of the five-year plan is divided into six categories: transportation, industry, mining, electricity, water conservancy, and agriculture. It is said that this plan includes the valuable experience of many experts, so it is extremely practical, and in terms of construction, its costs, labor, materials, and completion time all have accurate budgets. It can be called comprehensive and well-thought-out, completely different from the general partial or idealistic plans. If objective conditions such as funding and personnel can be properly coordinated, and everyone proceeds step by step, we believe that this plan will be the backbone of our country's economic recovery.

The full text has not yet been disclosed, and we do not know the distribution of each department, especially the specific facilities in the agricultural sector. General impressions are still in earnest expectation. Because in the past twenty years, economic construction has been steady, and industries such as highways, industry, and mining have not been suspended due to internal and external troubles, but the improvement in agriculture has been significantly lagging behind. And several budding businesses, such as the promotion of American cotton and American tobacco, and the improvement of silkworm varieties, have also been destroyed by the war. In addition, problems such as donations, corvée, transportation, and public security have not yet been sorted out, so that the villagers are restless and the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy. Still, from the overall point of view, it only accounts for one part of the economy. However, we must know that most of the raw materials and daily necessities are derived from the countryside, and the outlet for industrial products is also mainly the countryside. Now the industrial recovery has not been completed, and various productions are less than half of what they were before the war. But many goods on the market have already shown obvious signs of stagnation and congestion. The decline in farmers' purchasing power is undeniable. In addition, raw materials for factories, such as wheat, cotton, tobacco leaves, wool, and even silkworm cocoons, all have to rely on foreign goods for supply, and if the supply is occasionally delayed, production may be suspended. From this point of view, revitalizing the countryside is undoubtedly the most important task in economic construction. Everyone knows that our country's farmers account for 80 to 90 percent of the total population. If the living standards of this absolute majority of the population cannot be improved, or even cannot be maintained, how much obstacle will there be to economic construction?

Secondly, the financial and monetary system problems are not listed in the original plan. We hope that there will be a whole set of methods that can be implemented in conjunction with it. Because the crux of the current economic problem lies in the instability of the monetary system, so sorting out the monetary system is actually the initial work of economic construction and also an important work of economic construction. If the current financial system, monetary system, and the interest rates, prices, wages, etc. that it entails remain the same and are not fundamentally reorganized, then the above economic construction will be greatly disturbed, at least in the process. Because all calculations cannot be determined, then all plans cannot be established. We speculate that the reason why it was not included in the original plan is perhaps because the matter is urgent and must be handled in advance, and it is not convenient to schedule a five-year procedure to proceed gradually.

But within the $500 million US dollar loan, if it is true, as it is said, that a detailed plan for economic restructuring must be submitted first, then we still believe that this is an important program. Now exports have not been developed, overseas remittances are largely evading, and inflation shows no signs of contraction. If we want to sort it out in time, we believe that we must seek help from foreign investment. There are naturally many ways for foreigners to invest. In addition to striving for safety, the objects of their choice are naturally the most profitable first, such as transporting goods to China, handling engineering, setting up factories, mining, and building roads. In the past year, international trade has not yet officially started, but the foreign exchange funds spent have been considerable. This number can easily be seen from the monthly customs statistics. However, the trade deficit is too large, and international trade is becoming more and more unfavorable, so the government has gradually restricted the application for imported goods. According to this inference, the so-called $500 million or other loans, if established, the way they are used will not necessarily be the same as in the past, still allowing them to flow into general and normal uses. We believe that the most urgent use is to sort out the monetary system and stabilize the value of currency.

### Opening of New Jiaozuo Section of the Daoqing Railway

140,000 Tons of Coal in Jiaozuo Awaiting Transportation

[Our Xinxiang Dispatch] Since the repair project of the new Jiaozuo section of the Daoqing Railway started on the 14th of last month, the entire project was completed on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. The next day (the 15th), at 8:00 AM, Shan Ping, the director of the Han Railway Bureau, represented Qian Zongyuan and led the heads of various sections, along with Qian Guiyi, the director of the New Jiaozuo Section Repair Project Office, and Li Xueyi, the director of the Xinxiang Office, to inspect the repair situation of the section along the line from Xinxiang to Jiaozuo by light special train, and to conduct the first test run. The reporter recently learned about the repair process of the Xinxiang-Jiaozuo railway in detail from Li Xueyi, director of the Xinxiang Office of the Pinghan Railway. According to his reply: The reason why this road could not be started last year was due to the lack of equipment. However, due to the serious coal shortage in the Yangtze River area and Henan Province, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Transportation to complete the repairs and open to traffic for coal transportation by the end of the year, so as to solve the fuel problem as soon as possible. After receiving the order, this road immediately established the "New Jiaozuo Section Repair Project Office" in Xinxiang and started work on the 14th of last month. More than 1,000 workers and more than 300 large horse-drawn carts were mobilized to work separately. During the period, the work was difficult and the equipment was extremely scarce. In addition, the Communist army often shot workers and damaged the restoration project in the area of Xiuwu, Daiwang, and so on, so that the work could not be completed before the deadline. All employees insisted on one month in this extremely difficult situation, and the entire repair was completed on the 14th of this month. The entire 62-kilometer line, except for the Xinxiang to Xiuwu section (41 kilometers), which is heavy rail and can be used for locomotives and cargo cars, the remaining Xiuwu to Jiaozuo section is light rail with 16 kilograms, so it can only be used for small light trains modified from cars. It is estimated that 150 tons of coal can be transported out every day, and if the track condition is good, it can be increased to 400 tons. The light rail from Xiuwu to Jiaozuo is currently being replaced with heavy rail. If the goal can be achieved, the coal reserves in Jiaozuo (currently about 140,000 tons) can be continuously transported out, and the coal shortage can be solved. As for the road protection issue of this road, we are requesting the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters for protection, and it is currently being guarded by armed workers of this road. After the test run on the 15th, tickets will be sold soon. However, the ticket price will be doubled compared to the price set by the current Pinghan Road. Three stations will be set up: Huojia, Xiuwu, and Jiaozuo.

### Default on Debt and Then Commit Murder: Robbing a Boat and Killing People in the Middle of the Night. Shouting "Soybeans Are Here!" and Chopping Down with a Kitchen Knife. The Dead Were Thrown into the River, and the Wounded Were Fortunate to Be Rescued.

[Report from Gaochun by this newspaper] On the 11th of this month, Chen Shujin and his son-in-law Wang Xianmu from Shuiyang Town, Anhui, used a civilian boat to load 30 bundles of vegetable cakes and transported them from Shuiyang to Dongba Town for sale. When they passed through this city, it was already afternoon, so they docked the boat at the Mendouwei area across the river from the urban area. Because Liang Jiagui, a resident there, had a friendly relationship with Wang and others, Liang owed Wang three bundles of wheat. Therefore, they took the opportunity to go to Liang Jiagui's house to demand payment. Liang Jiagui agreed to repay the debt and said, "There are five *zu* of soybeans to be sold in Dongba. After the sale, the proceeds will be used to offset the wheat debt, and then we will settle the account. He also instructed them to move the boat about *li* to Sangu on the same night to load the soybeans." Wang Xianmu thought that it was a win-win situation and agreed. Unexpectedly, at midnight, as the two were sleeping, Liang Jiagui suddenly appeared with a kitchen knife, shouting, "Soybeans are here!" Just as the two were about to get up, they were met with the kitchen knife. Wang Xianmu was slashed once on the neck and fell into the water, but he did not die. Chen Shujin was slashed more than ten times and died. The body was tied up and thrown into the water. The murderer loaded the vegetable cakes onto another boat and escaped. Wang Xianmu went ashore naked and covered in blood. Enduring the pain, he ran to Hukoutou Village, about *li* away, and opened the door of a blacksmith shop. The blacksmith was shocked when he opened the door and called out to the neighbors in the village. Wang Xianmu was unable to speak due to his injuries, but he was able to write down the details with a pen. The villagers rushed to the rescue that night, reported it to the county government, and carried him to the county hospital. The county government arrested the murderer's family, and after questioning them, they were temporarily released on bail, responsible for collecting Chen Shujin's body. Wang Xianmu is now able to speak after medical treatment. The authorities are pursuing the murderer.

### Rongyang, Guangwu, and Fushui Counties in Henan Province Are Merged into Chenggao County: Yuanwu and Yangwu Counties Are Merged into Bolang County

[Report from Zhengzhou by this newspaper] Rongyang, Guangwu, and Fushui counties in Henan Province are small in area and sparsely populated. Their borders are adjacent, and in fact, there is no need to divide them. The previous Changju had a proposal to merge these three counties. The name after the merger was officially named Chenggao County by the Ministry of Interior. Later, the War of Resistance against Japan started, and the plan was delayed and not implemented. This year, Henan Province has carried out large-scale staff reductions and streamlining of administration, and has made great efforts to reduce the institutions below the county level. At the same time, Che Xingwang and other representatives of the people of Guangwu County submitted a report to the Henan Provincial Government, requesting that the three counties be merged as soon as possible to facilitate the implementation of government orders. After deliberation by the provincial government committee, it was deemed necessary and it was decided to implement it from this year. The Ministry of Interior was consulted and it was named Chenggao County. At the same time, Yuanwu and Yangwu counties were merged into Bolang County. The Henan Provincial Government also submitted the proposal for approval and decided to implement it in advance. However, the location of the county seat for the above two merged counties has not yet been clearly stipulated. Regarding the reduction of institutions below the county level, the general regulations stipulate that the county government should set up four sections and one office. The same type of business in the original institutions should be merged and handled separately. At the township level, they should also be merged and expanded according to the actual situation. For example, Zhengzhou originally had three towns and ten townships, but now it has been merged into two towns and six townships. The regulations for the mergers of various counties have been implemented since January 1 of this year. All laid-off employees will be paid one month's salary as severance pay.

### Huaiyin Levies House Tax.

### Thirteen Counties in Northern Anhui Jointly Establish Farms to Revitalize the Yellow River Flood Area

[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Northern Anhui has been plagued by frequent disasters and military costs, followed by the Yellow River floods. The rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the flood areas urgently need relief. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), recognizing this, has joined hands with the four ministries of agriculture and forestry, food, transportation, and economy, as well as the Department of Health, to establish the Yellow River Flood Area Reconstruction Committee. Branch committees will be set up in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan, and work teams will be set up in each county. In northern Anhui, thirteen counties including Fuyang, Taihe, Yingshang, Wuhe, Sixian, Shouxian, Fengyang, Fengtai, Dingyuan, Lingbi, Huaiyuan, Xu Yi, and Huoqiu will jointly establish farms. The committee will allocate tractors to help these disaster-stricken counties with cultivation. These machines can cultivate 50 acres of land per day and will be used for mobile cultivation within each county. It is estimated that the thirteen counties will cultivate a total of approximately 4.4 million acres. This work is scheduled to be completed before the spring plowing. The seeds, fertilizers, small farm tools, and flour for work relief will also be allocated by the committee. The estimated flour allocation is 8,000 tons in January, 8,000 tons in February, 10,000 tons in March, 12,000 tons in April, and 12,000 tons in May. If the seeds cannot be received before the spring plowing, the flour will be exchanged with farmers in various villages to help them complete the cultivation work as soon as possible.

### There Is a Deep Pit on Sichuan Middle Road

Sichuan Middle Road is an important thoroughfare in the city. More than three *zhang* south of Beijing Road, there is a deep pit with a diameter of two *chi*. When I take the bus, if the driver is not careful and the wheels run over the deep pit, the car body will shake violently, making passengers feel uneasy. I believe there are many others who have the same feeling when passing Sichuan Road. I am asking for a small space in your newspaper to publish this and request the Public Works Bureau to repair it as soon as possible (Wu Haifeng).

### Price Increases for Kerosene Should Be Restricted

Recently, many citizens use kerosene stoves for cooking, so the use of kerosene is more widespread and has become an important daily necessity for the public. Recently, the old price of kerosene in city shops, including the can fee, has risen from 15,000 yuan to about 30,000 yuan per five gallons. However, the price at which companies such as Mobil and Asia Petroleum sell to their managers is still 12,000 yuan per five gallons, including the can fee (7,000 yuan for kerosene and 5,000 yuan for the can). However, because the managers are aware of the unstable supply of kerosene and the rising price of gold notes, they hoard the goods and resell them to shops for tens of thousands of yuan per can, making a profit of tens of thousands of yuan per can. Furthermore, it is said that whenever managers receive a delivery slip from the kerosene company, they can sell the delivery slip to others without having to pay for the goods, making a profit without working for it. We should ask the Social Bureau of the Municipal Government to find a way to restrict this kind of illegal profiteering by intermediaries to benefit the public. (Sheng Bengong).

### Village Self-Defense Teams Should Be Established Urgently

Recently, bandits have been rampant in the villages of western Shanghai, and robberies are frequent, causing anxiety among the villagers. After the security forces in the villages of western Shanghai were ordered to be abolished, there was a lack of organized armed groups, so they could not effectively defend themselves. Although the police station patrols day and night due to the vast jurisdiction and inconvenient transportation, it has not been slightly slack. The number of volunteer patrols in each village is small, and the area is vast, so there are not enough people to allocate, and it is felt that the reach is not long enough. As for the Baojia personnel, who participate in assisting, they are helpless to go out empty-handed. How can they fight against bandits with weapons? Therefore, if we want to eliminate the banditry in the suburbs, we must organize self-defense teams in each village. The villagers in the suburbs have lived here for generations, and their families and property are closely tied to this place. When they encounter a robbery, they can bravely arrest the bandits. If each village is jointly defended, it can not only supplement the police force but also suppress the bandits' arrogance. It is a good method for local autonomy. We sincerely hope that the authorities will adopt it and order the villages to establish self-defense teams as soon as possible to consolidate the security of the suburbs.

### Stalin Accepts British Guarantee: Anglo-Soviet Treaty Still Valid. Soviet Union Suggests Extending the Treaty to Fifty Years. Misunderstandings Caused by Bevin's Speech Have Been Resolved.

[United Press, London, 24th] The British Foreign Office announced today that Marshal Stalin has accepted Britain's guarantee that it has no intention of abandoning the Anglo-Soviet alliance and proposed that the two countries jointly consider removing weakening clauses from the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Agreement and extending the term of the agreement again. In a note sent to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Stalin stated that it is now clear that Your Excellency and I have the same view of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Stalin's note officially ended the misunderstanding surrounding Bevin's speech. It is widely believed that Bevin's next action will be to study the meaning of Stalin's statement that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement has "weakening clauses". Bevin had hinted that he was planning to conclude a "Prevent German Aggression" agreement with the Soviet Union, and it is rumored that Stalin has agreed to extend the term of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement to 50 years.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Stalin has accepted Foreign Secretary Bevin's assurance that the Anglo-Soviet treaty remains valid. The Soviet newspaper Pravda recently stated that Bevin's Christmas broadcast, in which he said that Britain was not bound by any obligations other than those to the United Nations, was a declaration that the Anglo-Soviet treaty was no longer valid. After Britain's repeated statements, Pravda maintained its previous statement and did not recognize the British explanation. The British Foreign Office today published the exchange of telegrams between Bevin and Stalin. Bevin telegraphed Stalin on January 18, stating that he was deeply grateful for the warm reception given to the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Montgomery, during his visit to your country. I am studying the report that Marshal Montgomery brought with him, but I am deeply disturbed by Your Excellency's statement to him that London may have recognized that the Anglo-Soviet treaty and post-war cooperation have ceased to be valid due to the existence of the United Nations. Pravda has previously misunderstood this, and I believe that other powers have also often expressed that they will base their policies on the United Nations. Marshal Montgomery told me that Your Excellency does not have the same opinion of the Anglo-Soviet treaty as Pravda, and of course, I do not have this intention either. Stalin replied to Bevin by telegram on January 23, stating that Your Excellency's statement that Britain is not bound by any obligations is indeed puzzling to me, and I believe that if it is not explained, it will inevitably be used to undermine Anglo-Soviet friendship. I believe that the Anglo-Soviet treaty still creates obligations for both parties regardless. I previously met with British reporter Wallace on September 17 of last year and stated that the Soviet Union is bound by the Anglo-Soviet treaty and is not affected by the United Nations Charter. Your Excellency's telegram and the statement from your government have completely eliminated the cause of the misunderstanding. Now I am sure that Your Excellency and I have the same view of the Anglo-Soviet treaty. After receiving Stalin's telegram, Bevin ordered the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to thank Stalin for his "frank and useful statement".

### Relations Between Britain and the Soviet Union May Have New Developments. Soviet Refusal to Exchange Military Officers

[Report by this newspaper] [London, 25th Broadcasting: According to well-informed sources here, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will reopen negotiations on the Anglo-Soviet alliance with the Soviet side when he attends the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: The policy of the British government is to seek the closest possible relationship with the Soviet Union.

Another report: When British Chief of Staff Montgomery visited the Soviet Union earlier, he suggested an exchange of military officers between Britain and the Soviet Union. Stalin has rejected this suggestion, saying that the intention of exchanging military officers is very good, but this is not the time, as it may be misunderstood as a preparation for war.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Since Stalin's telegram to Foreign Secretary Bevin hinted that the Soviet Union might agree to extend the validity of the alliance from two to fifty years if "reservations that could weaken the Anglo-Soviet alliance" could be eliminated, well-informed sources expect Foreign Secretary Bevin to act immediately on this hint. The first step should be to explore the nature of these so-called reservations. Article 4 of the alliance stipulates that the contracting parties should engage in military mutual assistance in the event of renewed aggression by Germany and other former enemy countries, and states that this article should remain valid until both parties jointly adopt common action with other like-minded countries to protect post-war peace and resist aggression. The Franco-Soviet alliance of December 1944 deleted the provision that military mutual assistance would not apply after the establishment of a general security system. It is thought that the Soviet government would also like to delete this provision from the Anglo-Soviet alliance to make military mutual assistance an absolute obligation. London political observers believe that this step may not be impossible.

### A Glimpse of the British Press's Views

Recognizing the Need to Revise the Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The recent exchange of notes between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet leader Stalin on the validity of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty has been commented on by the British press. The Labor Party's Daily Herald stated, "It is obvious that the alliance treaty must be revised, because it is a wartime treaty, and most of it is out of date, so it should be changed to a regional security agreement, as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the United Nations Charter. The time has come to eliminate misunderstandings and rebuild wartime friendship on a permanent basis in peacetime." The London Times stated, "An unfortunate misunderstanding has led to a fortunate result, and the next step to improve Anglo-Soviet relations will be sought at the Moscow conference in March." The Daily Mail stated, "Marshal Stalin clearly hopes for a stronger treaty, and even hopes to expand its scope." The News Chronicle stated, "The future Anglo-French alliance should be drafted along the lines of the Anglo-Soviet treaty, and any modifications to the latter may affect the former." The Daily Mail stated, "It is not easy to interpret Moscow's state of mind. Marshal Stalin's recent conversations with reporters and the exchange of notes with Bevin hint at an attitude of friendship."

### Success or Failure of Anglo-Burmese Negotiations Still Difficult to Predict

[Reuters, London, 25th] U Tin Tut, one of the Burmese representatives to the Anglo-Burmese negotiations, said that the talks were proceeding smoothly in a friendly atmosphere and that it was impossible to predict that the negotiations would fail, adding that neither the British nor the Burmese side could allow the negotiations to fail. Another representative, former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw, said that the outcome of the negotiations was still difficult to predict, but that all issues of close mutual concern had been discussed and needed to be seriously considered, and that it was expected to take several days to reach a definitive decision. The British government has made every effort to consider and accept the Burmese demands, and if the negotiations unfortunately fail, neither the British nor the Burmese side can be blamed.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 24th] A spokesman for the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma said that the League was prepared to instruct its representatives to withdraw from the Burmese Governor's Executive Council if the Anglo-Burmese negotiations failed, and that the Burmese delegation in London had been summoned to return to Rangoon by January 31.

[United Press, London, 4th] Well-informed sources said that British Prime Minister Attlee had announced that he would report to the House of Commons early next week on the outcome of the recent independent negotiations conducted here by the Burmese delegation. It is reported that the talks will conclude next Monday, and the delegation will return to Rangoon before the end of the month. It is said that Attlee and his cabinet members expressed sympathy for the various proposals put forward by Burma, but strongly urged that if Burma could first achieve dominion status, it would benefit both sides. Observers here said that although Burmese leaders have strived for complete independence, Burma may first become an independent and autonomous dominion within the British Commonwealth, so as to reap the benefits of Commonwealth and military cooperation with the British Empire.

### Burmese Authorities Arrest Communist Leaders

[Reuters, Rangoon, 24th] The Burmese government gazette contained an order from the authorities declaring the Burmese Communist Party and the Red Flag Peasants' Association (Trotskyist faction) to be illegal organizations. Police have been dispatched to arrest the leaders of the Communist Party and other illegal political parties, and 26 people, including Red Flag Association leader Soe Thein, have been arrested. The government gazette stated that members of the aforementioned groups had trespassed into courts and government offices, and that members of the Communist Party had looted rice warehouses, and had publicly distributed leaflets inciting rebellion.

### Britain Issues New Note to Egypt

Britain Firmly Advocates Sudanese Self-Determination

[United Press, Cairo, 25th] The British government today presented a new note to the Egyptian government, stating its position on the Sudan issue. Observers believe that this new note will not lead to an agreement in the negotiations to amend the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936. British Ambassador Campbell met with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy today to deliver the note. Nokrashy said that he would announce a response tomorrow. Neither side disclosed the contents of the new British note, but it is known that Britain insists on Sudanese self-determination and opposes Egypt's demand for the annexation of Sudan into Egyptian territory under the rule of the Egyptian monarch.

### Coeur du was Elected as Temporary Head of the World Bank

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] The Board of Directors of the World Bank today elected Coeur du as its temporary head. The sudden death of former Deputy Head Smith (who had resumed acting head duties after Meyer's resignation as head) forced the Board to quickly elect Managing Director Coeur du as temporary head, and also prompted the Board to fill these two vacancies. Truman and other American officials unanimously praised Smith as one of the most capable people in public service.

### South Africa Echoes Australian Proposal, Advocating Small Countries' Participation in Peace Treaty Discussions; Soviet Representative Firmly Expresses Opposition

[Reuters, London, 24th] The South African representative to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today presented his views on the procedures for the participation of small countries in the meeting, believing that all active belligerent countries should be allowed to participate in the work of the various committees to be established, and that small countries should have the right to express opinions, ask questions, and receive documents. British representative Strang said that Britain believes that representatives of small countries should generally participate in the meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The French representative also said that several points of the South African proposal were relevant to France. Soviet representative Gusev reiterated that the mandate of the Council of Foreign Ministers had clear provisions and would not allow small countries to participate in the work of the Four Power representatives at this stage, but could only be invited to attend the meeting to express their views. American representative Murphy said that the mandate of the Council of Foreign Ministers should be strictly interpreted, and there was no agreement after a long debate.

Avoid Excessive Demands in Border Adjustments

[Reuters, London, 24th] South African representatives Skellen and Kerlen presented South Africa's views on the German peace treaty to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today, saying that South Africa favored Germany becoming a decentralized and federal state, but not including Prussia. This federal state should have a central government to handle major affairs such as foreign affairs and the economy. The basic goal is to prevent the resurgence of German military power, while not restricting the development of its economic and social life, so that it can occupy its rightful place in Europe. Regarding the issue of Germany's borders, South Africa believes that it is not appropriate to cede large areas of land inhabited purely by Germans to its neighboring countries, and that the eastern border of Germany should be at most the Oder River. If Poland's territory extends deep into Germany, it will create uncontrollable friction. South Africa recognizes the importance of the Saar region to the French economy, but firmly opposes the annexation of the region into French territory, because the residents of the region are almost purely German. South Africa generally agreed with the small-scale border adjustments requested by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

### Yoshida Plans to Try Again to Form a Coalition Cabinet

Success or Failure Depends on the Attitude of the Opposition Parties

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The "Kyoto Shimbun" reported today that Prime Minister Yoshida has re-determined his plan to form a coalition cabinet. If an agreement is reached among the leaders of the three major parties, the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the Social Democratic Party, then the Yoshida cabinet will submit its resignation within a few days, and the three major parties may hold a meeting today. According to some observers, the Social Democratic Party, which refused to participate in the Yoshida coalition cabinet on the 17th of this month, has changed its attitude after suddenly holding an executive committee meeting on the 22nd, and Yoshida's proposal to form a coalition cabinet again has apparently been encouraged by this. In addition, the general strike scheduled for February 1 is another reason why Yoshida is eager to stabilize the political situation. It is rumored that Yoshida is preparing to invite all political parties to join the cabinet, except for the Communist Party.

### Japan Issues New Public Bonds

### MacArthur's Birthday

Although Old, He Has a Good Appetite

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Tomorrow is General MacArthur's 67th birthday. He will work as usual and only have lunch with his wife and son, followed by a birthday cake. According to his adjutant, there are no special celebration plans. MacArthur, who is spending his birthday abroad for the twelfth consecutive year, is now 67 years old. Although he thinks about retiring someday, he is still very healthy and is fully focused on the occupation work. Since arriving in Japan, he has only taken a few days off due to a cold last spring. Doctors say that he has a good appetite and is quite casual about food, not being particular about fine cuisine. One general said that the old man has an "iron stomach."

### Marshall Personally Attends Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference; Vandenberg and Connally Will Accompany Him; Marshall Hosts Banquet for Envoys from Various Countries

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall will attend the Foreign Ministers Conference, which, according to the decision of the recent New York Foreign Ministers Conference, will be held in Moscow on March 10 to discuss the drafts of the German and Austrian peace treaties. According to the State Department, Secretary of State Marshall plans to implement the plan of former Secretary of State Byrnes to attend the Moscow Conference. Today, Marshall hosted a banquet for Washington envoys from various countries at Blair House, which was the first formal meeting he held outside the State Department since being appointed Secretary of State. Marshall, who had no appointments with diplomatic personnel today, continued to spend most of his time studying American foreign relations.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned today that the new Secretary of State Marshall will invite Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Connally to accompany him when he attends the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March. Vandenberg and Connally initially expressed their unwillingness to go, but have now agreed, in order to continue to represent the unified foreign policy of the Democratic and Republican parties.

### Large-Scale Riots in Punjab Province, India; Caused by the Arrest of Muslim League Leaders; Clashes with Police Result in 200 Injuries

[Reuters, Lahore, 24th] Police today searched the offices of the Muslim National Guard and the Hindu National Guard in Lahore. Seven Muslim League leaders were arrested for refusing to be searched. Muslims in Lahore held a meeting in a mosque to protest the arrests.

[United Press, Lahore, Punjab Province, India, 24th] The Punjab Provincial Government today banned the Muslim League's paramilitary volunteer group, the National Guard, and detained eight high-ranking Muslim League officials. Police wielding batons charged a group of Muslim League members, resulting in riots. No fewer than 200 people were injured. The Muslim League expressed its outrage at the government's actions. The Bombay Muslim League has called on 2.5 million Muslims throughout the province to strike this Saturday to protest. Muslims held a mass rally in Bombay tonight to protest the government's ban on gatherings of more than five people. The implementation of this ban was due to the Indo-Muslim conflicts since last September, which resulted in more than 1,200 deaths. Today's editorial in the Muslim League's newspaper called on the people of Punjab Province to depose the provincial government that hates Muslims. The Punjab Provincial Government announced that the Muslim League's "National Guard" and the Hindu "Youth League" were searched at the same time, but no Hindus were arrested. The provincial government's actions are not aimed at any political party, but only to prevent the expansion of private armies in order to ensure national security. After the news of the searches and arrests was announced, demonstrations appeared in Lahore, chanting anti-government slogans, resulting in clashes with the police. At least 30 people were arrested. The Muslim League Executive Committee of this province is scheduled to meet tomorrow with the Muslim League members of the Provincial Assembly to decide on a course of action. Kamaruddin, leader of an Indian women's group, said: "This is another attempt by the Punjab Provincial Government to eliminate the Muslim League groups by force, but I dare say that these people will never succeed, and the Muslims of India will never yield." Hassan, acting chairman of the Muslim League in this province, said: "Our struggle is neither criminal nor violent. I have been ordered to strike against the ban on public gatherings when necessary, and the people will not retreat even if they are shot." Ali, a Muslim League cabinet member of the interim government, also made a statement here, advising the leaders of this province not to get caught up in the vortex of Indo-Muslim conflict.

### Difficulties in Handling the Korean Issue; Rumors that the United Nations Will Be Asked to Resolve It; American Senators Advocate Thorough Investigation

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to reliable sources, officials from the United States State Department and the Army Department in Japan and Korea are now beginning to consider the possibility of entrusting the currently unresolved Korean issue to the United Nations for resolution. The source cautiously pointed out that this consideration is still in its early and formative stages. Even if this move is still in the "consideration stage," it is recognized here that the US-Soviet efforts to resolve the Korean issue have indeed reached a dead end. However, the United Nations may also find it difficult to accept this thorny issue, so this matter will only be referred to the United Nations when it is ultimately impossible to resolve it. It is unanimously believed here that some measures should be taken, because the 38th parallel has been an obstacle to the country's economic recovery for 17 months since the US-Soviet joint occupation of Korea.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Syngman Rhee, leader of the conservative party in the US military occupation zone in southern Korea, today bluntly denounced the "ambiguous elements" in the State Department for obstructing the United States from fulfilling its promise to grant Korea independence, but refused to say who these ambiguous elements were. Rhee said that these people are hindering the execution of the American policy towards Korea and feel that they are inclined towards communism, but since General Marshall was transferred to Secretary of State, he has heard that these people will leave the State Department.

[French News Agency, Washington, 24th] Senator Hickenlooper, Chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and a Republican senator, told reporters that there are many contradictory rumors about the situation in Korea, which is really disturbing, so the US Congress really needs to send an investigation team to Korea to conduct an on-site investigation. In addition, Hickenlooper spoke in the Senate today and also requested the Senate to immediately discuss all the activities of the United States in the Far East, especially in Japan and Korea.

### US Army Secretary Orders Subordinates to Purge Unstable Elements

[United Press, Washington, 25th] In order to purge unstable elements among the civilian officials in the garrisons throughout the United States, Secretary of the Army Patterson specially ordered the local commanders to pay attention to secret investigations, and gave the commanders extensive authority to dismiss them at any time. However, in cases where there is suspicion of endangering the security of military equipment, they will be suspended for 90 days and the intelligence department will thoroughly investigate them before reporting to the Secretary. If the facts are true, they will be dismissed immediately, otherwise they will be restored to their original positions.

### Ambassador Koo Visits Clayton

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin visited Under Secretary of State Clayton today and talked for a long time before leaving.

### French Forces in Hanoi Launch Another Full-Scale Offensive; French Commissioner to Vietnam Takes Firm Stance

[United Press, Paris, 25th] According to the press here today, French forces have launched a full-scale offensive against the areas occupied by Vietnamese forces in Hanoi. This is the first large-scale offensive by the French side since the outbreak of the Franco-Vietnamese war on December 19. The purpose of the French offensive is to open up the railway line. A French military communique said that French artillery had repelled the Vietnamese artillery units that were shelling the railway. The unrest of the Vietnamese has now spread to Cochinchina, and Vietnamese forces have fiercely attacked villages near the city of Vung Tau. (transliteration)

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam D'Argenlieu said in a broadcast on the occasion of the Vietnamese New Year that France is determined to restore peace and will carry out this task to the end. France has treaty obligations and will not tolerate those who abandon these obligations. He hopes that the Vietnamese can cooperate with France to rebuild order and security.

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 24th] The French military headquarters here issued a communique stating that Viet Minh convoys attacked French outposts in the Nam Dinh area several times on the evening of the 21st of this month, but were repelled.

[United Press, Manila, 25th] It was heard here today that the Viet Minh radio station in Hanoi broadcast the words of American Consul General Sullivan, saying: "The longer the Vietnamese people struggle, the more certain their final victory will be." This statement was made at a banquet held by Viet Minh leaders for the consuls of the United States, China, and Britain on the occasion of the Lunar New Year. British Consul Wilson thanked the Viet Minh authorities for protecting the Indians in the area and said that the Viet Minh's compliance with international law has won the sympathy of the world. There was no mention of what the Chinese consul said, but it was said that Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressed his gratitude to the leaders of India and Burma for their sympathy for the Vietnamese people and their struggle against French imperialism.

Vietnamese Representative in India Urges Our Support

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 24th] Mai Duc Chau, the representative of the Permanent Vietnamese Delegation in Paris to India, said that he had sent a letter to China, urging the Chinese people to continue to support Vietnam's struggle for freedom. In his letter, Mai reviewed the current situation in Vietnam and emphasized that the overseas Chinese in Vietnam have always sympathized with the Vietnamese government. Mai called on Burma and India to respond in the same way. The chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress asked the constituent trade unions governed by Colombo, Calcutta, Mumbai, and the local area to take immediate steps to cut off transportation between France and Vietnam. The chairman also asked the French Labor Confederation and the trade unions in Singapore and the United States to take similar actions.

### First Meeting of the New French Cabinet

Premier Determined to Do His Utmost to Suppress Prices

[French News Agency, Paris, 24th] The new French cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow, to be chaired by Premier Ramadier. Premier Ramadier held talks with Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense, General Juin, this morning, and delivered a radio address in the evening, elaborating on the government's economic plan, stating in brief: The achievements of the former Premier Blum were quite substantial. We have suffered greatly from the continuous rise in prices over the years, and we are fortunate that it has now ended. The government will continue to complete this task. We will do everything in our power to implement this plan, and the continued development of price suppression movements will eventually punish those who act against the will of the people and thus go bankrupt.

### Italian Cabinet Crisis Expected to Be Resolved

Socialist Workers' Party Holds Dissenting Views

[French News Agency, Rome, 25th] After the Socialist Party leader Nenni issued a declaration last night, proposing new conditions for joining the government, the Italian cabinet crisis has seen a turning point and is expected to be resolved soon. Nenni today expressed his approval of the principles of the coalition government and Premier de Gasperi's plan, and has changed his position after learning that Socialist Workers' Party leader Saragat refused to join the government. De Gasperi told the press that the situation yesterday showed hope for a rapid resolution of the cabinet crisis, and that Nenni and Communist Party leader Togliatti were in agreement with him. Togliatti only requested that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Treasury be merged into a "ministry," but did not object to the abolition of the Post-War Relief Department. After Saragat decided not to join the government, Nenni asked De Gasperi to change his plan and reconsider the allocation of cabinet members. He suggested that the government's plan should meet the needs of the working class and that the Socialist Party should also be given political leadership positions. Nenni's resignation as foreign minister was of decisive significance to himself, and what is most important now is what decision the Republican Party will make at its meeting today.

According to the Committee's plan, the United Nations Secretariat would be asked to study the League of Nations' plan to establish a Far East Bureau, a broad plan to prohibit the trafficking of women and combat prostitution. Various agreements drafted by the League of Nations before the war will be included in the draft convention prepared by the United Nations Secretariat. The Committee also asked the Secretariat to study and report on international actions to prevent crime and punish offenders. The Committee recommended that the Secretariat consult with the International Labor Organization and other agencies on this matter and the issue of trafficking in women and children.

### American Commander Announces Arctic Combat Conditions

Human Endurance to Cold Exceeds That of Machinery

[United Press, Somewhere in Alaska, 24th] Colonel Cain, commander of the US Army's "Operation Musk Ox," a special mobile unit in Alaska that tested the endurance of tanks and infantry, proved today that humans can maintain combat capabilities in the Arctic cold, while equipment may not be able to do so. Defensive warfare can be carried out in Alaska, but new tactics are needed. In addition, there must be two shifts of personnel for rotation, and there must be warm tents and hot meals, ample rest opportunities, and care for the injured at the highest speed. As for offensives, strategies such as flanking maneuvers or central breakthroughs are impossible, and only positional warfare can be carried out.

Innocent Victims of the War in Vietnam

### Difficulties in Handling the Korean Issue; Rumors that the United Nations Will Be Asked to Resolve It; American Senators Advocate Thorough Investigation

### World Economic Trends

— Our Special Correspondent in the Tea Trade, Wang Yizhi

If one can clearly see the global situation, follow its course and seize opportunities, and leverage external forces from various aspects to achieve our aspirations for "progress," there is no reason why we cannot achieve twice the result with half the effort...

In the global economic landscape of 1947, the United States is in the most advantageous position, while Britain faces significant difficulties. Russia, on the other hand, is seeking opportunities to advance westward. The stalemate between Britain and the United States against Russia regarding Germany is vastly different from the past. In the past, Britain's traditional policy of dealing with the European continent could often achieve great results without spending huge sums; for example, using France to counter Germany, or Germany to counter Russia. Britain was always adept at combining with the "second strongest" power, combining the strength of Britain and the second strongest power to jointly defend against the "strongest," making it easy to win with a two-on-one advantage. By leveraging the tactic of mutual restraint between the two major powers on the European continent, Britain, as the "second," could approach one side during their infighting and easily reap the benefits without much difficulty.

Now, however, times have changed, and it is no longer possible to rely on German military strength to counter Russia as it was a few years ago. Britain and the United States now need a strong military force equivalent to the former German military to forcefully prevent Russia's westward advance. This action requires too much funding, and the United States is now seeking markets overseas, focusing on China and Asia, and not paying much attention to Europe. As a result, Britain must face Russia alone, and each time it struggles precariously.

Recently, the Russian forces advancing from east to west have been making steady progress in the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey, Thessaloniki in Greece, and Trieste in Italy, while the British forces in Egypt, Greece, and Turkey are declining day by day. In the future, European countries such as Italy and France will become strong bases for Russia. The political situation in France is not yet fully stable, while Italy and Spain are both receiving American financial assistance. The progress of post-war reconstruction in Italy will definitely be faster than in France.

In Northern Europe, Russia has expanded its territory to its satisfaction and does not need to seize new territories for the time being. It only seeks to quickly consolidate the territories it has already occupied, establish new industries in all sectors, and become self-sufficient in providing for local workers. Denmark's agricultural products are very abundant, but recently they have been completely bought up by Britain. Belgium is fortunate to have preserved its Congo colony in Africa, and its domestic industry is gradually returning to its original state. Compared to the pre-war 1938 standard of 100%, woolen fabrics have increased by 72%, cotton fabrics by 35%, linen fabrics by 22%, and mixed fabrics by 18%. The purchase of clothing fabrics has been exempted from distribution restrictions.

In the Netherlands, after the signing of the Dutch-Indonesian peace agreement on November 18 last year, the securities of all East Indies colonial enterprises suddenly depreciated in the domestic market, falling by a quarter of their original value. The Dutch headquarters has invested a total of 4 trillion Dutch guilders in shipping companies and factories in the East Indies colonies. Due to the lack of goods coming by sea, domestic docks and factories relying on colonial raw materials for manufacturing have all fallen into a state of stagnation. Moreover, the number of colonial people is several times that of the Dutch headquarters. It is not easy to win quickly by using force in the colonies. During the two-sided war, agriculture and industry suffer the most. To quickly restore the original state, a large amount of capital is needed, and it is necessary to communicate with the United States. However, for its own convenience, the United States would rather lend directly to the newly established democratic government of the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands lacks both people and capital, making it difficult to retain the wealth and resources of the East Indies. As a result, among its nine trillion people, five trillion may still need to be relocated abroad. Its suffering seems to be somewhat similar to that of Germany.

Britain finds it difficult to repay its American debts, and its combined territories and colonies form a large-scale economic group, seeking to rely on the sale of export goods to repay its American debts. Unfortunately, this idea contradicts the United States' intention to seize markets, resulting in a lack of quick and effective results.

The United States places the greatest emphasis on China in its efforts to seize overseas markets, followed by Japan, then the Dutch East Indies, then India and other parts of Asia. Among them, the South American countries, except for Argentina's meat market, which is in conflict with American business interests, are already under American control.

Secondly, there is the abolition of heavy industry monopolies and light industry, with the intention of using the export of children's toys to pay off the consumption of the British and American occupation forces in Germany and Japan. The newly established American toy industry during the war can be a strong competitor. The goods of Germany and Japan are of high quality and low price, which is tantamount to competing with American goods for markets, and is another contradiction in the economic world. It is said that American industrialists are already planning countermeasures and dreaming of devaluing and dumping their goods.

Wars often arise from commerce. Those who follow the will of Heaven prosper, and those who defy it perish. We Chinese should cultivate virtue and value culture, not forgetting that we are weak. If we can clearly see the global situation, follow its course and seize opportunities, adjust our sails to the wind, and leverage external forces from various aspects to achieve our aspirations for "progress," there is no reason why we cannot achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we are only exploited by one side, like the frequent uprisings in the semi-colonies of Central and South America, it is not enough to harm others, and there will be more than enough self-inflicted disasters.

Today, China is like an outstanding woman who has suddenly been loved by a powerful friendly nation. Compared to Germany and Japan, who cannot succeed whether they go forward or backward, there is a vast difference between heaven and earth. It is the right time for the Chinese to adjust their sails to the wind, and it is extremely easy and supremely wise to follow the trend.

My intention is by no means to favor the United States. I ask, in today's world, who else besides the United States has the remaining strength and leisure to sincerely help us? Who else loves and values us more than the United States? Our people's livelihood is declining, and everything needs to be rebuilt. If we can take advantage of the fact that a friendly nation has fallen in love with us and quickly arrange for planned loans, we can increase the purchasing power of the people and promote Chinese export goods that do not conflict with the United States. Regarding the absorption of American goods as an urgent need for temporary solutions, and using education and incentives to place knowledgeable intellectuals and improve the knowledge of the people as the key to fundamental solutions for absorbing American goods, wouldn't national interests and the people's welfare advance together as a result?

### 防疫 Committee Holds General Meeting, Zhang Wei Emphatically Calls for Strengthening Port Quarantine, Hong Kong Smallpox Patients Have Already Mixed into the City

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held a general meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday afternoon. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, Epidemic Prevention Division Director Chen Bangxian, municipal councilors, and prominent figures from all walks of life, totaling over a hundred people, attended. The meeting was chaired by Mayor Wu, who emphasized the importance of vaccination to prevent smallpox in his address. Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei then reported on the implementation of mandatory vaccination in the city, stating that the city's population is estimated at four million, excluding the elderly and weak, who account for 30 percent. Those who should be vaccinated this year account for 3.2 million people, to be completed in two phases, with 2 million in the first half of the year and 1.2 million in the second half of the year. Vaccination is planned to be carried out in the spring and autumn seasons. The implementation dates, as decided yesterday, are changed as follows: (1) The spring vaccination period will be from February 1st to 9th for the promotion period, using slogans, announcements, newspaper advertisements, movies, and speeches to raise public awareness. February 9th to March 15th will be the first phase of the general mobilization, adopting a persuasion approach. April 15th to May 15th will be the second phase of the general mobilization, forcibly implementing vaccination and conducting a general inspection of land and water transportation and citywide spring vaccination certificates. (2) The autumn vaccination period will be from September 16th to 20th for the announcement period. September 21st to October 31st will be the first phase of the general mobilization. November 1st to November 30th will be the second phase of the general mobilization. The methods are the same as in the spring.

Later, the person in charge of the Seaport Quarantine Station reported that in November last year, a seven-year-old child with smallpox was discovered on a ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai. After a thorough investigation, it was found that his vaccination certificate was forged. A similar situation occurred two weeks ago, and the matter has been handed over to the Hong Kong government. Therefore, it is hoped that the city will be especially cautious when issuing vaccination certificates. According to the rules of the Seaport Quarantine Station, if smallpox patients are found in a certain area,

When the number reaches thirty, it will be declared a smallpox area. Between December 21st and, the number of smallpox patients reached 1,474. The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station declared Hong Kong a smallpox epidemic port on November 8th.

Director Zhang loudly appealed at yesterday's meeting, saying that Hong Kong is only separated by a body of water, and smallpox is now rampant with a very high mortality rate. Therefore, the traffic inspection work must be strengthened! We absolutely do not want to bring diseases into this city from other places. After hearing this, the mayor nodded in agreement and asked all sectors to work hard to promote this. He stated that if no smallpox is found in the city in the future, it will be due to the efforts of everyone; if unfortunately any is found, it will be our shame.

Also, it was decided at yesterday's meeting that citizens aged 50 and over will not be subject to the mandatory vaccination measures, but this is only limited to within the city. If traveling abroad, they must still be vaccinated one week in advance.

Two pieces of dry bread were placed on the long stool. Wang held her stomach with both hands and complained of stomach pain, asking the prison staff to give her boiling water to quench her thirst. Some people sympathized with her, but others pointed out that she was a female con artist, claiming that she was faking illness and did not need to be paid attention to.

### Collision Case Outside Wusong Estuary, Responsibility Determined, Losses Shared

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of responsibility for the collision and sinking of the Zhijiang (芷江) and Huatong (華通) ships outside the Wusong Estuary, the Navigation Administration Bureau convened a collision committee yesterday afternoon to resolve the matter. Bureau Director Li Guofan, Section Chief Chen Guangzhe, Wang Muzong, Customs Port Director Yuan Jun, and the responsible persons of the two companies attended. The captain of the Zhijiang ship, Xin Chengfang, and the captain of the Huatong ship, Zhang Jinsheng, were escorted to the scene by the District Prosecutor's Office to describe the circumstances of the collision. The meeting lasted until 7 pm. After detailed inquiries and judgments, it was decided that the Zhijiang ship was at fault for its wrong course, and should bear 80% of the responsibility. The Huatong ship's towing barges on both sides did not comply with the Port Affairs Law, and should bear 20% of the responsibility. All losses will be shared by the two companies according to this ratio.

It is also learned that more than ten representatives of local sailors went to the Navigation Administration Bureau yesterday morning to request the release of the captains of the Zhijiang and Huatong ships.

### A Large Number of Robbers Caught in the Net - Guns and Original Stolen Goods Recovered - Headquarters Located at Panjiasha Outside Wusongkou

[Report from our newspaper] Xiao Fuquan, the Director of the Huxi District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Command Investigation Department, recently received a secret report stating that a large number of robbers were hiding in the urban area, committing many crimes, and possessing weapons such as carbine rifles. He immediately dispatched Deputy Director Zhang Wenming, Director Wang Jingwen, and Intelligence Section Chief Yang Weibin to conduct investigations. After spending more than ten days, they finally discovered that the gang had set up a secret room at Room 609 of the Jinshan Hotel on Guangxi Road on the 15th of this month. Action Section Chief Yan Jinwen immediately led officers such as Zhai Gengchun to arrest the robber Chen Linqi. He confessed that the gang leader Zhang Shicai was hiding in Room 520 of the Wugong Hotel. When they went there, the suspect had already fled upon hearing the news, and only his mistress Tang Dayuan was apprehended. Subsequently, they went to Room 414 of the Yangtze Hotel to arrest the remaining members, but were unsuccessful. They then rushed to Wusong overnight and finally captured the gang leader Zhang Yancai inside No. 105 Hefeng Road, confiscating dozens of bullets and box gun cartridge belts. After interrogation, they apprehended accomplices Fan Zhiming, Huang Nianxiu, Yang Heshang, and Zhang Mulang at the Wusong Wushang Inn. They confessed that the headquarters was located at Panjiasha, 40 li away from the Wusongkou sea area. They immediately took the suspect Fan Zhiming there and recovered a carbine rifle, hundreds of bullets, two telescopes, and three hand grenades from a thatched house. They also arrested Huang Wangjin and Zhu Xilang, two robbers guarding the firearms, and Zhou Aibao, a receiver of stolen goods, bringing the total number of men and women arrested to ten. After the office interrogated each suspect one by one, they confessed to committing numerous robberies from December of last year to January of this year without denying it.

### Zhenru Machine Factory Embezzlement Case of UNRRA - Indictment Full Text

Two UNRRA Staff Suspected of Stealing and Selling Will Be Tried for the First Time by Our Country's Courts

[Report from our newspaper] The UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory embezzlement case has been investigated and concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office, and a public prosecution has been filed. The handling prosecutor believes that although Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are UNRRA staff members, they were borrowed by UNRRA and supervised by the Chinese government, engaging in public service. Their status as public officials has been confirmed. In the worst case, the two are also persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters. Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption states: "Soldiers, public officials, or persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters who commit crimes under these regulations during wartime shall be punished in accordance with these regulations. The same applies to non-military or public officials who are accomplices." Therefore, the defendants Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, Qian Zhengfu, and others jointly encroached upon and stole for sale, violating Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption: "Those who steal for sale, encroach upon, or steal public property shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for seven years or more." In particular, Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo continued to steal and sell. According to Article 56 of the Criminal Law: "Whoever continuously commits the same crime through multiple acts shall be deemed to have committed one crime, but the sentence may be increased by up to one-half." Therefore, if the crimes committed by Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, and others are true, they will be punished jointly in accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Law, and the sentencing will inevitably be severe in the future. The fact that UNRRA staff members are tried and punished by our country's courts will begin with Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo. The full text of the indictment is published below:

Defendants:

Xi Zhi, male, 46 years old, Australian, residing at No. 165 Maiyang Road, Occupation: Deputy Director of Factory.

Xie Piluo, male, 34 years old, Polish, residing at No. 35 Tailatuo Road, Occupation: Director of Factory Affairs.

Yang Shenghuan, male, 34 years old, Hunanese, residing at No. 70 Lane, 84 Xianyang Road, Occupation: Staff of UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory.

Li Luoshi, male, 21 years old, Cantonese, residing at No. 16, Lane 97, Meibaike Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.

Ma Shiyi, male, 21 years old, Hebei native, residing at No. 14, Lane 97, Meibaike Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.

Qian Zhengfu, male, 23 years old, Jiading native, residing at No. 21, Lane 102, Zhongzheng North Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.

Cao Chiming, male, 36 years old, Zhejiang native, residing at No. 7, Fuxingli, North Zhangjia Lane, Nanshi, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.

The above-mentioned defendants are involved in a case of suspected corruption (Case No. 5755 of Zhenjia in the 35th year). After investigation, the prosecution is filed because it is deemed:

Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are both staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), borrowed by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Xi Zhi is the deputy director of the Zhenru Machinery Assembly Factory of the administration, and Xie Piluo is the director of the factory's affairs. On July 22 of last year, Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo stole and sold 55 boxes of five-plywood from the factory to Huang Zhangbin of the Daxing Construction Company, obtaining US$11,000. In November of the same year, they, together with Yang Shenghuan, the leader of the factory's material distribution group, Li Luoshi, the field manager, Ma Shiyi, Yang's assistant and cargo inspector, and Cao Chiming, the auditor, jointly stole and sold 10 boxes of aluminum sheets from the factory to Li Siheng, the owner of the Jingcheng Hardware Store, obtaining 11 million yuan. In the same month, Xi Zhi, together with Qian Zhengfu, the leader of the material allocation group, stole and sold 10 boxes of aluminum sheets to Wang Xiansheng, the owner of the China-US Oil Company, and divided the proceeds, which led to their transfer to the office.

The defendants Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, and Ma Shiyi have already confessed to the above-mentioned facts. The process of how they discussed it, how they obtained the proceeds, how they distributed them, how they were discovered, and how they were arrested is described in detail, as if they were drawing a picture. In addition, witnesses Zhu Jiade, Deng Tuolai, and Hui Desheng testified in court about the investigation and investigation process in great detail. There is also evidence of the US dollar bill and legal tender of the stolen money sent to the case, a note from Daxing Construction Company applying to purchase 4-foot, 8-and-a-half-inch five-plywood, a receipt for US$11,000 signed by Australian Xi Zhi to Daxing Construction Company, UNRRA Machine Factory Nos. 26, 42, and 58 delivery orders, and invoices for aluminum sheets, etc. It is beyond doubt that they jointly stole and sold public property. The defendant Qian Zhengfu quibbled with his words, but it has been clearly indicated by Xi Zhi how he negotiated with Xi Zhi to steal and sell 10 boxes of aluminum sheets. It has also been stated by Ma Shiyi and Yang Shenghuan how he took the 10 boxes of aluminum sheets that he stole out of the factory. It is difficult to deny. The defendant Cao Chiming is responsible for the inspection of material receipt and distribution. If he did not collude with them, how could the aluminum sheets without a delivery permit be allowed to be loaded and shipped out of the factory? Since the defendant admitted that he was suspicious, why did he not report it for investigation? Based on the testimony of witness Zhu Jiade, when he went to inquire at the time, the defendant looked flustered and spoke evasively, indicating that he was suspected of jointly stealing. Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, and Qian Zhengfu are all staff members of UNRRA, and there is no doubt that they are public officials. Although Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are staff members of UNRRA and receive salaries from UNRRA, they are borrowed by UNRRA and supervised by the Chinese government, and are engaged in public service. They must be recognized as having the status of public officials. Even if we take a step back, because they are UNRRA employees and receive salaries from UNRRA, we cannot consider them to be public officials. They are also persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters. According to the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, if they have engaged in acts of encroachment upon or theft for sale of public property, they should also be punished in accordance with the regulations. Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are responsible for the custody of the factory's public property. They jointly encroached upon and stole for sale with Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, Qian Zhengfu, etc., in violation of Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption. Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo stole and sold aluminum sheets twice, with only a few days in between, indicating that they had an overall intention to commit the crime. There is no doubt that they are serial offenders under Article 56 of the Criminal Code. However, Xi Zhi's theft and sale of five-plywood in July of last year and the theft and sale of aluminum sheets were separated by several months, and it is believed that the intent to commit the crime was different. They should be punished jointly in accordance with Article 50 of the same law. All the stolen public property will be handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, and a public prosecution will be filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### American Military Remains in China Theater - 2,500 Bodies Have Been Found - More Than 400 Unidentified

[Report from our newspaper] Major Allersmith, Director of the American Military Cemetery Registration Office in the China Theater, stated here yesterday morning that the office has now discovered a total of 2,575 bodies of American military personnel, which were found in Taiwan, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Kunming, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Among them, about 1,760 bodies have been identified, and the identities of 455 are being checked by the US Army Department.

A total of 420 coffins of American military personnel have been found in Taiwan, but some coffins contain more than one body. Forty bodies were found in Qingdao, and 260 bodies were found in Shenyang, including two bodies of British military personnel and one body of an Australian military personnel. Eight hundred and sixty bodies were found in Kunming, 325 in Chengdu, and 525 in the Shanghai cemetery.

Major Smith said that the work of identifying these bodies is extremely slow and difficult. He said that the office plans to send some personnel to Germany for research because the method of identifying bodies used there is faster.

About 400 of the bodies found in Taiwan were American prisoners of war who were bombed by American aircraft while being transported from the Philippines to Japan on two Japanese ships. It is reported that one Japanese ship originally carried 1,700 American prisoners of war from the Philippines to Japan and was bombed outside the Philippine Islands. As a result, 560 American prisoners died. The survivors were carried on another Japanese ship, which was bombed again by American aircraft on January 9, 1945, killing 200 people. According to Japanese documents, the bombed bodies were originally intended to be cremated, but due to the major bombing by American aircraft, it could not be implemented, and they were buried together in a large tomb 75 feet long and 18 feet wide.

### Deeds, Delivery Orders, and Bills Should Be Stamped in Accordance with the Law

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for shipping deeds, delivery orders, and bills issued for meals, dishes, and beverages sold on ships and trains, should be stamped in accordance with the law. Notice to all member stores of the guilds: It is approved by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in the letter Hu Zhi Si Zi No. 218 of the 18th of this month, which states that the Ministry of Finance and Direct Taxation Office issued Instruction No. 16822 of Jing San Zi, stating that shipping deeds and delivery orders of transportation agencies should be stamped separately by the issuers in accordance with Item 21 of the Stamp Tax Rate Table. In addition, bills issued for meals, dishes, and beverages sold on ships and trains should also be stamped in accordance with Item 3 of the Tax Rate Table. It is reported that the issuers of the above-mentioned documents have mostly failed to stamp them in accordance with the law, and the stamp inspection and sampling personnel in various places have also neglected to check them at any time, resulting in a huge amount of stamp tax evasion, which is very wrong. In addition to separate orders, it is necessary to order the bureau to quickly transfer it to its subordinate agencies and strictly investigate it at any time and place, and to report the inspection situation in accordance with the regulations. This order, etc., should be complied with, in addition to separate letters, the corresponding letter reaches, that is, I hope your guild will check it.

### Social Service - Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life

Everyone Practiced Thrift During the Spring Festival, Saving More People Brings Great Fortune

Yesterday, this column published an appeal for the people who are lonely, widowed, poor, and sick, hoping that everyone would save as much as possible during the Spring Festival and help the poor compatriots as much as possible, so that they can get some help in this season of snow and severe cold. Although there are so many poor compatriots and our strength is so weak, I believe that as long as everyone works together and enthusiastically contributes, we can definitely accumulate a considerable amount, and at the same time enable more suffering compatriots to receive assistance. As the ancient saying goes, "Many grains of sand form a pagoda, and many furs make a coat." No matter what the matter is, as long as we gather the strength of the masses to do it, it will never fail. Now we only need to adhere to the purpose of "donate one more penny, save one more life," eliminate all unnecessary expenses, and donate the money saved to our poor compatriots. The so-called "giving charcoal in the snow" is exactly what it means. At the same time, I think the compatriots who receive alms will definitely express their heartfelt thanks.

### Charitable Relief

Taking 110,000 from New Year's money to donate to your column for the purpose of helping the poor and sick, the amount is small, but I hope to use it as a brick to attract jade, hoping that all the

Dear Editor: During the Lunar New Year, we children could not avoid the custom of paying New Year's greetings, eating candies, receiving New Year's money, etc. It would be really meaningless to waste New Year's money at will. Recently, the weather has been very cold. We are full, warm, and dressed, and our hands and feet are still stiff and cold at home. Thinking of those suffering compatriots who have no food or clothing, I don't know how much pain they are in! We four brothers and sisters would rather that all the children in Shanghai and even China can take out a part of their New Year's money, then the suffering compatriots will definitely receive great help and comfort. I wish you good health! Xia Zhiyu, Zhiguang, Zhiyun, Zhiyao. Bow.

### Inspecting Cotton Yarn Quality - Textile Control Passed Sampling Method

And Urge Each Yarn Factory to Report Finished Products for Purchase - Purchase of Foreign Cotton is Limited to 20 Count and Above Cotton Yarn

[Report from our newspaper] The 21st regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held in the city government conference room at 10:00 AM yesterday. The attendees were Wu,兼 Chairman, Li,副 Chairman, and committee members Shu Yunchang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, and Liu Wenteng, the director of the Textile Control Committee's business office. The attendees were Fang Dong, the director of the Goods Tax Bureau, and Rong Yixin. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

There were three important motions: (1) Urging each yarn factory to quickly report the number of finished products that should be purchased by the government. The Textile Control Committee has issued a yarn factory daily report and a weekly cotton yarn sales notice, but each yarn factory has not yet filled it out, so the committee cannot issue a notice of approval and entrustment to purchase cotton yarn based on the verification. It is now decided to ask the factory personnel stationed in each yarn factory by the Goods Tax Bureau to urge each factory to quickly fill out and report the production situation from January 1 of this year to the present. (2) Each yarn factory, regardless of its size, must be limited to spinning 20 count and above cotton yarn if it wants to purchase foreign cotton. At the same time, it must allocate half of the finished product to the government for purchase in accordance with the cotton yarn purchase method set by the committee. The quality of the finished product must meet the predetermined inspection standards, otherwise, the purchase price will be proportionally reduced. (3) Passed the seven articles of the cotton yarn quality inspection sampling method and decided to implement it from the 27th of this month. The items are listed as follows:

Article 1: The quality inspection of cotton yarn produced by each factory shall be organized by the committee.

Article 2: Each time a cotton yarn quality inspection is conducted, the committee will send personnel to each factory to take yarn samples in accordance with the prescribed method, seal them, and bring them to the committee for inspection.

Article 3: The method for taking yarn samples from each factory is listed below: (A) In the fine yarn room of each factory that spins each brand of yarn count, the sampling personnel shall randomly select 20 yarn tubes from each car for testing, such as raw yarn weight, tension, evenness, twist, and moisture. (B) In the packaging room of each factory, the sampling personnel shall randomly select one skein of light and heavy yarn from each brand and count of cotton yarn (i.e., 10 Hank) for inspecting length and skein content. (C) In the packaging room of each factory, the sampling personnel shall randomly select one pile (i.e., ten pounds) from each brand and count of finished yarn for testing color and packaging.

Article 4: After all the yarn samples are collected, the sampling personnel shall mark the brand number at any time, and ask each factory to assist in packaging, packing, and sealing the box, and at the same time ask the person in charge of the factory to sign the seal on the box to ensure caution.

Article 5: The seal shall be prepared by the committee.

Article 6: The method for inspecting cotton yarn quality shall be formulated and implemented separately.

Article 7: If there are any shortcomings in this method, it may be submitted to the committee meeting at any time for resolution and modification.

### Import and Export Industry Forms Arbitration Committee - Hires Consuls from Various Countries as Advisors

The Import and Export Industry Association previously decided to form an arbitration committee at a joint meeting of directors and supervisors.

According to the person in charge of the association, the committee is set up specifically to mediate all disputes in international trade, so as to avoid unexpected losses to members.

The price opened was slightly higher than last year. Foreign pine was quite stable because the application was not issued, and fir slightly increased.

### Gold Price of Jewelry in Silver Shops - Must Not Exceed 20,000 Beyond the Allotted Price

[Report from our newspaper] The responsible authority of the Central Bank stated that the silver shops in this city raised the listed price of jewelry to 440,000 yuan per tael on Lunar New Year's Eve. In fact, the highest distribution price of the Central Bank on that day was only 400,300 yuan per tael for the 10条, and most of the others were distributed within 400,000 yuan. It is evident that the silver shops are suspected of raising prices for profit. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated, limiting the listed price of jewelry in each silver shop to not exceed 20,000 yuan beyond the distribution price of the Central Bank.

### Impacted by Stable Gold Prices: Chinese Stocks are all Flourishing

The Chinese general issues were sluggish yesterday but then improved; the small issues even more so. Yong Shas and “Bo” (likely a typo of “Bu” 簿) stocks reached new highs. Initially, the market opened lower due to weakness in the gold market. After the opening, apart from the futures market, issues 91, 104, 44, and 97 immediately purchased cash Yong Shas, while issues 85, 232, 155, and 97 also purchased forward Yong Shas, pushing the forward Yong Sha price up to 844 yuan. The futures market was posted by financial firms issues 45 and 220, etc. The Yong Sha posting price was between 21 and 22 yuan, equivalent to a daily interest rate of about 1.8 cents. Issue 198 sold, while issues 156 and 231 cashed out Yong Shas, causing a temporary drop of 10 yuan. Issues 232, 155, and 89 continued to purchase, and issues 35, 224, 14, and 97 repeatedly purchased cash Yong Shas. Near noon, the overall price rose sharply, with forward Yong Shas rising to 860 yuan. New Asia once hit the limit up. Issue 145 had high supply and fell back slightly. In the end, Yong Shas closed slightly higher than the previous closing price. Xinhe, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose more than half a percent, while Huafeng and Meiya rose more than one and a half percent. In the forward market, Yong Shas, Meiya, and Xinguang each rose more than half a percent, and Huafeng rose one and a half percent. Cold stocks continued to rise slightly. Off-market, various stocks were quoting for old-tier year-end prices.

### Central Bank Distributes Over Two Thousand Bars: Gold Price Ultimately Rises by Ten Thousand

Raw gold was quite stable yesterday. Although the Central Bank supplied, it was difficult to satisfy buying appetite. It initially fell low and then rose high. The morning opening saw prices as low as 4.04 million yuan for sale. Later, due to pressure and supply relationships, it once fell to around 3.95 million yuan. The Central Bank immediately distributed 2392 bars at this price. Subsequently, buyers and those with surplus funds searched, and the supply source decreased, gradually rebounding. At noon, it once rose to over 4.1 million yuan, resulting in a rise of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the Central Bank's restriction that silver shops could only add 20,000 yuan to the allocated gold, yesterday's price for jewelry gold was 415,000 yuan. Silver was still stable. Money exchange businesses had not yet opened. Foreign currency quotations had no significant changes. The Hong Kong exchange rate also had supply at 1340 yuan, with an implied interest rate of about 1.5 cents?

### Autumn Silk Purchase Begins: Simple Procedures, Purchase Upon Arrival

After the autumn silk cost was verified and approved by President Song, the Central Bank, in order to provide relief to silk manufacturers for the Spring Festival settlement and to deduct various loan arrears, notified the Autumn Cocoon Loan Administration Office and the China Trust Bureau and the China Agricultural Bank on the 21st at 2 PM to begin purchasing. On the first day, a total of 275 loads of autumn silk and mixed spring silk were purchased. In the past two days, another 200 loads were purchased. According to Sun Bohe, Director of the Autumn Cocoon Loan Administration Office, the estimated output of autumn silk and mixed dried spring silk in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in the 35th year is about 3,000 loads. Of these, 660 loads of autumn silk and 225 loads of mixed dried spring silk have been reeled and passed inspection. The rest are currently being reeled, inspected, and transported. The procedures for purchasing autumn silk this time are simplified for convenience: purchase is done upon arrival, and there is no specified date for remittance. When silk manufacturers want to sell, they can receive payment by presenting a warehouse receipt from the Loan Administration Office to the China Trust Bureau. It is expected that this work will be completed in no more than a month.

### China Trust to Establish Tea Evaluation Committee: Decides to Purchase Tea for Export

Tea Collection Limited to Shipment to Shanghai Before the End of This Month

The issue of collecting tea leaves for export in this city had been requested by tea merchants to be held before the Lunar New Year so they could get through the New Year. But for various reasons, this was not realized. In order to relieve merchants and the people, the government is handling the acceptance of drafts through the China Agricultural Bank so tea merchants can barely get by with difficulty. According to personnel responsible for this matter at the China Trust Bureau, it has now been decided to adopt the method of the former China Agricultural Corporation for purchasing tea leaves. The tea evaluation committee will be established soon. In addition to the designated personnel participating, two foreign businessmen will be hired as consultants. The purchase of tea leaves is limited to those shipped to Shanghai before the end of this month. The evaluation work will begin at the latest at the beginning of next month.

### A Large Amount of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Report] A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai at the end of the Lunar New Year.

The ship sailed on December 21 of last year and returned to Shanghai this Monday (20th). It is currently docked at buoys 7 and 8 for unloading and transfer.

### Speaker Pan's Opinion: Private School Tuition Issues Should be Legally Resolved; Resolutions Cannot be Changed Except by Submitting for Reconsideration According to Law

Private primary and secondary school principals and teachers in this city published advertisements in newspapers yesterday, issuing declarations stating that the City Council's resolution setting the tuition fees for private schools in the 36th year at 130,000 yuan for primary schools, 170,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 220,000 yuan for senior high schools was an arbitrary regulation that disregards the livelihoods of teachers. The reporter interviewed City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan specifically about this matter, asking for his opinion. According to his response: This case was submitted for discussion by the municipal government. All cases submitted by the mayor should be discussed and voted on according to law by the City Council. All resolutions are decided by the majority. This is the general practice of parliaments in democratic countries. The case was discussed for two days, and the proceedings were reported in the newspapers. It was not easy to pass with an addition. This is a fact witnessed by councilors from the teaching profession and reporters present. To say that it is an arbitrary regulation that disregards the livelihoods of teachers is probably not entirely true. Teachers' lives are hard, and parents bear a heavy burden. It is difficult to satisfy both parties. In recent years, prices have risen continuously. Although running schools is difficult, if the private school economy is absolutely transparent and fully subject to legal supervision by the government, how can the true difficult situation be understood by everyone? I believe it will be more likely to gain the support of parents and the sympathy of society. As for whether the resolutions of the City Council should be complied with, it is the responsibility of the government. If there are obstacles, there is no other way to change it except to submit it for reconsideration according to law. There are many eloquent people in our education field, and I sincerely hope that they can be calm and seek a legal solution to the problem.

### Private School Teachers in this City to Petition the Council Tomorrow

Demanding Increased Education Funding

Representatives of private primary and secondary school teachers in this city are scheduled to petition the City Council, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau tomorrow (27th) morning, demanding improved teacher treatment, increased education funding in the city, accounting for 35% of the city budget, and subsidizing private school teachers with half of the funds. It is said that students in private schools account for 85% of middle school students and 67% of primary school students in this city, but the current subsidy for private schools is only 3%, which has not yet been distributed.

### Dr. Zhu Kezhen Discusses: Chinese Students Lack Practical Experience; Advocates Integrating Mind and Hand to Seek Practicality

[UK News Agency, London, 24th] Dr. Zhu Kezhen, the Chinese representative attending the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and President of National Zhejiang University, has arrived in London, visiting renowned British educational institutions and professional personnel. The reporter recently visited President Zhu during his travels and received the following statement: I was born in 1890 and studied geology and metallurgy at Tangshan Engineering College, Harvard University, and the University of Illinois. However, decades of educational experience have led me to believe that current higher education should emphasize practicality and reduce empty talk about systems. There is too much specialization in today's education law, so Chinese students only know theory and lack practical experience after returning to the country. This is a major educational crisis. In other words, students lack a basic education and cannot integrate mind and hand. Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to attend the UNESCO conference to come to England and observe the general British education law for comparison. I believe that too much compartmentalized education cannot raise today's living standards in China. The result may be that there are books. As for the educational institutions in England, although Oxford and Cambridge Universities are too classical, they attach great importance to practical education. I initially saw that ordinary schools in England lacked equipment, but this also has its advantages, because students must use both mind and hand to seek knowledge. Conversely, if everything must rely on machines, then mind and hand cannot develop simultaneously.

### Student Unrest at Wuhan University Subsides: All Classes to Resume Tomorrow

[Our Report from Hankou, 25th] The student unrest at Wuhan University has, in fact, been quelled since the Student Self-Government Association issued a public letter. In order to seek a thorough solution, the association, with the consent of the majority of students on Lunar New Year's Eve, sent representatives to meet with President Zhou, expressing a firm desire to retain him. Zhou has agreed to consider and announced to students that classes will resume on the 24th, pending resolution by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, some students have already started classes today, and all classes should resume on the 27th. However, the requested demobilization subsidy for students remains unresolved.

### It will be Difficult to Add Grades to Municipal National Schools this Semester

Because the City Budget has not yet been Decided

The budget for the 36th year has not yet been approved by the City Council. The Accounting Department of the Municipal Government has notified all departments that expenses can only be handled according to the budget for the 35th year. New projects will be postponed for the time being. Therefore, it will be difficult to add grades to municipal national schools this semester. It is reported that local people in various suburban districts have independently prepared school buildings and school supplies and requested the Education Bureau to open national schools. There are already more than 20 schools. More than 100 grades have been requested to be added to various central national schools and Bao national schools, but due to budget constraints, they cannot be established or added. However, on the school side, because the number of applicants is unusually crowded, maintaining the original state of the 35th year is impossible. It is reported that some principals will go to the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Government, and the City Council to petition separately, so that the school can decide to add grades before the start of school to accommodate out-of-school children.

### Rockefeller Foundation Allocates Final Donation to Assist Peiping Union Medical College

[US News Agency, Washington, 24th] The Rockefeller Foundation recently announced a final donation of $10 million to the China Medical Board to support Peiping Union Medical College.

Fosdick, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation, wrote to Pack, Chairman of the China Medical Board, citing the "great achievements" of Peiping Union Medical College, stating: "The Foundation takes the opportunity of making this final donation to rededicate the College to a new generation in China, confident that the light that has emanated from the College in modern medicine will not be allowed to dim."

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th] The provincial government believes that the restoration of the National Northwest Library in Lanzhou is of great importance to Northwest culture. After convening relevant agencies for a meeting, it was decided to use Zhongzheng Park as the site of the library.

### Zuo Shunsheng Suggests that the Authorities Establish Constitutional Lectures in all Schools

[Our Report] It is reported that Zuo Shunsheng suggested to Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, and others during his time in Beijing that constitutional lectures should be universally established in universities. Chinese political scholars should lecture on the content of our constitution and the history of constitutionalism in order to enhance young people's correct understanding of the constitution and not be misled by propaganda. At the same time, constitutional courses should also be added in middle schools so that students can understand the foundation of the country. Zuo also pointed out that French children aged twelve already have declarations of human rights in their textbooks, which is something that our country should emulate. It is said that Zhang, Chen, and Wu all expressed their agreement.

### National School Burnt Down: Wu Changyun Selects Site for Reconstruction

The National School on Shaanxi North Road (i.e., Seymour Road) in this city was burned down on the 22nd of this month due to a fire in a neighboring house. Education Bureau Director Gu has submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which has been approved, to select a site for the construction of a school building as a model for celebrating the birthday of the school's founder. Mayor Wu has personally indicated his permission. It is also reported that the Education Bureau has sent personnel to consult with the Land Administration Bureau to allocate a public land within the 12th district for the construction of the school. Once the school building design is decided, they will contact the Public Works Bureau to discuss construction methods. The cost is around 200 million yuan.

Enrollment for new students in junior and senior high school has already begun. There are not many places left in the elementary school and kindergarten departments.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Ends in a Draw Yesterday: Score 0-0, Neither Side Scores; Li Huitang Misses Penalty Kick

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 25th] The Hong Kong-Shanghai interport football match was held here today. At the end of the match, neither side had scored, and the match was not extended due to darkness. Shanghai goalkeeper Zhang Bangyao was the hero of the entire match, saving many dangerous shots. Otherwise, the Shanghai team would have suffered a crushing defeat. During the match, the ball often hovered in the Shanghai team's area. The Hong Kong team's forwards repeatedly broke through the defense line, but were all saved by the goalkeeper. Hong Kong center forward Li Huitang's penalty kick hit Zhang Banglun's palm and did not go into the net. Afterwards, Li said that he did not know why he could not control the ball. However, the general audience knew that Li thought the ball was questionable and deliberately did not kick it in. During the match, two shots that were sure to score hit the Shanghai team's goalposts and bounced out.

### Basketball League Resumes After Holiday: All Black to Fight Giant Today; Green Team vs. Qianghua in Women's Group

The Second Basketball League had been closed for a week due to the Lunar New Year. The holiday has now passed. Starting at 5:30 PM today, three matches in the men's and women's groups will continue to be held at the Municipal Gymnasium.

The opening act will be a meeting of the women's group, where the Green Team will meet Qianghua. The Green Team has won two consecutive victories and is showing great momentum. Although Qianghua, under the guidance of Lin Weicong, has up-and-coming young players such as Jiang Meiying, Cao Suzhen, Xi Manying, and Cao Manzhu, it is feared that they will still be difficult to resist.

The second match, in Group B of the second division, will be between Green Forest and Team V. The former took the Indian Fanjiang team in the first match and has young players such as Shu Jiayi, Wang Jieping, Chen Zhengsen, and Ye Yunshan. Team V's ball skills are quite impressive, and there will definitely be a dramatic performance.

The headlining match will be in Group A, where Giant will face All Black. All Black has rebuilt its strength this year, but today is only its first match. However, the team's main player Jia Youliang is on a trip to Hong Kong with the interport football team, and it is difficult to gather the team members, so it may be possible to withdraw from the game. However, in order to maintain the spirit of sports, the victory or defeat is not important, and they will try their best to participate. The order of each match is recorded later:

Green Team - Qianghua (Women) 5:30 PM

Green Forest - Team V (Group B) 6:30 PM

Giant - All Black (Group A) 7:30 PM

### Facing Up to Our Nation's Drama

— Xiang Peiliang

Unexpectedly, my letter was published by the editors of this journal. It was merely a private letter, only briefly mentioning certain facts, so naturally it was not very detailed. Now that it has been published, I feel compelled to say a few more words. I have no intention of criticizing Mr. Xuan, but I simply lament that our nation's drama is either blindly praised, blindly attacked, or carelessly handled with irresponsible writing, leading to misinterpretations. Our nation's drama has a history of about seven hundred years, with countless works left behind, and has now diversified into dozens of different forms. Such a huge thing cannot be casually dealt with. Its advantages, disadvantages, strengths, and weaknesses are worth discussing in detail. I will first put forward three points as the basis for the following explanation.

(1) Music is an extremely important element in our nation's drama, or rather, singing is an extremely important element. In various dramas today, from Kunqu Opera (which is actually just a type of singing) to Chu Opera, Yue Opera, and Peking Opera (these are some of the most recently developed dramas, popular for no more than twenty or even a few years), the biggest difference lies only in the singing style, while the script, performance, and stage conditions (including costumes) are only secondary factors. However, the gradual separation of drama from music and its independence is a definite trend, so our nation's drama has reached a point where reform is imperative.

(2) However, the scope of drama is extremely broad, and it is never permissible to stubbornly negate the rest based on a viewpoint of a certain point. From ancient Greece to modern European and American works, there have been many changes. Judging Shakespeare, medieval mystery plays, Aristophanes, or even Molière by the standards of modern drama would be incompatible. But one must objectively admit that these are all dramas, no matter how different they may appear. One must also objectively admit that "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Autumn in the Han Palace," and others have the same value as "A Doll's House," "Hamlet," and "Antigone."

(3) Art must always start from the history and culture of one's own nation. Relying solely on foreign things will never take deep root. Based on my experience of performing in folk dramas for more than six years, I can say that purely Western-style spoken drama does not suit our people very well. We must learn from our own original drama, eliminate the inferior and preserve the superior, and re-create a national form of drama.

However, this is too distant an ideal to be discussed for the moment. At present, I hope to study foreign dramas more accurately, and at the same time, study our own more accurately. First, figure out what this is all about, and then talk about other things. Even if it is thought that it must be abolished, the verdict must be made at that time.

Currently, regarding our nation's drama, only the history of the development of opera music is generally clear. (But I hope that many facts that have already been clarified and determined will not be confused again.) Although there are still some details that have not been determined, they are not major problems. However, there are many other important issues about which we know almost nothing. For example, in terms of scripts, only literary value (including the rules of composition) is studied. But no one has asked about the basic concepts and main methods of structural form for handling content. In terms of form, some places differ from the West, such as the complete disregard for time and space, the lack of conflict between characters, the indistinguishability of tragedy and comedy, and the lengthy forty or fifty act annotations, etc. Very few people pay attention to the development process of theaters and performances, and no one studies the more than thirty existing local operas (which are rich materials).

There are many questions for which I urgently want to know the answers; however, I have neither the academic ability nor the knowledge, and I have not read any texts discussing these questions. Looking around, I can't help but feel melancholy. For example, Lü Tiancheng, Li Yu, and others' theories on playwriting are extremely precise and pay great attention to the stage. Why is the stage performance of our nation's drama not very significant, and why can't Ruan and Li's works be listed alongside Gao, Tang, Kong, and Hong's Yuan drama? The themes of Southern drama before the Ming Dynasty were extremely broad, why did they focus entirely on talented scholars and beautiful ladies after the Ming Dynasty? Guan Hanqing and Huang Jieyuan were about the same age, between them, that is, between Zaju drama and Zhugongdiao, were there any transitional works? Kunqu Opera flourished for about two hundred and fifty years, from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, why was it overthrown by the more primitive Luan Tan in terms of script, performance, and singing? Is there a certain general rule for the rise and fall of various dramas? And the rise and fall between various dramas are almost all regressive, that is, the more primitive ones overthrow the more complete ones in terms of technique, why? Various local operas, especially minor operas, such as the aforementioned Chu Opera, etc., have a very large audience, what are their advantages? European mystery plays are quite similar to our nation's drama, but they are probably more immature, why do they each have different developments? Music is originally extremely important, can it be reformed? And so on.

Therefore, I hope to face up to our nation's drama. To attack it, we must find the real shortcomings, and we cannot criticize it based on the standards of modern Western drama, saying that there are no lights or sets. Nor can we list certain dramas as having feudal thoughts or being obscene and thieving. Because scenery and lighting are not necessary elements of drama, and we cannot generalize to the entire drama. To praise it, we must find the real advantages, and we cannot fill it with face paint, posture, singing skills, etc. Because these either belong to the actors or are irrelevant to the whole. As for saying how wonderful Wang Shifu's structure is, it is only meant to fool foreign laymen.

I hope that someone will first start with solid material work, and gradually progress to finally understand what our Chinese drama is. In order to allow them to start calmly, I also hope that people who have no intention of pursuing this path will not interfere at all.

June of the thirty-first year, Zhunti Nunnery in Suzhou

At this time, on the contrary, Xu Hui, trapped in Shanghai, which had fallen into enemy hands, not only lost contact with Daojun, but her situation deteriorated and she had to apply for a job as a female employee at Hongkang Company, but she was not hired because she was married, so she had to change her job again and become a tutor in the family of the traitor Lu Zhiming, but Lu was fired by his wife in anger.

As a result, the lives of their mother and daughter were plunged into panic, and they had no choice but to sell their meager furniture and move into a complex neighborhood in a working-class district. Their neighbors included a dancer and the head of the dance hall who lived off the dancer, as well as a crazy old man who thought of his son all day long, and the mother and son of a rickshaw puller named A Gen, who depended on each other for life.

The Pacific War broke out, and the enemy occupied the entire city of Shanghai. News from the mainland was even more impossible to find. Xu Hui struggled to support the livelihood of herself and her beloved daughter while anxiously worrying about Daojun and Li Jiecheng, who had gone to the battlefield together. At this time, Li Jiecheng was sent to Shanghai to carry out a secret mission. In one chase by enemy and puppet detectives, he accidentally encountered Xu Hui. Xu hid him in her home to heal his wounds and asked him about Daojun's whereabouts. Li Jiecheng could not answer either, as he and Daojun had also been separated for five or six years.

Xu Hui and her daughter continued to live in poverty. In these long and miserable months, only the friendship of A Gen and A Gen's mother, the rickshaw pullers who were infatuated with Xiaoling, and Li Jiecheng, was their only warmth!

Victory brought joy to people, but it also brought disaster. Many families were celebrating family reunions, but Daojun's news was still nowhere to be found. An even greater misfortune befell them: the yarn factory where Xiaoling worked to support her family told her mother that they were no longer hiring people, so Xiaoling, who was so worried about her mother, decided to take the last way out and go to her "good neighbor" Qiu Daban, relying on her singing career to survive. She returned home every night at midnight, and concealed the truth from her sick mother, saying that the yarn factory was only operating half-time.

After the victory, Daojun was recommended by a certain prominent person and honorably assumed the beautiful position of receiving official, changing his name to Lin Chuanxin and being sent to Shanghai. He was warmly welcomed by all parties, especially the traitor Lu Zhiming, who claimed to be an underground worker and flattered him. Daojun had also asked people to inquire about Xu Hui's whereabouts at his former residence, but he never obtained accurate information, and soon put it behind him, indulging himself in the pleasure of brothels all day long.

In a certain dance hall, he happened to meet the graceful and talented red dancer Aina, who was Xiaoling. Father and daughter met, and in the confusion of "seeming to know each other but not meeting", they fell in love at first sight.

On Christmas night, all the dance halls were open all night. Aina was reluctantly kept by Daojun. When she returned home at dawn, she ran into her mother, who had been waiting at the door for a long time. Xu Hui discovered Xiaoling's secret and severely reprimanded her, warning her that her father was a patriotic and honorable man, and that she would rather die than have her daughter engage in this occupation. From then on, Xiaoling disappeared from the dance halls.

Daojun did not see Aina for several days, so he asked Qiu Daban to bring a note to invite her to meet at a certain restaurant. The girl, who had been stirred by his charm, was also deeply in love with the affectionate and wealthy guest, and went to the restaurant as promised. Xu Hui saw the note left by Xiaoling and followed her. She saw the dancer in love with her daughter, who was also her husband Lin Daojun, whom she had missed day and night for eight years.

After this unbearable stimulation, Xu Hui's illness turned terminal and she was bedridden. Li Jiecheng arrived and happily told her that he had found out where Daojun lived. Xiaoling was overjoyed and wanted to go with Li Jiecheng to see him, but Xu Hui suddenly stopped them loudly. The two did not know why. After repeatedly asking, Xu Hui smiled bitterly and did not answer. She really did not want to tell her daughter the truth.

While Xiaoling was out buying medicine, Daojun came again to invite her. He happened to meet Xu Hui, who was about to die. Daojun was speechless and could not explain himself. He only told her not to spread the word, for the sake of his current reputation and status. Xu Hui was disappointed by his ingratitude and hated this incestuous disaster, so she angrily beat and drove Lin out.

On a stormy night, Xu Hui passed away. Xiaoling heard her mother's dying words and suddenly realized that the dancer she was infatuated with was her own father. Xiaoling was filled with shame and indignation and was so grief-stricken that she wanted to die. After Li Jiecheng's sincere persuasion, she left with Li to pursue a new life far away.

When Daojun, after thinking carefully, rushed to regret, the place was empty, as if light smoke had disappeared with the wind.

### The Story of "Returning Home in Glory"

— Gu Eryi

In 1937, Lin Daojun, a middle school teacher in Shanghai, and his wife, Xu Hui, an elementary school teacher, and their nine-year-old daughter, Xiaoling, were living a happy, sweet, and leisurely life. Unfortunately, the "August 13th" artillery fire rang out, and the flames of aggression burned Shanghai and most of the country. Lin Daojun, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, although it was Xiaoling's birthday celebration, resolutely left his beloved wife and daughter and went with his friend Li Jiecheng to the mainland to participate in the sacred task of defending the motherland.

In a fit of anger, they embarked on the journey and joined the rescue work in the war zone, going in and out of the artillery fire. Daojun was used to a quiet life and could not bear the hardship. Using the excuse that the work in the front and rear was equally important, he bid farewell to his comrades-in-arms and withdrew from the front line alone, heading towards the wartime capital.

The difficulty of finding a job in Chongqing made Daojun, who was unfamiliar with the place, feel trapped. Finally, he was forced to go to his only old friend, Wu Boxian, whom he did not want to see.

Wu Boxian was the manager of Sanjiang Trading Company. Under Wu's cold demeanor, he ordered Daojun to be an automobile parts salesman. Daojun had no choice but to make a decision to go on the opposite path after repeated consideration.

From then on, Daojun went smoothly, rising from a salesman to a householder, and then soaring to become the general manager of Jiufeng Enterprise Company. Even Gao Liqin, the socialite who used to give Daojun the cold shoulder, was transferred to Daojun by Wu Boxian as if she were goods.

### "Spring Dream in Heaven"

— Xu Changlin

Engineer Ding Jianhua was leading workers to build an airfield on the front line to cooperate with the National Army's counter-offensive. Someone rushed from a county town dozens of miles away from the airfield to Ding and others' work site, telling them the news of Japan's unconditional surrender, and showing them the news published in the newspaper. After reading it, Ding and others were overjoyed and celebrated with each other.

Ding rushed home to tell his wife, Shulan, who was preparing snacks for Jianhua, because she was three months pregnant and was having morning sickness. When she heard the news of the victory, the husband and wife were both unusually excited, and they planned a sweet family life after the war in the room. Ding also showed his wife the drawings of a beautifully designed house that he had completed a long time ago, as if they were already living in it.

Soon, Jianhua and his wife returned to Shanghai. Ding had an old mother living with a distant relative somewhere. When Jianhua first arrived in Shanghai, he also lived there temporarily. There were several manufacturers who had ingratiated themselves with the enemy by providing them with materials during the fall of Shanghai, and thus became rich. After the victory, because they had not been noticed, they were able to get away with it and used their money to make friends widely. Seeing that Ding Jianhua came from the rear, they were very friendly at first, but gradually saw that Ding had no connections and had already made friends with powerful people, and wanted to use his house to entertain distinguished guests, so they forced Ding and others to move out. Ding went everywhere to find a house, but because the transfer fees were huge and he had no gold bars, he had no place to live for a long time. Ding thought to himself that he had spent his whole life building huge mansions that stood towering before his eyes, but he had nowhere to shelter from the wind and rain, and he was living in a small room under the eaves of an ancestral hall, and he was extremely sad.

Shulan was about to give birth, and Jianhua had been running around for several weeks and was still unemployed. Moreover, his old mother was overworked and was also bedridden and seriously ill. At this point, Ding was utterly despondent and extremely grieved. He used his remaining money to get drunk and staggered home in the rain. Just then, the mansion was brightly lit with lanterns, and there was singing and dancing. The guards suspected that Ding was a thief and beat him. The matter was learned by the master, who saw the architectural drawings designed by Ding and loved their beauty very much, and wanted to hire him, because Gong Zheng was deeply in love with a socialite and planned to build a golden house to hide her.

Shulan gave birth to a son, but she was unable to raise him, and discussed it with Ding, planning to abandon him in an orphanage. The matter was known to Gong, who had been involved in the world of pleasure in his early years and had been too injured, so his wife and concubines had no children. He asked Ding to raise him as an adopted son, and paid Ding a certain price. Ding agreed, because the delivery fees had not yet been settled, but Gong repeatedly warned Ding and others not to leak this matter.

Gong's wife hated this child very much. One day, Gong's wife abused the child at will because it was not her own. Shulan's heart ached for her child, as if it were being cut with a knife, so she stood up and interfered angrily. Gong's wife then learned that this baby was Ding's own flesh and blood, and quarreled with Shulan, so she returned the baby to his neighbors.

Ding and his wife decided to leave Gong's house in this situation, but they had nowhere to stay, so they temporarily lived under the eaves of his mansion. Little did they know that this mansion was the very one that Ding had designed and built back then. Ding's name was left on the foundation stone. When Ding saw it, he was extremely grieved, so he sneaked into the mansion to caress his hard work, climbed the stairs to the top of the fifty-odd story mansion, and thought that he was an architect, but his family had nowhere to shelter from the wind and rain, and he was extremely depressed. Suddenly, he heard voices from the ground and looked down, and it was the doorman of the mansion scolding his wife and telling her to leave. Ding was furious, but he could not support his strength and suddenly lost his footing and fell. When the crowd went to rescue him, he was already dying. The police found the architect's certificate that had fallen from his body and realized that Ding was the past architect of the mansion. The passers-by were all extremely saddened.

### Random Talks About New Films

— Ma Bochang

"Tonight and Every Night"

It is not the fire tree and silver flower containing Xingqiao Town that opens, but London at night under the big bombing. On the streets without lights, lovers walk home hand in hand. Where the fire rises, the home is left with ruins. There are also young men and women indulging in taverns. Warm feelings are not fully expressed, and a piece of smoke, they are all forever silent. This is a catastrophe, but only at this critical moment of life and death do people understand how much love is desired in a short life. Therefore, in the car, they are insatiable for sweet kisses. I believe that the story of "Tonight and Every Night" is more beautiful than other New Year's song and dance films, and more complete than "Cover Girl", although it does not have the dazzling tricks of "Cover Girl". Among several song and dance scenes, I especially appreciate "Lonely Crying". The color matching of clothes and the mask set are extremely harmonious, including the symbolic meaning unique to ballet. The scene of "Women Soldiers in the Same Camp" wearing sanitary shirts is full of curves. As a comparison, Jenny Bland seems to be slimmer, belonging to the "girlish type", while Rita Hayworth is plump and already a woman's body. Rita's singing and dancing are regarded by Columbia as a cash cow. Her dancing skills sometimes surpass Betty Ireland of Fox, but the sex appeal is as sweet as Betty. Lee Bowman with a small mustache is full of romance, and can be called a second Melvin Douglas. Jane Darwell is more charming than before. Her performance in "My Favorite Brunette" and "Romance on the High Seas" is naturally not as good. Marc Platt's dance is indeed a genius. Hitler's arrogance is expressed without regret. It can be combined with the Nazi salute in "Air Force" as a double masterpiece.

"Diamond Horseshoe"

A song and dance stage is built in the West, or it is the world of Ye Feng and Dai Carlo. The charm of her "The Gay Senorita" dance is still lingering. Carmen Miranda's world is an island in the Pacific. In the Lishang Salon, the lights are shining. Under the palm trees, the songs are passed on one by one. Mary Montan imitates Dong Shi, but she is not her opponent. When she arrives in the West and performs in a dance hall, the time, place, and people are all inconvenient. Wearing a black veil and singing a song alone, the lights are bright and there are people all around, without any sentimentality, enough to set off the mystery of the black veil. In the "Indian Girl" scene, Dorothy Lamour tries her dancing steps for the first time. Without the close-ups of "Tonight and Every Night", the charm is fully displayed. This dance cannot beat the oriental dance of "Desert Song". The women soldiers' dance is also inferior to "Sweet Rosie O'Grady". The chorus of "You Are My Rainbow" while boating on a quiet night is the most moving. The song "Whistling in Broad Daylight" is not good. Compared with Diana Durbin's driving and singing in "Spring Parade", the tempo is just right. Counting it all, as long as Dorothy's smile when she combs her hair is still pleasing. Dick Powell's singing is not weak, but fortunately he can change his style early. The movie "Murder, My Sweet" proves that his transformation has a bright future. Victor Moore is a confused old man, and he is suitable for singing a duet with Laurel and Hardy.

Director George Marshall is mediocre, even inferior to Robert Z. Leonard of "Spring Parade". First, he does not know how to use Dorothy Lamour's characteristics; second, he does not understand the graphic beauty of song and dance scenes. The camera only advances from the front angle, which is sluggish and lacks change; third, he limits the song and dance scene to the interior, missing the wild scenery of Arizona.

"Endless Love"

The ending of "Peach Blossom Pool" is a gray glass door, cold, bare, quiet and silent. The division of time, Yan Hua's figure brushed across the clouds, so slowly, through the bumps on the glass, like teardrops, the dark figure stopped, slowly turned around, still so quiet, so bleak, after a while this figure brushed across the clouds again and disappeared. This scene coincides with the glass door lens of "Waterloo Bridge", but "Peach Blossom Pool" is more pure and heavy, and director He Zhaozhang can be proud of this. The brief and powerful final section of high heels going upstairs in "Endless Love" uses the music of "Madame Butterfly" for dubbing, which is really clever. In such a long story, the small scenes under the eaves of Shanghai during the occupation period are too vague, stained with our past dream demons, retreating together, the wind and sand of the disaster, people only need a kind of warmth, and the dust dream on the drying platform when the air raid sounds is a bit cold, but it is the sweetness in the tears. Compared with after the victory, the light is actually a tragedy. It is a pity that He Zhaozhang only has these two points to commend, the rest are scattered and redundant. There are too many shots of air defense introducing buckets, etc., which are similar to news propaganda films. The singing in no scene is natural, and the garment stars in the set are like dog eyes, which make people laugh and cry. The screenwriter has no center, and the traces of creation are obvious. Only Zhou Xuan is the best, good at warmth and charm, which is more pleasing than her singing. After watching Western films for a long time, I have less affection for domestic films, but I still praise Zhou Xuan. Shu Shi and Huang Wansu, who play blind mothers, are okay, but the faces of Bai Chen and others are not pleasing to the eye.

### Review of "Woman and Peace"

— Ye Lianxun

Before I saw "Woman and Peace," I thought Mr. Li Jianwu was just a writer who could write romantic works like "Isn't It Still Spring" and "Jin Xiaoyu." After I finished reading "Woman and Peace," I felt that Mr. Li Jianwu was not just a mediocre playwright who could only write "hero and beauty" stories, but also a progressive writer who could stand at the forefront of the times, criticize reality, and expose the evils of society.

Chen Baichen's "Lu Guantu" reflects the shadows of political corruption and the self-serving attitude of corrupt officials, but in Mr. Li Jianwu's "Woman and Peace," we see the cruelty of war treating humans as cannon fodder, the tragedy of families being torn apart, the exorbitant taxes and levies under political corruption and economic collapse, and the irrational phenomenon of women being surplus and men being scarce.

"Woman and Peace" has a story that is a myth, but not a beautiful fairy tale. It doesn't intoxicate people in pink fantasies like "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." It is a myth full of vigilance and criticism. This myth makes us think of the horror of war, the boredom of human self-slaughter, the preciousness of peace, and the pitiable and ridiculous "comedy" of harming one's fellow humans, which should be corrected.

Some people say that works like "Woman and Peace" are just works that show off during the low tide of the drama movement. It is not as serious and humane as Chen Baichen's "Wedding March." However, I believe that as long as a playwright denies the corrupt phenomena in society, he can use any means and form to express his themes and plots, because drama is not simply about having a complete form, but mainly about whether the content of the work has a corrective effect on real life. Therefore, although the characters in a work like "Woman and Peace" are not as realistic as the protagonists in "Wedding March" and still carry some mythological colors and the shortcoming of "exaggeration," as long as its content has achieved the task of drama correcting life, we should still say that it is a good play.

Chen Baichen's "Wedding March" only raises a serious question, but he does not solve the problem, while the author of "Woman and Peace," although he also shouts the slogan of striving for peace, he uses the reaction of men to defeat the war god who is addicted to killing. Obviously, the former is just a drama that raises questions, while the latter is a long-established "helmsman." It is undoubtedly "icing on the cake" to have him direct "Woman and Peace," with the balanced positioning and adept techniques. This is definitely not something an ordinary and vulgar director can achieve, especially the grand scene at the end of the third act. It is really not easy to handle this performance in such an orderly manner.

It is worth mentioning the dance and singing, the former's simple and appropriate "drama" movements, and the latter's lyrics that use folk tunes, which bring a lot of intimacy to the audience.

The set design of this play is also quite satisfactory. The set design of the first act uses broken walls to show the destruction of houses after the war. The set design of "Guiren Pass" in the second act uses cartoon techniques to indicate that this is the underworld, and the set design of the last act adds the "shallow scene of the house" constantly rising to show that peace is constantly being built, and the prosperity of the past has been restored. This is quite a set design that matches the "development of the plot."

In terms of actors, Shen Yang's shoemaker is the most successful, with rich rhythm in his lines and a good ability to capture comedic effects. He is really a rare comedic actor. Secondly, Chen Qing's strongman and the chairman of the village also have good achievements.

### What If a Plane Crashes at Sea?

— Xu Shuyuan

Since the four plane crashes of China and Central Airlines, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of passengers, followed by the crash of the Far Eastern Airlines' Luzon Miss, it was fortunate that the Far Eastern Airlines' plane had sea rescue equipment, so only a very small number of passengers died. Since there are so many plane crashes, in wartime, people would definitely be suspicious and say that there were spies sabotaging. Indeed, if someone puts a pinch of sand or sugar in the transmission part of the engine, wouldn't there be a breakdown halfway? Now it doesn't seem that there are spies sabotaging it, so it is either attributed to the poor skills of the pilots, or it is blamed on the bad weather. In short, if the pilots die in a crash, there will be no evidence to prove anything. Weather is also a difficult thing for laymen to understand. Even a wise prosecutor like Bao Xiaosu would not be able to catch the god of weather and interrogate him.

Passengers inevitably become suspicious of planes and have a tiger-talking-about-color attitude. In fact, air transport is very safe if it is properly managed. Taking the Luzon Miss crash at sea as an example, because it was handled properly, the sacrifice was minimal. If it had been another airline, wouldn't all the passengers have been unjustly drowned at the bottom of the sea? We must not doubt the safety of all airlines and all planes because one or two airlines are not properly managed, and therefore give up the right to fly. However, before getting on a plane, we must understand the emergency steps in the event of an accident. Passengers on foreign planes that fly over the sea have a life jacket. When using it, pull out the bolt, and the compressed gas will fill the life jacket. It can't sink in the sea. There are two rubber lifeboats in the overhead compartment of the plane, with oars, radio transmitters, shotguns, fishing hooks, and sufficient supplies of food and medicine. When the plane malfunctions, the pilot issues a notice or alarm to abandon the plane. Passengers must not panic or move around. They must wait until the plane makes a forced landing on the sea. It will probably not sink within one or two minutes. That one or two minutes is enough for all passengers to escape to the wings. The sea is very cold, so people who fly over the sea must wear more cotton clothes. It's great if they are waterproof. The people who reach the wings first will pull out the lifeboats and pull out the bolts. The compressed gas will fill the rubber boats. At that time, the plane will be gradually sinking. The passengers who come out later may jump into the sea and grab the ropes next to the lifeboats. Sometimes the lifeboats are released upside down in a hurry, with the bottom facing up. Then everyone has to find a way to turn it over. The method is for the strong to press down on one side of the boat, so that the other side can be lifted up. Then it can be turned over. The days of drifting on the lifeboat are uncertain, from a few days to forty or fifty days. The prepared food is limited, and at most it can be used for a week. Moreover, it is limited to canned food and other compressed dry food, and there is a small amount of fresh water. The most unbearable things at sea are several. The first is the sunlight during the day, which burns your skin off. Although there is a small awning for use on the lifeboat, it really can't block the ruthless fire. The second thing caused by the heat is thirst. At first, there is still fresh water for drinking, but when the fresh water is used up, you have to wait for the rain from the sky, but this kind of expectation is not certain. No matter how thirsty you are, you must not drink seawater, which will make you even more thirsty. Some passengers are so thirsty that they would rather jump into the sea and drown. The third thing is hunger. The dry food is extremely limited, and even if it is used sparingly, it will not last for a few days. After that, you have to fish to eat. Sea fish can be eaten raw, according to my flight instructor. He drifted at sea for forty-two days and lived entirely on raw fish. Ordinary people can't live that long at sea. People with bad bodies will die after being soaked in the water for one or two days.

Rather Abandon Treasures, Don't Forget the Radio

When escaping from the plane, don't forget the radio transmitter. Rather lose gold and silver treasures, but be sure to bring the radio transmitter to the rubber boat. The transmitter is a square generator. By shaking a handle, you can generate electricity. Turn the dial to SOS to automatically send out a distress signal. If other planes pass by, shake a small mirror towards the sun to attract the attention of the people on the plane. This method is very effective. In the past, people who made a forced landing in the jungles of Burma were rescued by transmitting signals with a small mirror.

In wartime, the United Kingdom and the United States had rescue teams on the sea, using electric boats, planes, and helicopters to carry out rescue work. Generally, within a few hours of receiving the distress signal, they could send boats and planes to reach the scene of the accident to search for the drifting people. The most ideal rescue tool is a helicopter. It flies close to the sea and hooks the drifting people one by one, which is both easy and fast. China has also bought helicopters, but they have not been used for sea rescue. Machines are to be used by people. No matter how good the machine is, if it is not used properly, it is no different from waste. I don't have too much hope that the civil aviation authorities will have the determination to improve, but I have to enrich my rescue knowledge to seek self-defense.

### Must Insure

— Wen Chi

A few days ago, there were too many accidents in the China and Central Airlines. If all passengers had travel insurance, the insurance company would have to pay a lot of money. I think this kind of insurance business is indeed quite suitable to be promoted. However, I have to declare that I am not soliciting business for any insurance company; some people think that "the dead are dead," what is the point of paying money? This certainly depends on each person's situation. The dead are indeed dead, but some of the dead still have family members who are not dead. The airline also presses down the value of Chinese lives lower than that of foreigners. In my opinion, a protest should be raised. The dead are indeed dead, but we are still Chinese! What? Still everywhere?

However, the airline can still bear a responsibility, compared to other places, it is still a step ahead.

In China's transportation industry, from planes to accidents. For example, a few days ago, there was a big car accident at an intersection. The family members of the dead are still suing Lu Futing, the former director of the Road Bureau; as for car accidents, they are commonplace in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. Total annihilation or safe arrival is all up to fate; in terms of steamers, there are also tragic news reports of small inland steamers exploding cylinders appearing in the newspapers, and most of the accidents do not bear any responsibility. All of this makes people think that Chinese people's travel is really too unsecured, making people shudder with fear.

I think that on the one hand, we should ask the government to strictly order all state-owned institutions or private enterprises that control transportation tools to effectively assume responsibility for travel safety, and also specify a reasonable compensation method. If an enterprise only makes money and lightly unloads its compensation responsibility, then it is really too "getting what it deserves." On the other hand, I think that all travelers, if they think it is necessary, should still get insurance. As for business trips on public service, public and private institutions may have a pension after the accident, but often the amount is enough to make people laugh or cry. I think it is better to allocate a small amount of special funds in advance to pay insurance premiums for business travelers. Pensions, insurance, and compensation are all responsible. But now we only see the airline paying a sour one million yuan in some kind of fee to the family members of the dead, which is really infinitely touching: How unfortunate to be born a Chinese!

"Buy Meat with Extra Pig Feet"

A few days ago, I took a trip on the Suxi-Changzhou Road on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway and encountered an unexpected thing. The ticket price for the Suxi-Changzhou bus is 3,600 yuan, but when buying a ticket, you must pay 3,800 yuan before the ticket seller is willing to stick a ticket out of the window. This additional 200 yuan is to buy a "travel accident insurance policy" from some company. As the saying goes: "Buy meat with extra pig feet," meaning that if you buy a little more meat, with agreement, you can get some pig feet without paying extra. It is an old example. But buying a bus ticket with an insurance policy is still the first time I've seen it. But they insist on you paying for fire insurance, military insurance, life insurance, travel insurance, and all kinds of tricks, which are the various business departments of an insurance company. The insurer receives a small amount of premium, and if an accident occurs, it has to pay a large amount of compensation, which is originally considered a fair transaction, with no deception. You can choose to insure if you want, and you can't force it on the street if you don't want to.

But the bundling method on the Suxi-Changzhou Road is simply forced. You have to insure even if you don't want to, otherwise they won't sell you a ticket and won't let you go. Therefore, taking this road means "must insure."

To be honest, the Suxi-Changzhou Road is only 60 Chinese miles long, and the roads are good. I don't know if there will be an accident, or if passengers will be "dead or disabled" after running ten thousand trips. So if passengers don't insure, it's fine, but if they do, they are "sure to win" and make money. Of course, everyone is willing to do things that "sure to win" and make money, but there is a big problem with this "must insure" method. I think the insurance business still needs to be promoted by all parties in China. This is really a quite meaningful business. "Must insure" is not allowed. You want to "sure to win," but the customers don't eat it, and neither does human emotion or law. "Must insure" becomes "forced to insure," "forced," "sure to win." Starting with small things and focusing on big things, the promoters of China's insurance business should use their brains more and calculate "sure to win" less, so that people will automatically and certainly insure. This is the attitude that business operators should have, otherwise it will not be very sophisticated.

### "New Year" Is Hard to Get Through

— Youzhen

During the Lunar New Year, when you go to visit relatives and friends, if you don't say "Happy New Year," they will shout "Congratulations" first; therefore, congratulating each other on getting rich is all the same, unbearably vulgar; although it is clear that this is a bad habit, it is limited to human "feelings" and "face," and you can't help but "reciprocate" a bit. Therefore, old customs and bad habits are unbreakable! Year after year, no one can resist.

Then, the servant smilingly brings out a cup of tea, with two olives attached to the side of the cup. Olives are originally a symbol of "bitterness comes before sweetness," which is considered auspicious and not annoying; however, in customs, olives are ingots, and ingots are "bringing in wealth and treasure." The master means that everyone gets rich, while the servant means attracting the wealth of the guests. At this time, even if your pockets are empty, seeing these two green fruits, you can't help but take out banknotes and reward the servant; otherwise, you always feel embarrassed!

Therefore, the difficult year-end has already passed, but the "New Year" of getting rich is really hard to get through! Many relatives and friends don't go to congratulate "New Year" to be scolded, saying congratulate "New Year," but can't afford the two "ingots"!

### Two-Headed Monster Baby – One Side Laughs, One Side Cries

— Jianhua

During the Lunar New Year, there are really many tricks in Shanghai. As long as you innovate and advertise in a unique way, you will cause a sensation for Shanghainese to watch. On the third floor of the New World on Nanjing Road, there is an exhibition of two-headed monster babies, and quite a few people come to see them. The baby has two heads, one head is scolding, one head is sleeping sweetly, one head is chewing, one head is staring blankly, one head is laughing, and one head is crying. They say in the advertisement that it is not for fun, but has research value. What is the reason for this kind of abnormality? I am not a physiologist, so of course I can't study the reason.

However, how many things happen in this deformed and turbulent society with one side laughing and one side crying? Alas! Two-headed monster babies are everywhere, when will this abnormality stop?

### Quasi-New Prophecy

— Shigu

The 1947 prophecy said that the people had already seen the rain pass, and the year of Bingxu cannot be without prophecy. I intend to write eight new prophecies. Whether they are accurate or not will only be "known after it happens." But, prophecy is difficult, how can I dare to do this? Therefore, I humbly add the word "Quasi," intending to respect other prophetic predecessors.

1. The method of overprinting postage stamps is applied to banknotes, with significant results. One day it is announced that one yuan notes will be overprinted as ten thousand yuan notes. Those that have not been overprinted can also be used at the same value. The citizens celebrate, and some set off firecrackers. However, one yuan notes are extremely scarce on the market, so the result is still quite disappointing.

2. The Soviet Union transfers Dalian to China, and all materials and factories remain unchanged. A group of 120 progressive people jointly issued a declaration, protesting to the Soviet Union, condemning this move as helping the civil war and plunging China into chaos.

3. The book "On the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty as the Most Equal Treaty" is published, with a gold-plated cover, totaling over a million words. A book critic calls it the only masterpiece of the year and a miracle in political science.

4. In order to verify Mao Zedong's sincerity, Mr. Liang performs a ceremony to heaven on a certain day, which is published in all newspapers across the country. According to those who witnessed the sacrifice, it was "colorful and beautiful."

5. The negotiations with the Communist side are successful, but the Yellow River still does not return to its old course. The Yan'an Anti-Japanese Relief Fund allocates 100 million yuan to the residents affected by the Yellow River floods as relief, under the name of "Continuing the Shallow Cause."

6. Prices are inflated and there is a raw material panic. One day, the employers in Shanghai go on strike citywide, demanding that workers work slowly. However, the workers insist on the policy of speeding up work. After passing through the General Labor Union, they only agree to reduce the working hours by one hour per day, and then try to solve the problem.

7. Something indicates a river between the two sides, and there are quite a few people who oppose it. After three parties mediate, the marriage of relatives is not legally announced, but is allowed to be held privately.

8. On payday, there are tiger carts gathered in front of various companies. Soon, the business of tiger carts in the city is booming again. Even well-informed journalists do not know why.

The Life of a Prominent Figure

### A Day in the Life of Attlee

— He Kai

If you happen to be in St. James's Park in London early in the morning, you may see an elderly couple walking slowly. If you catch up and take a closer look, it turns out to be Mr. and Mrs. Attlee. This is the morning walk that the Prime Minister and his wife take before starting their day's work.

The Attlees live at 10 Downing Street near the park—the official residence of the British Prime Minister. The house at 10 Downing Street is very large, but the Attlees only occupy the upper floors and use the lower floors when public affairs require it.

The Prime Minister gets up very early, already out of bed by 7:30 AM. He reads the morning papers (The Times, the Manchester Guardian, and the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald) at breakfast, and then goes for a walk in the park.

Back from the Walk After Mr. and Mrs. Attlee return from their walk, the Prime Minister returns to his office in 10 Downing Street to begin work, reviewing the telegrams and documents that require his attention. If there is no Cabinet meeting (the regular Cabinet meetings are held every Monday from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and every Wednesday from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM), visitors arrive around 10:00 AM.

The visitors are always Cabinet members, Members of Parliament, members of committees chaired by the Prime Minister, and guests who come to pay their respects. The conversations continue until lunchtime, which is usually at 1:00 PM. The Attlees often have lunch with Labour Party leaders or visiting dignitaries.

Every day around 1:45 PM, the Prime Minister goes to the House of Commons to answer questions. He may stay to participate in debates, where he must speak, and until the House adjourns (sometimes as late as 10:30 PM).

While in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister meets with many Members of Parliament, where he gets a sense of the Parliament's view on current issues. His Parliamentary Private Secretary and press officers supply him with public opinion.

Handling Official Documents Returning to his office in 10 Downing Street, Attlee handles official documents, telegrams, and reports! He stops working at 4:00 PM to have tea with his wife and daughter. At 5:00 PM, he begins work again, receiving visitors, holding committee meetings, signing documents, and dictating letters, until 7:00 PM, when he has dinner.

Dinner is often an official banquet, with famous visitors and others in attendance. Dinner, coffee, cigars, and conversation usually take two hours. Then Attlee goes back to work for about an hour.

Like most Britons, the Prime Minister is also a cricket fan. Between all these meetings and work, he studies the results of the day's cricket matches.

Valuing the Younger Generation Among the visitors at 10 Downing Street, there are often young Labour MPs who have shown great promise in their work in Parliament. Attlee often reads the Parliamentary record and pays close attention to young MPs whose speeches show that they have the talent and ideas that are beneficial to the Labour Party and Britain. This is one way the Prime Minister identifies talented people who are qualified to become Cabinet ministers.

When the Prime Minister is at home, his favorite pastime is detective novels, but he also enjoys classical poetry, and he also carries a notebook to write down his own verses. Although he doesn't object, he doesn't like modern poetry.

Since becoming Prime Minister, Attlee has had to give up his hobby of woodworking because of lack of time.

### Yin Exceeds Yang

— Wen

In recent days, the sales of incense and paper money in Shanghai have reached their peak. A new Customs Gold Unit of 250 yuan can only be exchanged for a few small strings of paper money, which shows that the inflation in the human world is getting worse every day, while the finances in the underworld are very stable. Therefore, people at home feel that the human world is not as good as the underworld! But in this year, "there is no way to heaven, and there is no door to hell."

### Goddess of Peace

— Fang Wen

The Goddess of Peace, which stood on the Bund before the war, has been missing for a long time since it was ravaged by the Japanese army. It was discovered this New Year's Day by an American female officer among the rubble in a dilapidated alley near the Suzhou Creek, but it was covered with scars and could not stand up.

What can the common people do besides silently praying for the health of the Goddess of Peace?

Spring and Autumn

### Yunlin New Year's Day Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

— Xu Zhongnian

Mr. Yang Kailing, the owner of the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society (No. 40, Lüban Road), held a "New Year's Day Paintings" and calligraphy exhibition from January 21st (the first day of the lunar Dinghai year) to the 30th at the society. The author visited on the second day of the lunar new year to offer New Year greetings and participate in the congee gathering, returning satisfied with both spiritual and material nourishment.

"New Year's Day Paintings" is an old theme, truly countless. If you want to hold an exhibition with "New Year's Day Paintings" as the theme, there are only two paths to follow: (1) Emphasize "quantity," giving people a sense of clutter and overwhelming the senses; (2) Emphasize "quality," having its own artistic value beyond mere timeliness. Mr. Yang Kailing adopted the second approach this time, which is commendable.

All of the "New Year's Day Paintings" in the exhibition have prefaces by Mr. Wu Zhihui. The main purpose of "New Year's Day Paintings" is to offer blessings: fortune, prosperity, and longevity. Mr. Wu Zhihui lacks none of these! At the advanced age of eighty-three, with profound knowledge and a reputation respected both at home and abroad, a gentleman who receives "New Year's Day Paintings" need only be somewhat like Mr. Wu Zhihui, I think, to feel proud! Moreover, the people who collaborated with Mr. Wu are all famous painters, such as Zhang Daqian, Wang Yachen, Ma Chaoran, Jiang Hanting, Mei Lanfang, Zhang Junmou, Zheng Wuchang, Wu Hufan, Chen Dingshan, Hou Xiang, Qin Qingzeng, Zhu Jianqiu, He Tianjian, Xu Yuliu, Qin Guliu, Xian Kunbo, Hou Biyi, and Tang Xiangleng. With all kinds of beauty gathered together, the two difficulties (painting and calligraphy) combined, it is truly a magnificent sight!

The calligraphy section is also strong. Mr. Wu Zhihui, Ye Gongchuo, Shen Yinmo, Pan Boying, Zhang Ji, Chen Qicai, Zhang Mojun, Zou Lu, Niu Yongjian, Dan Maoxin, Hua Shixun, Hou Xiang, Hu Yisheng, and Yang Qianli are all outstanding masters. The characters are sometimes thin and sometimes plump, sometimes rigid and sometimes gentle; some people are known for their calligraphy, and some calligraphy is known for its author; some, being scholars, retain their scholarly essence; and others, having galloped across battlefields, retire after achieving merit and follow elegant pursuits. As the ancients said: establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words: all the participants in the calligraphy exhibition have established something. We, the viewers, in addition to admiring their calligraphy, also hold unlimited respect for their character and achievements.

Now, I randomly publish a "New Year's Day Painting" to show a glimpse. The painting is by: Zhang Junmou painting plum blossoms, Chen Dingshan painting bamboo, Zheng Wuchang painting pine trees, Jiang Hanting painting nandina, Zhang Daqian painting lingzhi, Mei Lanfang painting water chestnuts, Wang Yachen painting persimmons, Feng Chaoran painting cypress branches, and Wu Zhihui writing the preface.

January 24, Year 36, the third day of the lunar Dinghai year, first attempt at writing.

### New Year's Day Painting

— Collaboration by Wu Zhihui, Zhang Daqian, Wang Yachen, Mei Lanfang, and other artists

### The Truthfulness of Modern Painting

— Guan Liang

Since Cézanne expressed three-dimensionality in modern painting, it is more accurate to say that the painters of that time, rather than striving for novelty and seeking various themes and diverse expressions, were struggling with the superficial traditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and seeking transcendence, even creating a more lively and free form of self-expression. At that time, from Cézanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso, to Chirico and Salvador, they were attacked by stubborn conservative critics, who believed that in abandoning the traditional concept of beauty, they were merely engaging in the destructive nonsense of the Dadaists, without building anything. However, the fact is that art is creation, not just the pursuit of ancestral traditions for satisfaction. Looking back from today, more than twenty years later, their intense construction of new art was not in vain but left behind more brilliant and beautiful flowers in the entire history of modern painting.

Some people believe that new art is always difficult to understand; because it is difficult to understand, it is only met with indifference, and even slander follows. Since new painting negated the superficial traditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, its most valuable aspects are its spirit and new truthfulness. The Fauvist painter Vlaminck, in his still lifes and landscapes, not only expresses the subject's color and quality vividly but even uses salt and sugar as metaphors. Even though they are both piles of white things, he should express that one represents saltiness and the other represents sweetness. From this, it can be seen the seriousness of the Fauvist painters at that time towards truthfulness. The truthfulness of modern painting is not just one-sided but should be multi-faceted. For example, "visual truthfulness," "emotional truthfulness," and metaphysical truthfulness can all be good examples. In terms of visual truthfulness, painters not only express a subject to satisfy the "likeness" but also find factors more important than likeness in the "likeness," which is to say that, for example, the human body should be a flesh-and-blood entity, and beyond expressing the flesh-and-blood entity, what is more important is life. How to make that life appear more actively on the canvas, and at the same time, it should be attached with indispensable emotions. When emotions dominate the canvas, even the superficial form can be abandoned, and even more abundant images can be obtained in deformation. Matisse, Derain, Gauguin, and Vlaminck can be representative of this type of work. As for emotional truthfulness, beyond pursuing color harmony and shape transformation, painters express a true feeling of the emotions at that time. This is similar to the feeling of floating like an immortal when first experiencing a kiss in the life of first love, directly depicting this feeling onto the canvas, and receiving an effect that transcends visual truthfulness. Writers such as Chirico can be representative of this example.

In metaphysical truthfulness, the group of surrealist writers who were once called monsters in the art world can be representative. Surrealists believe that beyond the thinking in daily life, there is still a life of fantasy and dreams dominating life in unknowable times, and they directly depict their own fantasies or dreams onto the canvas. They believe that if painting can express daily visible life, then how can it not depict daily invisible but more valuable parts of reality? Since the discovery of surrealism, new painting has not only been like flowers that the common folk have never seen, but it has also expanded the field of new painting from the limited to the unlimited, bringing modern painting into infinite angles and visions. The most recent surrealists have expanded from purely poetic themes to political and social themes. They believe that in addition to using words and writing to convey thoughts, people's illusions and dreams at least have common points of resonance and common truthfulness. Taking these as themes may not be incomprehensible things. Painters of this type are Salvador, who currently lives in the United States, and Miró can be representatives.

In short, from Cézanne to Picasso and Dalí, modern painting has not only expanded the fields that predecessors could not have dreamed of in just two short decades, but also created broader aesthetic views from various schools since the negation of traditional beauty. Painting is not just the reproduction of the subject matter, but the creation of the subject matter.

### An Autobiography of a Philippine Writer

— Written by Bulusan, translated by Peng Siyan

Since my autobiography was published, I have received many letters asking the question "How did I become a writer?" They want to know how a person without formal training can write pleasant and stimulating works. They also want to know all the factors that contributed to my writing career.

It is difficult to answer these questions, because a writer's success requires a long process and delicate tempering. When I came to America, I never thought I would become a writer. I recall the day I set off for America from my hometown, with only a vague impression of America in my mind. How could I have imagined being so fortunate in America? At the same time, I was not clear about the exact reason for my pursuit of knowledge. However, deep in my subconscious, there was indeed a passion to resist the harsh environment that pressed on my childhood. It was for this reason that I resolutely left my motherland.

But where did this "resistance" come with me? Of course, I don't think this resistance was born within myself. I often found many faults in my friends. Therefore, I began to feel that I had moved from a lower standard to a situation that contradicted the American conscience. Moreover, the only way I could avoid anger in my distress was to "run." So for the past ten years, I have been living a wandering and fearful life. From Zhuhe to temporary stability, the result was that I fell into the abyss of fear instead of escaping it. This almost made me want to give up on life. This feeling of fear did not stop until I realized that "resistance" was born within myself. In fact, fear is part of my consciousness, and at that time I began to seek ways to get rid of fear.

First, we must understand the nature of fear, what brings fear, and what makes fear so terrible. Is it because I was driven to Alaska and forced to do animal-like work in a poor working environment that a terrible shadow appeared in my mind? Or is it because when I arrived in California, I was refused entry into the church and saw "soul traders" dominating religious beliefs, which caused fear?

In fact, the times I have felt the most fear in my life are still the following: The first time, at a bus station in San Francisco, I was completely attracted by a beautiful American woman. At that time, I did not expect that a white man would give me an embarrassing blow. Afterwards, I was very ashamed of why I couldn't refute him in the following tone: Is human beauty a special product of Americans? This feeling of guilt really made me unable to forget it for a while; on the contrary, it aroused my courage to praise. At the same time, I have always believed that beauty belongs to everyone, not to a certain race or a certain class. Therefore, I was completely freed from the long-standing fear. Secondly, one day when I went to the public library to study on my own, people on the street pointed at me and laughed. At first, I didn't think they were laughing at me. When I looked in the mirror and saw myself all over, I realized that they were laughing at the hole in the crotch of my pants. At that time, I felt very sad. In fact, I had been going to the library to read books at that time every day for six months, and the clothes I wore were all this set. Because I was completely focused on the beautiful words and deeds in the books of California, I forgot that there were also clothing requirements among human beings. That evening, I sneaked into the gambling den to drink "oily tea."

Indeed, I was lonely during those years of fear, shame, and hunger; I hardly had contact with human beings (even with a single individual) for several years, and I had not heard a woman's delicate voice. One late night, I woke up from a dream and stroked my face with the cold blanket. At that time, I really yearned for human affection. Several years later, I did meet a woman who indeed brought me to the edge of the real world, and also made me encounter the fear of American racial discrimination. Because her father said to me in a cold tone: "You Filipinos are not human at all, and you are not worthy of talking about love with my daughter."

Is "love" a unique property of white people? Does "love" belong to race? Why did the American father make such a mistake? Alas! Clear water is actually more compassionate than the love between men and women, pigeons are actually more faithful than the love between human beings, and the construction of ants in their society is actually more perfect than the world of my private ownership!

By depriving me of my right to be human, I began to live like a silent bird in the forest. In fact, in the declining "social forest," there are even more vicious beasts. Therefore, I can't bear to see such a human life again. I once thought: If I could truly become a silent bird and not be restricted by so-called "humanity," that would be the best thing.

But someone helped me run out of the darkness and move towards the light, so I can write about the truth of our life in the forest. The motivation for this writing is entirely to expose the sins of Filipinos living in America. In fact, it is also to expose the sins of millions of people living in the "social forest." Then I hope that in this exposed text, I can develop a

I am very clear about the situation in the United States, and I am also quite familiar with the source of American democracy, so I am deeply afraid that the future of American democracy will be ruined by money, power, and influence. Therefore, I hope that the United States will have a writer who can do his best to contribute his experience to serve thousands of Americans, and I also hope that the Philippines will have a writer who can create weapons of life and hope for the people. Only such a writer has meaning and function.

The above is my answer to the question of how I became a writer that people generally ask. Originally, a writer is not only for life, but also to understand the essence of American democracy, and at the same time to promote it to build a society in which there will be no more racial discrimination and contempt for the poor and lowly. Then our goal of liberating mankind will be achieved. (Translated from The Far East

### Aesthetic Education and Psychological Construction

— Zheng Wuchang

Remembering Teacher Cai Yuanpei, who advocated aesthetic education

The recognition of beauty comes from the inherent intuition of human beings; because of the level of knowledge, different perceptions arise; often you think it is beautiful, but I think it is not beautiful; today I think it is beautiful, tomorrow I think it is not beautiful; here I think it is beautiful, but elsewhere I think it is not beautiful. It seems to be very complicated and without standards. Therefore, what is truly beauty? First, there must be a law, which is the "law of beauty." In my humble opinion, "beauty" must conform to "truth" and "reality," that is, it must be "true," which is one law. Once it is true, it must also cater to the appreciation of the ears and eyes, making you feel happy and joyful, which is "good," which is one law. With these two laws, whether in production or in actions, they are all beautiful - fine art, virtue. On the contrary, things that are unreasonable, irrational, hurt conscience, and harm morality are all not beautiful. The ancients said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself;" "Do not deprive others of what they like." Human beings inherently have a little bit of conscience and ability, and no one knows what beauty is, and no one knows how lovable beauty is. Not imposing on others what you do not want, and not insulting what others like, is conforming to reason, which is "true"; therefore, harmony between self and others is a "good"; is it not a virtue? Exhaustively imitating creation and learning from nature is fine art, but painting distant trees larger than nearby trees, and unfurling sails in the wind and rain, is unreasonable, which is not "true"; it makes people see it unpleasantly, which is not "good"; can it be considered fine art? From this, it is not difficult to have a considerable standard for so-called aesthetic education. In fact, the work and effect of aesthetic education are very common and long-standing in human society, firmly holding supreme authority. For example, men's clothes and hats, women's rouge and jewelry, officials' palaces and instruments, merchants' storefronts and advertisements, religious buildings and images, from making rituals and music to seeking flowers and willows, all borrow the influence and temptation of beauty to cater to human's love of beauty to achieve their desired purposes; it can also be said that all politicians, religious leaders, educators, and other sociologists must use "fine art" and "virtue" to govern the country, preach, and change customs.

Now, wise men who care about national affairs are all talking about building a new China. They mean that because our China, which has a history of thousands of years of culture, has now collapsed and fallen behind, it must be rebuilt. I don't know whether what is to be built is to be built the same as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, which is considered new? Or to be a little newer than them, which is considered new? I think whether it is new or old, as long as it is "beautiful." Psychological construction is much more important than material construction; propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love are our old Chinese virtues, and they can also be said to be eternally new, but now they are really declining! We should awaken them from the psychology of the people. If the psychology of the people has the construction of virtue, all politics, education, military affairs... can be reasonable and conform to the situation, and get on the right track; as for industry, commerce, etc., it is not difficult to have constructions that adapt to the actual situation of modern times. If it is easy to be polluted, easy to fight, and easy to corrupt, which goes against the laws of beauty, there is no hope for construction. Therefore, I now miss even more the promotion of

Teacher Cai Yuanpei once advocated "replacing religion with aesthetic education." At that time, quite a few people shouted together; now, hardly anyone talks about it. This great and lofty enlightenment, especially in modern Chinese society, only acknowledges it as a famous saying, and does not try to carry it forward and make it a reality. It not only fails to live up to Guangjue, but also blows out the bright lamp of the national cultural movement.

The existence of any religion is nothing more than holding a common emotion, reason, and nature of human beings as a basis, compiling doctrines and classics, and spreading influence to prevent the loss of the original emotion, reason, and nature, so as to become a Buddha, attain the Tao, escape sin, and ascend to heaven. But among them, it is inevitable to borrow divine sayings and ghost stories, and use confusing means. As for aesthetic education, there is only one "beauty" character to serve as the creed of education, which is relatively bright and practical. Because human beings, whether foolish or wise, can be said to love beauty. Loving beauty is human nature, and we hold this love of beauty; on the one hand, we come to develop the spirit of beauty, improve the degree of beauty, increase the value of beauty, promote the effectiveness of beauty, and at the same time cultivate the appreciation of beauty, arouse the love of beauty, and understand the function of beauty. A group of people who have a love of beauty are constantly nourished and influenced by beauty, and then reform their body and mind, change their temperament, and even change customs, which is probably more natural and easier to believe than the practice of doctrines by believers who have been baptized or ordained.

However, "beauty" has "laws" of beauty. It is not beautiful just to be good-looking and pleasing to the eye; it is not beautiful just to be lovable and attractive; it is not beautiful just to be self-satisfied and envied by others. People in the world are busy, seeking wealth and profit, and fighting for power, which one is not to seek the comfort and enjoyment of beauty to satisfy his desire for the love of beauty. But the result is that it is not beautiful. This is all because they do not know the "laws of beauty" and blindly pursue them, so that they draw tigers like dogs and learn Taoism and become demons, and even like moths throwing themselves into the flames, they do not realize it until they die. How much this fails to live up to the good intentions of Heaven in endowing human beings with the love of beauty! To save the people who have gone astray for the love of beauty, there must be "beauty education."

### The Spirit of Depiction in Western Painting History: Landscape Painting in the 16th and 17th Centuries

— Shen Yan

If one were to trace the roots of the development of landscape painting in Western art history, one could find considerable material even in the Classical era, taking its subject matter from the narrative poem "The Odyssey" or from fantastical landscape paintings. In the Roman era, one can find interior decorations in Pompeian houses that "resemble Japanese fusuma paintings (Note: Fusuma are similar to shoji screens, but are covered with special thick paper and painted with various pictures, serving as interior decorations)." Until the 15th century of Christian painting, Italian paintings often featured works with landscape painting concepts in the background, as the prevalence of perspective at that time made the trend of depicting landscapes as backgrounds even more popular. However, purely drawn-from-life landscape paintings began to appear, and landscape paintings began to be produced as independent works. Representative works from the 16th century include the beautiful murals by the Venetian painter Giorgione and the watercolors by the German painter Dürer. The sketches of Leonardo da Vinci should also be especially noted. Among Leonardo's sketches, there are groups that resemble landscape sketches from life. However, most of them are memoranda regarding the investigation of natural phenomena, rather than pure landscape sketches from life; for example, the landscape of mountains under rain is a sketch depicting meteorological phenomena, and the sketch depicting the river basin is a sketch of fluvial phenomena, all of which are records of observations and studies of geophysics. Therefore, Leonardo's concrete study of vivid natural phenomena with a purely scientific attitude is integrated with the purely artistic observation of exploring the aesthetic of scenery with scientific sensitivity, forming an inseparable unity. Thus, the works that resemble landscape paintings that can be found in his sketches are a form of integration of "science" and "art," which is completely different from pure landscape painting, but at the very least, it can be considered a landscape sketch. This sketch is dated 1473, and scholars who study the history of landscape painting attach great importance to this clearly dated material.

Almost at the same time as Leonardo, Dürer, who completed German painting, also left a pair of excellent watercolor landscape paintings. These landscape paintings beautifully depict the local color of Germany at that time, which is a very evocative work. In addition to natural scenery, many depictions of folk houses are also included.

Giorgione's outstanding landscape painting, commonly known as "The Tempest," is a purely colorful landscape painting. The clouds in the sky behind are thick and dark, while the colors of the trees are rich and bright. It is said to depict the local color of Castelfranco, where the author lived. According to some researchers, the figures in the foreground of the painting are related to legends, but it is more appropriate to regard these young and poor men and women as decorative figures. And this latter interpretation is of great significance in art history. Because pure landscape paintings with decorative figures appeared as a "work" from this point on. Giorgione also has a painting called "Pastoral Concert," which focuses on depicting figures and cannot be regarded as a landscape painting, but Giorgione's excellent talent for depicting landscapes is fully demonstrated here.

Combining the above-mentioned various works, they are merely beautiful historical materials that are scattered individually. Landscape painting became an independent department in painting and promoted systematic development in the next era (i.e., after the 17th century).

In the 17th-century art world, there were two systems of landscape painting: (1) "ideal landscape painting" and (2) "pastoral landscape painting." The former developed in France, while the latter flourished in the Netherlands. Generally speaking, the former is a system that arose based on the needs of court culture, while the latter is a form that matured in the atmosphere of civic culture. However, there are still many points to be noted when examining it from the perspective of realism.

At that time in France, ideal landscape painting was respected in principle, while pastoral landscape painting was not recognized for its high artistic value. Although the reasons are complex, the main points are as follows: At that time, France inherited the mythological legends of the Classical era, and combined with the Italian tradition of landscape depiction, it preferred the Italian flavor of foreign sentiment to natural scenery. Therefore, the artistic natural trend must be expressed in idealized techniques. At that time, the gardens sought by society in France and Italy were not natural imitations, but distinctly formalized gardens. For example, the vast gardens of "Versailles" can be regarded as its representative. At that time, kings, nobles, and aristocrats often wandered in this kind of patterned garden. Therefore, it is very possible that any artistry was not recognized in the pastoral landscape of the farmer's living environment.

However, there were still many realistic natural tendencies in this situation, because French painters inherently respected realism, and this characteristic was naturally expressed in their paintings; therefore, even ideal landscape paintings often contain rich realism. For example, Nicolas Poussin, the founding father of French painting, was a representative writer of ideal landscape painting at that time, but the background of his landscape paintings with decorative legendary figures was a sketch of the suburbs of Rome. Moreover, Gaspard Dughet's paintings often include pure sketches from life that do not contain any legendary figures, and even his works can be found that can truly feel the local color of the mountainous areas near Rome.

This kind of sketching tendency can also be clearly seen in French painting in the 18th century. For example, in the works of Antoine Watteau, a representative painter of the time, many use aristocratic gardens as backgrounds, such as "The Embarkation for Cythera," in which the trees depicted are realistic sketches. By the second half of the 18th century, for example, the works of Hubert Robert, a landscape painter representing the dawn of Neoclassicism, were mostly pure sketches depicting the ruins of classical Rome.

As mentioned above, the ideal landscape paintings that developed in France mostly contain elements of sketching from life.

The Netherlands was a newly emerging republic that separated from Spain in the mid-17th century, and its religion was also Protestantism. Its colors were particularly strong, and its social system and customs were different from those of France, so its paintings also had their own characteristics. For example, Rembrandt's style of religious painting seems to express the world of sacred tradition in everyday language. Also, in Frans Hals's portrait paintings, one can find easily approachable everyday expressions. This basic sentiment opened up a new phenomenon of using the living environment of everyday life as the subject of painting, thus creating paintings with unique local flavors. The depiction of the living environment of everyday life significantly expanded the scope of painting. The situation is briefly described as follows:

(1) The description of the living environment inside the homes of citizens is a kind of genre painting, but its nature is completely different from ordinary genre paintings. Ordinary genre paintings show a certain degree of curiosity about the materials and emphasize specific interests, but Dutch paintings are more natural and easygoing than this, like a fragment of everyday life. In order to distinguish this kind of work from ordinary genre paintings, it is more appropriate to call it "interior painting."

(2) Certain places where the public gathers, such as roads, squares, or the interior of public buildings, are also special themes. Art historians call this "architectural painting" and recognize its particularity.

(3) Still life paintings, which appeared in art history as an independent department, also began in the Netherlands at that time. This is also a close-up of the living environment of everyday life. However, ordinary still life paintings did not reach a high level of development. The completion of still life paintings should be attributed to Chardin, a great painter of the French bourgeoisie who inherited and promoted the Dutch painting style, but the history of still life paintings began in the 17th-century Netherlands.

As mentioned above, in the 17th-century Netherlands, many specialized painters who depicted the living environment of everyday life appeared, and their works were mostly small paintings. They have a delicate and light style and are suitable for hanging in citizens' homes for appreciation. In this situation in the Netherlands, pastoral landscape painters appeared, using the countryside as the theme of depicting the living environment to meet the needs of society at that time, which was also inevitable.

Pastoral landscape paintings developed in the Netherlands, and their subject matter was broad and their forms varied. Generally speaking, they have the following characteristics:

(1) Similar to the above-mentioned "architectural painting," it depicts regional landscapes including buildings.

(2) It depicts pastoral landscapes decorated with livestock and shepherds, some of which can be regarded as animal paintings.

(3) It depicts pastoral landscapes centered on various figures, including those that resemble genre paintings.

(4) It depicts seaside landscapes, many of which are centered on sailing ships.

(5) It depicts the natural environment mainly with trees.

(6) It depicts the effect of clouds in the sky.

(7) It combines windmills or farmers' houses to depict the fun of the countryside, some of which focus on farmhouses.

The various constituent elements mentioned above are arbitrarily combined to produce various changes, and the writers are generally equally excellent. In other words, the general level of pastoral landscape painters is quite high, and the number of writers is also considerable. Among these many writers, Jacob van Ruisdael is relatively well-known, but the most outstanding one is Rembrandt; this person was the only writer who painted religious paintings at that time, and his portrait paintings and genre paintings were also not bad. And he is also quite famous as a landscape painter. Rembrandt was proficient in oil painting techniques, and he used these techniques to add a complete and rich atmosphere to pastoral landscape paintings. In short, the 17th century was an era that marked out new territories in the history of painting.
