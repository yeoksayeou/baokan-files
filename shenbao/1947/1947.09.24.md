### The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Suggests the Government Improve the Treatment of Public and Private School Teachers; Cancel the Cost of Living Subsidy and Additional Salary, and Issue Salaries Based on the Price Index; The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee Resolves to Request the Implementation of Credit Loans

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council held a temporary meeting at 3 PM on the 23rd. Chairman Jiang Yong presided. After the Secretariat reported that Huang Yanpei was unable to attend due to other matters, the meeting began. (Discussion: The committee revised and passed the suggestions on the peace treaty with Japan and submitted it to the government for consideration. The resolution to request the government to postpone various elections was retained. The resolution to request the government to quickly decide on its attitude towards the Indonesian war to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese was passed and submitted to the government for serious consideration. The resolution to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to order all primary and secondary schools across the country to thoroughly use Mandarin Chinese for instruction was passed and submitted to the government for consideration.) The resolution to request a thorough investigation and strict punishment of the China Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing losses to the national treasury, and as a warning against corruption, was passed and submitted to the government for thorough investigation and strict punishment. The resolution to request a quick increase in disaster relief funds to aid the refugees in Anhui Province, and the resolution to request a quick dispatch of senior officials to thoroughly suppress the banditry in the Dabie Mountains and Huang Mountains to curb the source of chaos, were both passed and submitted to the government for prompt handling. The resolution to request a quick allocation of 100 million in emergency funds to aid the refugees in Henan Province was passed, and the government was requested to quickly allocate funds for relief. The resolution to request the Executive Yuan to properly plan to improve the treatment of public and private school teachers, and to implement a system of livelihood loans to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity, was revised and passed, and submitted to the government for prompt and effective handling.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The issue of improving the treatment of public and private school teachers was also discussed at the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council on the 23rd. The proposal was submitted by three council members, Lu Qian, Fan Yu-sui, and Jiang Yong, to "request the Executive Yuan to properly plan to improve the treatment of public and private school teachers at the root, and to implement a system of livelihood loans to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity," listing two measures: Adjust salary payment methods; Implement livelihood loans. Many council members spoke during the discussion. Yin Shuxian strongly opposed the proposal. He said that if this measure were implemented, the national treasury would bear a burden of several hundred billion yuan, which was virtually impossible. In the end, it was decided to delete the measure to implement livelihood loans, and the proposal was changed to "request the Executive Yuan to actively improve the treatment of public and private school teachers to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity." The revised resolution was passed and submitted to the government for prompt and effective handling. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

(Reasons) Public and private school teachers who have maintained their integrity during the eight years of the War of Resistance have suffered immense hardships, struggling to survive, hoping to find relief after victory. However, the Communist Party has risen up in arms, and the government is suppressing the rebellion, causing prices to skyrocket and the legal tender to depreciate sharply. Since the victory, salaries have been adjusted several times, but in reality, each adjustment forces public and private school teachers to tighten their belts even further. Those whose hometowns have fallen into the Communist-controlled areas are still unable to return home. Not only is their property gone, but they are also burdened by the refugees of their fleeing families. Those who value their self-respect have fallen into desperation, while cunning people disregard everything, leading to a prevailing wind of corruption and the decline of justice. Driven by hunger, the moral climate is deteriorating. If no urgent measures are taken to remedy the situation, it will develop into an uncontrollable situation.

(Measures) Adjust the method of paying salaries; Completely abolish the cost of living allowance and additional salary, and allocate salaries based on the price index; Based on the price index, convert salaries into physical goods for distribution.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting again on the morning of the 23rd to review the loan proposal for civil servants submitted by Liu Zhideng and others. More than ten legislators attended, with Liu Tong presiding. Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, also attended. During the discussion, the legislators expressed strong dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment among civil servants and raised many questions to Xu Baiyuan. Xu responded separately and explained the difficulties of the loans. Some legislators also believed that the original measure of using real estate as collateral was, in fact, impossible to implement, as most civil servants do not own fixed property. It was decided to change it to credit loans. In addition, the following supplementary measures were drafted: Pay salaries according to the price index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics; Ensure that the treatment of all agencies is equal; Abolish the distribution of physical goods. The proposal will be submitted to the Executive Yuan after being passed by the general assembly on the 25th.

### The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Requests a Thorough Investigation of the China Trust Bureau's Selling Enemy Property at Low Prices

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Regarding the China Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing significant losses to the national treasury, council members Jiang Yong, Wu Zhaoxu, and Yao Tingfang have proposed to the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council that a thorough investigation and strict punishment be carried out. The resolution was passed at the temporary meeting of the Resident Committee on the 23rd and submitted to the government for thorough investigation and strict punishment. The proposal's cause is: "For the Central Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing losses to the national treasury, please thoroughly investigate and strictly punish them as a warning against corruption." It is claimed that since the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau was merged into the China Trust Bureau and the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office was established, all enemy and puppet property in Shanghai has been handled solely by the bureau. The enemy property that has been sold is already uncountable. It is noted that the former Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau had valued 127 buildings of the Japanese-owned Gongda Yarn Factory in Yulin Lane, Yulin Road, Tilanqiao, at 141,158,716.68 yuan last September. Now, the bureau sold it to the original landlord this May for only 71,470,000 yuan. The land rights were for eight years. More than half a year has passed, and prices have increased more than tenfold, but the selling price has decreased by half. Who can believe that there is no embezzlement? If the Gongda Yarn Factory is like this, it is difficult to guarantee that other properties sold by the bureau are not in similar situations, causing losses to the national treasury and enriching private pockets. The competent authorities should quickly conduct a thorough investigation, and if the facts are verified, severely punish them to warn against corruption, so that the remaining materials can be sold one after another with less loss. Furthermore, the enemy and puppet real estate still held by the bureau, in addition to being allocated to various agencies, is often lent by the bureau to relatives and friends for residence without collecting any rent. It is said to be managed on behalf of the government, but it is inappropriate to use public property to do favors. Moreover, it is rumored that some people are nominally borrowing for residence but actually secretly collecting transfer fees. A thorough investigation should be carried out together. All real estate lent by the bureau to private residents that should be confiscated should be sold to benefit the state. Those that are definitely not enemy property and should not be confiscated should be returned to the original owners as soon as possible, without allowing them to be occupied by others, hindering the property rights of the owners.

### Bird's Eye View of Nanyang

— Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang

Reminiscences of Following the China National Aviation Corporation's Test Flight to Nanyang, Part 6

This reporter accompanied the China National Aviation Corporation's test flight and traveled through several major cities in Nanyang, including Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, and Batavia. I flew a total of 7,000 miles. Although the trip was hurried, I had many feelings based on what I heard and saw. The first and most profound impression was the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for their motherland. Whenever we flew to any city, the overseas Chinese were overjoyed when they first saw the national emblem of "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" on the "Sky King" and the reporters who came from afar, as if they had met family members in a foreign land. They asked questions and eagerly wanted to know the current situation of the motherland. Unfortunately, we were unable to bring many moving and joyful messages.

Overseas Chinese Encounter Unprecedented Difficulties

The second impression is that we feel that the overseas Chinese are now encountering unprecedented difficulties. At a time when various places in Nanyang are singing the praises of nationalism and national self-determination movements, unfortunately, our overseas Chinese are the first to fall into a crisis-ridden environment, and many have even entered the "path of destruction." We saw that in the conflict in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese suffered property losses and casualties in the crossfire. This is such a heartbreaking thing!

Looking back at the history of overseas Chinese pioneering in Nanyang, the Dutch East Indies was the earliest. Many of the overseas Chinese residing in Batavia today are already sixth-generation descendants, and some are even eighth-generation descendants. They initially reclaimed wasteland in the Dutch East Indies, working diligently and frugally, slowly transforming a desolate island into the dazzling "Golden Bird" it is today. But today, unexpectedly, there is such a terrifying and tragic scene, watching the blood and sweat and construction of the overseas Chinese for four hundred years being destroyed without a trace in the gunfire. Regarding this point, we believe that the Indonesian approach is extremely foolish and unwise. If the Indonesians really destroy everything of the overseas Chinese in this war, then what is left? It is not difficult for us to imagine that the Indonesians will have regressed four hundred years and returned to the "desolate era" of that time.

The so-called "a single spark can start a prairie fire," the continued hidden worries we will consider are, how can we guarantee that other small ethnic groups will not follow suit due to everything that the Indonesians have imposed on the overseas Chinese?

Let's turn around and look at this corner of Thailand. In recent years, the overseas Chinese community has also begun to face serious threats. Recently, the Siamese government plans to nationalize all the rice mills in the hands of the overseas Chinese (commonly called "fire mills" locally). This is undoubtedly another fatal blow to the overseas Chinese. We know that in the past, the rice produced in Siam and Saigon was almost entirely controlled by the overseas Chinese. If the overseas Chinese in Thailand lose all their rice mills, the consequences can be imagined. What follows will be a crisis of bankruptcy.

It is precisely because the overseas Chinese have suffered various traumas overseas that they place great expectations on their motherland. When we flew to the above-mentioned places, the overseas Chinese all earnestly hoped for a strong and unified motherland, and at least at this stage, there should be concrete actions so that they can live and work in peace in Nanyang. However, most of our consulates in various places are unable to carry out their work smoothly due to a lack of manpower and a large workload. There are 800,000 overseas Chinese in Bangkok alone, and the consulate has only fifteen staff members, and some of these 800,000 overseas Chinese are scattered in various small towns. How can these fifteen government workers take care of everything?

At a time when anti-Chinese movements are rampant in various parts of Nanyang, our country's foreign propaganda work in Southeast Asia deserves special attention from the authorities. Although our country has no intentions in this region, it is our nation's "window" and the outer line of our economy. The actions of the local governments and people have a great influence on us. The United Kingdom and the United States have established news agencies in major cities in Nanyang to provide local newspapers with photos and written materials, or to establish reading rooms to provide illustrated magazines for free. It is essential that we immediately develop election work. This reporter believes that if our foreign propaganda work in Southeast Asia is done well, it will be more effective than our international propaganda in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The people of Nanyang have no understanding of any of our country's problems at present. After the China National Aviation Corporation plane landed in Bangkok, the Thais came to ask if the plane was being flown by Americans. They simply did not believe that Chinese people could fly planes. In Batavia, Indonesians asked reporters: Is your country's capital in Shanghai? All of this proves the urgent need for us to strengthen international propaganda in Southeast Asia.

### Chairman and Wife Donate Property to Help the Church Run Schools

[United Press, New York, 22nd] The Methodist Church announced today that Chairman Chiang and his wife have donated their land and houses in Chongqing to the church for use as schools and orphanages. The land and houses cover an area of more than 10,000 acres and include 20 stone houses. The chairman and his wife also donated US$50,000 for their expenses.

### President Zhang Arrives in Beiping; Inspects Northeast and Believes Officials are Aware and Vigilant; Will Stay for Two or Three Days Before Heading to Chahar, Suiyuan, Jin and Lu

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 23rd] President Zhang Qun arrived in Beiping at 12:00 noon on the 23rd on a special plane from Shenyang. Accompanying him were Deng Youde, Zhou Junliang, Fu Boping, and five others. The weather in the old capital was clear after the rain today, and the autumn sun shone brightly on the Xiyuan Airport. More than a hundred officials, including Li Zongren, Sun Yunzhong, and He Siyuan, came to the airport to greet him. When the door of the plane opened, Zhang, wearing a dark blue Western suit, stepped off the plane with a smile and exchanged greetings with the senior officials who welcomed him. He then rode in the same car as Li Zongren into the city and went straight to the Customs Hostel to rest. Song Ziwen also stayed here when he came to Beiping in the past. President Zhang immediately met with reporters and said that he had been away from Beiping for fourteen years. He first visited Beiping in the thirty-third year of Guangxu to take the exam for studying abroad. Since then, he has come to Beiping from time to time. The last time was in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. He saw that the potted flowers displayed along the street at Xisi Archway were still the same as they were more than ten years ago, so he felt very much at home. He plans to stay in Beiping for two or three days this time. He would like to visit Zhang Heng, Gui Suiyuan, Taiyuan, and Jinan, but the itinerary is yet to be arranged. As for the trip to South China, he is afraid that he will have to return to Nanjing to deal with accumulated official business before it can be realized. He plans to go to various places to see how the implementation of government orders is and to investigate the hardships of the people and the lives of refugees, so as to lay the foundation for relief work. In addition, he is eager to see the current situation of the industrial and mining units left by the enemy and puppets in North China. The specific inspection program in Beiping is being arranged by the municipal government. When asked about his impressions of the Northeast, President Zhang said: Mencius once said, "When one bears the burden, one's heart is in danger; when one is worried, one's thoughts are deep." This can be a true portrayal of the state of mind of those in power in the Northeast. They are very clear about the importance, complexity, and seriousness of the Northeast, and they know to be vigilant. After Director Chen took office, all departments are setting an example to cooperate, and efficiency can be strengthened. The people of the Northeast support the central government's suppression of the rebellion, and their emotions are enthusiastic. When he arrived in Changchun, more than a thousand people welcomed him in the streets. After fourteen years of enemy and puppet rule, they eagerly hope to return to the embrace of the central government and live in peace. When Zhang left Changchun for Shenyang yesterday, the weather was dark and rainy, and it was extremely dangerous. Zhang's staff still have lingering fears when talking about it.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] In the afternoon of the 23rd, President Zhang answered questions and visited Director Li, and exchanged views on the president of Peking University, Hu Shi, and the famous scholars of Beiping, Zeng Xiang and Gu Zhongxiu. He also inspected the new urban area. President Zhang is scheduled to attend the municipal government's morning meeting on the 24th and then inspect the Shijingshan Power Plant and Iron and Steel Plant.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Qun and his entourage left Pan at 9:20 AM on the 23rd and flew to Beiping. Chen Cheng and other heads of agencies went to the airport to see them off. Zhang shook hands with Chen and others with sincere gratitude. Sun Yueqi followed him. It is internally decided that Guan Jiyu, the political deputy of the Ministry of Grain, will postpone his trip to Nanjing.

### The Executive Yuan Decides to Purchase Vehicles from the Shenyang Machinery Plant, Affecting the Solution of the Jiang Mining Problem

[Our Zhiyang Dispatch on the 23rd] President Zhang Qun inspected the Northeast for four days, investigated the general situation in the Northeast, and solved many important problems. Zhang diligently sought out the people's hardships, did not sit still, and did not waste resources, giving the people of the Northeast an excellent impression. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant of the National Resources Commission manufactured five locomotives and one hundred freight cars, which were stored in the factory. A certain department did not buy them, and the factory was in a dangerous situation because it could not sell these goods worth about 60 billion legal tender. Anshan Iron and Steel's products were indirectly affected. It is also reported that the Kaiyuan Coal Mine has 550,000 tons of coal in storage, worth about 200 million yuan, but there are no cars to transport it out. The people in the industrial areas of Beijing and Shanghai are all affected, and the Kaiyuan Mine is also affected. The problem of 100 tons of locomotives and cars, which is recognized as a strange thing, has been solved, directly and indirectly affecting the industrial and mining industries of the Northeast and North China.

### Japan's Early Reparations Drawn Yesterday in Tokyo, Our Country Allocated Nearly Half of the First Batch

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The allocation of the first batch of equipment reparations made by Japan to the Allied countries has now been determined. At that time, our country will draw machinery tools and auxiliary metalworking equipment, a total of 9,780 pieces, as an early transfer of reparations. This accounts for 30% of the early transfer of reparations. The first batch of allocations totaled 19,700 pieces of machinery tools. When the draw was made today, it was divided into two numbers. Our country drew the even number, while the British, representing the Philippines and the Netherlands, drew the odd number. Wu Ban-chen, the head of our country's "Reparations and Restitution" delegation, represented our country in the draw. The ones drawn by the British are for the other half of the 30% of the early transfer of reparations, which will be allocated among the British, Philippines, and Netherlands.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Regarding private business representatives going to Japan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has notified each district to report according to regulations for the first three batches within a limited time. The ones who have reported to the ministry are Liu Qiguang, Liu Ming, and Yin Zhankui, representatives from the Taiwan District, and Yong Yongxuan, Chen Xisan, and Tan Zhiqing, representatives from the Tianjin District. As for the overseas Chinese business representatives going to Japan, Wen Chaozhu and Zeng Zhengyin have also been appointed by the Preparatory Committee. The remaining representatives are being selected.

### People Suffering from Deafness, Blindness, Muteness, and Madness Can be Elected as People's Representatives; The Judicial Yuan's Explanatory Letter Responds to the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Executive Yuan previously stated that people who are blind, mute, deaf, or mad have obvious difficulties in performing their duties and asked the Judicial Yuan to interpret whether they can be elected as representatives of county and township people's representative organs or township chiefs. According to the Judicial Yuan's reply, the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of the Yuan decided: if such people are elected, it cannot be legally considered that their election is invalid. Even if it is difficult for them to perform their duties, there is no way to remove them from office except through legal procedures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The election methods for National Assembly representatives from national vocational groups were amended at the joint business meeting held on the 22nd by the Election General Office and the national vocational group election offices. The new method is that candidates for National Assembly representatives from vocational groups should be jointly signed by districts and industries, and voting should be conducted by district, and the number of votes should be counted by district. Except for one person with the most votes in each district being elected as the basic number for each district, and women's representatives being counted separately by totaling the national votes, the remaining seats will be determined by comprehensively comparing the names of those with the next most votes in each district nationwide, arranging the list by the number of votes, and determining their election.

### The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Decides to Retain the Proposal to Postpone the General Election

[Mu Bao, Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The opinion of some council members that the election should be postponed was raised again at the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council on the 23rd, but it was still decided to retain it. In addition to the council members, some National Assembly representatives also have the same feeling. When the Resident Committee met on the 23rd, Cai Zhisheng, Yu Nanqiu, and Lu Qian proposed "Requesting the government to postpone various elections," listing six reasons, briefly: It is not appropriate to disperse forces and shift goals during the period of suppressing the rebellion. At a time of economic hardship, the cost of campaigning violates the principle of frugality. Campaigning scandals are unprecedented, and people of integrity disdain to campaign, while corrupt people can fortunately advance; such elections are difficult to achieve the effect of selecting the wise and capable. The degree of friendly countries' assistance to us depends entirely on our military and political strength; elections are not the point they pay attention to. The proportional allocation of seats for each party seems to need to be considered. The current situation is more difficult than it was during last year's National Assembly. Due to the circumstances of the times, it may not be possible to change the policy according to the times. The proposal put forward two methods: Request the government to quickly solicit the opinions of the National Assembly representatives by means of communication. Request the government to quickly convene a meeting of the Legislative Committee to discuss the issue of postponing the election. Many council members spoke during the discussion, and Zhang Qianhua opposed it most strongly, saying that points 3 to 6 of the reasons for the original proposal were completely unreasonable. Because there were many opponents to the proposal, it was finally decided to retain it.

### Wei Daoming Flies from Taiwan to Shanghai to Discuss Financial Issues in Taiwan Province; Will Return to Jiangxi in the Next Few Days to Elect National Representatives

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, flew to Shanghai this morning. He will visit Zhang Jia'ao, the President of the Central Bank, to discuss financial issues in Taiwan Province. The official rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender is currently set at 1:72, but the black market rate is 1:52 and is trending lower. The Bank of Taiwan lacks funds, and the exchange between Taiwan and Shanghai has not been smooth, which is one of the reasons for the devaluation of the Taiwan dollar in the black market. Another reason is that recently, some businessmen in Taiwan are collecting legal tender and taking it to Hong Kong and Guangdong to sell and buy smuggled goods. It is reported that Wei will discuss with Zhang the issue of borrowing and allocating legal tender funds and restricting the amount of legal tender that can be taken from Taiwan Province to Hong Kong and Guangdong. Wei will also return to his hometown in Jiangxi for a trip and return to Taiwan in about two weeks.

[City News] Wei Daoming, Chairman of the United Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan on the morning of the 23rd. Wei is scheduled to return to his hometown in Jiangxi within a few days to engage in activities to compete for election as a National Assembly representative.

### Lu Han Flies to Changchun and Transfers to Jilin

To Attend the Completion Ceremony of the Stele for the Soldiers of the 60th Army Suppressing the Rebellion

[Our Changchun Dispatch on the 23rd] Lu Han, accompanied by Dong Yanping, came to Changchun on the 23rd and transferred to Jilin to慰问 旧部. According to Lu, after flying to the Northeast on the 19th, he went to Jinzhou, Jiangxian, Dahu Mountain, and other places, only returning last night.

### Preliminary Meeting for Peace with Japan to Proceed as Planned by the U.S.; Our Diplomatic Measures Focus on Stance Regarding Peace Treaty with Japan; Recommendations for Participation Sent to Government for Consideration

[United Press Washington, 22nd] A State Department spokesman stated: "The United States is proceeding according to its original plan for convening a preliminary meeting for peace with Japan and hopes that China can participate. Regarding the suggestion that the Japanese peace conference be presided over by the Far Eastern Commission, the United States has not received any such suggestion from the Chinese side." This statement from the State Department seems to clarify various conflicting reports from the outside.

[United Press, Ottawa, 22nd] Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton, upon returning here on the evening of the 22nd from the Canberra Conference, stated that he hopes a conference including the Soviet Union will be held in New York in the coming days to discuss the treaty of peace with Japan. Although the conference will use a two-thirds majority voting system, opposing veto power, this procedure is deemed necessary "based on the experience in Paris."

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shih-shun reported on diplomatic measures at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 23rd, mainly reiterating our stance on the peace treaty with Japan. He stated that the opinions of the four powers should converge and that the veto power should be retained.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] At today's extraordinary meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council, thirteen suggestions regarding the content of the peace treaty from the "Recommendations of the Council Regarding the Peace Treaty with Japan" proposed by the Council's Japan Policy Research Committee, along with the two suggestions passed at the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee on the 19th, totaling fifteen suggestions, were amended and passed. They will be submitted to the government for adoption. The original text of the fifteen suggestions is recorded below: Preliminary consultations on the peace treaty with Japan should still be conducted by the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union before being submitted to a conference of the relevant eleven nations for discussion. The discussion and signing of the peace treaty with Japan should not await amendments involving the veto power (the above two points were passed at the meeting on the 19th). The Japanese Emperor system, being the embodiment of the spirit of aggression, should be abolished. Japanese military industrial facilities and heavy weaponry should be completely destroyed. The level of Japanese industry should be limited to that necessary to maintain the essential living standards of the Japanese people, and if an annual measure is necessary, it should be based on the level before 1928. The calculation of reparations should be based on the duration of the war and the public and private losses incurred during the war. Japanese domestic and overseas assets and industrial facilities (including textiles) should all be used as assets for reparations. Gold, silver, jewels, and ancient books and artifacts looted by Japan in China should all be returned to China and should not be considered as reparations. Islands outside the Japanese territory as stipulated by the Cairo Declaration, should be placed under trusteeship, with the Ryukyu Islands under Chinese trusteeship. Japanese war criminals should be promptly tried by military law and severely punished, with the aim of concluding this before the peace conference. The Japanese education system's curriculum and teaching materials should be thoroughly revised to eliminate the resurgence of aggressive ideologies. After the signing of the peace treaty, a "Supervisory and Implementation Committee" should be organized by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to supervise Japan's implementation of the peace treaty. The control period is tentatively set at 30 years, and the control period may be extended if Japan violates the peace treaty. If Japan violates the peace treaty, force may be used for sanctions, to be jointly executed by consultation between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The signing of the peace treaty should take place in China.

### Executive Yuan to Convene Small Group Meeting Today to Discuss Economic Measures

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to convene a small group meeting at 10:00 AM on the 24th to discuss important issues related to economic measures.

### Water Supply Disrupted in Most Areas of Nanjing Due to Water Plant Malfunction

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A malfunction occurred today at the city's main water plant, causing a water supply disruption in most areas.

### New Governor of Macau Indicates Intention to Ban Opium and Gambling in Macau and Assist Our Government in Combating Smuggling

[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 23rd] The newly appointed Governor of Macau, Commander [柯維利拉; transliteration], arrived in Guangzhou on the 22nd to pay a courtesy call on local authorities. He told reporters that he had lived in Macau for seven years and in Guangzhou for two years, so he was very familiar with the situation in Guangdong and Guangzhou. After taking office, he would certainly enhance friendly relations with China. Regarding the flourishing of opium and gambling in Macau, he said that he would implement a ban. As for the current smuggling that often passes through Macau, he said that if the Chinese government needs it, he will do his best to assist in combating smuggling.

### High Prices in Cold Shenyang; A Fur Coat Costs Over Ten Million

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 23rd] Prices are high in Shenyang, and the weather is cold. The outdoor temperature hovers between 60 and 65 degrees. A coat made of grey squirrel fur costs 15 million legal tender, mink down costs over 5 million, and a muskrat costs between 100,000 and 300,000. Rice costs 6.210 per catty, and pork costs 15,000 per catty.

### Our Ambassador to Sweden Presents Credentials to the Swedish King

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Our newly appointed Ambassador to Sweden, Xie Wei-lin, was received by the Swedish King on the 20th to present his credentials and handed over a portrait of Chairman Chiang as a gift. The Swedish King thanked him and asked him to convey his greetings to the Chairman.

### American Newspaper Warns Government Not to Hesitate Further on China Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain warned, as Truman and Marshall are carefully considering Wedemeyer's report on China, "The situation in China is deteriorating due to the hesitant and passive actions taken by the U.S. government." The paper also reviewed the U.S. policy toward China since the Yalta Agreement, hoping that "from now on, what we wish to do should be neither too little nor too late." The newspaper's editorial headline was "The War in China is Not a Phony War." It stated, "When we were destroying the Japanese Empire, our declared post-war policy was to help establish a strong China as a bulwark of peace in the Far East, but in reality, almost every move we made resulted in weakening China. When we carried out the Yalta deal, we forced our ally (China) to cede the privileges of Outer Mongolia, Lushun Port, Dalian, and the Northeast Railway to the Soviet Union, yet we failed to make the Soviet Union abide by its responsibilities in this transaction. Such a brutal cession of the territory and sovereignty of an allied country by the United States will inevitably cause America's prestige in China to decline to an irreparable level."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The White House announced today that the date for Wedemeyer's meeting with President Truman has not yet been decided. He may meet with Secretary Marshall before meeting with the President. At the same time, a State Department spokesperson stated that Wedemeyer's report will only be released after the President has studied it.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] A well-known foreign neutral observer and international diplomacy expert here told our agency that China should not align itself completely with either the Soviet Union or the United States. He believes that Vice Chairman Sun's statement advocating that China adopt an effective diplomatic policy, and China's taking the same stance as the Soviet Union against the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, are both pertinent. He believes that to prevent China from being subjected to Japanese aggression again, China should resolutely demand the complete disarmament of Japan and the elimination of Japan's aggressive tendencies.

### Continuous Victories in Western Shandong; Cao County Recovered; 40,000 Remnant Bandits Surrounded and in Desperate Straits; Joint Land-Sea Offensive in Jiaodong Advances on Longkou

[Our Correspondent, Yanzhou, 23rd] On the 22nd, the National Army in Southwestern Shandong recovered Cao County. After suffering heavy casualties, the remaining main force of Chen Yi's eight columns are fleeing north in disarray. The National Army is pressing forward from Dancheng, Juye, and other directions, and is massing forces to annihilate them. The situation in Southwestern Shandong has now stabilized. According to reports, in the battle of Huangguan'an and Dinglizhang in Dancheng on the 16th of this month, the National Army captured all the staff of the four puppet county governments of [鄲城; transliteration], [鉅野; transliteration], [南旺; transliteration], totaling more than 500 people. Because the bandits lack local staff to drive them, it is generally estimated that the bandits in Southwestern Shandong can be completely wiped out in a short period of time.

[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 23rd] Earlier this month, the 6th and 10th columns of the Communist bandits in Western Shandong crossed the Yellow River south from Shouzhang, and colluded with the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 8th columns of the bandits in [鄲城; transliteration]. Later, they split up and fled to the area south of Cao County and northeast of Shan County. Over the past two weeks, after being pursued, intercepted, ambushed, and encircled by the National Army, the bandits have suffered confirmed casualties of over 20,000 and 5,000 have been captured. Currently, the National Army controls the ferries on the south bank of the Yellow River. The 40,000 remaining bandits have been driven by the National Army to the triangular area of Juye, Heze, and Dingtao, and are surrounded. Lacking food and ammunition, they are in a desperate situation with no way to retreat and difficult to advance. It will not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] When Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on military affairs at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 23rd, he stated that if the Communist troops in the Northeast do not reinforce Jiaodong and the National Army continues to block them, then Yantai can be recovered within a week.

Longkou can be recovered soon. With the navy's strict control over Yantai and Weihaiwei, they have lost their effectiveness. The Communist troops have changed their external contact and supply routes to the Haiyang and Rushankou areas. The National Army has sent the navy to strengthen the blockade. [Another Dispatch] At 4:00 PM today, the National Army completely captured Qixia.

[Our Correspondent, Weixian, 23rd] The remnants of the 9th and 13th columns of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong are fleeing to the Juchi Mountain.

The militia at all levels must be directed and commanded layer by layer, but during the period of assisting in combat, they should be under the command of the senior military commander.

### Executive Yuan Orders Strict Compliance with Measures for Dealing with Communist Party Members in the Rear

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan has submitted the measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear to the National Government for approval and record. It has separately telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments to strictly comply with the regulations. The original text is as follows: The measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear, formulated by this Yuan, have been submitted to the National Government for approval and record, and are hereby circulated for enforcement. Since the old nest of the Communist bandits in Yan'an has been destroyed and the main force in Shandong has been defeated, they are running around like startled pigs, everywhere. Many of the people who were coerced into joining the chaos have defected and returned, and the bandits lurking in the rear vainly hope to take advantage of the chaos. At this time, the government should, on the one hand, take the principle of not punishing those who have been coerced, and offer amnesty to the people who have defected from the front lines, and on the other hand, hold the heart of eliminating evil, thoroughly investigate the hidden bandits in the rear, so that those who sincerely surrender will have a way to rehabilitate themselves, and those who secretly communicate with the bandits will have no chance to escape. It will be easier to quell the rebellion and get the people out of the water. The purpose of the promulgation of the measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear is just this. Now that it has been circulated by the National Government for enforcement, local governments at all levels should immediately comply with the regulations and earnestly implement them, so as to achieve real results. This is of utmost importance.

### China and the United States Should Truly Understand Each Other – Reflections After Reading Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the International Women's Conference

The International Women's Conference was held in the capital the day before yesterday, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek attended and delivered a speech, suggesting that members of the conference understand the Chinese people's thinking by studying and exploring China's cultural treasures, and hoping that they can truly understand China and become important links in promoting international understanding after returning to their countries, thereby building peace in the future world. Madame Chiang Kai-shek's original speech was very long, but two sentences are most worthy of consideration by friendly countries: She said, "China has recently undergone the pain of fire and blood, and although our heads are covered in blood, we have not lowered our heads." She also said, "Regardless of whether we receive assistance from the world or not, we are prepared to strive for success and fight to the end." Madame Chiang Kai-shek not only spoke for the people of our country, expressing the attitude we wanted to express, but also humbly requested that international mutual understanding be further promoted.

We believe that today, mutual understanding between the two major allies of China and the United States is particularly urgently needed, not only for the sake of China and the United States, but also for the peace of the future world. We firmly oppose unnecessary accusations and causing unnecessary misunderstandings to the other party.

For example, the "naive" remarks made by Mr. Acheson on the 26th of this month in an interview with the United Press, and the criticism of the "wishful thinking" made in the statement when Special Envoy Wedemeyer left China, could really have been avoided. It was reported that Mr. Sun had told a United Press reporter: "After General Wedemeyer submits his report to President Truman, the Chinese government will study whether it is more beneficial for China to unite with the United States or with the Soviet Union. If China is forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, the government and the Communist Party will inevitably reach a peaceful resolution." Therefore, American people mainly believe that "if China really has this idea, it is a 'naive' effort." And at this moment, the attitude of our Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly seems to be slightly different from the past, and on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, he insisted on using the veto power of the major powers in the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries on peace with Japan, which on the surface formed a consistent action between China and the Soviet Union. The general public is even more speculating and misunderstanding our country's current foreign policy, saying that China will follow the traditional trick of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to place itself between the United States and the Soviet Union, or that the words and deeds of the Chinese authorities are close to making empty threats. In fact, judging from the history of friendship between China and the United States, if there are any reported misunderstandings, it is not only the misfortune of the two countries, but also, as Madame Chiang Kai-shek said, there is indeed a need to intensify the promotion of international understanding.

We have no way of knowing whether the United Press's report about Mr. Sun's remarks is accurate or whether it is consistent with Mr. Sun's original intentions. Even if it is as reported by the United Press, this remark can only express Mr. Sun's personal intentions at most, and it cannot be used to judge the government's decision-making. According to reports, "official sources in Nanjing believe that Mr. Sun's recent remarks on the current situation only represent his personal views and are not enough to reflect the government's dynamics," which shows that Mr. Sun's remarks cannot represent the government's intentions, just as Mr. Wallace's remarks cannot necessarily represent American policy in every sentence. As for our country's attitude towards the peace treaty with Japan and the issue of veto power, it is originally based on our country's inherent position and cannot be confused with Mr. Sun's remarks. Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, the National Political Council and the Foreign Ministry's Peace Treaty Review Committee have carefully discussed it and both believe that the Soviet Union must participate in the peace conference with Japan, and the four major powers should retain veto power in the conference. Because China and Japan are geographically close and have suffered from the aggression of Japanese militarism for a long time, the harm is particularly severe. For its own security, it cannot allow the resurgence of Japanese aggression, so it naturally pays special attention to the peace treaty with Japan. Moreover, there are still many issues to be resolved between China and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union cannot be excluded from the peace treaty. Therefore, although China's decision-making on the peace treaty with Japan may be similar to that of the Soviet Union in appearance, it is completely based on an independent position, and its meaning may not be the same as that of the Soviet Union. Judging from the fact that Australia also advocates retaining veto power, it can be seen that countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression or been threatened by Japanese aggression all have the same feeling about this.

Speaking of our foreign policy, it has its consistent policy and firm position. When the founding father was dying, he entrusted us: "Unite with the nations of the world that treat us as equals and fight together," that is to say, we will be friends with all nations that are friendly to us. The Confucian tradition of China for two thousand years only knows loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, reverence, kinship, and good neighborliness, and will never allow us to engage in so-called "threats" or "blackmail" and other dishonorable behaviors. As for the so-called "using barbarians to control barbarians," in this day and age, there will never be such an overly "naive" person who speaks before doing. Just as Palmerston said at the time, "Britain has no permanent friends, nor permanent enemies." If we bring it up again today, it will inevitably be too "naive." We recall that when Mr. Sun made his remarks, it was just after General Wedemeyer, President Truman's special envoy, issued his statement leaving China and before he was about to provide a report. We certainly know that Mr. Wedemeyer's statement may also have good intentions, but as a special envoy, with a hasty time, the visits may not have been detailed, and the investigations may not have been completely accurate. And when the mission was completed and he was leaving China and returning home, the publication of the statement not only damaged the self-esteem of the Chinese people, but also was an impolite act for a special envoy with diplomatic status, and the indignant emotions of the Chinese people could be seen everywhere. It is the same as Mr. Sun's remarks that are easy to cause misunderstandings among American friends. Therefore, we recall Chairman Chiang's conversation with American reporters in July, which was: China "welcomes any constructive criticism." People who are reporters should especially try to reduce misunderstandings between nations. We hope that the people of both China and the United States can encourage each other in this regard.

In terms of foreign policy, China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, and the length of the border between them is unparalleled in the world. Although China and the Soviet Union have different founding ideologies, being good neighbors is undoubtedly our country's inevitable effort. As for the United States and us, we face each other across the Pacific Ocean. Since this war of resistance against Japan, the traditional friendship between China and the United States has been baptized by blood and fire and has become more solidified. We cherish the friendship between China and the United States, and we do not want to see any misunderstandings in the relationship between China and the United States, or even in China's foreign relations. Chairman Chiang said at a reception for American reporters: "The Chinese people will always be friends of the United States"! Our friendship with the United States has always been firm, and we hope that the United States' friendship with us will also always be firm.

### Lie Makes Urgent Appeal: All Countries Should Eliminate Differences; General Debate of the General Assembly Concluded Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded, and the Chairman announced a recess until Thursday.

[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: United Nations Secretary-General Lie today made a direct appeal to major powers, hoping to reconcile Eastern and Western differences, because this divergence is brewing terror and hatred all over the world. Lie's appeal was made to the United Nations General Assembly, and although he did not directly mention Marshall or Vyshinsky, the target of his appeal was clearly the United States and the Soviet Union. Lie said: "An indispensable condition for peace is the joint efforts of countries with different social systems and benefits to find a way to live together peacefully. All difficulties must be resolved through negotiations, and there should be sincerity in seeking compromise. Otherwise, international peace and security cannot be maintained." Lie said: Although differences exist between major powers, they have not yet reached the point of threatening the survival of the United Nations organization, but they are enough to hinder the activities of the United Nations, making it impossible for it to exert its due effect. He also said: "I do not believe that these differences will lead to war, because all countries in the world hope to prevent another war from happening. The greatest difficulty today is the mutual suspicion between major powers, and the psychology of fear is the greatest danger, because fear can produce hatred, and hatred can create a crisis, which is an inevitable trend." Lie believes that the United Nations

### Soviet Representative Launches Another Attack on the United States

[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: After United Nations Secretary-General Lie made an urgent appeal, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately began to speak, attacking the United States for submitting the Korean issue to the General Assembly with all his might, and advocated that the issue be removed from the agenda, on the grounds that the Korean issue should be handled jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union, and that the United States' move clearly violated the US-Soviet agreement. In addition, Vyshinsky expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the inclusion of the issue of revising the peace treaty with Italy on the agenda, believing that this move was untimely and lacked legal basis, because the period from the time the treaty was ratified was only one week. Some countries obviously want to use the revision of the peace treaty with Italy as a means to achieve their selfish goals, he said.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] After the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan approved the final report of the conference, the chairman of the last meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, gave a speech at the meeting, asking the United States to accept Europe's demands, pointing out that Europe has paid the greatest price in life, suffering, and destruction, and this is not a plea for pity. The American people and Congress should now decide whether to allow Europe to help build world peace and prosperity. The misfortune of Europe will cause the collapse of most of the world's economic system. Bevin then urged the participating countries not to be affected by any divisive forces and to continue the reconstruction plan.

Within Months

A New Situation Will Arise Bevin said: Within weeks, at most months, we will face the world's only situation. Poverty, famine, and widespread unemployment, although they have existed in the past, were all caused by the destruction of law and order, or the collapse of the world's economic system; today, Europe's needs cannot be met only because of the lack of a way to pay foreign debts. After this crisis is fully developed, there is no historical precedent to judge what form it will take. French Acting Foreign Minister Taittinger then gave a speech, expressing regret for the inability of all European countries to participate in the conference, and declared that the door is still open, and countries that have not participated can still participate.

Italian Famine

Will Cause Revolution Italian Foreign Minister Sforza said that if the lack of bread in Italy continues for another two or three months, a revolution will inevitably break out. This is not the result of doctrine, but the result of famine.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The report unanimously passed by the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall European Aid Plan has been published simultaneously in Paris and London after the meeting.

For the Next Four Years

Need More Than 20 Billion It is estimated that the amount of aid needed by Europe in the next four years is US$22.44 billion. Except for the US$3.11 billion that is hoped to be provided by the International Reconstruction Bank to purchase major equipment, the remaining US$19.33 billion needs to be allocated by the United States. In addition, in order to restore the financial stability of several European countries and fulfill the production plan under the European self-help plan, another US$3 billion in aid is needed. This self-help plan is scheduled to be completed in 1951, and its content includes restoring pre-war grain production, increasing pre-war food rations and supply, and increasing coal production to 30 million tons more than before the war, and increasing power generation to two-thirds more than before the war.

### Domestic and International Situations Become Increasingly Urgent; Important Consultations in the White House; Truman to Announce Decisions on the Weekend

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] It is reported that President Truman is considering possible answers to urgent issues such as high domestic prices and overseas hunger on the 23rd. It is also heard that his final decision will include whether to convene a special parliament, how to compensate for the shortages in Europe, and to what extent to require the American people to economize.

The main points of the plan submitted to the President by the Truman Cabinet Food Committee on the 23rd are: Not taking firm emergency action, but only strictly reducing American grain exports, which may have an effect on reducing American inflation, but may hinder American foreign policy. Slightly reduce grain exports, and at the same time implement a comprehensive automatic food rationing plan, so that there is surplus food available for export. It is reported that most of the President's senior advisors advocate adopting this solution, believing that it is a moderate approach. Strive to reach 567 million bushels of grain, which can be compared with last year's record-breaking export. This will be a non-voluntary austerity plan, and the government must be granted the necessary powers by convening a special session of Congress. The last approach is obviously no longer under discussion. Most senior officials seem to have agreed that by the time an effective control plan can be implemented, it will be too late. Even Marshall has lost his enthusiasm for convening a special Congress. According to a senior Republican congressional leader, if a special Congress is convened, it must be until December, at which time it will be only a few weeks away from the regular congressional session in January. Judging from various situations, Truman clearly has no intention of convening a meeting quickly, and it is reported that he is willing to make a decision after listening to opinions from all parties.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The American policy that will affect the fate of Europe this winter is being carefully discussed by President Truman and his cabinet members. The meetings held today include: A cabinet food problem group meeting composed of Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. A two-hour meeting was held today to formulate a plan to increase food exports as much as possible and suppress domestic food prices. Marshall is now going to the White House to report to the President on the diplomatic situation, especially focusing on the needs of Europe. A meeting of all cabinet members will be held at lunch time at the White House. After the meeting, the President, accompanied by his special economic advisor Steelman, will hold another meeting with the cabinet food group to listen to its report. The results of these meetings will produce the American government's decision-making to deal with the domestic crisis and the European economic crisis. It is reported that Truman may announce his plan this weekend.

### British and American Rescue Efforts Fail; Petkov Hanged

[Reuters, Sofia, 23rd] Bulgarian opposition leader Nikola Petkov, leader of the National Agrarian Union, was executed by hanging in the northern suburbs of Sofia at midnight yesterday. His appeal after being sentenced to death was rejected by the Supreme Court as unreasonable. Petkov was arrested three months ago for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the government and was sentenced to death. The British and American governments repeatedly protested to the Bulgarian government, the Allied Control Council in Sofia, and Moscow, demanding a re-examination of Petkov's death sentence and protesting the method of the trial, but were all rejected.

### Dutch Government Announces Policy Toward Indonesia; Report of the Consular Corps to be Completed This Week

[Reuters, The Hague, 23rd] Dutch Prime Minister Beel announced Indonesia policy in the Lower House today, saying it would immediately abolish the Dutch Committee in Batavia and set up a central agency to negotiate with the Republic of Indonesia. He also revealed that the Dutch government would submit a bill to Congress to amend the Dutch Constitution so that the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies could establish a new relationship. Beel said he believed the report of the consular corps in Batavia would be beneficial to the Netherlands. He also said that the situation in Indonesia cannot continue like this and hoped that the Security Council would pay attention. Governor-General Van Mook can return to Batavia from Ceylon tonight. At the same time, the consular corps in Batavia held another meeting this morning, and its investigation report is expected to be completed this weekend.

### Mrs. Pandit Broadcasts, Urging Attention to the Suffering of the People of Asia

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union and chief representative to the General Assembly, Mrs. Pandit, tonight broadcast a speech to the Far East, pointing out that the world is paying daily attention to the famine threat in Europe, but comparatively little attention is paid to the suffering of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. Mrs. Pandit said that India's pursuit of freedom, peace, and justice is more enthusiastic than any other country in the world. We should do our best to strengthen the United Nations organization. The Indian people feel that the division of India is a painful blow. We hope that through our work within and outside the United Nations organization, India and Pakistan can recognize the division of land in the short term, and it should not be a "division of interests" for the people of the two countries. Mrs. Pandit continued, in order to maintain world peace, we deeply hope that the Netherlands can recognize how Britain has abandoned its right to rule other countries in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Mrs. Pandit then condemned the current war propaganda, pointing it out as dangerous propaganda, which would lead to war in the long run.

### Japanese Zaibatsu Groups Strive to Resist; Elimination of Economic Power Concentration Act; Demand the Implementation of "Autonomous" Financial Control

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The coalition cabinet led by Tetsuo Katayama, the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party, intends to express some forms of economic democratization in the Economic Power Concentration Elimination Act because the state-owned coal project has not fully implemented the Socialist Party's policies. However, the contents of the bill immediately aroused strong opposition from the Japanese Zaibatsu forces.

Recently, the Economic Doyukai, led by Sozo Hotta, vice president of Sumitomo Bank, one of the four major Japanese Zaibatsu, issued a so-called "Financial Control Democratization Plan" to resist. The main points of the plan are as follows: Establish a financial committee composed of private financial institutions, the Bank of Japan, and representatives of depositors to implement the first-person non-bureaucratic financial control. Each financial institution shall follow the principle that each shareholder shall not hold more than one-twentieth of the total capital stock. Reorganize special financial institutions, implement the unification of financial administration, and open up local finance, allowing the establishment of local banks.

### Japanese Floods Have Not Receded; Epidemics Follow

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] In Tokyo, Japan, the Edogawa, Katsushika, Adachi and other districts, the water depth was still eight inches as of 5:00 pm today, which has decreased slightly compared to yesterday, but seventeen cases of cholera and twenty cases of typhoid fever have now occurred, and there is an increase in cases. The Ministry of Health and Welfare is currently busy with epidemic prevention work.

### Soviet Satellite Countries Speak, Involving Our Country

[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 22nd] After British Representative McNeil gave a speech, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Schmiek reiterated the Soviet Union's criticisms of Western countries at the United Nations General Assembly today, saying, "According to official American data, the amount of war materials shipped to China by the United States in the first three months after the cessation of hostilities was even more than the total amount of materials shipped to China during World War II. How will the countries that accept this large amount of aid fare? How is China?" Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky also criticized the United States' aid to China, saying, "This action by the United States violates the prohibition of the United Nations Charter against interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and shameless war profiteers continue to support the reactionary groups in China, Palestine, and Greece."

### Reconstructing Siberia to Become the Heart of the Soviet Union; Stalin's Ideal Can Be Realized

[United Press, New York, 23rd] Raymond, the former head of the Soviet Economic Department of the Army Department, wrote in the "United Nations World" magazine today, reporting that Stalin's dream of transforming Siberia into the heart of the Soviet Union is about to be realized. According to records, the Soviet Union has secretly built 100 new industrial cities in accordance with the current five-year plan, and is striving to turn a wilderness into a key production center, which shows that the Soviet Union is taking steps to revive the industrial economy destroyed by the war. Although very few people in the country know about these cities, and the latest maps do not include them, only a few have been named, and the rest are temporarily collectively referred to as "Besimyanka," which means "nameless city," and are awaiting the use of Stalin and Molotov's names to change and then call them. The purpose of building these cities is not to promote or attract tourists, but to accommodate large factories, hydroelectric power plants, mines, and railway junctions, and to provide housing for hundreds of thousands of workers from all over the country.

### "Mechanical Brain" Pilots Airplane Successfully Across the Atlantic

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The US Air Force announced today that a C-54 four-engine Skymaster aircraft has safely crossed the Atlantic Ocean without pilot control, arriving at Brize Norton near Oxford, England. The plane took off from Stephenville, Newfoundland, at 11:00 PM on Sunday and arrived at Brize Norton ten hours and fifteen minutes later, a total distance of 2,400 miles. This unmanned flight was a US Air Force test flight. It is said that this unmanned aircraft is controlled by a complete "mechanical brain." Everything related to the flight, including time, radio waves, and driving, is automatically controlled by the machine. Before takeoff, the "mechanical brain" only needs to be aligned, and then the destination indicator button is pressed, which automatically calculates the required time, speed, and head and tail wind speeds, so that it can arrive at the destination at a certain time. There were fourteen people on board this test flight, including nine reserve pilots for emergency use. However, no one touched the controls during the entire journey. This is the first unmanned flight across the Atlantic in history.

British Chief Representative to the UN, McNeil, yesterday condemned the Soviet Union (British Information Office)

### Second Day of Senate Assembly: Many Inquiries Raised on Municipal Facilities, Mostly Regarding Police and Social Affairs

[Report from this newspaper] The fourth session of the Municipal Senate Assembly held its second meeting yesterday from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Senators raised inquiries regarding the city's civil affairs, police affairs, social affairs, finance, and health. Mayor Wu, Director Zhang Xiaosong, Director Yu Shuping, Director Tian Yongqian, and Director Wu Kaixian then answered them one by one. Health issues will be answered this afternoon according to the agenda. At the same time, inquiries will also be raised regarding public utilities, public works, land administration, health, and education administration, which will then be answered by the relevant directors. The senators' inquiries and the directors' replies are recorded separately below.

(1) Social Affairs: Zhang Zhongyuan inquired: The regulations for donations for municipal construction for automobiles stipulate that 3.6 billion should be used for relief, but when visiting the children's home, why was it said that only rice was received (enough to eat until next New Year) and no money was received? The children's home on MacTaggart Road, which had 200 children, has been moved to Caohejing Children's Home, and the original site has been converted into a women's home. However, the original place could accommodate 200 people, so why are only 20 women now being accommodated? Can the Social Bureau continue to take in street children in the future? Lu Huiming asked about the organizational situation of the women's home and hoped that it could accommodate more prostitutes, etc., so that they could learn handicrafts to make a legitimate living.

### Carrying Mauser Pistols to Rob People: Difficulties in Managing the Home. Director Wu Felt Ashamed for Being Unable to Cope.

Mayor Wu first replied that the reason why the women's home cannot accommodate more people after the children's home was converted into a women's home is due to the lack of funds and food. Director Wu replied that the budgeted revenue for the relief fund from the automotive construction donation for the first half of the year should be 1.79732 billion yuan, but the Social Bureau itself has not yet received it. Previously, 1 billion yuan was borrowed from the Municipal Bank at an interest rate of 2%, which has been used to purchase rice, so it is a fact that the children's home only received rice and no money. In the past, the central government stipulated that the food expenses for the shelter should be 16,000 yuan per person per month. After submitting a request, the central government has approved an increase to 25,000 yuan from September. The management of the women's home is actually very difficult. For example, if a prostitute is taken in, someone will come to rob her after three to five days. One prostitute came to the home, and a man suddenly came and said he was her husband and depended on her for support. If the prostitute entered the home, he would have no food to eat. An old woman said that after her daughter-in-law entered the home, she and her grandson had nothing to live on and insisted on taking her back. They initially used soft tactics, and then brought Mauser pistols. Finally, they led plainclothes or armed men to rob her. As many as a dozen people have been robbed in this situation. Such strange phenomena in Shanghai and the deterioration of social customs to this point make me feel ashamed that I cannot cope with it. I have now contacted the police bureaus of various branches and asked them to send armed police officers to protect them at any time. However, the expansion of relief efforts is also urgent. According to my idea, it is best to send old women, children, and husbands to the shelter. The surplus funds from the construction donation are intended to expand the relief funds. Street children will continue to be taken in to ensure that the shelter is not vacant.

### Truth About the Shandong Native Association Dispute

Fei Shusheng requested the truth about the Shandong Native Association dispute in Shanghai be made public. Director Wu replied: This issue is very complicated. The Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road was established in the teens of the Republic of China. During the enemy-puppet period, Su Chengde became the president and changed it to the Native Association, which is actually unreasonable, because the Shandong Guild Hall is a financial group, while the Native Association is a social group. Later, the association ran Wuxun School, which was run by the Democratic League. Since it was not registered and there were frequent disturbances, after investigation, it was found that the school was run by the former subordinates of Su Chengde of the Shandong Native Association. In order to maintain social stability, the government ordered the school to be closed. However, the school's principals, Zhang Naiqi and others, refused, so it had no choice but to order the guild hall to stop its activities and run the school. After mediation by various parties, in addition to the original eleven principals of the guild hall, four young Shandong people were added to jointly organize a Native Association, but this was opposed by the old committee members. Then, Ma Deng published an advertisement, and it was said that the advertisement cost 50 million yuan. Standing in the position of supervising social organizations, I have the right to handle it. Moreover, it is not appropriate for both parties to independently initiate the organization of social groups of the same nature, so I ordered them to merge.

Social Organizations Must Have a Legitimate Mission

Fei Shusheng also asked: When citizens organize social groups and register with the Social Bureau, why are some approved and some are not approved? The Director replied: At present, there are often groups applying for approval, but after investigation, it is found that many of them use the name to collect huge membership fees from members or arrange fights, so they are not approved. The purpose of statutory organizations should be pure, and they should at least have a special and legitimate mission. Those that are solely for the purpose of maintaining relationships are actually unnecessary.

Zhou Lianze said that the fixed amount of 30,000 yuan for public pawnbroking is too small and should be increased to 200,000 or 300,000. Answer: The establishment of public pawnbroking is to help the common people. Any damaged items are accepted, and nine out of ten are not redeemed. Therefore, funds are limited, and if it is increased too high, the truly poor will not be able to pawn anything.

### Banning Without Aftercare Is Very Troublesome

Lu Huiming inquired about how to solve the aftercare problem for unemployed dancers after the ban on dance halls by lottery, and Zhang Zhihan also said: The government should carefully consider the austerity plan, otherwise it will cause social unrest. It is unreasonable for the government to regard dancers as floods and beasts. Who doesn't have children? No one prepares their daughters to be dancers when they grow up. The reason for this is out of necessity.

Director Wu's reply to this question said: Senator's proposal said "It is better to regulate dance than to ban dance." I think it is not easy to regulate dance halls strictly. However, the problem of relief for unemployed dancers is very troublesome. At the last municipal meeting, Mayor Wu asked me what to do, and I answered him, "There is no way," only "get married." To put it bluntly, the life of dancers is too extravagant. They are used to eating and wearing well, and the relief center cannot afford to support them, and they cannot live there. So it is better to get married and live a comfortable life.

### Regarding the Jindu Massacre, the Director Once Requested Punishment

(2) Police Affairs: Zhang Zhihan asked to report on the handling results of the Jindu Massacre. Traffic in this city is chaotic, and tragedies easily occur. Empty tricycles and rickshaws often travel slowly on the road, greatly hindering traffic. It is necessary to strictly ban them. Director Yu replied: The part of the Jindu incident involving military police has been finalized in Nanjing. As for the police part, the criminal part will be tried by the judicial authorities, and the administrative part, the director of the Xincheng Branch, has been demoted. Laoza, Huangpu, and Songshan also had student police officers participating at the time, so the directors of each bureau were given a major demerit. As for myself, I also have dereliction of duty and have requested the mayor to punish me. Empty cars wandering on the road are always urged to pay attention. However, a part of them come from the suburbs and have no customers to pick up when they go back, which inevitably hinders traffic. It is decided to strictly ban them.

Zhang Zhongyuan said: Rickshaw and tricycle cushions are sometimes taken away by the police. If they are not returned for a day, it will affect their livelihood for a day. It is necessary to adopt a fine method. The Director replied: I also sympathize with the fact that car cushions are taken away. I have repeatedly ordered my subordinates not to do so, but according to police reports, they have repeatedly violated the rules and will not listen to warnings. There is really no other way.

### Yang Anren: Haggard. Only in Prison for a Dozen Days. No Longer the Heroic Posture of the Past

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Anren, the deputy director of the National Bank Operations Bureau who was sentenced to seven years in prison for the Jinchao case, was brought out from the Sinan Road Detention Center at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yang was mentally depleted, with a pale complexion and dull eyes, wearing an old white canvas suit, a blue turn-down collar shirt, and old yellow leather shoes. He has only been in prison for more than ten days, and he no longer has the heroic posture of the past. He was first escorted to the Grand Court for trial, and then escorted to the Eighth Investigation Court to be interrogated by Prosecutor Chuan Bang about whether he was detained during the trial period, so that it could be deducted from his sentence. Yang replied that he was detained by the Garrison Command for one day when the case occurred, so Yang's sentence for the case is seven years less one day. At 4:30 PM, after the interrogation, he was returned to the detention center. It is said that Yang will be transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution within days.

### Dancers Shout Loudly: I Don't Want to Get Married! Another General Meeting Calls for a Postponement of the Dance Ban

[Report from this newspaper] Amid the call to ban dancing, the city's dance hall industry made another appeal. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the second temporary general meeting was held at the New Xianlin Dance Hall. Representatives from 29 dance halls in the city, dancers, musicians, and dance industry workers, totaling about 20,000 people, arrived in large trucks early in the morning. The scene inside and outside New Xianlin once again resembled the crowded scene of the previous time. Nearly 4,000 dancers were still wearing cloth shoes and blue shirts, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, lying down on the lawn in front of New Xianlin, like a group of refugees. They were in stark contrast to the huge, dull neon lights on the roof of New Xianlin, making people feel that prosperity is like a dream.

After the meeting, the leaders of the congress presidium, Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, Tang Zongjie, Mao Zhihai, etc., delivered speeches one after another, repeatedly stating that dance halls are legitimate businesses and have nothing to do with austerity. If austerity is enough to create unemployment, then the parents, children, and livelihoods of tens of thousands of dance industry workers will also be cut off. Therefore, they called on the authorities that if they really want to limit the time for the lottery to ban dance, they should also give three to five years of sufficient time so that they can find ways to change careers calmly. Subsequently, dancers' representatives Sun Zhimin and Jin Meihong gave speeches. Sun shouted, "We demand the right to continue living!" Jin frequently shouted, "I don't want to get married!" Both were passionate and completely changed their weeping appearance last time. In order to maintain order at the meeting yesterday, the male and female seats were separated on the left and right in advance. There were many old women and children in the female seats, all of whom were family members brought by the dancers. When Jin and Sun gave impassioned speeches, they listened attentively, seemed deeply moved, and some quietly wiped away tears with handkerchiefs.

### Senator's Wonderful Speech: Dancing Can Cure Chilblains

Hu Yunyuan, representative of the Dance Industry Workers' Union, took the stage and said, "If our demands cannot be realized, we will go to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to cry!" Before he finished speaking, a burst of applause followed. Musician representative Aranas then said in a relaxed tone: "Many foreigners are rushing to Shanghai to visit dance halls because Shanghai dance halls have a special atmosphere. If this atmosphere is eliminated, it will be a great disappointment!" The audience responded with a burst of applause. When Senator Zhu Wende spoke to the point that "Dancing can cure chilblains, and music can relieve boredom. Why should it be banned?", applause and cheers erupted inside and outside, lasting for a long time.

Dispatch Ten Representatives to Petition the Senate

The conference decided to send representatives Sun Hongyuan, Sun Suiren, Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Xu Tianbing, Chen Yaoting, He Hai, Zheng Zhongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and Aranas to the Senate at 3:00 PM to petition. Senators Wang Xianqing and Tao Baichuan received them on behalf of the Senate. Sun Zhimin presented two letters from the city's dancers to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, totaling 818 letters, and Sun Hongyuan and Aranas expressed their opinions. Wang and Tao agreed to forward them and earnestly urged the representatives to understand the principle of "stability first" and wait patiently for the authorities to give instructions. The authorities will definitely take into account Shanghai's special environment as much as possible and formulate a satisfactory solution. After receiving a definite answer, the representatives left one after another.

### Swift Action to Search for Hoarded Goods, Uncovering a Group Hoarding Fuel, Totaling Thousands of Tons Worth Hundreds of Millions, Requesting the Establishment of Another Review Committee for Verification

[Report from this newspaper] The skyrocketing prices of gasoline, motor oil, and fuel oil in the city were actually caused by a group manipulating hoarding behind the scenes. After Mayor Wu received this report, he immediately sent personnel to investigate secretly and submitted a list of the hoarding oil merchants to the Police Bureau's Economic Section yesterday morning. After Director Xu consulted Director Ruan, he immediately dispatched a large number of officers, divided into 14 groups, and set off to inspect simultaneously. By 6:00 PM, a total of more than a thousand tons of various oils had been inspected, worth about hundreds of millions of yuan. The Yongda Kerosene Factory on Gaoyang Road hoarded 1,000 tons of diesel, 550 cans of kerosene, and 37 barrels. Wang Congquan at No. 361 Poyang Road hoarded 16 barrels of light diesel, 2,222 barrels of medium diesel, and 1,149 barrels of heavy diesel.

Zhengtai Company on Waitan Road hoarded 600 barrels of motor oil and another 321 cans, and Tongsheng Oil Company at No. 1018 Haining Road hoarded 875 barrels of diesel and car oil, 6 cans of Vaseline, and 82 barrels of kerosene. In addition, 270 barrels of diesel were found at No. 272 Manzhou Road. Cai Yinsen at No. 965 Beijing East Road hoarded 139 cans of kerosene and 60 barrels of diesel. Yuan Shunxing Oil Shop at No. 260 Hailaer Road hoarded 343 barrels of kerosene, 122 barrels of diesel, 74 barrels of motor oil, and 8 barrels of asphalt.

Mo Laoda at No. 116 Jiangjia Lane, Kangding Road, hoarded 147 barrels of kerosene. Chen Qingzhang at No. 10 Ruxiang Lane, Tangjiawan, hoarded 48 barrels of car oil, 7 barrels of motor oil, 7 barrels of gasoline, 20 barrels of kerosene, 156 barrels of white oil, 26 barrels of large bag oil, and 9 barrels of Vaseline. He Xingzhi at No. 266 Zhonghua Road hoarded 130 barrels of kerosene, 38 barrels of motor oil, 55 cans of motor oil, 41 cans of kerosene, and 19 barrels of diesel. Shen Bailu at No. 91 Xinjian Road hoarded 126 barrels of diesel and 29 cans of kerosene. The above-mentioned hoarded oils that were seized were sealed and handed over to the parties for safekeeping and reported to the mayor for verification that evening. Director Xu believes that the work of auditing all the seized account books is a major responsibility and has requested the director to set up another review committee for verification, so as to handle it accordingly.

### Truth About the Bloodshed Case on Haifang Road Comes to Light: Apprentice Expelled and Takes Revenge

[Report from this newspaper] The Jining Police Bureau has solved the Haifang Road bloodshed case, and the truth has come to light. It is reported that the deceased, Shen Youren, opened a copper lock factory in Nanxiang during the occupation. An apprentice, He Xiulin, was expelled due to bad character and held a grudge. He then colluded with Shen Huada to attack Shen. After repeated twists and turns, the police bureau learned from another apprentice of the deceased, Pan Hesheng, the whereabouts of the murderer's hideout. The chief Chen Kaizhou personally led his staff Yuan Qiqi and police officer Tan Yangsheng to arrest him. He is currently being interrogated by the police bureau.

.Oil Problem Solved

### China Airlines Will Not Suspend Flights

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the oil problem of China Airlines, the Regulatory Committee has today approved the quantity declared by the company and included it in the import quota.

### Health Center Accused of Negligence, Director Makes Some Justifications

The Infant Care Health Center, because the Song Tianlin infant in the foster care department of the second branch of the hospital died of illness, the parents accused the hospital of negligence and the doctor of being irresponsible, and sued the hospital to the District Prosecutor's Office. The director of the hospital, Dean Jun, made a statement on this matter to make some justifications.

### Expand Austerity Propaganda, Advocate Small Gifts and No Gifts

The preparatory meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Austerity Propaganda Committee was held yesterday. It was decided to organize the Shanghai Municipal Austerity Propaganda Committee to expand austerity propaganda. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, it is suggested that the Municipal Government issue a notice to the heads of all agencies, advocating the "no gifts" movement to cultivate a spirit of austerity.

### Jeep Accident Case: Driver George Interrogated

[Report from this newspaper] Romanian George Barber, driver of the American War Dead Repository in Shanghai, drove a yellow jeep at 0:25 AM on the 21st of this month in front of No. 134 Tongfu Road and knocked down a tricycle, killing the rickshaw puller Wang Zhongxing. The perpetrator driver George was arrested and confessed after interrogation. He was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, where Prosecutor Liang Shunsheng interrogated him. He also admitted to the crime. Because George is suspected of causing death due to negligence in his work, he was ordered to be detained temporarily.

The Mayor also replied: The traffic in this city is chaotic, and the main roads are too narrow, which has a great impact. The widening of Tianmu Road will be very beneficial, but residents have come to petition again. However, for the benefit of the majority of people, the Municipal Government has to sacrifice the interests of the minority.

### Crazy Gambling in Small Teahouses from New Year's to Now

Li Shuzi asked the Police Bureau to strictly prohibit gambling, saying that villagers in the suburbs play mahjong and use rice as bets, with some using five dou of rice as one spade, and there is a small teahouse that has never closed at night since the New Year, gambling day and night. The Director replied: Those who gamble in public places will be punished for breaking the law. In August, 47 people were arrested for gambling, and stricter measures will be taken in the future.

Zhang Zhongyuan said that prostitutes soliciting customers on the street should be banned and sent to women's homes. Answer: Dealing with the problem of prostitutes is very difficult. Many are arrested every day, but they return to their old ways after being released, which is difficult to deal with. However, we must strengthen our efforts.

Zhou Xuexiang said that the police cars are badly damaged and should be improved immediately. Wang Guoxian said that the fire-fighting equipment is also poor. The Director replied: This is actually limited by maintenance. I hope the Senate will mobilize citizens to donate.

### Committee to Study the Treatment of Soldiers and Police

Shi Zongde said that the management of vegetable markets along the road is ineffective. The Director replied: Vegetable vendors in the vegetable markets are crowding outside the market to compete for business, and strict management must be strengthened.

Wang Weiyin and Zhao Yangxiong also raised the issue of police treatment. The Mayor said that the treatment of civil servants and police officers is regulated by the central government and cannot be changed. I hope the Senate will help find other ways to improve it.

After a lengthy secret investigation, it was discovered that the Futong Printing House on Weihaiwei Road was the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda organ in Shanghai. On the night of the 19th of this month, personnel were dispatched to search the premises, arresting over twenty CCP members and seizing a large quantity of documents inciting worker and student unrest. Among them were Wu Kewen, Zhang Zhongzhi, Wang Hailin, [character unclear], Lian Yaokun, and Wang Jiaxiong, six individuals in charge of the Electricity Workers' Union who were involved in the work. Several secret orders from the CCP Central Committee were found on Wu Kewen's person.

### Citizen Death, Suspected Infant Mortality: Mayor Frankly Admits He Had Not Paid Attention to Statistics

Regarding finance: Shi Zongde stated that the collection of the automotive municipal construction donation was not individually notified, only announced publicly, and citizens who did not pay attention were fined for late payment, resulting in significant losses. Director Tian replied: In the future, individual notices will be sent to vehicle owners to pay the donation. However, in reality, the income from fines is limited.

Regarding civil affairs: Wang Weiyin inquired whether the city's household registration survey was accurate, expressing considerable doubt. He noted that the city's population in July of this year was 4,300,630, while the number of deaths was only 2,634, resulting in a mortality rate of only seven per thousand. He pointed out that it is rare for any country's population mortality rate to be below fifteen per thousand and that studies indicate that China's average mortality rate is typically above thirty per thousand. Director Zhang responded: The city's mortality rate is seven per thousand. In 1933, the national rate was eight per thousand. The rates in various countries are also similar: France eight per thousand, the Netherlands also eight per thousand. Population deaths in the city are not subject to mandatory registration, and deaths of young children, etc., are often not reported.

Shi Zongde stated that the reports from the Central Meteorological Observatory are often inaccurate, affecting travel and safety, and requested that the city government pay attention. Mayor Wu replied: I have not paid attention to this matter, I am very ashamed. I often transfer attention to the Academia Sinica, but this matter requires decades of experience and sophisticated technology. Zhang Naizuo stated that the work of the city government bureaus cannot be coordinated and will suggest organizing a municipal inspection and improvement team to inspect various districts daily. The mayor expressed acceptance of this criticism. Chen Baotai also questioned that half of the buildings in the Shanghai Sanatorium on Daxilu are staff dormitories of the Health Bureau and that dances are held there. Schools are being built on small vegetable markets, turning them into apartments. He requested that the mayor conduct an inspection.

### Wu Tiecheng Sends Letter to Mayor: Abandons Shanghai Election

Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, sent letters to Mayor Wu and Chairman Fang yesterday, stating: "Esteemed Guozhen, greetings. In this year's National Assembly election, the public sentiment is fervent. Tiecheng has frequently been urged by comrades and friends in Shanghai to participate in the Shanghai election. They said that the citizens love me and have unanimously recommended me. Their words are earnest, and I am deeply grateful and moved. I have been a Shanghai citizen for over thirty years and have served as a public servant for over five years. Every time I return to Shanghai, it feels like returning to my hometown. When I meet with local people, whether I know them or not, they treat me as one of their own and joyfully reminisce. This deep affection is something Tiecheng will never forget. If I could be elected in Shanghai this time, I would not only be delighted but also consider it the highest honor. Unexpectedly, elders and brothers in Guangdong have sent a flurry of letters and telegrams, urging me to compete in Guangdong, and they have already registered me as a candidate in the original constituency. I dare not disobey the wishes of the elders, and it would be inappropriate to halt their efforts. After repeated consideration, I can only agree to run in Guangdong. Tiecheng is indeed a Shanghai citizen, and in future elections, I will still go to Shanghai to vote, fulfilling my duty as a citizen. However, I deeply regret that I cannot participate in the Shanghai election this time. The kindness and affection of the people of Shanghai towards Tiecheng will be forever etched in my heart. I hope the Mayor will understand. I hereby announce this and extend my respects. Citizen Wu Tiecheng."

### Autumn in Huludao

(Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, 18th) The autumn in Huludao appears particularly desolate and lonely; this is the first impression the reporter received. Looking out from the harbor, the vast expanse of water is boundless. There are no chimneys and no sails, only seagulls frolicking there. The three docks are all quiet. A 6,000-ton freighter is docked, having already unloaded ammunition and guns, fully loading three trains. Three or five soldiers are wandering on the dock. One soldier is laboriously catching a small fish. Commercial ships are prohibited from entering here; it only swallows and spits out war materials. There is no smell of money, and no traces of wealthy merchants or ordinary tourists. Judging from the notices posted by the port headquarters, there have been smuggling and black market activities. History has destined Huludao to be lonely. When our government began construction in April of the 19th year of the Republic, the Japanese did everything possible to obstruct it. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese developed Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen), making Huludao look like a ghost guarding the west coast of Liaodong Bay. History has taken a step forward. Today, we must re-evaluate the value of Huludao, and to value the Northeast, we must value this only gateway at present.

There are small hills rising from the sea on the island. To the right of the hills, there is a fishing port that produces a large amount of hair shrimp. The reporter crossed over the back of the hill, and a scene from "Song of the Fishermen" unfolded before his eyes. Going down the slope to the fishing village, this village has 180 households, about 1,200 people, all relying on hair shrimp for a living. The total annual income reaches 240 billion yuan (circulation currency). 60% of the income is in the hands of a few shipowners. The fishermen work hard but cannot get enough to eat. A fishing boat hires four fishermen. For every ten catties of fish caught, the shipowner gets six catties, and each fisherman can only get one catty of fish. The highest annual income for a fisherman is 600,000 yuan, and the lowest is 200,000 yuan, which is not enough to eat sorghum rice and corn. The faces of the fisherman do not have the color of a sailor; they have been eroded by hunger. In this corner of the island, the vast majority of good people are living a life of humiliation and poverty. The cause of social instability may lie here.

When leaving this small island, I looked out at the harbor; the sea breeze howled, and the waves surged. It was the sight of the autumn tide coming in! (Reporter Zhao Zhan) The second dock of Huludao Port (Northeast News Agency photo)

Regarding schools that are striving tirelessly despite economic difficulties, I cited Fudan and Nankai as examples, but I did not list these two schools as being the foremost. I am currently in charge of Fudan's affairs and cannot proclaim it as number one, as that would be boastful. The current trend of self-aggrandizement is extremely alarming, and I dare not follow suit.

### University Sports Meet to be Held on Double Tenth Day

The university sports meet, organized by the Municipal Sports Field, which was postponed twice last semester due to rain and student unrest, has now been decided to be rescheduled for Double Tenth Day. Because the various prizes have already been prepared, the invitation nature of the previous semester has been cancelled. All public and private universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools in this city can register to participate as a school unit. The meet is divided into male and female groups, and the events remain the same. The registration period is from October 1st to 5th. The procedures will be announced in the coming days and will be sent separately to each school. According to the person in charge of the sports field, if the open sports meet scheduled by the Sports Association to be held on the same day is not cancelled due to the rescheduling of the city-wide sports meet, then it will still be combined with the university sports meet at the sports field to save costs.

He enjoys all kinds of sports, especially tennis. His tennis skills are exquisite, with excellent serving placement, long shots, and short shots. In his previous match against Hou Kaitian, he demonstrated unparalleled power. It is not easy to achieve such results at such a young age.

### Night Scene at the Lido; Record of the Opening of Xiangdao Swimming Pool

[Our Hong Kong Correspondent] Autumn has cooled, and the Lido's opening at this time is indeed somewhat out of season, but given the lack of swimming pools these days, and the appearance it presents after the renovation, it is already a "Lido Garden." I think there will still be many attractive aspects.

The Lido was requisitioned by the Air Force last year and was only recently returned. After some refurbishment, it has a unique flavor. Its swimming pool facilities are not much different from the "Continent" in Shanghai, but the diving platform is more complete than the "Continent." Moreover, the Lido faces the sea in the back, with some slight natural charm, and is not "vulgar." What is even more exciting is the open-air dance floor.

On the green grass, tables and chairs are arranged. There is intoxicating music, fine wine, and you can also enjoy a cup of deep-flavored coffee. The sea breeze blows, the seductive lights, and the charming moonlight create a great place! On Mid-Autumn Festival night, as long as there is no rain, there will be no shortage of guests here.

Due to the rain, the Lido's "ribbon-cutting" opening was postponed to the 7th. After 5:00 PM, the eastbound "Qingjivan" tram was very crowded, and many people went to the "Lido" to join the fun. Guo Quan, Weng Shijian, Cao Ke'an, and prominent figures in the business community also came to "Lido" to support the event, which was a rare sight. How could the tables and chairs on the green lawn accommodate more than 5,000 spectators.

The swimming performance began at 6:00 PM. The exciting programs included: screw turn swim, synchronized swimming, driving in reverse swim, burlap sack swim... There were also diving and water polo performances. The performers included: Chen Lvji, Mai Weiming, Wang Xiushan, Luo Dezhen, and other famous swimmers. At 8:00 PM, the order was the ribbon-cutting of the dance floor. The ceremony was performed by four sisters: Xi Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan. We composed poetry in the cool autumn night by the sea and left.

### Billiards Competition for Student Aid; Datong Cup Handicap Tournament; More Than Forty Participants

Billiard enthusiasts such as Zhu Qiliang, Xu Shizhang, Ding Shunbao, Zhou Xingeng, Dai Guirong, and Guo Lanfang are enthusiastically supporting the event. Chen Zaichun, Zhang Yuanji, Peng Dajiang, Pu Zhongfang, Xu Shizhang, Zhu Qiliang, Dai Guirong, and Zhou Xingeng have been invited to serve as judges. More than forty people have already registered. The schedule will be arranged and the competition will begin as soon as the registration deadline expires at the end of this month.

### Four-Party Joint Office's Rotating Audit Team Completes Work in Shanghai Region

Submitted General Report on Top Ten Industries

[Our Newspaper] The four-party joint office’s rotating audit team’s work in the Shanghai region, lasting more than two months, was fully completed on the 20th of this month. The team inspected 102 factories, including dyeing and weaving, flour, oil pressing, electrical machinery, chemical industry, and other production industries. Most of the larger-scale loan factories in the city have been inspected. This audit work did not focus on trivial details but mainly sought to understand the facts to clarify the actual situation of each production industry and the effectiveness after the loans. Therefore, the work was more arduous than previous audits. In addition to compiling audit reports for each factory inspected, the team collected data from relevant agencies to verify the information. A general report has also been submitted on the top ten major industries, including weaving, silk weaving, wool weaving, flour, oil pressing, electrical machinery, machinery, enamel, rubber, and western medicine, to provide reference for the authorities in deciding future review and loan policies. According to the results of the inspection, the situation is generally as follows: Generally, the use of loans is still normal, and no cases of using loans for non-production purposes have been found. Due to the continuous rise in raw material prices, there is a widespread feeling of difficulty in circulating funds, and using the loans to purchase materials is far better than other uses. Most manufacturers have seen a significant increase in production and sales volume after receiving loans. However, some have not reached their maximum production capacity due to a lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and labor disputes. The accounting systems of various factories are mostly unsound. Some still cling to old habits, using old-style accounting subjects, which are unclear and should be improved.

### Cotton Yarn Creates a New High Price: 42 Count Blue Phoenix at 24.5 Million

Raw soybean oil rose by 10,000 to 20,000, refined oil also rose by 20,000, vegetable oil also rose by 10,000 to 20,000, and sesame oil also rose by 10,000 to 20,000.

### Bulls Selling at High Prices, Chinese Stocks Trend Sideways

Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally trended sideways. Buyers from the yarn and flower groups and Hong Kong came in succession. Prices had touched highs in both the morning and afternoon sessions, but a continuous flow of profit-taking by the bulls met with poor market absorption, and overnight interest rates opened high at 24%, repeatedly preventing further gains. The future depends on credit conditions.

Morning Opening

Continuing the previous close, all stocks opened high. After the opening, Dah Yung spun down from 253 to 248. Strong buying then pushed it to high prices of 255 and 257, before many people sold off, causing it to fall back to a low of 243 for immediate delivery and 244 for forward delivery. Later, it repeatedly approached the 250 mark. At this time, apart from overnight long positions taking profits, there were also sales, causing considerable struggle. At 10:30, overnight interest rates also opened high at 19.5% and 24%, fluctuating around 245. After 10:50, a major player in the industry, [Name], strongly pulled, buying momentum rose again, pulling Dah Yung up to 256. Black market prices for some items fell slightly by 10%, before falling to 247 near noon, but were easily pulled up again before the close. The morning closing saw Qian Xing rise by 10% compared to the previous closing. Dah Yung, Xin He, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qian Xing, Yongye, Zhongsi, Jinglun rose slightly. Sino-French fell by 10%. Xinhua and Hua Feng were flat. State Goods hit the limit. Other rises and falls were slight. Forward delivery stocks saw Xin He and Meiya rise slightly, Qian Xing rise by half a percent, and Dah Yung, Hua Feng, and Jingfu fall slightly.

Afternoon Market

Opened immediately and was showy. After opening, the overnight asking price exceeded the forward delivery price within the market by a large amount. Holders were excited. Dah Yung rose to high prices of 256 and 258, before many people sold off, falling to 249 and 250. The National Bank released 22.5 billion, and buying momentum rose again, returning to 257. Many retail investors took profits, and prices fell again to 250 and 251 near the close. The overnight asking price was low after the close. Compared to the previous market close, Dah Yung, Hua Feng, Jingfu, Zhongfang, Cement, Zhabei, and Hengfeng rose slightly in immediate delivery stocks. Qian Xing, Sino-French, and Jinglun rose by half a percent. Meiya, Xin He, and Xinhua remained flat. State Goods remained at the limit. Other stocks saw slight falls. Forward delivery stocks saw Xin He and Meiya fall slightly, Dah Yung, Hua Feng, and Jingfu rise slightly. Overnight old stocks were stable.

### National Textile Industry Production Conference to Open in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning

[Our Report] The National Textile Industry Production Conference, hosted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is scheduled to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce from 9:00 AM tomorrow for three days. Chen Qitian will come to Shanghai to personally preside over the conference. The General Assembly has established a secretariat, with Liu Wenteng as Secretary-General and Yuan Shenda as Deputy. It is estimated that over 250 representatives of public and private factories and experts will attend. Proposals submitted to the General Assembly will be reviewed in five groups: Raw Materials, Industrial Technology, Funding, Textile Education, and Yarn and Cloth Adjustment, Transportation, and Sales, and Others. The fourth preparatory committee meeting will be held at 12:00 noon today, and journalists will be received at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Currently, over 50 people have registered, and over 40 proposals have been received, most of which are related to production technology improvement issues.

### Civil Coal Allocation Method: Fuel Management Committee to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss

[Our Report] The sixth meeting of the Civil Coal Allocation Committee of the Fuel Management Committee is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 5th. At that time, the allocation method for the fourth allocation of civil coal in the city will be decided. It is reported that the total amount of the fourth allocation of coal will still be 15,000 tons. As for the third civil coal allocation of over 13,000 tons, 80-90% has already been allocated. The investigation sub-committee of the Allocation Committee also held a meeting on the 20th to further adjust the A, B, C, D, and E grades of the original 44 coal allocation industries.

Recently, black market coal prices have fluctuated, with bituminous coal reaching 3 million per ton, more than three times the official price. The reasons for the analysis are: 1. General price increases. 2. Diesel fuel has already risen threefold, and more and more people are switching to coal. 3. The situation in Hankou is unstable, and the source of Xiang coal is blocked. Therefore, coal prices have gradually risen. However, the Fuel Management Committee's source of coal is increasing daily. However, in order to replenish the safe coal reserves, the allocation amount has not been fully increased. However, it is firmly believed that if the allocation of coal is not delayed, coal prices can be gradually brought into line. It is reported that recently, various coal mines in Kaihua and other places have sent letters requesting adjustments to the price of coal. The reasons are: 1. Since the exchange rate has been changed to be pegged to the market price, costs have increased drastically. 2. Wages have generally increased. At the current price of coal, it is impossible to continue production. The Committee is currently considering the situation.

Factories Requesting Coal Briquettes Strictly Prohibited from Flowing into the Black Market

[Our Report] The market price of coal briquettes has risen to 85,000 per dan, while the price for industrial workers is still 28,000 per dan, a huge difference. Therefore, various factories are enthusiastically applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for allocation. In order to prevent malfeasance and flow into the black market, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday invited the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association to discuss and decide to continue issuing goods to the approved coal briquette factories as much as possible. If it is found that coal briquettes are flowing into the black market, the allocation rights of the factory will be immediately terminated. Participants also calculated the source of coal dust in the country this year. According to Shanghai's fuel consumption, there is still a shortage of 200 tons of coal dust this year. Foreign exchange needs to be used to purchase from abroad to Shanghai. The Central Trust and the Central Bank are requested to find ways to provide this foreign exchange.

### Qinhuangdao Coal Shipped to Shanghai

[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Tian ship is transporting 8,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Hai Yan ship is also transporting 2,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the same time tomorrow (the 25th).

### Foreign Exchange Balancing is Effective, Overseas Remittances are Gradually Improving

[Our Report] Yesterday, an official from the Foreign Exchange Balancing Fund Committee told reporters: The biggest goal of the Committee in balancing foreign exchange is to make the exchange rate closer to reality, in order to promote exports and increase overseas remittances. He said: Since the establishment of the Committee, up to the 18th of this month, general prices have risen by 40%, export commodity prices have risen by about 9%, and the foreign exchange rate has risen by about 9%. Comparing this, the impact of general prices on export goods and the foreign exchange rate is very clear. However, the Balancing Committee still hopes to maximize the balance of the exchange rate under the premise of taking into account the actual situation. It is reported that China's export situation has been better than expected in the past month, and overseas remittances are gradually becoming normal. In the future, the strategy of balancing the exchange rate will be used to make exports and overseas remittances better day by day.

### Cigarettes and Soap Both Rise

Although Hwa Cheng and Nanyang brands are distributing cigarettes in the market, the strong buying momentum has led to rising prices. Ten sticks of British brand rose by 300,000 from the previous day. Old Knife also rose by 350,000. Other Chinese and foreign brands of cigarettes also rose uniformly.

Daily necessities and soap are trading very actively, with everyone expecting higher prices. Gu Ben Arrow and Knife brands rose by 14,500 yesterday. Xiang Mao and Guanghua brands also rose by more than 10,000.

### Overseas Compatriot Seeks Brother from Afar (Translated)

Remote mountains and rivers, who grieves for the lost traveler?

Dear Editor: I am a Chinese living in Nanyang since childhood. I know very little about the language of my motherland, which is the main reason why I am writing this letter in English today. I have an older brother named Luo Hong. Two years before the War of Resistance, he returned to the motherland to pursue higher education. After graduating from Chaoyang University, I received a letter from him, knowing that he had joined the army to participate in the War of Resistance. Since then, I have not heard from him. It has been ten years now, and I don't know if he is still alive. My mother passed away a year ago, and I am also in dire straits. I hope you can publish this letter in the newspaper. If it can give us brothers a chance to reunite, we will never forget it. Sincerely wishing you peace, Reader Kesawan Medan

### Zhang Shuqi's Painting Exhibition

— Li Fu

Brother Shuqi has returned from America with honors, and he is exhibiting his recent works at the China Painting Academy, which is a major event in the art world. I have seen his large paintings, the brushstrokes are fluent, the ink colors are blended, and the spirit is complete. The hooks and carvings are particularly strong, directly approaching the Song people, sweeping away the weak habit of recent drawings. Occasionally, the use of dyed paper adds to the clarity; the charm of setting it off is deepened. The landscapes are unprecedented, among which the autumn trees are swaying and graceful, and the atmosphere is stern, with the general idea of Qu Yuan's "The wind soughs and the trees rustle," which is the crown of the whole scene. Several willows are sparse and well-arranged, embellishing the foot of the slope and the mouth of the water, especially giving a sense of leisure and distance. More than half of the colorers are mostly unconventional, and they are ingenious. Because the United States has been wantonly buying European ancient and modern paintings in the past ten years, the richness of the collection is almost no less than that of France, Italy, Belgium, and England. Brother Shuqi has lived there for a long time, watching and learning day and night, and has a special understanding. Then he unconsciously revealed it on paper.

### Zhu Yingpeng's World Art View

— Wu Ti

The appreciation of all modeling arts usually goes through a process from "eye appreciation" to "heart appreciation." The former is physiological, while the latter is psychological and ideological.

Before this exhibition of Chinese paintings by Mr. Zhu Beihai (Yingpeng), I had read it once. Let's take the Guanyin in the form of a general who is now pointed out. At a glance, the most striking thing is the thin and sharp line that is very slow, calm and clear; secondly, the direction and ups and downs of the money, free change, free occurrence, although extremely neat and extremely smooth pleasure; again, the moist and transparent, light and even ironing color, as if the air in early spring, refreshing. In this way, after the physiological movement evoked by the screen reaches an appropriate stage, the rational concept makes me pay attention to the theme of the depiction. The compassionate female Guanyin Bodhisattva has been transformed into a mighty general, which is exactly "I am in front of him, all showing his body, and showing his body, and for saying the law, making him accomplished" originating from the story of the Buddhist scriptures. Looking at the expression, the idol posture of the Buddha and Bodhisattva is completely gone, and a superhuman expression of unity of spirit and flesh overflows the paper and ink. Its realm is the realm of the heavens. His figure painting method contains the qualities of Greek, Indian, and various arts after the European Renaissance in the inherent style of China. The charm is vivid, brilliant and magnificent. The enthusiasm is seen in the implication, full of the power of life. From the understanding caused by the book, I feel that there are two main factors in the artistic content of the Zhu style: in thought, it is the union of the two trends of being born and living in the world; in art, it is the integration of the two forces of national character and internationality.

Like Zhu Shi's unique form, magnificent and strange painting style, it is certainly wrong to say that he deliberately perverted. In fact, things that have no source will never cause new emotion and shudder for the appreciator. The formation of the style of all works of art is determined by the artist's personality, and the artist's personality is determined by his thoughts and his philosophical basis. Zhu Shi's works are displayed in the Chinese Art Academy, and everyone can appreciate it, because of this. I personally rely on subjective reasoning, no longer the metaphysical side, but the metaphysical side.

The paintings exhibited this time are all Zhu Shi's recent productions. Although they are not final editions, they are already mature fruits, needless to say. For more than 20 years, from the life of the party and government to social life, to the lonely life after the enemy and puppets occupied Shanghai until today, from the outside, but his art history and nationalist thought have converged into a spirit. Due to years of entrusting his feelings to epic poems, he turned to studying the process of Greek art from West to East, and even involved the religious myths representing the national ideology. Therefore, in this Chinese painting exhibition, we felt a new force, vaguely having the potential to disturb the Chinese literary world.

Judging paintings from paintings, the modern painting style of "imitating as creation" has also reached a time when it must be changed. The personal freehand works of the literati have become empty and without content. What should be replaced is the romantic spirit and the realistic national painter. Like Zhu Shi, the few landscape paintings in his exhibition are all full of strong epic atmosphere. An ideal natural state, and the small world of leisurely and comfortable escape from reality since the Southern Song Dynasty are different.

### Yingpeng's Paintings

— Xu Weinan

The first condition for a calligrapher and painter is to have their own original personality. Since one has a distinct personality, they will naturally go on the road of creation. For example, Yan Lugong's calligraphy has its own personality, and he created the "Yan Zi", which has become a major school of calligraphy. Painters such as Wang Wei, Liang Kai, Mi Fu, Bada, Si Wang, Jin Dongxin, Jiao Bingzhen, etc., are all masters with the strongest personalities and can create.

### Preface to Farewell to Mr. Gu Yiqiao

— Zhang Zengtai

On September 1, Ding Hai, the Shanghai Municipal Primary School Principals' Talk Association publicly feasted Mr. Gu Yiqiao, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, at the Central Western Restaurant. Because Mr. resigned as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and was honorably appointed as the President of the National Chengchi University: the Chengchi University has the celebration of obtaining a wise president; and the achievements of Mr. in revitalizing Shanghai's education in the past two years, and the unfinished implementation of Shanghai's five-year education plan, all of us colleagues do not want Mr. to leave Shanghai for a day.

Shanghai is the center of culture in our Republic of China, and the number of universities and primary and secondary schools is the first in the country. Unfortunately, on August 13, 1937, Japanese soldiers invaded, and almost 80-90% of all schools and cultural institutions were destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, Mr. first served as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, and in the midst of extreme economic difficulties, he worked tirelessly, ran around, and reported in order to seek revitalization. In less than two years, almost all of the original municipal schools have been restored; and the newly established municipal schools have increased by more than half compared to before, and the number of students has almost doubled. He has made every effort to run people's education and eliminate illiteracy. Mr.'s achievements in revitalizing Shanghai's education in the past two years are obvious to everyone and will never be erased. In addition, in recent times, prices have risen daily, and life has become increasingly difficult. In addition to raising the basic salary of teachers, Mr. also requested the municipal government to issue academic training fees to teachers, which is helpful to the life of teachers. This Mr. has helped the teachers of our municipal schools, and it is also something that our colleagues will never forget. Now, at the time of parting, recalling Mr.'s achievements in revitalizing Shanghai's education, and understanding the life of teachers in municipal schools, how can we not think leisurely and sad! However, Mr. is honorably appointed to the National Chengchi University. The achievements of his future career and the respect for his reputation will be ten times or a hundred times greater than today in Shanghai, which is even more admirable!

I have not been in contact with Mr. for a day except for official business. Now that the rivers are long and the roads are long, I respectfully say the above.

### Rejoicing in Seeing the Transformation of Guanyin

— Zhao Jingshen

The time arrived for White Dew, and after several showers of rain, the heat dissipated instantly. Taking advantage of the cool weather, going to the home of my friend Zhu Beihai (Yingpeng) to read books is indeed an interesting thing.

It was a delicate living room, and what attracted my attention the most was the "green gauze cage." I mean the three bookshelves with gauze screens alone, like wardrobes, with copper rods installed at the top and bottom, which could not only prevent sun and wind, and dust accumulation, but also felt very neat. On the easel were plaster statues of Homer and figures from Greek mythology. Opposite hung an oil painting painted by Beihai himself, next to a copper piano, stacked with many musical scores, and a statue of Beethoven. This was probably the "hobby" of his daughter, Mingwu. Hanging on the wall of the suite was a large oil painting by his disciple Su Xian, Apollo driving a cloud chariot. Just by looking at this art-filled living room, one can tell what kind of person the host is, and there is no need to introduce him further.

I woke Beihai from his afternoon nap. He showed me many of his recent works. Soon, He Tianjian, Yu Jianhua, Wang Jinshan, and other painting friends also arrived, as well as Chen Shihua and Shen Lizhi, and the two Xizongs. We appreciated Beihai's works together, while casually discussing the major trends in the painting world over the past decade.

Beihai's paintings are roughly divided into two categories: landscapes and figures. Land scenes like "Cloud Plank Picture," "Three Pines Picture," "Lofty Peaks and Autumn Freshness," and the imagined "Mount Hua," although they are also creations with clouds leaning on them, do not feel very fresh and do not evoke special feelings. Perhaps I am just making a fuss over nothing? Whenever I see paintings of the sea or snow-covered sea, I always think this way, as I have never seen similar paintings before. Such as "Breaking Waves," "Heavenly Sun Driving," "Sunset Surprising Waves," "Watching the Sea Picture," "Sea Tide," the colors are light and extremely quiet, shedding the worldly atmosphere and reaching a state of perfection. His material from the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" suits the taste of a mythology enthusiast like me even more. To put it bluntly, I seem to see the woodcuts inserted in "Selected Yuan Dramas."

The figures are even better than the landscapes. Such as "Dragon Girl Offering Pearl," "Red Line Stolen Box" (I hope to see a copy, a lonely female knight of Ling Kang without the green sides above and below). "A Country Girl Holding a Hoe," "Auspicious Goddess," "Beihai Miao Gu Immortal," and other works are certainly very pleasing; but what I like the most are the various transformations of Guanyin. The five colors are dazzling, making people unable to take it all in. The author himself likes "Guanyin Appearing as a General" the most, wearing helmet and armor, with full and powerful muscles, and especially bright and divine eyes. Accompanied by little ghosts, riding clouds and controlling the air, it feels even more solemn. In addition, there are "Standing Guanyin," "Sitting Guanyin" (one of which is uncolored), "Gauze Robe Guanyin," "Elephant-Riding Guanyin," "Ruyi Guanyin," "Open-Eyed Guanyin," "Willow Branch Sprinkling Water Guanyin," "Sudhana Guanyin," "Long Sword Guanyin," etc. I love to see "Sleeping Guanyin" and "Fish Basket Guanyin" the most. The Sleeping Guanyin closes her eyes and lowers her eyebrows, leaning on a rock, making her even more beautiful. The halo on her head almost becomes a moon gate in a garden, covering her whole body. The Fish Basket Guanyin leans her body diagonally, her left hand holding her skirt, her right hand holding a basket, with a lively and fresh fish inside, as if performing the Kunqu opera "Following the Boat." Beihai paints Guanyin using extremely thin and easily滲透半生料級畫紙, very meticulous, the area occupied by the painting is very small, only about one-tenth of the entire picture, leaving a square at the top for inscription or appraisal. Sometimes the clouds are winding, quite like a pattern, I can shrink it to make the cover of a literary book. I have read "Buddhist Birth Stories" by Rhys Davids of England, and I know that Sakyamuni would be reborn as a farmer, doctor, judge, etc., many times. Unexpectedly, Guanyin also has so many transformations. The author mentioned that he loves Guanyin, and especially likes her pair of bare feet; Jinshan added "bare chest and exposed breasts," and I added: "This is close to the power and beauty of Greece." In the past, Chinese paintings of Guanyin often had her sitting on a lotus seat, hiding her natural feet. Probably such paintings are imported into China from India after being influenced by Chinese etiquette. Beihai, like the "Heavenly Horse" he painted himself, is unconstrained, so what he paints is very different from the traditional method. He is not Zhao Mengfu or Li Gonglin, but himself. He has his own unique style, especially the various transformations of Guanyin he paints.

Walking out with Jinshan, in front of my eyes still appear Guanyin holding a willow branch, a long sword, a ruyi, or a fish basket, either sitting or standing or lying down, accompanied by little ghosts or Sudhana, the various images, very different from the clay sculptures made by craftsmen in the back hall of ancient temples. I am drunkenly as if I have appreciated a new hand scroll of Guanyin paintings in the Dunhuang Grottoes.

Most painters and calligraphers will imitate and follow, and at best, they can only become fake Dong Xin, fake Four Wangs, fake Bada, etc., which is not worth mentioning!

Like Jiao Bingzhen, who absorbed the essence of Western art and applied it to Chinese paintings, making Chinese paintings more perfect and radiant, it is naturally worthy of praise. This kind of work of absorbing the essence of Western art is becoming more and more wonderful in modern times. We dare say that when studying contemporary Chinese painting in the future, we will definitely discover many characteristics that the predecessors dared not try. Chinese painting in modern times is not a golden age, but at least it is not far from the golden age.

Mr. Zhu Yingpeng is an outstanding figure in modern Chinese painting. His personality is the strongest. People say that he is very difficult to deal with. In daily affairs, Mr. Zhu himself indeed feels difficult to deal with, but in art, it is precisely the main factor of Mr. Zhu's success. In other words, Mr. Zhu's paintings have his own consistent personality and never follow others, but he can grasp and apply the advantages of his predecessors. In addition, he is also very knowledgeable in Western painting, so he can also grasp the characteristics of Western painting. The excellence of the lines in figure painting is the result of his integration of the strengths of ancient and modern painting schools. For example, for the study of clothing pleats, he spared no effort, spending a lot of effort in Buddhist art to search, and then seeking clues from ancient Greek art. So he created the most perfect modern Chinese figure painting.

He can also paint landscapes and flowers to the best of his ability, depicting them to the most touching point. Even for a small stone, the ink color he uses must integrate the folds of Chinese painting and the shading of Western painting. His works can be said to be masterpieces, so although the size is not large, it is enough for people to appreciate. For those who truly love art, we hope to be able to appreciate Mr. Zhu's works more.
