### The Government Will Adopt Emergency Measures to Stabilize Prices and Secure the People's Livelihood; Chairman Chiang Specifically Instructs on Implementation Principles

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] At 12:00 noon on the 11th, Chairman Chiang summoned Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenglun, Qin Fen, and others to the official residence for lunch. Afterwards, he inquired in detail about the current financial turmoil and price fluctuations, and instructed on the principles of emergency measures. He ordered the heads of relevant institutions to immediately discuss emergency measures to stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood. It is learned that the above-mentioned leaders have been studying implementation methods by category, aiming to achieve results within the shortest possible time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] After the adjournment of the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 11th, Song Ziwen specifically convened Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Gu Lun, Qin Fen, and others to discuss emergency measures to resolve current economic, financial, food, and price issues, and dispersed only at noon.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the frenzied fluctuations in the Shanghai market. It is heard that the Chairman has specifically ordered relevant Shanghai leaders to come to Nanjing to report and make emergency decisions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Wang Yunwu recently told our newspaper reporters regarding the soaring prices in Shanghai, saying: The government is determined to adopt effective countermeasures to thoroughly control the situation, and a final decision can be made within a few days. Wang then stated the Ministry of Economic Affairs' current principles for guiding industry and commerce, saying: Industry and commerce should strive for self-reliance, and especially improve technology and management. For the purpose of supporting industry and commerce, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established industrial and commercial guidance offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, and five other locations to serve industry and commerce. Since the establishment of these offices, the guidance and management provided to industry and commerce in various regions have been quite effective. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' method for increasing capital by evaluating the fixed assets of industrial and mining transportation enterprises has been passed by the National Defense Council. This method can prevent industrial and commercial enterprises from bearing excessive taxes, and the method of fixing increased capital, which is one-fifth of the increased cash, allows new capital to be added to industrial and commercial enterprises, absorbing some of the idle funds. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted a Chamber of Commerce Law, which has been submitted to the Political Affairs Department for review and will soon be implemented. As for industrial loan measures, they are only stopgap measures; the fundamental solution still lies in self-reliance.

### The Shanghai Gold Rush is Spreading Rapidly; Special Prices are Trending Higher in Various Regions; Strict Controls Have Been Adopted in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Other Places

Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] After the Shanghai gold rush spread to Nanjing, price fluctuations in the Nanjing market have been extremely large. The price of gold rose sharply, reaching 930,000 yuan at around 3:00 PM on the 11th. It weakened slightly in the evening. There were rumors of no market for rice and grain, and the price also rose to 120,000 yuan per unit. The Nanjing authorities decided to implement reasonable and strict controls. Shen Qia believes that stabilizing prices should start with stabilizing rice prices. In the future, the city government will make its best effort to ensure the stability of rice and grain supply in Nanjing. According to the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau, based on the situation of grain price control in Nanjing over the past half-month, it is firmly believed that there is no shortage of food in Nanjing. At the same time, strict prohibition will be imposed on the re-export of rice and grain. In addition, the control of general commodity prices will also be handled reasonably and strictly enforced in conjunction with grain prices.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Shen Yi and Xie Zhengfu visited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food at 11:00 AM on the 11th to discuss the issue of grain supply and price stability in Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Grain prices are also fluctuating. The reporter recently interviewed the person in charge of grain, inquiring about emergency measures. He replied: The current rise in grain prices is not due to a shortage of grain, but is affected by the fluctuations of overall commodity prices. It has now been decided to sell as much grain as possible under government control, and then grain prices will naturally stabilize. It is heard that 70% of the grain requisitioned for the 35th year has already been achieved, and it is expected that it will be fully achieved by the end of this month. Among them, the original plan was for 30% to go to the central government, but now efforts are being made to purchase a portion back to the central government, so that military food and civilian food will not be a problem. It is also learned that the government has sold a large amount of rice and grain in Shanghai.

The city government has taken emergency measures, extracting 450 piculs from the Jiyi granary every day and distributing them to nine rice shops to supply civilian food.

Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th Dispatch] It is learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that Zhenjiang's commodity prices have been soaring due to the stimulus of Shanghai's gold prices, greatly affecting the livelihood of public school staff and ordinary people, is planning to take emergency measures to stabilize prices. It is heard that the police bureau has been ordered to start an investigation, and those found to be deliberately raising grain prices and commodity prices will be severely punished according to law.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th Dispatch] Zhenjiang's gold ornaments opened at 710,000 this morning, rose to a high of 920,000 in the afternoon, and fell back to 870,000 in the evening. Pawnshops changed their prices five times throughout the day, and all goods soared with the wind.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 11th Dispatch] Grain prices here are soaring. Cooked rice has exceeded 140,000 yuan per picul. The Wuhan Headquarters convened relevant parties this afternoon to discuss suppression measures and decided: (1) Temporarily prohibit the export of grain.

### Restriction on the Import of Newsprint

Is to Encourage the Domestic Paper Industry - Wang Yunwu's Conversation with Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] After the government included newsprint in the restricted import category, the price of paper rose sharply, and the national newspaper industry was most affected. Wang Yunwu recently told reporters: Regarding the restriction on the use of paper, the United Kingdom has a precedent. The United Kingdom currently has strict controls on the publication of newspapers and books, and they can only be published with government approval. At present, Chinese newspapers are competing to expand their page numbers, and various pornographic newspapers and books are not necessary to publish, so there are measures to restrict paper. However, although the government has imposed an additional tax of 50% on imported paper, it still encourages the import of paper-making raw materials, so that the domestic paper-making industry can develop. It is hoped that the press will promote the use of domestic paper more.

### Our Levy of Import Tax Greatly Shocked the British

[British News Agency, London, 11th Dispatch] The news that China has newly ordered the levy of a 50% surcharge on imported goods based on their value rather than on tariffs has greatly shocked the business community here. The London business community has long recognized that China's economic situation requires strict measures and that the economic situation is difficult to improve unless import and export trade is slightly balanced. However, they believe that levying an extra fee of half the market price on imported goods may have unexpected effects. Currently, we are waiting here for detailed information on this surcharge.

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] It is reported: Regarding the takeover of Dalian, an agreement has been established between the Chinese and Soviet governments, stipulating that Dalian will be divided into twelve police districts, and the Chinese government will organize a police force. Chinese troops will not be stationed in Dalian for the time being. The actual takeover of Dalian will be implemented soon, but reporters visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon, and it was said that the Ministry has not yet obtained information regarding the Dalian situation.

### The Situation in Eastern Henan Deteriorates Sharply; National Army in Northern Anhui Occupies Hao County; A Major War Will Soon Occur in the Mountainous Areas of Southern Shandong

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th Dispatch] The situation in eastern Henan has deteriorated sharply. After the National Army recovered Hao County in northern Anhui on the 10th, the 20,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's Communist Army, who were scattered in the Zhecheng, Ningling, and Luyi areas, were in a very disadvantaged position. Yesterday, the Communist Army attempted to divide and return to the north of the Longhai Railway between Minquan and Liuhe, but was intercepted head-on by the National Army. The Communist Army lost one-half of its troops and was forced to flee back to Ningling and Suixian. Morale was low, and they surrendered to the National Army along the way.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th Dispatch] A major war in the central Yimeng Mountain area is brewing fiercely. The Communist Army that fled east from Xintai, after obtaining reinforcements from the Communist Army that went south from Jiaodong, used the 150-kilometer undulating, complex, and intricate mountainous area between Xintai and Linyi to lay mines everywhere, set up defenses all over the mountains, destroy roads, and clear the fields. However, the National Army has already prepared countermeasures for this, and it is expected that a major war in the central Yimeng Mountain area will soon be launched from Xintai and Linyi.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The National Army in southern Shandong is progressing. On the 10th, it captured Huabu south of Lijiazhuang, Minquan east of Lanfeng on the Longhai Railway, and the Jiukaocheng area. On the 10th, the National Army and the 3rd Column of Liu Bocheng's Communist Army engaged in fierce fighting. Liu's troops were defeated and are retreating.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th Dispatch] The 40,000 to 50,000 troops of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th Divisions of the Communist Army, who invaded the area between Baitabu and Huandunbu, suffered heavy losses after being surrounded and attacked by the National Army for three days and nights. On the night of the 9th, they began to flee from Shahezhen to the east of Linyi and Juxian. In addition, the National Army, which advanced towards Linyi, strengthened pacification work on the 10th, the central route north of Zhujiazhuang, and the left flank near Changchengzhen. More than 10,000 Communist troops who were defeated by the Japanese in Tai'an are currently fleeing towards Boshan. Linyi is now an empty city, and most of the Communist troops are hiding in the mountains on both sides. Therefore, the two columns of Cao Cheng's troops, numbering more than 20,000, advanced rapidly south from Dingtao and Caoxian yesterday. In addition, Zhang Guohua, commander of the Communist Army's Shandong-Henan-Anhui Border Region, led five or six troops of the Communist Army and set out from Luyi to Ningling and Shangqiu on the 10th, attempting to attack Shangqiu and destroy the Longhai Railway.

Hao personally led the Special Service Regiment to charge the Communist Army in this battle.

### Constitution and Laws Committee of the Legislative Yuan Begins First Phase of Work; Control Yuan Discusses Post-Constitution Organizational Structure

Roughly Determined Number of National Assembly Representatives

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 11th] The Constitution and Laws Committee of the Legislative Yuan has commenced its first phase of work, focusing on the five major laws stipulated in the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution: (1) Organization of the National Assembly; Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives; (2) Election and Recall of the President and Vice President; (3) Election and Recall of Legislators; (4) Election and Recall of Supervisors; (5) Organization of the Five Yuan. It has been decided to divide the work into five groups for research, with each group consisting of six to eleven members. The conveners of each group are as follows: Group 1: Chen Yuan Yuan; Group 2: Luo Ding; Group 3: Dai Xiu Shi; Group 4: Peng Zui Shi; Group 5: Di [blank space]. Accompanied by several tanks and supported by aircraft, they fiercely attacked Heze. Our × unit is engaging in a counterattack, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 11th] The Control Yuan held its first Control Laws meeting on the morning of the 11th, to discuss the organization of the Control Yuan and various control laws after the implementation of the constitution. Secretary-General Li Chongshi of the Control Yuan chaired the meeting, with over ten Control Yuan members participating. It was decided to form two committees to draft various laws and regulations. Regarding the organization of the Control Yuan, according to the provisions of the constitution, if the current provincial and municipal divisions remain unchanged, the number of Control Yuan members will increase to over two hundred and ten. If the provinces and regions are reduced in size and the number of Control Yuan members in municipalities directly under the central government increases, the total number of Control Yuan members will increase even further. As the number of members increases, the secretariat must also expand, and the number of committees will also increase to around ten. Preliminary plans include committees for internal affairs, national defense, foreign affairs, education, agriculture and forestry, economy, finance, and transportation. Regarding the control laws, they will be divided into impeachment laws, censure laws, consent laws, and correction laws for separate discussion. Regarding the local organization of the Control Yuan, representatives raised proposals during the National Assembly meeting, but there are unlikely to be any changes to the organizational law.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 11th] The number of National Assembly representatives and legislative and supervisory committee members has been largely determined. The total number of National Assembly representatives is nearly three thousand. Among them, two thousand one hundred are regional representatives. The original number of overseas Chinese was forty-one, but as the number of regions has increased from twenty-three to around forty, the number will also increase proportionally. The number of representatives for professions and women has not been finalized. The number of legislators will be nearly eight hundred, an increase of about eight times the current number. The number of supervisors will be over two hundred and ten, and may increase further. According to the constitution, supervisors are elected by popular representative bodies. However, due to the special circumstances of overseas Chinese, they will be elected by overseas Chinese industrial, commercial, and educational organizations.

Candidate Nomination Methods; Election Laws Also Have Provisions

Furthermore, nomination methods for candidates and various election laws also have provisions. If anyone can be a candidate, the number of candidates will inevitably be uncountable. If handled in this way, the cost of elections will be high, and it will be difficult to concentrate votes. If the British system of deposits is used first, it would violate the constitutional principle of "equal, direct, and secret ballot." The final decision is to use a method of nomination jointly signed by a certain number or more of electors. However, it is also considered that if the number of joint signatories is too large, there will inevitably be fraudulent signatures, leading to various election lawsuits. Therefore, it is stipulated that nomination by joint signatures of one hundred or more people will qualify a candidate. In the future, when nominating candidates, various parties will also use the method of joint signatures of electors, rather than the American-style party nomination method.

### Civil Aeronautics Administration Sends Experts to Revamp Airport Equipment; Meteorological Observatory Plans to Provide Accurate Weather Information

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Official sources stated today that the Civil Aeronautics Administration has dispatched several experts to various airports to revamp ground equipment to ensure aviation safety. The Civil Aeronautics Administration, recently established and subordinate to the Ministry of Communications, oversees the activities of various commercial airlines. The Director-General, Dai Anguo, is the eldest son of Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, and studied aviation in the United States. The agency's investigation into the recent series of aircraft accidents proved that inadequate ground equipment was the main cause. Most civil aviation airports currently lack modern equipment such as radar instruments and beacon lights. Agency personnel said that the prospect is optimistic after the airports are revamped and modern equipment is added, but this cannot be achieved in a short period of time, because at the beginning of the project, necessary data is lacking, and it is impossible to formulate a comprehensive reform plan. At the same time, the Central Meteorological Observatory is currently conducting a plan to provide aviation authorities with accurate weather information. The plan stipulates the establishment of meteorological stations throughout the country to work closely with the Civil Aeronautics Administration. These stations will be located at important airports and key military points to provide the Civil Aeronautics Administration with accurate weather forecasts.

### Full Text of the Reasons for the Verdict Against Traitor Ding Mocun, Continued from Yesterday

Shamelessly Serving the Enemy

Furthermore, during his tenure as the puppet Zhejiang Province Governor and concurrently as the nominal head of the puppet Zhejiang Province Party Headquarters, he printed a large number of enemy-flattering propaganda materials, such as advocating the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and the Axis powers' inevitable victory, and distributed them to various puppet municipal and county party headquarters. He also used his position as the puppet Zhejiang administrative head to control materials, organize a materials transportation and sales management office, exploit civilian wealth, and supply the enemy and puppets. This is proven by the official letter No. 235, letter, of the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, dated December 17, 35th year of the Republic. Furthermore, in the summer of the 34th year, when the enemy's defeat was already apparent, the defendant desperately put up a last-ditch fight. He even colluded with Japanese agent Nakajima Shinichi to plan the organization of a commando brigade to carry out guerrilla warfare after our Allied forces landed on the coast of eastern Zhejiang, contain our Allied forces, and delay the collapse of the enemy. This is proven by the defendant Nakajima Shinichi's confession in Case No. 244 of the War Criminal Nakajima Shinichi of the War Criminals Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense, and Chen Gongshu's report (see excerpts from items 72 and 73 of the court's investigation file). From this perspective, the defendant Ding Mocun shamelessly served the enemy and acted as a henchman for the tiger. The facts of his joint conspiracy with the enemy country to plot resistance against this country are clear and unambiguous, beyond any doubt.

Shirking Responsibility

Although the defendant argued: (1) Regarding the part about harming Central personnel, in 1939, the enemy and puppet secret service agencies in Shanghai included those set up by the enemy army, those set up by the navy, those set up by the puppet Provisional Government, and those set up under the traitor Wang Jingwei, which was the No. 76 controlled by Li Shiqun. In the autumn of that year, Li Shiqun discovered that the defendant was attempting to escape and immediately placed him under house arrest at No. 76. Then, he forcibly gave the defendant the title of Director of the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, so that the defendant could not escape back to the Central Government. No. 76 was responsible by Li Shiqun, but actually it was controlled by his cronies Wu Shibao and Yang Jie. The defendant was no different from a high-ranking prisoner, as evidenced by the letters from Jiang Weiyuan Bocheng, the former Director Zhao Binggu of the Southeast Working Group of the Military Commission (evidence numbers 12 and 11). None of the evidence presented by Yu Chenyin regarding Yu Hua's murder can prove that it was committed by No. 76. Zheng Pingru was a Japanese intelligence agent and had simultaneous relationships with our Central Government and the Communist Party. In the winter of 1939, the enemy captured her and imprisoned her in Hongkou. Ms. Zheng's murder was clearly a frame-up by the enemy. The Central Executive Committee's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics' reply to your esteemed court, although proving that Ms. Zheng's murder was true, did not specify that it was done by the defendant. Pan Sansheng's testimony, provided by a Shanghai businessman, is purely hearsay. Furthermore, the testimonies of Li Shiqun and Wu Shibao's wives, Ye Jiqing and Yu Aizhen, said that they knew nothing about Ms. Guan's murder, which is sufficient to prove that Ms. Zheng was not harmed by No. 76. As for the underground workers of the Military Intelligence Bureau in Shanghai listed by the Bureau, most of them served as the Secret Service Headquarters. Before the Headquarters was established, they were clearly harmed by the enemy. In short, none of the Central personnel who died were harmed by No. 76. Even if, stepping back, they were killed by No. 76, the defendant was completely being held and acted against his will by Li Shiqun and could not take responsibility on behalf of Li Shiqun.

(2) Regarding the New Year's Day address, the defendant was extremely silent in the puppet government and was one of the reasons for Wang Jingwei's dissatisfaction with the defendant, as Gu Baoheng can testify. Evidence No. 31: "Not only was the 'New Year's Day Address of the 33rd Year' not written by the defendant, but the defendant never even knew about it. The article was published in the series sponsored by the China Daily, the organ of the puppet propaganda department. It must have been written by the propaganda department on his behalf and published in the defendant's name. The article vigorously promoted the Greater East Asia War, which was contrary to the defendant's views. The defendant had obstructed the puppet government from participating in the so-called Greater East Asia War," as evidenced by Evidence No. 32. "When the puppet Central Political Committee passed the case, the defendant refused to attend, which was extremely displeasing to Wang," as Wu Chengyu can testify.

(3) Regarding the crimes during his tenure as the puppet Zhejiang Province Governor and his concurrent positions, the enemy supported enemy merchants, and the local products of the puppet Zhejiang were controlled and transported by enemy merchants. The puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government handled the materials transportation and sales management office to reduce the suffering of the people and increase benefits. On the one hand, it enabled our Chinese merchants to transport and sell freely, and on the other hand, it found vehicles for them to transport goods at any time. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Department claimed that it was exploiting civilian wealth and supplying the enemy and puppets, which is completely unfounded. As for the matter of printing a large number of enemy-flattering propaganda materials in the name of the puppet Provincial Party Department, the defendant concurrently served as the chairman of the puppet Provincial Party Department in name only and never actually held the position. The defendant had not heard of the puppet Provincial Party Department printing those propaganda materials before.

(4) Regarding the puppet commando brigade, the defendant discussed with Wan Lilang the organization of a commando brigade to cater to the Central Government's counteroffensive and show achievements, and also planned to approach Nakajima of the Mei Agency (enemy intelligence agency) to deceive him into providing firearms. As for how Wan Lilang deceived Nakajima, the defendant had no knowledge of it. However, as far as the defendant can recall, Wan Lilang did not achieve his goal of deceiving Nakajima into providing firearms. The puppet commando brigade was never established due to lack of funds and other items. Even if Wan Lilang had other plans, the puppet commando brigade belonged to the puppet political security department. Wan Lilang formed the commando brigade was assigned by Chen Gongbo. At that time, the defendant had already left the puppet political security department and had nothing to do with the defendant's puppet Zhejiang Province position.

No Room for Sophistry

However, regarding the first point, according to the confession of Xia Zhongming, the leader of No. 76, the defendant participated in the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters: "No. 76 was organized by Ding Mocun, Li Shiqun, and Ji Fohai. Everyone knew that," (see the transcript of the entrusted interrogation by the Shanghai High Court on December 11, 35th year). It is clear that it was not out of coercion. Furthermore, Hu Junpeng testified at the investigation court of this court: "Ding Mocun was the Director of the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, probably voluntarily. Ding Mocun was definitely responsible for the Secret Service Headquarters. Before the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters was established, there was a secret service organization in Yidingpan Road. The person in charge was Li Shiqun, who was completely controlled by the Japanese and adopted an assassination policy in the concession, which required the consent of the Director in advance. As for arresting people, it was not necessary to obtain the consent of the Director," (see items 93 to 97 of the investigation file of the Procuratorate of this court). This further proves that the actual person in charge of the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters was Ding Mocun, not Li Shiqun. The working personnel he murdered were clearly at Ding Mocun's instigation. (To be continued)

### Editorial: How to Clarify This Chaotic Market

Since the wild rise in prices began, the market has fallen into extreme chaos. For example, the price of gold bullion has reached 9.6 million, U.S. dollars are at 17,500, white rice is 140,000, Twenty cigarettes of the "Special Double Horse" brand are 6 million, twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth is 222,000, "Warship" face powder is 51,000, raw oil is 320,000, and "693" sulfurized yuan is 8.5 million. Yet, demand still exceeds supply, with everyone eager to sell, resulting in a state of business without transactions. Among these, the average daily need for rice in the city is actually only around 15,000 to 20,000 bags, while the Social Affairs Bureau sold over 58,000 bags yesterday, clearly exceeding actual needs. However, black market rice prices continue to rise sharply, and rice merchants' greed only increases. It is clear that the recent surge in prices is largely due to speculation and has little to do with actual sales. Therefore, to eliminate this chaotic situation, we believe that:

In terms of public measures, it is essential to adopt strict methods and not be satisfied with just selling off goods. It should be understood that the government sells off materials to supply the people, stabilize life, and not just to meet every demand or provide ample chips to satisfy the desires of speculators. As for gold, its only uses are for jewelry and utensils. If the government has sufficient reserves and nothing else to do with them, or to tighten the money supply and withdraw a portion of the currency, it may consider releasing a certain amount and using it as needed to achieve the aforementioned goals. If not, then this decorative item that cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold, does not require the government to supply it in large quantities. Because our country is not a gold-producing nation, selling off gold is equivalent to wasting foreign exchange. In this time of booming trade deficit and dwindling funds, whether such waste is worthwhile need not be discussed further.

The original government's reason for selling off gold to suppress gold prices was mainly to reduce stimulation and stabilize prices. Since the implementation of this policy, we certainly cannot deny its considerable effect. However, recently, the general state of price madness has not been fully controlled by the price of gold. That is to say, there is no very close relationship between the price of gold and the price of goods. Even if the government uses its greatest efforts to push the price of gold back below 4 million, it is highly doubtful whether general prices will follow suit. Therefore, it is worth studying the merits and demerits of the idea of nationalizing gold. As for continuing to supply these speculative and decorative items, which is blindly continuing to consume this type of foreign exchange, we believe that it has reached the stage where a decision should be made, without further delay.

On the private side, everyone should regain their senses and re-examine whether their method of wildly raising prices is justified. Because although the rise and fall of prices may have occasional factors at times, ultimately, they cannot escape the control of the law of supply and demand. Since the beginning of the new year, generally speaking, there has been no large-scale increase in actual sales in various regions. And while the industrial sector is crying out for collapse, demanding wage cuts or liquidation, the amount of raw materials needed will not drastically increase. In addition, with the looming threat of war and no sign of improvement in transportation obstacles, although loan conditions have eased and the money supply has slightly loosened, the threat of high-interest loans has not been eliminated. If hoarding continues for a long time, actual sales remain stagnant, and expenses such as interest, rent, insurance, etc., increase day by day, then how to deal with the aftermath at that time must be considered in advance.

The soaring prices of general export goods are undoubtedly affected by the foreign exchange subsidy. However, since the sixth of this month, because of the step-by-step increases, many commodity prices have already risen by double or more. That is to say, all the effects of the subsidy have been completely offset. Then, domestic and foreign prices still cannot be balanced, which means that export trade is still difficult to activate. Looking at this past week, what types of exports have actually been settled with foreign merchants? Which types have received overseas responses indicating they are marketable and can be purchased? If overseas sales cannot be activated, then hoarders who are blindly dragging in goods now, whether they will regret it when it comes time to deliver, they should really examine themselves. As for whether the United States will really impose retaliatory measures on these subsidized export goods, let's put that question aside for now.

Fundamentally speaking, the reason for the soaring prices should naturally still be explained in terms of currency value. The so-called price of gold and export subsidies are still only temporary and occasional phenomena. Therefore, to stabilize prices and eliminate the current chaotic situation in the market, we still hope that the government will make a decisive change in its monetary policy. If the currency continues to inflate, making it impossible to increase the public's confidence in legal tender, unwilling to save, and those with surplus funds either buy jewelry, gold bars, foreign currency, or hoard goods and speculate, then prices will never be stabilized, and the current chaotic situation will ultimately be impossible to save. We believe that the government's effective policies should still start here.

### Investigation of the Mu Du Rice Case Completed, Accounting Books Have Questions

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 11th] The Mu Du rice profiteering and hoarding case has aroused serious repercussions from all sectors of Suzhou.

Wang Shimin, head of the Social Affairs Section of the county government, returned to the city on the evening of the 11th after completing the reinvestigation. Our reporter made a special visit late at night to inquire about the truth. He reported that according to the statistics recorded in the accounting books of various rice shops that were reviewed, there were a total of 21,227 shi of rice paddy and 1,748 shi of rice.

It was recently learned that around 8 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, a large number of scattered bandits reappeared in the Menghe and Gaoqiao areas of the northern third district, gathering about a hundred people and attempting to stir up trouble. After receiving the report, the Danyang security team immediately led its team to attack and engaged the bandits in the Yishan area on the Wu-Dan border. At that time, the Jiaojing General Team stationed in Menghe also set out to assist in the suppression upon hearing the news. After several fierce battles, the bandits were defeated and fled towards Yangzhong County. Five bandits were killed, and two rifles and two pistols were seized.

### Contending for Inheritance, Claiming to be Immortals, Spreading Rumors to Deceive the Public, Murdering Two Lives, Strange Drama Staged in the Zha Pu Niang Niang Temple

[Our Pinghu Dispatch] The case of the false **Quan (sect)** setting up a church to fool people and kill people, which occurred in this county last month, has been completely solved by the police bureau. The Tenth District Commissioner commended Inspector Jin and Chief Criminal Police Gao for their meritorious service. The incident took place inside the Tianzun Niangniang Temple on the Qilong'an Mountain peak in the Old Liangzhuang Township, about twelve miles away from Zhapu. Liu Youyu gathered a group of followers and occupied the temple, claiming to be the **Jade Emperor**, making absurd statements and inciting nearby villagers. On the 17th of last month, Xu Keqiu and his brother, who had served as the district chief of Jinshan Lvxiang, were drowned in the pool next to the temple. When the news spread, the police bureau dispatched officers to Zhapu to investigate. Upon arriving in Zhapu, the general public was afraid of the widespread demonic powers and dared not lead them up the mountain. Then the police and Yu detoured up the mountain, Liu Youyu was not willing to yield, but took off his fur robe and jumped with his feet crossed, waving his hands wildly, chanting words in his mouth, and two others ran into the temple, beating drums and ringing bells, and all the instruments of magic were ringing. The police officers then fired their guns as a warning, and Liu Youyu was forced to jump off a huge rock, went to the entrance of the temple with a big knife in his hand, and tried to resist arrest, and then re-entered the temple and made strange noises. At that time, another villager happened to go up the mountain, and the police asked the reason for Xu Keqiu's death. He said, "Liu Youyu was ordered by Bao Gong to recognize them as adopted sons, so he beheaded them." Indeed, two corpses were found in the mud in front of the temple, pressed down by huge rocks, and the flesh and blood were blurred. The situation was extremely miserable. At that time, Liu Shouxing, one of Liu Youyu's followers, walked out of the temple, still acting silly, intending to kill the police officers with a knife, but he didn't know that his magic was ineffective and was shot to death instead. Liu Youyu and others were all rounded up and brought to the county along with other suspects for interrogation by the judicial office. According to the investigation, Liu Youyu recently fought with Liu Jinlong and Liu Liuxing to compete for inheritance, Youyu faked **immortality**, designed to murder Liuxing and Jinlong, and at that time Xu Keqiu's brothers fully understood the inside story, so to silence them, they were first murdered. Some people suspected that Liu and others had mental illness, but the examination showed no signs of madness, and their strange behavior and words were all to shirk responsibility.

### Reorganizing the Qu River

### Wujin Xinsheng Iron Factory Concealed Enemy and Puppet Materials

Investigating and Discovering Water Machines, Water Bellows, Etc.

[Our Wujin Dispatch] This county's local court and Enemy Property Branch recently received a confidential report that the Xinsheng Iron Factory outside the Ximen Gate was concealing a large number of enemy and puppet materials. On the afternoon of the 8th, at about 1 PM, prosecutor Li Yulong and personnel from the branch rushed to the factory for a thorough investigation. They seized five water machines, water bellows, and other items. In addition to investigating the factory, they also summoned Jiang Hongsheng and other relevant personnel to court for interrogation. It is reported that there were originally more than 30 of these water machines, which were purchased by the Disaster Relief Committee during the Jiaxu (23rd year) drought relief before the Anti-Japanese War to rescue farmland irrigation in the four villages. During the occupation period, they were looted by the Japanese and hidden in the Wansheng Iron Factory (owned by Wan Xiangyao). After the victory, Jiang Hongsheng, the factory's materials director, and Zhou Weikun, the bookkeeper, transferred them to the Xinsheng Iron Foundry, with only five remaining. The rest have not been found. According to general speculation, they may have been resold long ago or destroyed and converted into other materials.

### Wuxi County Council to be Established on the 15th

In addition, starting on the 10th, the so-called express telephone service has also been opened between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, meaning that each call, from the time the calling user registers to the time the receiving user starts talking, will not exceed ten minutes at most.

### Unrest in the Eastern Countryside of Wuxi, Village Head Murdered Late at Night, Two Bandits Lure Him Out of the House, Rope and Bayonet Attack Together

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] Recently, bandit alarms have been frequently heard in all directions, especially in the Ganludangzhai area in the eastern countryside, where there have often been incidents of looting, rape, and kidnapping. Around 12 PM on the evening of the other day, two bandits in plain clothes holding pistols suddenly came to the home of Zou Shiliang, the village head of Dangkou Jin'e Township, claiming to be youth soldiers from Maotang Bridge, who came to contact him because there were bandit troops active in the area. Zou immediately got up and opened the door upon hearing this. The bandits then rushed in, and then asked for the name of the deputy village head, and asked him to contact them together. Zou believed it to be true and went to the outside room with them, and did not return for a long time. The next day at dusk, Zou's body was found in the Jin'edun Southeast Bang River, with a hemp rope around his neck and thirteen stab wounds on his abdomen and lower body. Zou's wife was distraught when she heard the news. The township office retrieved the body and sent a special messenger to report to the county government on the 10th. On the 10th, Deputy Township Head Zhu Guanlun, together with the head of the district, reported to the local court's prosecutor's office and requested to send someone to inspect the body. After the Jin prosecutor opened the investigation, he ordered them to return and decided to send someone to the countryside to inspect the body on the 11th.

### The Suzhou Creek Bank Should be Quickly Repaired

Shanghai is our China's first largest city, especially the city of the victorious country. The appearance and construction should be improved. Now I live on the Suzhou Creek Bank, and I see the following things every morning and evening, which need to be handled urgently:

(1) The bridge lamps of the Tianhou Palace Bridge have broken glass that is incomplete, and some of the electric lights do not shine brightly, which is a bit of a flaw. I think it is easy to handle, so please do it quickly.

(2) The railings along the Suzhou Creek are broken and incomplete. If pedestrians are not careful, they may fall into the river in the dark. Please install them quickly to avoid danger. The above two items naturally require funding. In my opinion, although the city's finances are currently in a state of famine, these small matters are easy to handle. If they can be adopted and implemented, it is convenient for people and makes the city look grand. (Zhu Juquan)

### Suggestions to the Municipal Transportation Authorities

Since the victory, the number of transportation vehicles in this city has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the roads are crowded with vehicles, with cars connected head to tail, and traffic is extremely congested. It often takes a long time to reach even a very short distance, and the time lost is really not small. Although the authorities have tried their best to maintain order, they are really overwhelmed. In view of this, I ask the authorities to unify the traffic lights on the main roads of the most prosperous areas of the city. For example; Nanjing Road is the most important, the distance between the cross roads is close, and the number of cars coming and going is the largest. Please change the traffic lights from Sichuan Road to the New World to automatic traffic lights, divided into red, yellow, and green. For example, when Sichuan Road is red or green, the rest are the same, and the yellow light is a preparation light, and its time is limited to three or four minutes, so that fast cars and bicycles can pass directly. In order to avoid the red light being blocked by the former and the latter coming one after another. Blocking in one place suddenly blocks the area. Thus; stopping all traffic can avoid congestion. The most important thing to note is that the traffic lights on the roads next to Nanjing Road should be changed to be the same as those that are the most important, such as the traffic lights at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, which are close to Nanjing Road. If Nanjing Road is green, the vehicles on Henan Road will block the intersection of Beijing Road and will not be able to pass. Waiting for it to open, Nanjing Road has already opened the red light, so Henan Road is blocked instead, so you must pay attention to the traffic lights near Nanjing Road. Trolley cars are the easiest to block traffic, and the reason is probably because passengers are crowded at each small station, and it takes a long time to stop. If five or six cars are connected and driving, please open an empty car between each or two trolley cars at the end points of the second line of trolley cars, which will be specially used to carry passengers at each small station, so that trolley cars will be slightly less delayed at each small station. On Beijing Road, pedicabs are the most troublesome, and the reason is that since passengers have come from the North Railway Station to various places, and the Pentang Lane Bridge and Laozha Bridge have not been opened, most of the pedicabs have been detoured from Henan Road to Beijing Road to pick up passengers from various places, so please repair the Pentang Lane Bridge as soon as possible and open the Laozha Bridge immediately, so that Beijing Road can avoid crowding. Is it appropriate? Please adopt it. (Wang Yunxiang)

### Plea from Small Landlords for Rent Increases

We are a group of small landlords who, besides relying on the meager salaries of our sons and husbands, also depend on some rental income to supplement our household expenses. In the past, we could barely manage, but recently, the prices of everything have skyrocketed, increasing several times over. Not only are gold and rice prices like this, but also water and electricity bills, housing taxes, land taxes, etc., have increased thousands to tens of thousands of times. However, our rents, based on the published method since last spring, have only been increased to 140 times the pre-war rent, and they remain at 140 times. A pre-war base rent of five yuan is now seven hundred yuan, but the total rent for a building is still not enough to pay even one-tenth of the land tax. If we want to increase the rent, the tenants say that the newspapers have not stipulated it, so they insist on refusing. Therefore, we now earnestly request the esteemed councilors of this city to re-discuss and fairly publish the multiplier in the newspapers. (Zhao Zhang et al.)

### US Launches Purge, Concentrating on State Department Personnel, Hiss Case Transferred to Justice Department

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Since the arrest last week of Alger Hiss, the alleged mastermind of Soviet espionage in the United States, a system of cleansing is visibly intensifying among US federal government personnel. The House Un-American Activities Committee is currently launching a campaign against communists here, focusing its target on the State Department. While this anti-communist sentiment is not particularly intense, it has gradually strengthened in recent months due to the exposure of subversive activities by communist elements. It is said that the Departments of the Army and Navy have been quite successful in investigating their personnel prior to enlistment. The Un-American Activities Committee also believes that red elements have infiltrated the US Immigration and Naturalization Service. To date, US civil servants have been subjected to loyalty and security checks before entering government service.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Republican Congressman Thomas, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, today released a letter from Attorney General Clark, stating, "The fifth column directed by Moscow within the United States should have been crushed long ago. Therefore, I hope that Alger Hiss and his accomplices will be prosecuted. The Communist Party has a flexible espionage and political apparatus that is active in the Western Hemisphere, and Hiss is only one important link in it. Future trials... will also expose other individuals whose activities are equally harmful." It is reported that the committee has subpoenaed many witnesses, all of whom have identified Alger Hiss as the top Soviet intelligence agent in the US. The committee accuses Hiss of conspiring to overthrow the US government, evading income taxes, and forging passports. Hiss was subpoenaed last week but refused to swear an oath and testify. The case has now been transferred to the Justice Department for handling.

Only Finland accepted the peace terms without protest.

[Reuters, London, 11th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin sent separate telegrams to the people of each of the five former enemy nations on the day the treaties were signed, offering words of encouragement. The telegrams stated: "The consequences of the war still remain in the world. Today, we must never forget the horrors and suffering of war. The signing of the treaties has officially ended the war. We should take this opportunity to look forward. Every nation now faces many individual and national problems. In addition, there is the issue of establishing understanding between nations, which requires everyone's goodwill, patience, and effort to address."

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Italy implemented a national general strike for ten days today, marked by the simultaneous sounding of sirens, to protest the terms of the Italian peace treaty and express grief.

### London Conference Reaches Stalemate, Arabs and Jews Reject New British Plan

[Reuters, London, 10th] Both the Jewish and Arab sides have definitively rejected the British government's new plan for Palestine. It is expected that the British government will no longer suggest resolving the Palestine issue through negotiations. The British Cabinet will likely pursue one of the following four paths: (1) directly implementing the already decided plan in its capacity as the mandatory power; (2) submitting its plan to a United Nations agency for approval and then enforcing it; (3) enforcing a solution with the assistance of a United Nations agency; (4) transferring the mandatory power to a United Nations agency. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Bevin favors the second option mentioned above, and the content of the new plan will not exclude partition.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 10th] British military authorities here announced a curfew to be implemented starting on Thursday and sentenced three Jewish underground operatives to death.

### Rumor That Marshall Will Meet Stalin to Directly Discuss Outstanding Issues Between US and USSR, US State Department Makes No Affirmative Statement

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Special Dispatch] A Central News Agency reporter today inquired with the State Department regarding the recent rumor that Marshall and Stalin might hold a meeting when the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is held on March 20th to discuss "outstanding" issues between the US and the USSR. The State Department did not provide an affirmative answer, only stating that Molotov visited President Truman when he visited Washington in the past, and it would be surprising if Marshall did not take the opportunity to visit Stalin during his attendance at the Moscow Conference. The State Department official further emphasized that Marshall met Stalin during his attendance at the Tehran and Yalta conferences, and when he goes to Moscow next month, he will naturally visit Stalin directly or through the introduction of the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith. However, the State Department does not intend to make any statements on this matter, and the date of the Marshall-Stalin meeting has not been set either. As for the matters they will discuss, it still remains for the two of them to decide. It is noted that before Byrnes resigned, he publicly stated that if he attended the future Moscow Conference, he would take the opportunity to visit Stalin. There is much speculation about the matters that will be discussed at the Marshall-Stalin meeting.

[Associated Press, Chicago, 10th] International affairs expert Dulles said to the "Atlanta Journal" Public Association today: "The traditional foreign policy of the United States is facing a serious challenge from the Soviet Union. This does not mean that a war incited by the Soviet Union is inevitable, but if we retreat and allow the Soviet Union to advance recklessly, there is a risk of causing a war. If the Soviet Union miscalculates, the danger of war is extremely great. Powerful political leaders often become overly confident when they are establishing great achievements. The US policies challenged by the Soviet Union are the Monroe Doctrine, the rejection of China being dominated by the great powers, the insistence on Europe's freedom from Nazi tyranny, and the advocacy that the United Nations should allow all countries to speak freely with equal status."

### British Coal Crisis Shows No Signs of Abating, Labor Government Faces Difficulties, Conservative Party Accuses Government of Lacking Foresight

[Associated Press, London, 10th] The struggle between the British Conservative Party and the Labor Party in various regions has intensified due to the severe coal crisis. In the House of Commons today, Churchill attacked senior officials of the Labor government for their incompetence in dealing with the national coal crisis and industrial crisis. More than 50% of British factories have now suspended work, but Churchill agreed to postpone the demand to vote on his proposed impeachment motion for another day. Churchill and Chancellor Dalton both stated in the House of Commons debates that neither the Conservative Party nor the Labor Party would allow the formation of a coalition government to jointly deal with the national crisis. According to weather forecasts, the freeze in the British Isles will thaw for 36 hours, and then it will turn cold again. The temperature will drop below freezing again on Tuesday, and the situation is pessimistic. Conservative MP Hudson accused Fuel and Power Minister Shinwell in the House of Commons of lacking foresight and handling the situation poorly. Shinwell replied that the government would be derelict in its duties if it did not take emergency measures. Churchill condemned the entire Labor government and its socialism for mismanagement at a high level, stating that the totality of our lives are gradually deteriorating and predicted that the situation would inevitably worsen. He said, "We can learn a lesson in gradual suffering." At the same time, Prime Minister Attlee broadcast to the nation, stating that the winter is unusually cold, the coal reserves were depleted during the war, and the number of miners has decreased due to many joining the military, which is the reason for today's coal crisis. Conservative Party Chairman Hulton addressed a political gathering in Glasgow, shouting that it is everyone's responsibility to overthrow the current government. He said that if the current government is allowed to continue, everything except Parliament will collapse. Labour Minister Isaac said at a Labor Party gathering in London: "We will definitely be able to weather this political crisis. The Labor Party must implement its socialist plans regardless of everything and with unwavering determination."

### Security Council Does Not Interfere with the Issue of the Execution of Political Prisoners in Greece, Greek Representative Notifies Lai to Approve Postponement of Execution

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 10th] The Security Council today, with a majority of nine votes, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining, passed the resolution of the US representative Johnson, rejecting the proposal of the United Nations Balkans Investigation Group to be allowed to interfere with the execution of Greek guerrillas. The resolution states: "It is hereby resolved that unless the person reported to be executed can be a witness for the work of the investigation team, the investigation team has no right to request a postponement of the execution." Furthermore, the Greek representative also sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations yesterday, stating that he has, as requested, postponed the execution and stated that the investigation team should not neglect its attention to the border dispute case because of this matter.

### A Serious Report from the US Government: An Analysis of Soviet War Power (Part 2)

— Translated and excerpted by Zhang Deqian

Strengthening the Red Fleet and Contending for Naval Power with Britain and the US

At the start of World War II, the Soviet Navy was very small compared to the world's powerful naval nations. The Red Fleet only had:

Three battleships (approximately thirty years old);
One new-style cruiser;
Six semi-new-style cruisers;
Two old-style cruisers;
A submarine force (small tonnage) (number unknown)
Seventy destroyers

During the war, Britain and the United States provided the Soviet Union with many types of warships through lend-lease or other means, including the famous British battleship "Royal Sovereign."

On May 21, 1946, Admiral Nimitz testified before the US House of Representatives Special Appropriations Committee that the total number of main ships of the leading naval nations were as follows: United States: 756; Great Britain: 491; Soviet Union: 204; Italy: 47; France: 46.

According to Nimitz, the Soviet naval lineup was roughly as follows: four battleships; seven heavy cruisers; two light cruisers; fifty-one destroyers; one hundred and forty submarines; no aircraft carriers; no escort carriers.

Air Force Maintains Secrecy, Produces Approximately 20,000 Aircraft Annually

The Soviet Army and Navy had agreed on close cooperation terms. This coordination was most evident during World War II when the Red Army took the offensive.

In the three years of war before the Red Navy Day on July 22, 1944, the Soviet Navy and Naval Aviation achieved the following results: sunk more than 2,500 enemy ships; damaged more than 1,200 enemy ships; and destroyed 6,600 enemy aircraft. Stalin declared on Navy Day in 1945: "The Soviet people hope to see the Soviet Navy grow stronger day by day. Our people will build new warships and new naval bases."

According to the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union gained full possession of the Kuril Islands and the southern half of Sakhalin Island and enjoyed privileges in the three eastern provinces of China. As a result, the Soviet Union's maritime authority was further strengthened.

Due to geographical reasons, the Soviet Navy must operate in vast and separated areas. The main purpose of the Soviet Navy seems to be to defend Soviet national interests in the White Sea, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Japan.

British and Soviet navies will meet each other at the entrances to the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, so it is necessary to find ways to coordinate in order to maintain peace. Similarly, the US and Soviet navies must also achieve coordination in the Western Pacific.

The Soviet Army and Navy each have an air force. We have no information about their air force organization and strength. It is estimated that at the beginning of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union had approximately 4,000 to 30,000 military aircraft, or perhaps more. In 1943, a German-occupied country aviation correspondent estimated that the Soviet Union could produce 20,000 aircraft per year at that time.

During World War II, the Soviet Union received a large number of aircraft from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act, making the Soviet Air Force stronger.

The position of the Soviet Army Air Force in the Red Army is roughly the same as the position of the US Army Air Force in the US Army.

During the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Naval Aviation mainly fought in the three war zones of the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. Air Force personnel not only had to protect naval bases and ships from enemy attacks but also had to launch counterattacks behind German lines.

Basic National Defense Policy Emphasizes Economic Potential

The basic national defense policy of the Soviet Union, as declared by Soviet leaders, is roughly (1) to support United Nations agencies in achieving collective security; (2) to maintain a strong army and navy to ensure its own security in case international coordination schemes fail. The Soviet Union's defense policy pays great attention to the economic potential related to military affairs. They also pay attention to how to expand scientific research facilities in order to make inventions, especially in the field of atomic energy.

### Complex and Confusing Japanese Political Situation, Efforts at Coalition Resume

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 11th] The Japanese political situation has recently become complex and confusing, with the Progressive Party's movement to form a new party and Prime Minister Yoshida's third attempt to pull in the Socialist Party to form a coalition cabinet intertwined. The Progressive Party convened a meeting of its top leaders today and decided to continue to form a new party but with the principle that it should not hinder the formation of a coalition cabinet. Based on this decision, the party's secretary-general, Tanaka, suggested to the Liberal and Socialist parties today that each party send three representatives to discuss the formation of a coalition cabinet. A party meeting may be held on the 13th. Minister Kawatani, Minister of Finance Ishibashi, and Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio and Central Committee member Mizutani seem to have reached an understanding. The Socialist Party may convene a meeting of its Central Executive Committee in the next few days to decide its attitude. The question is whether the party's left wing will compromise with the right wing. Prime Minister Yoshida summoned Minister of Home Affairs Uehara and Cabinet Secretary-General Hayashi this morning to discuss the coalition cabinet and the new party issue. He then met with State Minister Shidehara to exchange views and decided to unite the Liberal and Progressive parties to promote coalition efforts. As a result of the Yoshida-Shidehara talks, the Progressive Party may abandon its plan to seek a new leader separate from Yoshida and Shidehara.

### Mayor Wu Convenes Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Price Stabilization Measures, Speaker Pan Discusses the Inside Story of the Gold Surge, Urges the Government to Take Decisive Measures

The prices in this city have fluctuated greatly in recent days. Mayor Wu is very concerned and convened a meeting at his official residence on Great Pulas Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Director Fang Zhi of the Municipal Party Committee, Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, and other party and government officials attended. It is heard that they discussed stabilizing the rising prices and will take necessary measures.

Speaker Pan Gongzhan went to Beijing on official business last night. The reporter met him at the North Station and recorded the following Q&A: (Q) Due to the surge in gold prices in Shanghai recently, prices in general have been affected. Will the government take any measures? (A) The Central Bank's policy of selling gold seems unable to control prices today and has instead become a factor stimulating prices. In a few days, it has skyrocketed by more than double, exceeding the rate of price increases. Therefore, it is expected that the government contains partisan political effect. The CCP clearly wants to use the materials or legal tender it has plundered in its areas to drive up the price of gold and disrupt the market in the KMT-controlled areas in order to achieve its conspiracy to undermine the government. For the sake of the country and the people, we should urge the government to take decisive measures. (Q) What are the opinions of the Municipal Council on this? (A) More than a dozen councilors have requested a meeting to discuss the price issue. It is likely that a special session or an early continuation of the second session will be convened in a few days. (Q) What are your thoughts on the incident at the Quanggong Building meeting the other day that resulted in a death? (A) Shanghai should prioritize peaceful living and working. Therefore, everyone should abide by the law. Supporting domestic products is naturally supported by everyone. However, using the name to raise the public, attempting to coerce the public into being anti-American, is clearly another ulterior motive. We sympathize greatly with the innocent beating of Mr. Liang Renda, which resulted in his death. We should ask the government to accept the petitions of the various labor unions, investigate the instigators, and arrest and punish the murderers in order to maintain order and stabilize society.

[Another Report] Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, because of the crazy rise in gold notes and prices in this city, took the night express train to Beijing last night to ask the authorities for instructions on how to deal with it.

### Difficult to Control Prices, Shakes Head and Smiles Bitterly, Social Affairs Bureau Helpless

[Our Report] Due to the crazy rise in prices in recent days, the reporter visited the Price Management Section of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about their opinions. They shook their heads and smiled bitterly, saying that it is impossible to negotiate or control the prices that rise several times a day.

### Gasoline Prices Increase by Almost Double, All-Day Supply Starts Today, No Longer Subject to Restrictions

[Our Report] Gasoline prices have increased from 1,300 yuan per gallon to 2,500 yuan per gallon starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. The congestion at gas stations that has occurred in the past week seems to be less severe after the price increase. According to some gas station attendants, all-day supply will be available starting today, and there will no longer be restrictions. It is understood that this price increase was requested by oil companies to our government and approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Case File of the Labor Encouragement Building Incident Transferred to the District Attorney's Office; Three Beaten Workers Verified Injuries; Accusation Filed Against Meeting Convener; Allegations of Joint Instigation of Assault Against Chen Shi-jun

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Labor Encouragement Building bloodshed incident, the Huangpu Police Department arrested twenty-one workers involved in the mutual assault at the scene. After questioning each individually, the police department, acting on the mayor's orders, released all on bail. All interrogation records and details of the crime were transferred to the District Attorney's Office at 10:00 AM yesterday, along with fifteen injury verification certificates, four meeting notices, and four copies of anti-American song lyrics. Additionally, three injured individuals, Meng Zhisheng, Chen Sihong, and Wang Yuxiang, jointly submitted a formal complaint to the District Attorney's Office, accusing Chen Shi-jun, Chairman of the Department Store Workers' Union of the Third District, of joint instigation of assault and other crimes. The three also went to the District Attorney's Office yesterday for injury verification. The prosecutor will summon Mi Yong, Wang Fugen, Cai Futian, Sun Shoukang, Yang Jun, and the other twenty-one individuals arrested for mutual assault within the next few days.

[Central News Agency Report] Workers Meng Zhisheng, Chen Sihong, Wang Yuxiang, and others, who were beaten and injured at the Labor Encouragement Building, reportedly requested injury verification from the District Court Prosecutor's Office at 2:00 PM the other day. They also accused Chen Shi-jun, Chairman of the Department Store Workers' Union of the Third District and convener of the general meeting, of being heavily implicated in the tragic incident. The forensic doctor verified the injuries as factual, and the prosecutor conducted a brief interrogation before accepting the case and initiating an investigation. The workers were instructed to investigate the perpetrators at the scene and report them to the authorities for legal action at any time. Finally, the prosecutor stated that he attached great importance to this case and would thoroughly investigate it. The full text of the original complaint is recorded below:

Full Text of the Complaint

Criminal Accusers: Meng Zhisheng, Chen Sihong, Wang Yuxiang; Defendant: Chen Shi-jun; Regarding the matter of investigating and prosecuting the crime of deceitful assault, it is submitted that on the afternoon of the 8th of this month, each labor union received a notice issued by the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Resisting American Goods," requesting each labor union to attend a meeting at the Xindu Theater at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Tianjin Road at 9:00 AM on the 9th. The notice stated at the outset that the purpose of the meeting was "to promote domestic goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis." This was the sincere request of our workers. Therefore, the accusers and others, filled with enthusiasm, rushed to the meeting venue. However, two friends wearing red flowers on their lapels at the entrance said, "Our meeting venue has been temporarily changed to the Labor Encouragement Building." The accusers and others rushed to the building again. But when they arrived, the meeting seemed to have already started. Someone was giving a speech on the stage, and some people below the stage were singing the songs "American Troops Get Out Quickly," "If We Can't Drive Away the American Troops, We Won't Be Satisfied," "Bastards Who Create Civil War," and "American Goods Are the Essence of Deception," none of which mentioned promoting domestic goods, clearly implying a political purpose. While hesitating to ask, they suddenly heard shouts of "Down with the National Government" and "Support the Communist Party." Many people in the crowd retorted to this. Unexpectedly, the friends wearing red flowers started scolding, calling them "troublemakers," and with a loud shout of "Fight," tables, chairs, and benches flew. Except for one person, Liang Renda, who died from his injuries, the first accuser suffered injuries to the top of his head and back, the second accuser suffered injuries to his left hand and right chest, and the third accuser suffered injuries to his face and back. It is investigated that the preparatory committee was presided over by the defendant, and the meeting place was also located at the defendant's labor union. Therefore, the defendant has significant suspicion of involvement in the crime. As for the other defendants who committed the assault, they will be added after further investigation. Therefore, it is requested that a true investigation be conducted and a prosecution be pursued to uphold the law and eliminate reactionaries. This would be greatly beneficial. The petition is submitted to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for your kind consideration.

### Organizing the Liang Renda Support Association

The Deceased's Remains Will Be Placed in a Coffin Today

The worker representatives of various industry labor unions in this city, who were deceived into attending the "Promote Domestic Goods and Resist American Goods" meeting, considering the impoverished state of their deceased colleague Liang Renda, have specially requested the General Labor Union to provide strong support. The union convened a temporary standing committee meeting and decided to establish the Liang Case Support Association, appointing Zhang Zhusan and twenty other individuals as committee members, who will begin work immediately.

[Another Report] Liang Ren's remains were sent to the Anle Funeral Home on Wuding Road by his family at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Staff from Wing On Company and public officials were also dispatched to assist with the arrangements. The Wing On Company staff also organized a preparatory committee for the Liang Renda Memorial Service to handle the funeral arrangements. It has been decided that Liang's remains will be placed in a coffin at 3:00 PM today.

### Chairman Fang's Remarks

Director Fang, chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, who just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday, attached great importance to the unfortunate incident at the Labor Encouragement Building. He met with a Central News Agency reporter at the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday and expressed his views on this unfortunate incident, stating that freedom of assembly is a precious principle of democratic politics, and love of domestic goods is a sentiment shared by all compatriots. However, according to reports in the newspapers, the assembly at the Labor Encouragement Building was not notified to the relevant government authorities in advance, and the meeting location was changed several times at the last minute. The meeting notice stated that it was to promote domestic goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis, but during the meeting, anti-American songs such as "If We Can't Drive Away the American Troops, We Won't Be Satisfied" were sung, and absurd slogans such as "Down with the National Government" were shouted. The convener of the meeting had no responsible person, and it was unknown who was in the presidium or who was the chairman during the meeting. To speak of democracy and freedom in this way is enough to make one weep for the future of China's true democracy and freedom. Now that this case has been sent to the judicial authorities for handling, it is hoped that the court authorities will investigate and question it according to the law and thoroughly investigate who is in charge of the so-called "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Resisting American Goods." It is necessary to thoroughly investigate who invited Mr. Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, Ma Yinchu, and others to speak at the meeting. At the same time, it is even more necessary to thoroughly investigate who was the instigator of the beating. Only in this way can Liang Jun not die in vain at the hands of political swindlers, and can the citizens of Shanghai, because of Liang Jun's death, deepen their understanding of the true colors of these careerists, so that they will not be deceived again.

### In the Xinshi and Jiangwan Districts, Cai Fushan Expressed Humility; After Being Elected, He Resigned; The Director of Civil Affairs Delivered a Speech Praising Him Highly

In the Xinshi District of this city, the election of the district chief was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. As a result of the election, Cai Fushan was elected district chief with the most votes, ten votes, and was elected deputy district chief with the most votes, twelve votes. Director Zhang Xiaosong then asked Cai Fushan which position he was willing to take, and Cai immediately expressed his willingness to take the position of deputy district chief and resign as district chief. Therefore, Zhu Shuren, who received the most votes with eight votes, was elected district chief on the spot. Director Zhang recognized that Cai Fushan's voluntary resignation as district chief was one of the most commendable actions in the district chief elections in this city and immediately delivered a speech on the spot, praising Cai Fushan highly. In the Jiangwan District, Li Chengtang was elected district chief with twenty-two votes, and Xu Zhongtian was elected deputy district chief with fourteen votes.

### Chen Shi-jun's Statement on the Process of Convening the General Meeting; The Formation Was Not Approved; Inconsistent with the Law

[Central News Agency Report] The Social Affairs Bureau, acting on orders to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Labor Encouragement Building incident, summoned Chen Shi-jun, Chairman of the Department Store Workers' Union of the Third District, to the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday for questioning. It is reported that Chen Shi-jun stated the circumstances of the Labor Encouragement Building incident, stating that the "Promote Domestic Goods and Resist American Goods Movement" was decided and convened by the full board of directors and supervisors of the Department Store Workers' Union of the Third District between the 5th and 7th of this month. The attending directors and supervisors, and the chairmen of various companies, included Ding Shengya of Wing On Company, Han Wucheng of Sincere Company, Liu Caizhang of The Sun Company, Chen Shi-jun of China National Products Company, Mo Buyun of Sincere Company, Lu Peiyu of China General Merchandise Co, Zhu Weicheng of Lihua Company, Du Lingyuansheng of Sanyo Co., and Lu Hengfu of Little Luzon Company. The meeting location was decided at the last minute on the morning of the meeting to be at the Department Store Workers' Union address in the Labor Encouragement Building. The agenda for the meeting on that day was: (1) To elect Wang Shouquan (China National Products Company) as the new leader; (2) To have Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, and others give speeches; (3) To elect the responsible persons of the preparatory committee. It was also stated that the song program for that day would be hosted by the labor union's singing group, and the security team would be staffed by the security teams of the various company branches. As for the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Resisting American Goods," it has not yet been established, but all documents and activities announced to the outside world are the responsibility of the directors of the Department Store Workers' Union of the Third District. According to a person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau speaking to a reporter, the association's launch and formation were not approved in advance in accordance with the law, which is inconsistent with the law. Moreover, the actual circumstances of the meeting did not match the content of the notice, which was the biggest reason for the dissatisfaction of the representatives of the various labor unions attending the meeting. It is still planned to continue to thoroughly investigate the matter jointly with the police department.

### Representatives of Deceived Workers Petition the Municipal Party Headquarters

The various industry labor unions in this city, who were deceived into attending the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Resisting American Goods" meeting, were brutally beaten by conspirators, resulting in worker deaths and injuries. They specially sent representatives Hu Kun, Zhang Jiande, Liu Zhiqun, and more than ten others to the Municipal Party Headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday to petition. Director Fang personally received them, and the representatives unanimously requested that the perpetrators of the incident be severely punished and that the families of the deceased be given generous compensation. Director Fang stated that the Party Headquarters would assist the government in thoroughly investigating the facts of the incident regarding the punishment of the culprits. He expressed his infinite grief for Liang Jun's injury and death and expressed his sincere condolences to the injured. He also stated that the government would severely punish those who caused the incident and that the government would provide generous compensation to Liang Jun, who died. The representatives then gladly departed.

### Tragic Explosion While Mixing Ammunition; Fire Department Squad Leader Died from Severe Abdominal Injuries

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 1:00 PM yesterday, an explosion suddenly occurred in the No. 1 dormitory of the Central Squad of the Fire Department of the Henan Road Police Department due to accidental testing of explosives. A thick smoke filled the air, and Squad Leader Zhou Yueshi was severely injured on the spot. When his wife, Wang Wenying, and his colleagues rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound, he was barely breathing but still able to speak. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries and the perforation of his intestines and abdomen, he died at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. Bureau Chief Zhou was 31 years old, from Jiangqiao, Shanghai, and had served in the Fire Department for eight years. He was diligent in his work and highly valued by his superiors. However, Zhou was fond of hunting in his spare time. Recently, due to the disappearance of ammunition imports and the soaring prices, he purchased some explosives a few days ago and planned to mix them according to reference books. Yesterday, after dinner, he conducted his first test in the dormitory, unfortunately causing the tragic accident. His remains have been sent to Liyuan Funeral Home, and the coffin will be sealed today.

### Workers Demand Higher Base Salaries; Government Orders Strict Prohibition Via Telegram

The China National Industries Association stated that the demand by employees of member factories to increase base salaries has made the current industrial crisis more serious. They specially submitted a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Social Affairs requesting them to effectively stop this in order to maintain the survival of factories. It is reported that the association has received a response from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the original text of which is as follows: "Received and understood. Regarding the matter that workers' base salaries should not be increased again, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Petition Group came to Nanjing to petition previously. The Ministry, together with the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies, convened a meeting and resolved that future wage adjustments should not increase the base salary. If necessary, it may also be appropriately reduced. The matter was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and telegraphed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and its Shanghai branch, and this Ministry has also sent a letter to the participating agencies to clarify the matter. Based on the foregoing, in addition to already sending separate letters to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the competent authorities to strictly prohibit this, you are hereby notified."

### All Circles in Beiping Respond to the Shanghai Peace Movement; Initiated by Wang You, Deng Cuiying, et al.

Since the Shanghai industrial, commercial, and professional circles initiated the peace movement, with its fair attitude, many people in the industrial and commercial circles of various cities have responded. It is learned that in Beiping, Deng Cuiying, Li Peng, Chuan Tong, Yang Bingchen, and twenty-one others are also jointly initiating a peace movement locally. They also sent a telegram via express mail to the initiators of the Shanghai peace movement a few days ago to facilitate contact.

### Nanjing Aircraft Arrives in Shanghai; Test Flight Achieves Satisfactory Results; Landings at US Airports En Route; Equipment Far Superior to Domestic Airports

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China National Aviation Corporation's DC4-type giant aircraft, the "Nanjing," which was test-flying and inspecting the Sino-US air route, flew back to Jiangwan Airport in this city at 2:30 PM yesterday. The aircraft took off from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd of last month, led by Mr. Dewey, an American director of China National Aviation Corporation, along with more than 20 technicians in communications, meteorology, and supply. It arrived in San Francisco on the evening of the 27th after passing through Guam, Midway Island, and Honolulu. After staying in the United States for ten days and having some contacts with relevant parties, the original crew departed from San Francisco on the morning of the 7th of this month and returned to China via the original route. In addition to Honolulu, Midway Island, and Guam, it also landed on Wake Island between Midway Island and Guam. The airport communications, meteorology, repair, and landing equipment in the above locations were inspected along the way. According to the technicians who returned to Shanghai, the test flight was extremely smooth and pleasant, and the equipment at the US civil aviation airports along the way was far superior to that of domestic airports. After the test flight returns to Shanghai, the company authorities will soon receive a report on the various technical details obtained during the inspection. The opening of the Sino-US air route should not be far off.

### The "Yellow Peril" Threatens Shanghai; Gold Price Soars, Bringing a Wind of Price Hikes; Extremes Breed Decline, Speculators Beware of Reaction

[Special Article from Our Newspaper] In the past day or two, the soaring gold price, which serves as an indicator of commodity prices, has brought a violent wind of price hikes, causing chaos and unease in the entire Shanghai market and making ordinary people worry about their future. Speculators aside, even ordinary, law-abiding people, upon seeing the sunlight each morning, consider the price of gold and the price of rice as their first thoughts. Even the most calm and composed people are now alarmed by the shocking depreciation of the legal tender. The entire Greater Shanghai is under the threat of the "Yellow Peril"!

Let us take a brief look back. Just after the Lunar New Year, the Central Bank considered that during the New Year, people in all industries would receive year-end bonuses, increasing purchasing power in society. Gold was relatively cheaper than commodities, naturally becoming an object of purchase and trade. Therefore, at that time, the Central Bank reversed its usual practice of releasing 1,000 to 900 bars per day, openly allocating 3,400 bars and secretly releasing more than 10,000 bars, aiming to preemptively stabilize the market in this city. Unfortunately, this plan did not achieve the desired effect. Starting last week, the gold price began to rise rapidly, and the Central Bank reduced its releases instead, encouraging speculators. As a result, the gold price rose in a straight line from 4.04 million to a peak of 5.9 million by last Saturday.

Critical Moment, Bolt from the Blue

At this point, there was an opportunity for the gold price to fall. When the gold price was 5.9 million on Saturday, the Central Bank allocated 4,000 bars at a price of 5.4 million. The minds of those in the speculative market are extremely sensitive, and this powerful action caused the gold price to fall at that time, and no one dared to buy in for a while. On Monday of this week, the opening gold price was 5.5 million, and it briefly fell to 5.37 million. But at 10:00 AM, a decisive moment arrived. Because 10:00 AM was the time for the Central Bank's allocation, tens of thousands of ears listened attentively. At 10:01 AM, it was confirmed that the Central Bank had changed its policy, allocating only to silver shops, and the number was surprisingly small, only 118 bars! This was a bolt from the blue, and the market was instantly in chaos. In just forty-eight hours, the magnificent sight of gold breaking through the eight million mark was created!

US Dollars and Stocks Are Very Lucky

The soaring gold price has a direct and multifaceted impact. First is the US dollar, which is inseparable from gold. However, buying it is more complicated, with the distinction between new and old notes, and the difference between buying and selling is too large, so fewer people inquire about it. But the price of the US dollar must be balanced with the price of gold, so as the gold price soared, the US dollar also reached a peak of 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. Stocks, which are usually unpopular, are also all rising to their limit. Yesterday, Wing On stock even traded at an additional 90 yuan. However, although the value of stocks has increased, it is at best a "substitute" because the gold price is rising too quickly, changing several times a day. It is not cost-effective to sell gold in the morning and buy it back in the afternoon, so people turn to stocks instead. At the same time, because the price of the US dollar has risen, people expect that the price of foreign raw materials will also rise, which is also the reason why stocks are so lucky.

Commodity Prices Change Several Times a Day, Shop Assistants' Expressions Are Ugly

Walking through the streets, it is easy to see the impact of the "Yellow Peril" on people's livelihoods. Taking the staple food, rice, as an example, the government's negotiated price for white rice is 76,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), and 60,000 dan of Saigon rice are released every day. However, some of the Saigon rice flows to other cities, and not every rice shop can buy it. As for white rice, the shop assistants will secretly tell you: with the gold price so high, rice will be 140,000 yuan per dan! The prices of daily necessities and imported goods change several times a day. Here are a few simple examples: soap has risen from 50,000 yuan per box to 320,000 yuan, and it is still in short supply. Klim milk powder was only 10,000 yuan per pound a week ago, but it rose to 20,000 yuan the day before yesterday, and yesterday it was declared out of stock. Other imported goods can be judged by analogy. In the past, the policy of shops was "high profits and desperate for cash," with smiling faces afraid that customers would not buy. Now, their expressions are stern, they demand prices at will, and sometimes they will tell you: after selling it, there is no way to replenish it!

The power of gold is as strong as the midday sun today, but extremes breed decline, and subtle signs have already appeared. At noon yesterday, the gold price rose to 9.6 million yuan, but two pieces of news suddenly came to the market:

President Song is Coming to Shanghai Today; A Major Player Sells Off in Huge Quantities

First, the authorities have paid close attention to the matter, and President Song will come to Shanghai today to personally handle it. The direct impact of this is that a major player sold off in huge quantities, causing the gold price to fall by more than one million. At the same time, it was reported that Washington believes that the value of the legal tender has depreciated to the point where its internal and external values are balanced, and it is willing to maintain this price. This also has a great impact on market sentiment. According to a person with market experience, the main reason for the current "gold rush" in the market is that some people speculate that the Central Bank has a total of 50 tons of gold reserves, and it has used 35 tons, leaving 15 tons, and it does not dare to put all its eggs in one basket and release them rashly. If the Central Bank maintains its current policy of not releasing gold, the gold price will soar to 20 million yuan in the short term! But on the other hand, the market is mainly driven by psychological factors. If the Central Bank can muster the courage to release about 20,000 bars, it will definitely be able to push the gold price down to the 4 million mark!

At the same time, I would like to introduce the views of a famous economist: the current rapid rise in the gold price is entirely caused by speculative psychology and is not a normal phenomenon. Therefore, when it encounters resistance, there will inevitably be a reaction. Based on past experience, this can be asserted. He has reliable evidence to prove that the government can still control the economic situation. He hopes that speculators, after making huge profits from this, can be slightly sober and avoid losing all their previous gains. On the other hand, if the government has a good way to prevent problems before they occur, it must implement it before the situation deteriorates, otherwise the majority of good people in society will suffer too much.

### Central Airlines' Hong Kong Route to Officially Resume Tomorrow

Central Airlines' international route has been decided to officially resume tomorrow. Tickets for the Shanghai-Hong Kong route have begun to be sold today, and the Chongqing-Hong Kong and Kunming-Hong Kong routes will also resume at the same time. As for China Airlines, it is reported that it will also be able to officially resume its routes in the near future.

### Regulations on Reporting Deadline for Land Requisitioned by the Enemy and Puppet Regimes

[Our Newspaper's Report] The measures for handling land requisitioned and encircled by the enemy and puppet regimes in Shanghai have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the Municipal Land Administration Bureau will soon announce and implement them, stipulating that the reporting period for owners will be from February 15th to April 14th. The Clearing Committee will send personnel to investigate and decide whether to purchase or return the land.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Committee was scheduled to meet at the Land Administration Bureau yesterday afternoon, but the meeting was adjourned due to the absence of representatives from the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office and postponed until next Tuesday.

### Robbery Case on Wuyi Road; Two Thieves Arrested and Confessed After One Interrogation; Injured Patrol Officer Still Has Not Recovered

[Our Newspaper's Report] On January 31st at around 8:00 PM, seven or eight thieves broke into the home of Yang Ruxin at No. 25 Wing On New Village, Wuyi Road, and robbed them of their property. After the victim reported the incident to the Changning Road Police Department, Branch Chief Wang Qingsun, upon receiving the report, personally led Deputy Branch Chief Shao, Section Chief Shi, officers Xu Xianzong and Xiao Chengzhang, and all the judicial police and volunteer police team leaders to lead more than ten officers to search and arrest the thieves in all directions. They arrested the suspects Zhang Cairen and Peng Maosheng at the side of Fushi Garden Lane at the intersection of that road. A handgun was found on Zhang, and they were taken to the bureau for interrogation.

According to Peng's confession, he is from Nantong and works as a driver. He lives at No. 4 Shuntai Lane, West Zhongzheng Road. In October of last year, he and his accomplices, including the fugitive Li Rong, robbed a certain store in Yangshupu, but he did not participate, only providing firearms. They robbed 2 million legal tender at that time, and he received 450,000 afterwards. On November 18th at 8:00 PM, they robbed a glass store named Duan Xinxiang at No. 63 Chengzhe Street, Jinling Road, and obtained 120,000 in cash, two coats, and two cheongsams. On the 28th of the same month, they went to No. 34 Yuyang Lane, Chongqing Middle Road, and robbed one otter coat, one suit coat, three watches, and one gold ring. He admitted without hesitation that he participated in both of the above incidents. According to Zhang Cairen's confession, he is 31 years old, from Nantong, and works as a coppersmith. He lives with Peng and denied the robbery of the Yang family on Wuyi Road, but the firearm was found in his pocket, and the maid of the victim's family, Chen Guiying, identified him at the bureau without error. He had no way to deny it, and then admitted it without hesitation. The branch bureau has applied to the relevant authorities for detention for ten days in order to continue to arrest the fugitive accomplices and has recovered a stolen gold ladies' watch, a sea tiger velvet coat, a rabbit wool coat, a blue serge lined shirt, and two women's lined cheongsams. Again, that night, when the police officers were dispatched, officer Xiao was the first to lead the police to the scene in a police car. While passing the entrance of the Huamei Friendship Association on Yuyuan Road, the police car was hit head-on by a public bus, causing damage to the front of the car and injuring Xiao's face. He was later sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and has not yet recovered. The case has now been compiled with complete confessions and will be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

### Introduction of an American Female Flying Instructor Who Recently Came to China; Colonel Dai Anguo and Others Are Her Star Pupils; Learning to Fly at Over Seventy Years Old, Comparable to Su Laoquan of Yore

[Our Newspaper's Report] In these times when plane crashes are frequently heard of, talking about learning to fly seems somewhat out of sync. However, we cannot abandon eating because of choking and retreat without progress. Here, we want to introduce to our readers Ms. Bosse, an American female flying instructor (see photo taken by this newspaper). She arrived in Shanghai from the United States last month to serve as the flying instructor for the Pinder Cub dealership, Taylor & Co. Mr. Taylor, the dealer, is currently petitioning the Chinese government to allow the import of civilian aircraft and the establishment of civilian flight training. Once approved, Mr. Taylor will set up a flying school in Shanghai, with Ms. Bosse as the instructor, using the "Pinder Cub" compact aircraft for training.

Ms. Bosse appears to be only thirty years old this year. However, she has taught more than seven hundred students in Washington, D.C., in the United States, one-third of whom are female. Several leading figures in the Chinese aviation industry, such as Colonel Dai Anguo, are her students.

Ms. Bosse graduated from Mills College in California in 1939 with a degree in Far Eastern History. However, she did not want to become a teacher after graduation. After leaving school, she might have gotten married, but after learning to fly for two months at a flight school, she decided to change her mind and become a flight instructor because she found flying extremely interesting.

Ms. Bosse initially taught civilian pilots. After the outbreak of the war, she switched to training air force pilots, which she did for three years. She herself has accumulated a total of 2,200 flight hours over the years. The longest flight was from Washington to Miami, about 1,200 miles.

When a reporter asked Ms. Bosse about her experience in learning to fly, she said, "Flying is actually much easier than driving a car because you don't have to control so many parts. When I first flew alone, I didn't feel nervous at all, as if I were sitting on a boat, and it was calm and peaceful."

Ten Hours of Learning Are Enough to Fly

As for the time required to learn to fly, it depends on each person's skills and intelligence. Generally, only about ten hours of training are needed to fly, and some can do it after eight hours. She herself obtained her instructor's license after flying for 200 hours. Speaking of age, Ms. Bosse said, "It doesn't matter." She had a student who started learning at the age of seventy-four and was no different from young people. When she was teaching, she even saw a seventy-two-year-old grandmother enroll in flight school!

The aircraft used for training is the "Pinder Cub," a lightweight, small aircraft that is easy to operate and has very little risk. It can take off and land on very small surfaces and can only seat two people. During training, the instructor sits in the front, and the student sits in the back. This single-engine small aircraft weighs 1,220 pounds, has 65 horsepower, can carry 12 gallons of gasoline, and can travel for two and a half hours.

The "Pinder Cub" first appeared in the United States in 1927 and is now popular throughout the United States. Before the war, more than 33% of civilian aircraft in the United States were of this type. During the war, this type of aircraft accounted for 65% of the total number of small aircraft used for training and flew specifically in airspace inaccessible to larger aircraft, such as over the forests of Burma and between the valleys of Muerzhou. This aircraft is worth about $3,500 in the United States.

As for the cost of flight instruction, in the United States, it is usually $10 per lesson and $8 per hour of flying. However, with the current unstable exchange rate in China, Mr. Taylor has not yet set a suitable teaching fee. Currently, Taylor & Co. has only one "Pinder Cub" parked at Longhua Airport. It was previously lent to China National Aviation Corporation to rescue injured children near Hankou. After approval by the Chinese government, the number of aircraft will be increased, and Ms. Bosse will also begin recruiting students.

### Thieves on the Beijing-Shanghai Line; Cash Transported from Agricultural Bank to Shanghai; Lost and Found on the Train

The Railway Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau cracked a major theft case on the 11th night express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line yesterday morning. The Director of the Police Department, Wang Zhaohuai, suddenly received information yesterday morning that thieves, posing as soldiers, were hiding on the train and stealing from passengers. Mr. Wang immediately ordered the Shanghai-Wuxi Police Section to investigate. After receiving the order, the section chief instructed his subordinates to carry out the investigation. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, a telegram was received from Suzhou Station stating that 70 million yuan in cash transported from the Changzhou Branch of the Agricultural Bank to Shanghai, including 14.5 million yuan, had been stolen on the 11th train. After receiving the telegram, the section chief immediately telegraphed all stations along the line, ordering them to closely monitor passengers disembarking from military trains and instructing the railway police on board to inspect the 11th train. At that time, the thieves, seeing the strict security measures, realized that although they had stolen the cash, they could not get it off the train and feared being caught by the authorities. Therefore, they escaped midway, abandoning the stolen goods under the seats in the dining car of the 11th train. When the 11th train arrived at the station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the railway police inspected the passengers and carriages and finally discovered the stolen goods. They immediately telegraphed the Changzhou Branch of the Agricultural Bank to retrieve the cash.

### Shipping Organizations Petition the City Government Regarding the Detention of Captains; Mayor Promises Legal Handling

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchant Ship Captains Association, the China Coastal Captains Association, and the China Marine Engineers Association, regarding the collision between the Zhijiang and Huaxuan ships, the subsequent detention of the two ship captains by the Water Police, their transfer to the District Court for investigation, and the denial of bail, have expressed their protest for days. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than 130 members of the associations, including Shi Xuyu, Jiang Liangfu, Shi Junpei, Zhang Shusheng, Huang Muzong, Jin Yueshi, and Lu Liangbing, petitioned the City Government, stating that the Executive Yuan had clear regulations regarding the division of powers between the Port Police and the Water Police, stipulating that all maritime collision cases should be handled by the Port Police. However, the Water Police exceeded their authority by detaining the captains. They requested the Mayor to guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future to uphold human rights. Mayor Wu met with all the petitioners in the City Hall auditorium, expressed sympathy for the sailors, and promised to submit the request to the Port Affairs Consolidation Committee meeting at 10:00 AM this morning for legal handling. He also hoped that if there were any problems in the future, representatives could be sent to the City Government to discuss them, rather than gathering large numbers of people to petition, wasting time, and refraining from blowing whistles. The members left at 11:30 AM.

### The Murder Case on Longmen Road; The Perpetrator Sentenced to Five Years

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Ronggen, the perpetrator of the broad daylight murder case on Longmen Road on October 20 last year, was tried by the District Court yesterday. Zhang confessed that five years ago, his wife, Li Jushi, had committed adultery with Li Chunshan in their hometown of Zhenhai. At that time, Zhenhai had fallen to the Japanese army, and Li Chunshan held a position in the puppet army. Fearing his power, he harbored resentment but dared not settle the score. After the victory, Li secretly fled to Shanghai with his wife, so he tracked them down, secretly plotting revenge. He searched for several months, earning a living as a shoeshine man, always hiding a sharp blade in his shoeshine box. On that day at noon, he happened to encounter Li Chunshan on Longmen Road, so he immediately drew his knife and killed him. Now that his enemy is dead, he is willing to accept legal punishment. The court ruled that Zhang Ronggen had confessed to the crime of murder and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment, with three years of deprivation of civil rights. Li Zhou's part in committing adultery was dismissed due to amnesty.

### Counterfeiting Central Bank Notes; Shanghai Destroys Organization; Distributing and Selling Throughout the Country; Amounting to Tens of Millions of Yuan; Printing Organizations Set Up in Haining and Hangzhou; Nine Chronic Offenders Arrested in One Fell Swoop

Recently, numerous counterfeit 2,000-yuan notes of the Central Bank have been discovered in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the Northeast, Tianjin, and other places. The Investigation Team and the Social Investigation Team of the Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai have completely cracked the case, and the nine main offenders involved in printing and selling counterfeit money have been arrested in one fell swoop. Regarding the investigation process, the Garrison Headquarters recently received a tip that Wang Zuxuan, Wang Zuf, Yu Zhenhua, Chen Aqi, Chen Zhouxin, and others from Haining are chronic offenders involved in manufacturing counterfeit money. During the enemy and puppet regime, these individuals had set up a counterfeit money printing organization in Zhujiaqiao Town, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, counterfeiting 5,000-yuan denomination Central Reserve Certificates and circulating them in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. After the victory, Wang Zuxuan secretly came to Shanghai, rented a room on the second floor of the American West Copper Bed Factory at 640 Zhongzheng East Road, and joined forces with former accomplices to print counterfeit 2,000-yuan notes of the Central Bank, 34th edition. They usually acted secretly, initially distributing and selling them in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Later, due to strict security measures after the discovery of counterfeit money in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, they changed their tactics and used them in Tianjin and other places. It was recently learned that these individuals transported several tens of millions of yuan of counterfeit money from Haining to Shanghai, disguising 50 million yuan as ten large boxes of cigarettes and secretly transporting them to Tianjin. The total amount of counterfeit money they transported to northern Jiangsu, Chongming, and other places in the fall and winter of last year reached several tens of millions of yuan. In addition to setting up a counterfeit money printing organization in Haining, which was managed by Yu Zhenhua, they also set up a printing organization in Hangzhou, which was managed by Wang Zuxuan.

Full Mobilization to Start Investigation

After receiving the report, the Garrison Headquarters fully mobilized and started the investigation on February 4. They first established a liaison point with an informant in Room 530 of the Shenzhou Hotel. Later, they learned that Chen Zhouxin lived in Room 119 of the Luming Hotel, so they disguised themselves and contacted him to purchase counterfeit money in order to learn about the source of the counterfeit money. After several trips, Chen finally agreed to sell 1 million yuan of counterfeit money, but said that he had to wait for a response from his friend in Pudong before he could set a date for delivery. At this point, another part of the investigation team set up Room 45 of the Luming Hotel to observe Chen Zhouxin's movements. Another part was stationed near 640 Zhongzheng East Road to detect the whereabouts of the main offender, Wang Zuxuan.

Extremely Alert and Cunning

On the 6th, it was learned that Yu Zhenhua, the main offender in printing counterfeit money in Haining, was staying at the Jinshan Hotel on Sanma Road. However, when checking at the hotel, there was no guest with the surname Yu. At around 6:00 PM, they met with Chen Zhouxin again. Chen agreed that the delivery could be made at 12:00 AM on the 7th, but it still depended on the phone call from Pudong. The next morning, the personnel following Chen Zhouxin were closely monitoring him, not daring to relax. However, Chen was extremely alert and cunning, constantly looking around while walking. Fearing that he would notice, the investigators fell behind slightly and lost track of Chen.

On the afternoon of the same day, at about 3:00 PM, the person in contact reported that Chen Zhouxin said that since there was no phone call from Pudong, the delivery had to be postponed. At the same time, the personnel waiting at 640 Zhongzheng East Road saw Wang Zuxuan enter the building at about 11:00 AM and closely monitored his movements.

Sufficient Evidence, Waiting for Opportunity to Arrest

On the afternoon of the 9th, at about 2:00 PM, a response was received from Chen Zhouxin, setting the delivery time at 12:00 AM on the same night in Room 35 of the Luming Hotel. At that time, 500,000 yuan of legal tender was used to purchase 1 million yuan of counterfeit money. At this point, there was sufficient evidence. However, since the whereabouts of Yu Zhenhua, the main offender in Haining, and others were still unknown, fearing that they would alert the suspects, they did not immediately arrest them. On the afternoon of the same day, at 8:00 PM, the investigators discovered that Yu Zhenhua was watching a play at the Star Theater with a woman. They waited at the entrance, and when the play ended at midnight, they followed him and finally found out that the suspect was hiding in the Pacific Hotel at the intersection of Seymour Road and Xinzha Road. They continued to send personnel to monitor his movements.

Everything Is Ready, All Arrested

On the same night, it was discovered that Chen Aqi, another main offender in the case, had returned to Shanghai from Haining and was staying in Room 319 of the Great Shanghai Hotel. At this point, the addresses of all the suspects had been separately detected. Captain Feng, believing that the timing was ripe, reported to Director Tao and ordered personnel from each group to start from 12:00 PM on the 9th to 3:00 AM on the 10th. In the end, Yu Zhenhua was arrested in Room 25 of the Pacific Hotel, Chen Zhouxin was arrested in Room 35 of the Luming Hotel, and the main offender Wang Zuxuan, his younger brother Wang Zufu, and suspects Wang Rongxing and Xu Xiaobao were arrested in Wang Zuxuan's home on the second floor of 640 Zhongzheng East Road. Chen Aqi, Yu Xingying (female), and Zhang Erlu were arrested in Rooms 318 and 319 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, and 400,000 yuan of unsold counterfeit money was found on Yu's person. At this point, all nine suspects had been arrested in one fell swoop.

Main Offenders Confess Everything

After interrogation, the main offender Wang Zuxuan confessed that in 1945, he had purchased two printing presses from Shanghai in Qilimiao, Haining, and partnered with Chen Aqi and others to print counterfeit Central Reserve Certificates. The total number printed was 320 million yuan. After the goods were released, they purchased cotton and salt in Yuyao, Zhejiang, and then stopped printing, selling the two printing presses in Shanghai. After the victory, he purchased two more printing presses in Shanghai and partnered with Yu Zhenhua and others to set up printing organizations, one in Hangzhou, which he was responsible for managing, and one in Haining, which Yu Zhenhua was in charge of. They started working in May and stopped in June of the same year after the Shaoxing County government discovered them, fearing that they would be caught. They destroyed the printing presses and instructed the Haining side to throw the printing parts into the river to destroy the evidence.

Yu Zhenhua also confessed, stating that it was generally the same as what Wang Zuxuan had confessed. According to the confession, the number of counterfeit 2,000-yuan notes of the Central Bank that had been printed reached several tens of millions of yuan. Later, after receiving news from Hangzhou, in order to avoid being caught, they threw the printing parts into the river, and so on.

### The Grain Loan Case Is Tried Again; Whether It Complies with the Amnesty Ordinance; Can Be Decided in Court Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The eight defendants in the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case, the District Court is scheduled to reconvene at 9:00 AM this morning. All sectors attach great importance to this hearing. Because the prosecutor has prosecuted all the defendants in accordance with the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Extraordinary Period, if the presiding judge does not intend to change the legal provisions, then this case meets the amnesty provisions of item A of the Amnesty Decree, and the defendants in custody, such as Wang Daren, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wu Rongsheng, will definitely be allowed to be released on bail. However, judicial circles generally believe that in this case, the presiding judge may change the legal provisions of the prosecution and sentence them according to the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, in which case they cannot be pardoned, and the application for bail by the defendants in custody will also be rejected. Therefore, the fate of the defendants need not be waited for the final verdict, and it can be decided in court today.

### Intelligence Agent Betrays and Joins the Puppet Regime; Claims He Was Ordered to Do So; Liu Haishan Testifies Similarly

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Yongkang's case of being suspected of being a traitor was heard in the High Court yesterday. The defendant was originally an intelligence agent of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Hanzhai District. In 1940, he defected and joined the Hankou District of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters. Because he betrayed his comrades, his face was stabbed and scarred. In 1941, he was transferred to work in the Puppet South China District. In May 1944, he was reassigned as a detective in the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Special High Section, investigating the internal situation of social organizations and secretly reporting to the enemy and puppet regime. Yesterday, the High Court summoned witness Liu Haishan to testify. Liu said, "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I served in the Special Operations Headquarters in Hong Kong and had contact with Liao Gongshao, the district chief of the Puppet South China District. At that time, the defendant was an intelligence agent under Liao's command, so he also had contact with us. Later, Liao fled back to Chongqing.

We also authorized him to come to Shanghai to join the Puppet Police Bureau and provided us with information about the enemy and puppet regime." Then, Chen Yongkang was questioned. The defendant confessed: "I was engaged in underground work. Joining the Puppet Police Bureau was under orders. I am really wronged in this lawsuit. Please summon Rao Shu, the deputy district chief of the Puppet Hankou District who is in custody, and summon Liao Gongshao to testify." The court argued that the case still needs to be investigated and rescheduled for further questioning.

After the victory, the enemy and puppet property handling bureau reported the case and sent it to the High Court for legal action.

### The Flower Bed Hides Opium Case; Deputy Director of the Garrison Headquarters; Describes the Process in Court; Pei Yuanjun Is Suspected of Drug Trafficking

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of hiding 1,058 catties of opium in the flower bed at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road, was tried by the District Court on the 4th of this month. Zheng Zhongwei, the deputy director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, who first received the tip, was summoned yesterday. Zheng, wearing a black cloak and military uniform, stated in court: "I also serve as the leader of the investigation and security team of the Port Affairs Committee. Because the supervisor of the committee reported that passengers on North Ocean passenger ships often carried drugs to Shanghai, I ordered my subordinates to pay close attention. I then received a tip that a passenger named Pei Yuanjun on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship repeatedly transported opium and hid it in the 'secret passage' of the house at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road, and then sold it continuously. The 'secret passage' is in the flower bed. After going to search, I found that the original tip was not entirely true. Although a large amount of hidden opium was unearthed in the flower bed, there was no 'secret passage'. During the search, Pei Yuanjun's wife frankly admitted that she had previously asked Gui Baoxian of the French Concession Police to see the items in the flower bed, who said that the opium had long been waste, and said that Pei Yuanjun was indeed suspected of drug trafficking." When asked about the original informant, Zheng replied that it was impossible to find him because the report was forwarded by the supervisor of the Port Committee. At this point, the interrogation was adjourned.

Yesterday, raw gold still followed its consistent style, seeing new prices again. Opening in the morning at 6.75 million to 6.85 million, it immediately saw competitive buying, surpassing 7 million and opening at a high price, approaching 8 million, before slightly falling back to hover around 7.4 million. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 80 bars to silver shops, initially saying 6.6 million, then suddenly correcting to 7.3 million. As a result, the buying trend became stronger again, immediately surpassing the 8 million mark. After many parties settled, it retreated to around 7.8 million. After a period of hovering, it reached the 8.5 million mark again near noon, trading between 8.2 million and 8.3 million at noon. In the afternoon, the next-day settlement was initially stable, then buyers started to stir together, immediately creating a spectacle, reaching a new high of 9.6 million. Only then did the supply appear, and many parties settled. After rising high, there was concern, and rumors of suppression measures and high officials arriving in Shanghai were rampant, and it once fell back to the 8 million mark. Finally, it remained stable, with a sharp increase of 1.75 million compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was 75,000, with a limited supply and intermittent disruptions, and the dark interest rate was only 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currency demand was low and supply was also low yesterday, still prospering with the gold price. The U.S. dollar dark market opened in the morning at 14,000 and 15,000, and the price rose to over 17,000 yuan at noon. It continued to rise slightly in the afternoon and ended at a high price, with a sharp increase of 4,500 compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also exceptionally popular, rising all the way from 2,900 in the early morning to a new peak of 3,700 at the end, with a further increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to around 3,100 yuan, with limited transactions. Indian exchange rates were 3,800 yuan, and British exchange rates were 49,800 yuan, both lacking trading.

### Shopping Mall Tour: Prices Increase Threefold to Three Times Compared to Before the New Year

[Our Dispatch] After the lunar New Year, the price of gold and U.S. dollars have been rising steadily, and daily necessities have also been rising rapidly. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited various department stores and saw that the prices of goods had increased by about 30% to three times compared to before the lunar New Year, with canned goods and Western medicine rising the most. A can of Del Monte coffee, which originally sold for 3,500 yuan, has risen to 18,500 yuan; a can of Del Monte peaches, which originally sold for 3,500 yuan, has risen to 12,500 yuan. Among Western medicines, hormones have risen twofold, and vitamins have risen onefold. Moreover, some Western medicines are "out of stock"; Squibb vitamin pills, which were abundant on the market not long ago, are said to be "out of stock" in all pharmacies. Cotton fabrics have risen 20% to 50%, and stockings have risen 50% to 100%. Comfy men's socks, which previously sold for 7,500 yuan, are now selling for 12,500 yuan. Daily cosmetics and toothpaste have risen by more than 100%, with Listerine toothpaste rising from 3,500 yuan to 9,000 yuan; Pond's Cold Cream rising from 6,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Fountain pens have risen 50%, and a Parker 51 gold set is now selling for 250,000 yuan.

The surge in prices has hit hard, but there is one major difference compared to before the war: the people rushing to buy goods at various companies are not as crowded. This shows the weakness of social purchasing power.

### Despite Rising Black Market Prices for Japonica and Indica Rice, the Price of Siamese Rice Will Not Change; The City Has Sufficient Rice Reserves, and There Will Be No Problem with People's Food

[Our Dispatch] Ji Mingzhao, the head of the Food Section of the Social Bureau, yesterday declined to comment on the rice issue, only saying that everything was in accordance with the mayor's instructions. Another official of the bureau told reporters that the negotiated price of 76,000 yuan for Japonica rice will not be adjusted in the near future. Because the price at the place of origin is higher than the negotiated price in this city, the amount of rice arriving is very small. The city's reserves of foreign rice are sufficient, and there will be no problem with the people's food. Despite rising black market prices for Japonica rice, the rice sold by the government will still maintain a price of 63,000 yuan per stone. The government must be responsible for the people's food problem, but there is no obligation to supply Japonica rice. According to estimates of the city's needs, 20,000 bags per day are sufficient. However, recently the Social Bureau has been selling 50,000 to 60,000 bags of Siamese rice every day, which is suspected of being hoarded, so currently not only are there few goods coming from other places to the city, but there may also be a situation of quietly flowing to other places.

Yesterday, the rice market continued to rise wildly, causing panic. Merchants wantonly raised prices, and the asking prices were without standards. Transactions were secretive, and it can be called a black market. The prices of various goods continued to rise by more than 20,000 yuan. High-quality Japonica rice has reached the 140,000 yuan mark, which is almost double the closing price last year. Yesterday, the market trading of Japonica and Indica rice was still suspended. The price of rice from Yunnan Province also rose wildly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The Social Bureau sold Saigon rice, 28,000 bags in the Nanshi Market and 30,060 bags in the Beishi Market, totaling more than 58,000 bags. The price of rice in the Xujiahui suburbs has also been raised to 150,000 to 160,000 yuan.

Flour

With holders refusing to lower prices, the supply has almost disappeared. Retail stores cannot buy the flour they want, and the market presents a situation of holding prices. Only a small amount of trading occurred in the early market. The price of "Warship" brand flour surpassed 50,000 yuan, reaching 51,000 yuan. The price of Entel foreign flour (100 pounds) reached 90,000 yuan, rising sharply by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The prices of other brands of flour all followed the trend. At the noon closing, Lilang foreign flour (70 pounds) was at 75,000 yuan, but buyers only offered 70,000 yuan, so no deal was reached. Bran fluctuated greatly, with enthusiastic speculation. The morning opening price for large bags of bran once surged to 40,000 yuan, reaching a high of 41,000 yuan. However, by noon, the number of sellers suddenly increased, and the market atmosphere suddenly turned downward. The closing price fell to 36,000 yuan, but it was still 1,000 yuan higher than the previous market. Small bags opened at 28,000 yuan and closed at 26,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 4,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce on the market, with asking prices above 70,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

The rising trend intensified. Because manufacturers and merchants were hoarding goods, and buyers were willing to pay high prices, speculators took advantage of this activity, and the market situation soared. However, very little trading occurred. Asking prices varied. Raw oil in baskets closed at 290,000 yuan at noon. Raw oil in Jilin barrels was last quoted as high as 320,000 yuan. Factory-made soybean oil and peanut oil all soared by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. There were no reports of transactions for other clear vegetable oils. The morning opening price for soybeans continued to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, by noon, the supply of Northern beans suddenly increased, and there were also goods from the road being sold, so the market turned slightly flat. Selected green beans rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame also rose by 20,000 yuan. Mung beans were also popular, and corn also rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans advanced by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw kernels were scarce, rising sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but the later market turned flat. Only bean cakes fell back, because customers stopped buying due to high prices. Smallholders sold to make profits, and the price fell back by 3,000 yuan.

### Pigments and Dyes Have Different Properties; Pigment and Sundries Company Details the Process

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Native Pigment and Sundries Trade Association yesterday specially hosted the city's news media to report the true differences between pigments, dyes, and the two associations. According to the distinction table listed by the association: the association was founded after the Taiping Rebellion. The guild was established in the sixth year of the Republic of China, and it was renamed the association in the sixteenth year. Members operate pigments and sundries, and the English name is Pigment. The commodities are vermilion, silver vermilion, cinnabar, red lead, white lead powder, gold powder, silver powder, litharge, titanium powder, etc. More than 20 types, and other inorganic pigments, etc. The sources are domestic, Eastern, Western, and Southeast Asian regions. The properties are insoluble in water and have covering power. The commodity is used to manufacture inks, paints, inkstones, rubber, and as medicines, drawings, and various items required in related industries. At present, there is another Pigment Trade Association, which was established in the 19th year of the Republic of China. Members operate dyes, and the English name is Dyestuff. The commodities are vulcanized black, black electric powder, indanthrene, sea blue, rapider, indigosol, and other medium dyes of various colors. The sources are domestic, Eastern, and Western regions. The properties are soluble in water and have penetrating power. The commodity is used exclusively for dyeing yarn, cloth, silk, satin, wool, leather, paper, etc. Therefore, from many aspects of research and analysis, pigments and dyes are clearly separated and cannot be merged. Moreover, the Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also successively convened the two industries to advise the dye industry to correct the association's name on file. Therefore, the details of the process are reported one by one so that all sectors can understand the truth.

### Raw Material Reserves Not Abundant; Oil Allocation Also Has Problems

[Our Dispatch] In the past two weeks, private factories in the city have shouldered the responsibility of allocating more than 6,000 dan of edible oil, supplying the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation for retail stores throughout the city to sell at negotiated prices. However, recently, as food prices continue to soar, the raw materials for oil extraction, such as soybeans and sesame seeds, have also risen. The recently negotiated price for soybean oil is 180,000 yuan per dan, and the negotiated price for sesame oil is 165,000 yuan per dan. At the time of the decision, soybeans were only 39,000 yuan per dan, and sesame seeds were 60,000 yuan per dan. Each oil extraction factory has reduced production due to insufficient raw material reserves. Therefore, it is still questionable whether the private factories can continue to maintain oil allocation this week. A spokesperson for the Oil Extraction Industry Association told reporters: At the time of the meeting convened by Mayor Wu, each factory had agreed to exchange bean cakes with the China Trust Bureau for soybeans, but due to lengthy procedures, and the fact that the China Trust Bureau still had to sell soybeans abroad and supply the market, the exchange did not come to fruition. He said: At present, the main difficulty of the oil extraction industry is that oil production must be supplied and sold at negotiated prices, but raw materials cannot be obtained at negotiated cost. For now, if the authorities cannot provide raw materials at negotiated costs, it is better to abolish the negotiated price system and restore free trade. As a result, raw materials and edible oil from other places may be able to be transported to Shanghai for sale. He also said: Judging from the recent situation, the black market price often exceeds the newly negotiated price. As a result, the negotiated price actually hinders the normal production of each factory. According to reports, if oil is produced at the current production cost, the price of soybean oil should be above 300,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Quiet

Yesterday the tea market was quieter, with holders asking high prices and few formal transactions. According to industry insiders, the government's purchase of tea leaves was agreed upon with tea merchants last year, but currently tea merchants are requesting the authorities to increase prices by 200,000 yuan per dan, so the purchase has been delayed again. It is possible that the price will be increased appropriately, and details will be obtained within a few days.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was still chaotic. Shantou blue sugar was 175,000 yuan, Huanggang blue sugar was 170,000 yuan, Shunde blue sugar was 168,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, Zhichi sugar was 195,000 yuan to 190,000 yuan, with more than 400 bags traded. Xinghua white sugar was 280,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, Gaozhuang Xingchi was 212,000 yuan. Other white sugars were all above 300,000 yuan, followed by 270,000 to 280,000 yuan. Qingdiao was 171,000 yuan within the industry.

### Coal Market Situation Chaotic

The coal market had strong buying interest, and the rising trend intensified. Many goods, such as Hongji lump coal, have become unavailable on the market. Kailuan train lump coal has exceeded the 1 million yuan mark, and Kailuan No. 1 coal has also reached 910,000 to 920,000 yuan. Firewood charcoal is also affected by the sharp rise in coal prices. Firewood charcoal merchants have closed their stocks and say they have no goods. Large coal ball factories have raised the factory price to 500,000 yuan, but there is still a shortage of goods. Only old customers are slightly entertained with one or two tons.

### Woolen Cloth Transactions Flourish, Prices Rise

The retail and wholesale prices of woolen cloth rose again yesterday, because merchants from Sichuan, Hunan, Xuzhou, Anqing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou all came to Shanghai to purchase. At the same time, the business of dress shops and Western-style clothing tailors on the street is not weak. Rumors of profitable buying are widespread in the market, and spring and summer goods are being hoarded and raised in price. Except for Melton women's woolen cloth, most of the goods are showing a situation of clearly rising prices and secretly rising prices. Moreover, the more the price rises, the scarcer the spot goods become, and the dragging in of goods is also faster. Yesterday, the city traded more than 20,000 yards in total. The transaction price of Yuanfeng Youzi woven cloth was 87,500 yuan, the transaction price of Xiexin Western-style woolen cloth was 110,000 yuan, the transaction price of Zhanghua Australian wool flannel was 97,500 yuan, the transaction price of American Melton was 49,000 yuan, and the transaction price of China Textile Western-style flannel was 120,000 yuan.

### Silk Prices Too High, No Actual Transactions

Yesterday, the silk market situation was even more chaotic, but due to the asking prices being too high, there were very few transactions. 120-count rayon, Gaoshan shiny, was asking for 7 million yuan, but no one cared, so the market was virtually suspended. Factory-direct C-grade yarn was asking for 7.5 million yuan in the morning and another 500,000 yuan in the afternoon. Dried-spun yarn for retail was asking for 6 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Silk goods all followed the raw materials and increased in price. Mei Ya quilt covers were 4.6 million yuan, Shanghai Silk Factory goods were 4.5 million yuan, Dacheng Gefeng crepe was 19,500 yuan, and Hua Zhong crepe was listed at 6,000 yuan. The prices of Sheng Hang goods were also high, and everyone was optimistic, but buyers were deterred by the high prices, so there were no transactions.

### To Avoid Concentration of Idle Funds, Central Bank Limits Shanghai Remittances

Recently, the prices of gold and banknotes in Shanghai have risen wildly, and prices in various places have risen accordingly. Merchants from Chongqing, Wuhan, Tianjin, and other places have transferred funds to Shanghai to snap up goods and gold, and the black market exchange rate is shocking. Chongqing remittance fees have reached one-tenth. It is learned that the Central Bank, in order to avoid the concentration of idle funds, is still strictly limiting remittances. Except for national banks and bureaus that have other methods of transferring funds, the remittance quotas for commercial banks and stores in various places are stipulated as follows: For Hangzhou and Nanjing, the weekly remittance amount is 50 million yuan. For Chongqing, Xi'an, Hankou, Chengdu, Zhangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Kunming, and other ten places, the weekly amount is 40 million yuan. For other places, the weekly amount is 30 million yuan. However, the Central Bank considers Chongqing to be an important town in the southwest, and in order to take into account the needs of the situation, it plans to increase the quotas for various banks and bureaus. All legitimate merchants who need to transfer funds to Shanghai, national banks and bureaus can transfer funds accordingly. The decision on whether to adjust the remittance fee is still being requested.

### China Bank Establishes Branches

The Shanghai China Bank was founded by Sun Yat-sen in the first year of the Republic of China. Now, the bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to establish the Linsen Middle Road Branch in this city and the Suzhou Branch. The Linsen Middle Road Branch is scheduled to open on the 12th of this month, and the Suzhou Branch is scheduled to open on the 17th of this month.

No. 36 offered some supply and fell back to an additional 70 yuan to close. Nos. 74, 89, and 151 advanced, and the premium increased to 130 yuan. Sino-Foreign also added 25 yuan, King Fook Qin Yu added 20 yuan, Mei Ya added 50 yuan, and the whole market was red, reaching 100%. After that, supply and sales turned more, and things got worse. Except for China Flour hitting the limit up, all other stocks saw lows. Diyi Yong Yarn also gradually fell to a low price of 1420 yuan. After the gold market fell, it stabilized. Nos. 97, 218, 117, and 14 advanced. Near the close, it announced a limit up again. After the close, it slightly rebounded.

### Speculative Atmosphere Envelops the Market, Cotton Yarn Rises Wildly Again, Cotton and Cotton Cloth Follow and Rise

Yesterday, the rise in the yarn market became increasingly uncontrollable. In the early morning, amidst the wild jump in gold prices, yarn prices also rose sharply in a straight line. 20-count yarn soared by 1 million, and 42-count and 40-count also followed with a huge increase of 1.7 million. The madness of the rising trend was astonishing. Transactions with foreign buyers were extremely quiet, because the domestic yarn prices could not keep up with those in Shanghai, creating a backward situation. The market was completely shrouded in a speculative atmosphere.

Due to the increased opening price of Fangjian, 12-pound Wufu fine cloth was supplied and sold at 162,000 yuan per piece, resulting in firm confidence. Shilin cloth outside the market soared by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, fine cloth followed up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and white Fu silk also rose by 40,000 yuan.

The allocation method was as follows: For Wufu fine cloth, each manufacturer got 40 pieces, and numbers 993 to 1378 each got 40 pieces.

### Principal Beats Teacher, Chen Suyun Held a Reception for the Press Yesterday, Reporting the Truth of the Incident

[Our Newspaper] After the fire that burned the National Elementary School on Shaanxi North Road in this city, an incident suddenly occurred in which Principal Pan Wenzhen of the school beat teacher Chen Suyun. At 3 pm yesterday, the beaten teacher Chen Suyun held a reception for the press at the Meilongzhen Restaurant, reporting the truth of the incident. In addition to Chen Suyun herself, more than a dozen teachers and staff from the school attended. In addition, many teachers and staff from other schools who heard the news came to participate.

According to Chen's report: She is from Linhai, Zhejiang, is 48 years old this year, and has served as the principal of Shangyi Elementary School in the county and Yinshan Elementary School in Haimen. Pan Wenzhen, the current principal of the National Elementary School on Shaanxi North Road, was a student of Shangyi Elementary School in the past. He had a bad character since childhood and repeatedly failed to change. All the teachers and staff firmly wanted to expel him from school. At that time, Chen was the principal. Considering that a girl would lose face if expelled, and for the sake of her future, she secretly ordered her to withdraw from school automatically. Unexpectedly, things have come to this day, and she has been insulted by her.

Public Property Has Been Moved Out, Falsely Reported as Lost

Chen continued: The cause of the beating incident was purely due to the fire on Shaanxi North Road. Because Chen was personally on the scene on the night of the school fire, she witnessed Pan Wenzhen moving public funds and important objects out with the help of five school servants. Afterwards, Pan falsely reported that they were all burned and created loss figures, requesting compensation from the Education Bureau. Chen, moved by righteous indignation, revealed his conspiracy, and was dismissed without cause and slapped by Pan. At that time, his younger brother Pan Tianmin and son Feifei also joined in the siege and beat Chen to the ground, and then punched and kicked him, causing his left eye to swell and his body to be covered with bruises. This can be testified by teachers He Fanfang, Yan Kuiru, Xu Shixue, Chen Fengqian, and Ge Shibiao of the school.

Base Behavior Was Revealed, Old Shame Turned to Violence

After Chen finished speaking, the teachers and staff who attended stood up and spoke one after another, generally reporting Pan Wenzhen's usual bad deeds. The speech of Wu Baoqin, the school's physical education director, was more specific. Wu said: The reason for Chen Suyun's dismissal is said to be poor teaching, insufficient ability, stirring up discord, and slandering the principal, but in fact, it is all slandered by Pan Wenzhen. Because when Chen Suyun first came to the school to work, Pan Wenzhen publicly introduced him, saying: "Mr. Chen is the principal of my elementary school days. He has good knowledge and rich experience. It is the school's luck to be able to come here to serve as the research director." It can be seen that there was no estrangement between Chen and Pan at that time. The reason why conflicts occurred later was because Chen concentrated on teaching and was always full of a sense of justice. He repeatedly advised Pan Wenzhen on the issue of randomly collecting fees. However, Pan Wenzhen turned a deaf ear to good advice and regarded Chen as a thorn in his side. After this fire, Chen revealed his base behavior, which led to old shame turning into anger and violence, injuring him.

Relatives and Friends of All School Teachers and Staff Account for the Majority

Wu also said: There are more than 30 teachers and staff in the school, and Pan Wenzhen's relatives and friends account for the majority of them. He usually monopolizes power, and the school's finances are never made public. He is also harsh to people. Teachers living in the school cannot even get water to wash their feet, and school servants are forbidden to wash their clothes for them, claiming that the school servants are hired by him privately. In fact, Wu personally saw the names of the school servants listed in the school's list of teachers and staff, and the Education Bureau is reported to pay their salaries every month. What is even more strange is that the salary reported to the bureau for the school servants is 110,000 yuan, but only 50,000 yuan is issued. Also, Pan Wenzhen graduated from dance school after only finishing the first grade of junior high school, and his private life is unrestrained and unruly, and he is not qualified to be the principal at all.

Three Requirements Raised in the Midst of Great Public Outrage

At this point, the emotions in the venue were high, and everyone believed that this incident was a disgrace to the entire education community and even the entire cultural community. Pan Wenzhen not only beat Chen Suyun, but also beat all the teachers. Now, corporal punishment of students by teachers is illegal. How can a dignified principal beat a teacher? In order to protect the safety of teachers in the future, it was unanimously passed to establish a joint association to protect teachers' rights and swear to be their backing. Finally, it was decided to petition the Municipal Education Bureau and put forward the following three requirements: (1) Demand that the education authorities express a solemn position and immediately replace Pan Wenzhen. (2) Demand that the education authorities order Pan Wenzhen to publish an apology to Ms. Chen Suyun in the newspaper. (3) Demand that the education authorities guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future.

### Our Ambassador to Siam, Li Tiecheng, Advocates Establishing a Teachers School in Siam, The Ministry of Education Expresses Agreement and Will Give Discretionary Subsidies

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Li Tiecheng, our ambassador to Siam, believes that the education of overseas Chinese in Siam needs to be developed urgently, and there is a great lack of teachers in general elementary schools. Recently, he plans to establish a normal school in Siam to cultivate healthy teachers, but the start-up costs and operating expenses are quite large. The overseas Chinese are unable to bear all the costs, and he has specially asked the Ministry of Education to provide subsidies. It is now learned that the Ministry of Education has agreed to this facility and sent a letter to Ambassador Li asking him to instruct the overseas Chinese organizations preparing to run the school to send the school establishment plan and the budget for start-up costs and operating expenses to the Ministry for review and give discretionary subsidies. After the establishment of this school in the future, it will solve the teacher shortage problem of overseas Chinese schools in Siam and various places in Indochina.

### New Map of the World Geography Society Insults Hubei People, Arousing Public Outrage, Agreed to Destroy the Original Plate and Publish an Apology in the Newspaper, The World Bookstore Is Affected and Demands Compensation for Losses

The new "Pocket-Sized Provincial Map of China" published by the World Geography Society in this city contains many insults to the people of Hubei Province. The Hubei Provincial Council and the Hankou Municipal Council expressed their indignation and jointly initiated the organization of the "Hubei Province Anti-Insult Movement Committee" to seriously investigate responsibility. Because the copyright page of the map is printed with the words "Distributed by World Bookstores in Various Ports," it also involves the World Bookstore, and dissatisfaction is expressed towards the World Bookstore. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Li Bojia, the director of the Booksellers Association of this city. According to his talk: He is from Chun County, Hubei, and believes that the World Geography Society's insult to Hubei people is inappropriate, but he stated that the World Bookstore and the World Geography Society are two organizations. The reporter also visited Zhang Yiqu, the executive director of the association, who said that the World Bookstore is a joint-stock company, and the World Geography Society is a commercial firm. In fact, they are not one family. This time, the World Geography Society printed the name of the World Bookstore for distribution on its publications, which was found to be an unauthorized use. The World Bookstore has lodged a stern protest with the society. The society, knowing that it was in the wrong, has already published an apology to the World Bookstore in the newspaper. The World Bookstore and the Hubei Association in Shanghai went to the society to investigate and ordered that all the printed and unissued maps be sealed up, and the issued maps be recalled immediately and destroyed together with the original plate. The society has now fully expressed its agreement and will publish an apology to the compatriots in Hubei Province in the newspaper. A case has fortunately come to an end. It is heard that the World Bookstore demanded considerable compensation from the society for the losses suffered after this incident, which happened to coincide with the spring sales, greatly affecting business in Hubei Province. The aftermath of the incident does not seem to be settled.

In the second quarter, Liang Miaoling of the Li team even scored two goals in a row, and Weng Xiayun added the finishing touch, and then took the lead 8 to 6.

The Indian team relied entirely on Stockpa Balin, and the scoreboard was only decorated. As a result, Railway Hu led 21 to 9 in the first half. After changing baskets, the Indian team did not improve. Zhang Zhenyli and Zhang Qu of Railway Hu continuously threw and scored six times in a row, and Zhu Jie even helped the evildoer, 31 to 11. The Indian team was at a loss. They made a major troop adjustment and adopted a long-range attack strategy, but they gained nothing, and the military's morale was also dissipated. Until the last four minutes, the generals of the Railway had the certainty of victory, so they defended more and attacked less, giving the foreign soldiers the opportunity to scurry. McCook. Rogerski scored a lot, but the result was still 23 to 33, losing to Railway Hu.

American Troops Fiercely Attack and Defeat Chunmao

General Fulak built another merit under the basket. Fu Shan scored one free throw and one throw, taking the lead 6 to 4.

Li Xianzheng and Pi Fusi both committed offenses and both scored. Bolo Har built his merit under the basket. Chunmao gradually fell behind 15 to 9.

The first half ended, and Chunmao was behind 15 to 21.

Disorganized Lineup, Chunmao Defeated

Bolo Har scored in the middle, and Li Xianzheng returned the color. Bolo Har entered under the basket again, and Paty Qiong scored again, 28 to 17. The American troops were at their peak.

Britman slapped the ball and gave it away, adding two points. The scores of Hailuqing soared. Zheng Jiabiao and Liu Fushan of Chunmao kept chasing closely, 40 to 25.

### Huaguang Accused of Forfeiture; Protests to the Football Committee

The Huaguang Sports Association, regarding the matter of being accused of forfeiting the junior cup, yesterday specially submitted a protest to the Football Committee. The original text is as follows:

Regarding the matter of protest, our team participated in the junior cup semi-finals organized by the Sports Association, scheduled for 10:30 AM on Sunday, November 9th, with Huaguang versus Qingbai B. When all of our team members reported for the match, it was exactly 10:18 AM, but the referee, without asking questions, immediately blew the whistle and, without stating a reason, declared Huaguang forfeited. According to the sports news in various newspapers that day, the scheduled match time was printed as 10:03 AM. At that time, we immediately stated to the referee that, according to the regulations of your sports association, the scheduled time was 10:00 AM. Even according to the legally defined sports time, there is a twenty-minute extension. According to precedent, this cannot be considered a forfeit. At the time, sports enthusiasts who knew the inside story believed it was a one-sided decision and repeatedly requested the referee to retract the decision, but they were refused. As a result, three audience members volunteered to leave their addresses to act as witnesses. We implore your association to uphold sportsmanship and make a fair ruling, continuing to grant us the right to advance to the semi-finals. As for our victory or defeat, it should be determined by skill, so as not to betray the purpose of promoting sports.

### Tonight’s Basketball Friendly: Jiaotong University Faces Chenyou Red. 6 PM at Jiaotong University Gymnasium.

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Jiaotong University basketball team has been coached by national team member Li Zhenzhong, it has made great progress and is preparing to show its skills in the university league. It recently invited the Hualian team for a friendly match. Tonight at 6 PM, it will face Chenyou Red again at the school's gymnasium. The two sides are evenly matched, and the match will definitely be intense.

Observations

Last night's match between the Marine Corps Youth and Chunmao was a touchstone for the strength of the U.S. military. The result was a decisive victory for the Marine Corps Youth over Chunmao, proving that the Marine Corps Youth is a team with both offense and defense, and its skills are above those of giants.

Chunmao is the embodiment of Huafu, maintaining the traditional style, but losing "speed" is a fatal flaw. The quick-attack and passing style that South China used to be good at was not seen throughout the game.

The Marine Corps Youth's No. 7 defender, using his giant physique, defended the basket tightly and without loopholes. During the attack, he closely guarded the opponent's basket and was a buffer point for the team's offense. Last night, he took away eight or nine out of ten balls under the basket for both teams.

To defeat the Marine Corps Youth, there are three points to pay attention to: (1) You must try your best to use quick attacks and passes to quickly enter the basket for shooting; (2) Before shooting, you should try to lure out the No. 7 giant; (3) Make more use of accurate mid-range and side shots.

### Trial of Tani Hisao, Protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre

— Nanjing, 9th Quick News, This newspaper’s special correspondent in Nanjing, Ding Kuanghua

Tani Hisao is the most cruel first person among the enemy generals who invaded China. The Nanjing Massacre was created single-handedly by him. No fewer than 400,000 innocent compatriots were sacrificed by his subordinates. Today, the War Criminals Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense is publicly trying this great butcher. The people of Nanjing should also be able to hold their heads high. Even if Tani Hisao is skinned alive thousands of times, it is not enough to redeem his sins! The Lihzi Society has arranged a solemn courtroom, filled with judges, witnesses, common people, and family members of the victims, all with fervent emotions. Presiding Judge Major General Shi Meiyu led the prosecutors and judges, and after they ascended to the court, at about ten minutes before two o'clock, the prison used a large truck to escort Tani Hisao to the court. Tani's height is not very high, but he is very sturdy, with a flat nose and a short beard, wearing a khaki military uniform, a gray woolen overcoat, and a gray hat. He also carried a yellow leather bag. His cunning and fierce appearance made it clear at a glance that he was a typical figure of the radical and hawkish faction among Japanese soldiers. He walked into the defendant's seat in a very embarrassed manner, stood up straight, and then bowed respectfully to the presiding judge on the stage. The taste of being a "prisoner" must be unbearable for him today. At this time, photographers scrambled to capture the scene, and order became very tense. In the midst of everyone's attention, Tani Hisao lowered his head, as if lost in thought, until Judge Shi questioned him, and then he slowly perked up.

Four Hundred Thousand Compatriots Died Under His Butcher's Knife

After Judge Shi verified the identity of the defendant, Prosecutor Chen Guang read the indictment, recounting that Tani Hisao, after graduating from the Japanese Military Academy and the Army University, served as a member of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, military attache at the British Embassy, and chief of staff of the Third Army. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Tani served as the commander of the 6th Division, which, together with the two divisions of Ushijima Mitsuru, formed an army called the Yanagawa Corps, which landed in Hangzhou Bay, captured Taihu Lake, and invaded Nanjing. On December 13 of the same year, the troops entered Nanjing and carried out a massacre, and on the 17th and 18th, they held a victory parade and a memorial service, letting their soldiers rape, kill, and burn. More than 400,000 innocent citizens of Nanjing died at the hands of this criminal's troops. After reading, the Japanese interpreter read it again to the defendant, which took about half an hour. At this time, Tani Hisao picked up his leather bag, took out a pencil, and recorded the main points of the crimes in the indictment, sometimes stopping to think. After the translator finished translating, Prosecutor Chen stood up and made a supplementary report, saying that the victims listed in the indictment were only a very small part of the actual number, which was more than 400,000. He then listed several collective massacre figures: At Hanzhongmen, more than 2,000 people were massacred at one time, the method being to line them up in rows, then shoot them with machine guns, and then burn them. At Caoxiexia, hundreds were killed... The total number of collective massacres was 394,408... The voice was full of sadness, and the audience was silent. "Demanding blood debt" was naturally everyone's unanimous demand.

Refuses to Admit Defeat; Denies Burning, Killing, and Looting

Tani the demon was quite calm. After the prosecutor spent nearly half an hour recounting his crimes, and the translator translated them into Japanese, he lightly dismissed them all. He said that although he had held original positions in the military, he had "not participated in the decision of national policy" except for "handling military issues related to Europe" and "researching strategic and tactical warfare." As for the two invasions of China from the 17th to the 26th years of the Republic (1928 to 1937), he said that he was "acting on orders, and soldiers cannot violate orders, which is common sense." And he himself: "has always believed that China and Japan are brotherly countries, and strongly advocated Sino-Japanese friendship," and that his "troops were elite Japanese troops, with strict military discipline, which can guarantee that there would be no burning, killing, or looting." Most surprisingly, he said: "After Japan surrendered, he read the newspaper in Tokyo and only then learned that there had been a Nanjing massacre. At that time, the Japanese government did not allow newspapers to publish such things." He called "surrender" a "truce," and it is not known whether it was because he had been in prison for a long time and had not personally witnessed the surrender of Japan, or whether he "refused to admit defeat until death." Tani Hisao's stubbornness can be seen from this.

Pushes the Responsibility for the Massacre onto Yanagawa

Presiding Judge Shi began the trial and first explained that the defendant was being prosecuted for three major crimes: first, the crime of launching a war of aggression; second, the crime of violating humanity; and third, the crime of destroying peace. At the same time, according to the 2,784 pieces of evidence submitted by the Nanjing Municipal Council and the 945 pieces of evidence submitted by the district office. Next, Judge Shi asked about the defendant's background and experience. Tani Hisao took out a resume from his leather bag and answered each question one by one.

Question: Tani Hisao, what is your background? Answer: "I am from Tokyo, 66 years old this year, graduated from the Military Academy and the Army University, military attache at the Indian Embassy, commander of the Dalian Artillery Company, commander of Tokyo Bay, consul general, and now a lieutenant general in the army." Question: "Since you are a high-ranking general, you should have participated in Japan's aggressive national policy." Answer: "I personally have always advocated Sino-Japanese friendship. Since China and Japan are of the same race, they should join hands to maintain peace in East Asia. To achieve peace and stability in East Asia, we must first promote Sino-Japanese friendship, but unfortunately, the Japanese government did not adopt any of these ideas." Tani was gesticulating and trying to defend himself, but the judge instructed the defendant that he would have the opportunity to defend himself later, and that the court still needed to investigate. Tani then stopped talking. The court then asked: "Was the invasion war directed by the military, or was it instructed by Doihara? You are a high-ranking officer in the Japanese military, so you should know. I would like to understand the actual situation, and I hope you can explain it." Judge Shi asked this question again and again, but Tani Hisao evaded it, saying only: "The defendant came to China twice, both on orders. It is natural for soldiers to carry out orders." Question: "What position did you hold when you invaded China?" Answer: "In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), I was the commander of the 6th Division." Question: "Were there not two brigades during the attack on Nanjing?" Answer: "Yes, the 11th and 36th Brigades. The commander of the 11th Brigade was Itai Tokutaro, and the commander of the 36th Brigade was Nakagou . The supreme commander of the attack on Nanjing was Yanagawa, who died of illness the year before last." Question: "Was there not also the Nakajima unit?" Answer: "Nakajima was the main force, and had nothing to do with Yanagawa. Above Yanagawa was Matsui Iwane." Question: "Who attacked Zhonghua Gate?" Answer: "It was the 6th Division of Yanagawa's unit. The attack was met with strong resistance." Question: "How many days did it take to capture it?" Answer: "It took two days to attack Yuhuatai and two days to attack Zhonghua Gate, a total of four days." Question: "What day did you enter the city?" Answer: "On the evening of December 12, and it was not completely occupied until the morning of the 13th." Question: "When Nanjing fell, did you not send a telegram reporting the victory?" Answer: "That was directed by Yanagawa, I don't know." Question: "According to the investigation, you entered the city once on the evening of the 12th and then withdrew, and then entered the city on the 13th." Answer: "Entering the city on the 12th was by climbing over the wall, as for withdrawing, that did not happen. When entering the city, there were the 13th, 47th, 23rd, and other regiments." Question: "Did you preside over the massacre?" Answer: "I don't know." Question: "Who should be responsible for the massacre?" Answer: "Nakajima entered the city on the 14th, I recall that I was transferred to outside the city on the 13th. At that time, other troops also entered the city. After Japan surrendered, I returned to Tokyo and saw a passage in the newspaper, only then did I know that there was a Nanjing massacre." There was another burst of cold laughter from the audience. Question: "During the investigation, you admitted to being stationed at Zhonghua Gate, and the most massacres in that area took place on the 13th and 14th. Now you deny it again, so who committed the massacre?" Answer: "There was absolutely no massacre." Question: "Since the defendant's troops did not massacre Chinese civilians, then who killed the many corpses in the defense zone of Zhonghua Gate?" Answer: "After two days of fierce fighting by Yuhuatai, there must not have been any residents left. At the time, when my troops advanced, it was as if they were entering a no-man's land. Even if there were Chinese civilians, there would not have been many." Question: "Apart from the war, did the defendant's troops not kill a single civilian?" Judge Shi continued to suppress his emotions and pressed the defendant further. Answer: "Absolutely not a single civilian was killed!"

### Two Skulls Represent One Four Hundred Thousandth of the Victims

Tani Hisao still pretended to be very calm when answering. The audience responded to the cunning defense of the fascist robber with "tsk tsk" sounds, and the atmosphere in the courtroom became more tense and serious. Judge Shi then instructed the forensic doctor to bring out the skulls as evidence. After the forensic doctor and inspectors took out eight skulls and several bones from a large sack, they displayed them one by one on the judge's table. Then, according to the examination report, the doctor reported the number and gender of each bone, and the characteristics that led to death. Three of the eight skulls belonged to women. Judge Shi said: Each bone here only represents one four hundred thousandth of all the victims. At the same time, there are also women's skulls, can the defendant say that women are also combatants? The cunning and treacherous Tani Hisao was speechless for a moment. He claimed that according to the recorded burial dates, the earliest was November 22, all after his troops left Nanjing. His troops left Nanjing in thirds on the 15th and 16th, and all left Nanjing on the 18th. Therefore, he only sympathized with the civilians who were injured or killed by stray bullets due to the fighting on the 12th and 13th, and the matter was unavoidable.

### Witnesses Arrive in Court, Recounting the Tragic Events Like a Painting

Xu Chuanyin, president of the Nanjing Branch of the Red Swastika Society, and American professors Smythe and Bates from Jinling University, who had witnessed the massacre, were called to testify, recounting the tragic events like a painting. Based on his sense of justice, he also wrote a record of the atrocities called "Wartime Damage in the Nanjing Area." In addition, he also brought "Japanese Atrocities in Nanjing" written by Miner Searle Bates. During his interrogation, Mr. Bates also submitted a written report. Judge Shi presented Mr. Smythe's and Mr. Bates' records of atrocities to Tani Hisao to read in court. The fascist robber appeared flustered, flipped through them a few times, and handed them to the translator.

### The Violated Woman Painfully Recounts Her Ordeal

A man named Wu Xiang also presented some evidence of the victimization in court. Then, two victims were called to testify. One was Yao Jialong, who said that his wife, son, and daughter were all shot and killed by Japanese soldiers on the evening of the 11th of the winter month in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). He himself was also shot in the back of the neck. To this day, the bullet has not been removed. The other victim was Chen Erguang, who is now 28 years old. At lunchtime on the 11th of the winter month nine years ago, she was raped by two Japanese soldiers. After each person was asked once, Judge Shi stated that due to time constraints, many other witnesses would have to be questioned tomorrow.

### The "Propaganda" Film is Ironclad Proof of the Crime

After Judge Shi finished the interrogation, he announced that the public trial would continue at 2 PM tomorrow, with a ten-minute break. The judge announced that a film shot by the Japanese army when they captured Nanjing would be shown to promote their achievements, including a section on the massacre, which would be shown for viewing and as evidence. Originally, part of this film was originally produced by the Japanese themselves as propaganda, but today it has drawn an oral confession for Tani Hisao. The scenes on the screen showed the "Imperial Army" advancing triumphantly, and the Japanese army massacring our compatriots. All of this is worth every Chinese person being vigilant about, but it should also be worth the fascist robbers repenting.

### Jinmen Customs: "The Most Sinicized American City," Visiting Feng Huanzhang Across the Sea

— San Francisco, 20th News by Air, This newspaper’s special commissioner Mao Shuqing

San Francisco, the gateway to the Pacific Ocean, the natural seaport of the United States, and a hub of sea, land, and air transportation. The international importance of the Pacific Ocean is increasing day by day, and San Francisco, a new city that has been developed for less than a hundred years, is also embarking on the road to prosperity day by day.

San Francisco is a city developed by Spaniards and Chinese. The name "San Francisco" was originally named in memory of the Spanish "Francis." Even now, many buildings and streets in San Francisco still retain traces of Spanish culture.

No other city in the United States is as Sinicized as San Francisco. The Chinese "golden signs" and palace-style houses in Chinatown are interspersed in the monotonous Western society, giving it a unique and quaint taste. Even outside of Chinatown, many of the advertisement figures in the glass windows have black hair and yellow skin. Many of the signs and billboards of shops opened by Americans are engraved with Chinese characters, especially the "Bank of America," "Trust Company," and "Insurance Company," which are written in square and upright Yan-style calligraphy. In order to attract life insurance from overseas Chinese, insurance companies have drawn many Chinese seal script "longevity" characters, and also engraved many slogans such as "long life and wealth," "may your life be as long as Mount Nanshan," and the like. The post office in San Francisco is also the only post office in the United States that writes Chinese names for "parcels," "registered mail," and so on. I also saw a bookstore in the bustling center of San Francisco called "Lieberman," which posted a special advertisement in the window: "We speak Chinese, welcome Chinese friends to visit."

### Feng Yuxiang Buys a Western-Style Building to Set Up a "Dragon Gate Formation"

In San Francisco, it is a very common thing for Westerners to speak Chinese. Foreign employees of telegraph companies and shipping companies all know a little Chinese, such as "hello" and "goodbye." Similarly, tourists from many foreign countries can easily answer a few simple English sentences when they arrive in San Francisco. During the San Francisco Conference, Molotov learned the English words "Thank you" and "Goodbye" here. When General Feng Yuxiang gave speeches in San Francisco, in addition to asking for a translation of the main text, he always ended with a "Thank you"!

On the evening of the second day after I arrived in San Francisco, I crossed the sea to visit General Feng Huanzhang. He was discussing the news in the English newspaper that day with his hydraulic expert Mr. Liu Zhai. Mr. Feng spent US$19,000 to entrust his American church friends to buy a new residence, a small and exquisite building. The building is located in the Berkeley residential area across the river from San Francisco, on Yanshi Road, a gentle hillside, surrounded by jungles and green grass, and the natural environment is very similar to Guling, and also somewhat like the North and South Hot Springs in Chongqing. In such a quiet environment, Mr. Feng reads books and newspapers every day, and practices English. Sometimes, when he returns from an evening stroll, he finds a few friends to "set up a dragon gate formation" (chat). He likes to talk about historical anecdotes of the past, and the stories are interspersed with many jokes.

Mr. Feng set off for Tennessee the next day, accompanied by his wife, hydraulic experts Liu Zhai and Zhang Yuanyi, as well as his adjutant, his secretary, and a Mr. Rob土, the head of the "Soil Conservation Bureau" of the American government. They planned to go to Los Angeles first, then visit the Porter Sluice on the Colorado River, and then stay in Tennessee for a month along the southern United States. Mr. Feng said: "After a month, we will return to Berkeley to sort out the materials, stay for another month, and then go to the TVA, and watch it there for another month. In this way, if we don't understand something the first time we see it, we can ask them again the second time."

### A Quiet Corner of the World, Visiting Gu Mengyu

Another "retired gentleman" living in Berkeley is Mr. Gu Mengyu. This political figure who "upholds righteousness and remains unyielding" is gradually being forgotten in the minds of the Chinese people. He lives in a small house that he bought himself on Seneker Road in Berkeley. The morning I went to visit Mr. Gu, he was in the "garden", wearing a set of "work clothes", which made it difficult to recognize him. He said that he does not often read newspapers. Ten days after the announcement of the Marshall Plan for China, he accidentally saw it on an old newspaper. Mr. Gu said: It is undeniable that the current political direction in China is towards democracy and the rule of law. "Maybe we can't progress very quickly, but it's always better than not progressing"! He said: He often goes to the library of the University of California to read books, "It's a ten-minute tram ride away!"

The Chinese in Berkeley can recognize many stories about Mr. Gu. He is so indifferent and quiet, living in this quiet corner of the world. Some people say that the "slow" speed at which he drives his car is well known to the Americans in Berkeley. He likes to go to a small lake to look at the sky, look at the water, and sit for an hour or two.

The natural environment of Berkeley is lovely. The essence of the entire San Francisco Bay Area is concentrated in Berkeley. There are cities, flat and wide roads, and green hills and forests behind them. From the center of San Francisco, you only need two and a half cents to take the "F" tram, and you can cross the San Francisco Bay Bridge all the way, cross the bay, and reach the foot of the mountain in Berkeley, and then transfer to the Route 7 tram, and slowly climb up the mountain along Euclid Avenue, and you can overlook the "Golden Gate Bridge" on the other side of the bay. One evening, I was walking on the hills, just as the "sunset was infinitely good" at the time of the westward sinking, and the afterglow shone on the Pacific Ocean, shining with thousands of points of golden light. I recalled looking at Poyang Lake from Hanzui Pass in Guling, and I had indescribable feelings.

### World Government: To Realize the Ideal of World Peace, Establishing World Order Must Come First

— Translated by Zhu Xi from Harper's Magazine

Since the events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, intellectuals around the world have believed that modern humanity's political methods are no longer applicable, and everyone seems frantically seeking a permanent world peace solution. Time is so short, and the crisis facing world culture and human survival is so imminent that it's no wonder those who yearn for peace mistake the castles in the air of world government for a paradise of permanent peace.

The world peace plans proposed by those with foresight are morally impeccable and theoretically irrefutable. Therefore, those who believe in this new political theory often display a biased attitude towards skeptics, which is understandable. They say that war is caused by the anarchic state of international governments, and to curb the rampant conflict between lawless nations, a world government must be created to enforce world law. Therefore, the primary political task of the atomic age is to draft a world constitution acceptable to all nations.

These world peace planners, although differing in details and opinions, generally agree on their arguments. These enthusiasts, while admitting that the steps they are taking are radical, neglect the revolutionary problems involved and oversimplify the complex relationships. For example, the "Declaration to the Peoples of All Nations" issued by the Rollins College Conference in the United States last March is entirely a statement of principles and a syllogistic reasoning. The principle is: "As long as the nations of the world cannot abolish their sovereign right to decide war and peace, the maintenance of world peace cannot be absolutely guaranteed, because peace is not only the elimination of war, but also the existence of justice, law, order – in a word, government."

This reasoning is so appealing, the solution so simple, and the claims made are so "grand" that it is no wonder that honest people unanimously support it, and it is not surprising that the opposition dares not criticize it. However, the skeptics can no longer remain silent, because the current world government has fallen into serious errors, and people should realize early that they have entered a dead end.

Using Clever Tactics to Cover Up Three Major Mistakes

We cannot achieve peace by syllogisms based on arrogant premises. The current prophets of world government have effectively masked three major errors with clever tactics. The first mistake is one commonly made by novice political scholars: that you can use law to stop everything, including crime. This view arises from a misunderstanding of the government formation process. The distorted process is as follows: the constitution establishes the government; the government enacts laws prohibiting people from fighting each other and advises them to resolve disputes amicably. The resulting law and order encourages people to cooperate with each other and live together as one big family. This view is completely unreasonable; except for short periods of dictatorship, the process of government establishment is exactly the opposite. Society is formed by the common life and common trust of people, which establishes habits and rules of conduct. Political power and government arise from this social order. The drafting of a constitution is only the final step.

The second mistake can be called the "Independent Nation Theory." Its assumption is that as long as the right of independent nations to declare war is abolished and that right is given to a "higher independent nation," war can be abolished. This is a misinterpretation of the shadow of independent nations as the reality of power. Because the sovereignty to declare war is not a necessary condition for war, as can be seen from the history of civil wars.

The third mistake is to believe that war is a lawsuit fought with bombs rather than with lawyers' briefs. It is said that the world government will establish a world court to resolve "disputes" that could lead to war. But war is often not a dispute over justice, but a conflict of interests. War, like politics, is an attempt to use pressure to determine who gets what, where, and when; it is an attempt to change the status quo.

The time for world government is not yet ripe. The earliest theorists of world government believed that as long as there was a suitable constitutional plan, world law and order could be guaranteed. The ancient Greeks called this thought process "inverted reasoning." This fallacy is also the three major mistakes mentioned above.

World Government Constitution Cannot Solve Problems

From this, it can be understood that the current constitutional approach of world government cannot solve any problems. It cannot create a government, let alone produce any stable social order. If the fundamental world problems are not solved, the foundation of world society, which precedes world government, cannot be established. Humanity will gradually realize that world order is a complex problem that can only be gradually solved, piece by piece, within a feasible scope. Only such a solution can weave the world's administrative system into the pattern of world order. As for constitution-making, that is the last step.

To reiterate, these world problems can only be solved within a feasible scope. For example, the atomic energy control plan cannot be criticized from the punitive aspect, but must be criticized from the extent to which the world administrative agency can effectively control the source and use of atomic energy. Lord Orr, Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, suggested establishing a "World Food Department" to store food, promote food production, stabilize food prices, and distribute surplus food to prevent famine. If benevolent international law scholars with optimistic ideals of "world government" can mobilize the political power behind this proposal, they will make a greater contribution to world peace. There are many plans that are more important and need to be implemented earlier than constitution-making, and the above-mentioned Orr's plan is only one example. Other examples include the proposal to establish an international oil organization; the necessity of promptly implementing the recently established World Health Organization; the difficult task of the International Refugee Organization; and various other plans to solve world problems within a feasible scope.

The realization of world society must be mediated by this kind of world cooperation. "All under heaven are one family" should be a recognition of the problem, not a statement of fact. The implementation of world peace plans depends on the evolution of world order. To make the adoption of a world constitution suitable for the times, one must have the genius to adapt to the political situation, which is absolutely lacking in today's enthusiasts of world government ideals.

### On the Eve of the Moscow Conference: Soviet Smoke Screen

— Translated from the American magazine "Newsweek"

Recently, the Soviet Union has begun to prepare in its own unique way for the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which will focus on the German peace treaty. Moscow newspapers have vehemently attacked the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany. Although the British and American authorities invited other occupying powers to participate in this economic merger, the Soviet Union interpreted this move by the British and Americans as a blow to the Potsdam Agreement, because that agreement treated Germany as an integrated and indivisible economic system.

In fact, this Soviet attack is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the important proposals that the Soviet Union will make in Moscow, a proposal that will completely change the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union will strongly put forward its already well-known demand, namely, to obtain compensation from regular industrial production, rather than from factory equipment, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. At the same time, the Soviet Union will agree to the complete unification of Germany as a condition for exchange—such a "concession" embarrasses American diplomats. They point out that at the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union had already agreed to the unification of Germany. This time, the Soviet Union is repeating its old trick, demanding further concessions from the Western powers in order to win the Soviet Union's consent to fulfill its previous commitments.

The US State Department has always firmly opposed the Soviet Union's new compensation proposal, but has recently made slight concessions. Today's response from the United States is: "Let's see what they demand. If they formally demand compensation worth $10 billion, we will insist on offsetting the value of the East Prussian land that the Soviet Union has already annexed and the factories that have already been seized."

In addition, there is another issue that the US State Department is deeply concerned about, namely: at what stage of the Moscow Conference should the German government be established? Currently, the State Department believes that the division of all land should be decided before the German government is established, otherwise it will inevitably leave a stain of recognizing the partition of Germany that can never be washed away. However, no one has yet come up with a plan to sign a peace treaty with Germany without signing a land treaty, but first-class jurists are working on this task.

### To the Moon

— Translated from Reader's Digest

240,000 Mile Journey

According to "Moon Travel," it will soon become a reality. Now, mankind has begun the practical preparations for the first unprecedented extraterrestrial journey. The organizer is the US Army. This article is published in Reader's Digest. The first half of the translation has been seen in this newspaper on January 15. Due to the Spring Festival holiday, it was not possible to publish the supplement. We apologize for the readers' letters and calls of inquiry. Now, the second half will be translated to respond to the readers. In the future, similar international scientific articles will be moved to other supplements of this newspaper, because this column has been temporarily suspended due to reduced space.

July 2 - No Air, No Clouds

Dawn comes suddenly like lightning. A moment ago, it was pitch black, and in an instant, tens of thousands of rays of sunlight suddenly leaped out from the horizon, dazzling our eyes. There is no sunrise like we have on Earth because there is no air and no clouds, so there is no spectacle of colorful clouds. Under the dazzling bright light, we have to lower the temperature of the warmer by a few degrees. Within 24 hours, the temperature rises to 25 degrees below zero, an increase of more than 200 degrees!

We look around. The rocket ship is parked on a small plateau, with towering, pagoda-shaped rocks on one side and a curved rock wall on the other. At the edge of the plateau, a white plain stretches to the horizon. That horizon is much closer than on Earth because there is no air, so it feels particularly close at hand.

Shadows as sharp as knife edges separate the light and dark sides, with a temperature difference of 50 degrees between the two. Today we have inspected the area near the rocket ship. Tomorrow—actually, it is still the same morning on the moon—we plan to visit the valley.

July 3 - Landing on the Southern Side of the Moon

The surface of the moon under our feet is a layer of soft dust a foot deep, below which is a brittle, uneven crust. When we step, the dust rises several inches and then returns to its original state.

Dusen has collected many rock samples, ready to take them back to Earth.

Today, as we were walking around that circular rock wall, we suddenly heard Liang's voice shouting from the headset: "A building—a church!" He pointed with his claw-like finger to the valley in front.

Three spires stand symmetrically and solemnly at the bottom of the valley, resembling huge man-made buildings. Dusen took out a lunar map to check and said with a smile: "That is Mount Pico, a famous mountain on the moon. It is the outer wall of the 70-mile diameter Plato crater. We originally landed on the southern side of the moon."

July 5 - I spoke too hastily yesterday. Dusen and I had just dismantled the camp and were preparing to continue our advance towards Mount Pico when a meteor shower began to fall. Fortunately, they were all small meteors. We could only hear the meteors pinging on the armor. Dusen gestured to me to hide under the edge of a small volcanic crater. This lasted for seven hours. We communicated by radio. They were also hiding in the crater. I hope no huge meteorite landed on our rocket ship.

July 6 - We walked towards Mount Pico, but it seemed to get farther and farther away. Two days ago, when we looked at it from the plateau, it seemed to be at most three miles away. We walked half the way, and it was still three miles away. But finally we reached the bottom and felt that it was worth the trip. When we looked up at Mount Pico at close range, it still looked like a church. Its structure is very peculiar. Mount Pico is made up of layers of rock stacked on top of each other, like a huge pagoda. Dusen explained that Mount Pico was gradually accumulated by the lava flowing out of three holes.

July 8 - Several hundred miles away from Mount Pico is what ancient astronomers called the Sea of Imbrium. When viewed from primitive telescopes from 240,000 miles away, it may look like a sea, but under our feet, it is just a desert of pumice chips. The temperature has now risen to 180 degrees, and the climate control on our bodies has long been switched from "hot" to "cold." At such a high temperature, humans cannot survive for even half a minute without wearing this specially made suit. One day, the temperature even rose to two degrees above the boiling point.

July 14 - Looking at Earth from the Moon

Today, at dusk on the moon, we looked up at the sky and saw a huge bright moon. That is our Earth! This scene is extraordinarily magnificent. If there were humans on the moon, they would definitely call it "New Earth." It hangs on the horizon opposite the sunset, a bright and clear crescent moon, 13 times larger than the moon we see on Earth. We stared at it in a daze, feeling "raising my head to gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown." So we tried our best to recognize which country the part we saw belonged to. It should have been very gratifying to see the Earth, but in reality it was not—home was really too far away.

July 15

The most meaningful stage of this scientific expedition is about to begin. The part of the moon that we have traveled through has already been precisely observed, photographed, and mapped by humans on Earth. Tomorrow we will reach the other hemisphere of the moon that has never been seen from Earth, and see the back of the moon.

Sober-minded scientists tell us that we have no reason to believe that the hidden side of the moon is any different from the side we usually see. But another group of people are deliberately making all sorts of sensational claims. Some people say that the back of the moon is just an empty shell. Some people believe that there are cities, gardens, and humans behind the moon. Tomorrow, when we cross the dividing line and enter the unknown, the matter will be clarified; and tomorrow night, when I broadcast again, you will all be able to know the truth... (The End)

Spring and Autumn

### Female Writer Gertrude Stein Passes Away

— Zhao Jingshen

Female writer Gertrude Stein recently died in the American Hospital in Neuilly. She had a strong, almost masculine face, a crew cut and curly gray hair, like a solemn statue. Some say she "resembled a bust of a Roman emperor, or a Buddhist monk."

Stein lived in France for forty-three years. Twelve years ago, she visited the United States, when her opera "Four Saints in Three Acts" and the poetic nonsense "Pigeons in the Grass, Alas" were performed in the United States. People commemorate her, often for her poetry, paying little attention to her prose; because in the former she often loved to repeatedly write her favorite nouns and objectives, but in the latter she only focused on verbs. She believed that art should live in the completely and independent "now," and she compared her own works to films, one image flowing into the second image, continuously and constantly. Ordinary writing often has many unnecessary words, and often uses stupid punctuation and parentheses to separate sentences. She asked, why add a question mark after a question, why use semicolons and commas to interfere with the action?

She liked to pursue the beauty of sound, sometimes making her works seem like they were written by an eight-year-old child. Her poems often made readers scratch their heads, leaving them completely confused. She could write like this: "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."

But she finally forced writers to pay attention to the value of "words," re-examining their logical and tonal beauty. The theory she illustrated had a great influence on Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Hemingway, and the young writers who visited her in Paris in the 1930s. She obliterated the long sentences and many unnecessary words of Victorian era writers. Therefore, America's best novelists do not write like this: "She lowered the curtains, her cheeks flushed, gently, she whispered, 'I love you.'" They simply write: "She said, 'I love you.'" She also opposed young people reading Scott, Dickens, Lanclay, Balzac, and Hugo.

However, her lectures on "Composition" at Oxford and Cambridge twenty years ago, and on "Narrative" at the four universities of California in 1934, were all methodical. Her early novel "Three Lives," which depicted two maids and a sorrowful black slave, was also very reasonable and concise. Her two autobiographies do not write about herself. One was written for her lifelong companion and secretary, called "The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas," and the other was written for the public, called "Everybody's Autobiography." These are all easy for us to understand. Her last work before her death was a conversation with American soldiers, showing the endless youth of today.

If she had lived a few more years, she might have abandoned her claim to use words, no longer repeating nouns, and no longer pursuing the beauty of sound. Her influence on America was not only in the literary world. When the German army trampled on France's beautiful cities and countryside, she perseveringly suppressed her own emotions. It is a pity that she died, otherwise she could have seen that France is now free, and Paris is more beautiful than before.

### Spring

— Peng Aohan

Sunshine

Sadly wandering through the dry, sandy, hazy desert, bearing a string of heavy days, I welcome the fragrance of spring fields.

The gentle spring breeze brings colorful and bright sunshine. The fields are bathed in the green spring sun.

"It's the season of cuckoo calls again!"

The sound of the cuckoo seems to pervade the wilderness and the hills; like the footsteps of a washing woman walking in the stream in the morning, startling the awakening farm.

The sun passionately kisses the barren land. The hardworking figure of the old grandfather disappears again on the edge of the fields.

The earth, a green ocean, is rippling with the fragrance of the land, the splendor of the rapeseed flowers…

Red Flower

Wandering along the winding mountain paths and streams, I see your awakening branches and leaves.

Like waking up from a strange dream, you calmly and quietly spread your bright red petals...!

"Ah, little flower of red life!"

I have suffered for some time because of the cold and congealed days you encountered. Even today, this gray residue remains on the palette of my life.

And you, little flower that proudly broke through the icy seal! You are singing a song of the century to the spring sunshine...!

Window

Over there, on the window curtain, a black shadow is jumping...!

I pushed open the heavy window curtain, welcoming the songs of the shepherdess from the fields outside the window...

Thus, the window drove away the darkness, brought in warmth, and presented various forms. The spring sun spread many flower patterns on the carpet.

"Aren't you looking forward to the spring morning? Then come to the window? It will report to you the itinerary of spring."

So, I stretched out my anemic hands, towards the outside of the window, welcoming the enthusiastic concern of the children...!

Green

Spring, it's the season of green again!

Thinking of some past days, I reminisce about the wide green fields.

There is no disturbance, nor is there a sigh; the fields are filled with vigorous and frivolous teasing sounds...!

From the distant paddy fields, the sound of the old cow's panting floats over, the sound is strangely heavy...!

"Paint some new green color on the fields!"

Thus, green ripples, green leaves; and ah, the green, drooping wild grass, the sky-like canopy covering the evergreen trees, should warm your youthful dreams, right?

Thus, green gives you a powerful revelation.

Thus, green gives you ardent vitality.

Thus, I saw you fall into the embrace of the fields and giggle...!

Clear Sky

Suddenly, I missed the green sea-like clear sky...!

So, I raised my head, and the azure clear sky dazzled my eyes, my heart...!

"The clear sky has a clear and clarified heart and dreams," I said. I saw it give me a silent and powerful revelation, so I cursed the treacherousness and mustered all my courage.

You, with new life, the clear sky belonging to spring, how much I miss you!

Now, I am using rough hands to excavate the clear sky's broad life, love, freedom, and life.

So, I lay on the chest of the fields, letting the light and heat emitted by the clear sky weave for me a scarlet and absurd dream.

Thus, I forgot the ridicule of people and things, and the long years that were insulted by life...!

### In Memory of My Deceased Friend, Li Zhaonan

— Zhong Ji Min

The day before yesterday, while attending a gathering of friends, I inadvertently flipped through the Shen Bao and saw the news of the overturned vehicle at Tiansheng Port. As I read on, I couldn't help but cry out, "Alas! Zhaonan is dead."

Two weeks ago, after the end of the term at Fudan University, I wrote to him, asking him to come to Fudan and inviting him to the Ye Family Garden. I said, "This is a small and exquisite garden, and now is a rare opportunity to relax, my friend!" He replied that he was busy with work and would prefer that I visit him. However, after the Lunar New Year, I was constantly on the go and never made it. Now he is dead. The word "meeting" will never exist between us again. All that remains in my heart are shadows of the past.

We studied and played together as children. After graduating from primary school, we went our separate ways. I went to Sanlin Normal School, and he went to Qiu Zhong. Later, the overall situation still revolved around guerrilla areas, all for the sake of graduating from high school.

Last year, circumstances led me to Shanghai, and we met again. This was our first meeting after seven years of separation. The friendship of those days had not been diluted by time, and the many years of rain, snow, wind, and frost had not eroded our pure hearts. He was still as lively and talkative as ever. He told me that he had reluctantly entered the business world and that the manager of the money shop where he worked was a man who held a remote honorary title of county magistrate from his hometown, fat and greasy, slippery, and full of tricks. The shop assistants were like subordinates in the government, often subjected to a scolding for no reason. Sometimes, when he encountered difficulties in accounting, the manager would say, "How can people like you become officials? Being an official depends entirely on reporting accounts well." He was angry, he hated it, and he hoped that other young people would never have to experience the life of a shop assistant that he had gone through. After the Japanese surrender, he resolutely resigned from his position as a shop assistant, came to Shanghai, and entered Wuxi Guozhuan (National College). He said that he wanted to improve, to strive, to destroy people like the manager in the country with his own hands. Not long after entering Guozhuan, the flames of civil war ignited in his hometown, and his economic resources were cut off. It happened that the Shen Bao newspaper was recruiting trainees, so he took the exam and was admitted. He said that he could gain more new knowledge from the editors in the future, and that he would work hard at writing, using his pen to expose all the evils in society.

After talking with me, he felt that we shared the same aspirations. On summer evenings, during breaks from work at the newspaper, he would come to my place. In a dimly lit alleyway, many people were cooling off and chatting, but only the two of us stood talking about the future. We would cherish our farewells until the Big Dipper hung askew and only the two of us remained in the alleyway.

In the autumn, I entered Fudan University. I often went to see him on Sundays, and the conversations were very short because he was tied down by more work. However, I never saw him with a worried look, nor did I hear him say anything dissatisfied. I sometimes asked him how he felt about his current work. He said: Cultural work is a great work. It is like a lighthouse in the dark night, pointing out a smooth path for ships at sea, especially on nights of storms and raging waves.

And now he is dead. His death is a loss to the Shen Bao newspaper, and also a loss to our group of young people striving for progress. The unfinished tasks he left behind can only be shouldered by us, this group of young people. We can only commemorate our deceased friend with greater effort and greater progress.

### Subtle Fragrance Drifting (Photography)

— Qian Nanchang

### Ode to Small Flowers

— Ye Feng

(I) Morning Glory

You poke your head out from a dark and humid place where you can't see a ray of sunlight all year round to see this bright world.

You come out from under the dense fence, from the decaying soil, stretching out your tendrils, gazing at the universe, the true meaning of light and life.

So you see the warm sunshine shining on the earth, emitting a burst of intoxicating fragrance of grain, and you will no longer feel the invasion of cold.

So you hear the lark singing in the blue sky, and the river singing to the distant night. I see that you seem unwilling to live in silent loneliness, and you blow the trumpet of justice to the world.

Ah! Beautiful morning glory that gives people joy.

No matter where; on the fields, under the fences, by the windows, there are your footprints of courageous trekking. You climb from the dark, weedy, and dense shade to a high place, looking up at the misty clouds. You are not used to the foul and suffocating ammonia-smelling air. Therefore, you yearn for fresh air and free and comfortable breathing. Wherever I go, I can smell your bursts of refreshing fragrance, as if the world would die silently without your existence, because our days must be decorated with flowers.

People do not avoid you because of your humble origins. Flower lovers plant you in front of their windows so that they can see you at all times. They are not as cruel as those who call orchids "gentlemen," imprisoning you in dark rooms and preventing you from seeing a ray of warm sunshine. They all love you so much, allowing you to breathe freely in the wilderness and kiss the sunshine to your heart's content.

Ah! Magnificent morning glory that gives me hope.

(II) Bean Flower

Blue, purple, pink, beautiful and lovely bean flowers, you are the future life and fruits of the farmers, who entrust the little hope they have gained from their hard work to you. When they see you blooming all over the mountains and fields, a warm smile appears on their faces.

When the spring breeze melts the snow in the mountains and fields, the sound of white dove wind chimes rings in the blue sky, and the earth is kissed by the warm sunshine, I hear your mothers poking their heads out of the black, fragrant, and loose soil to welcome the season of new life beginning, a scene of joyous laughter.

In those days, you lay peacefully in your mothers' arms, listening attentively to the songs of the world. When the season of mature new life begins to arrive, you break out of your mothers' arms one after another. I seem to hear your unrestrained singing, singing praises for the blessings of the land:

Welcome! This season of new life is beginning, we have all fought through the long night. Today, before the red sun arrives, we will go to meet the bright dawn. …

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 166

— Ye Jinfeng

"Although he's tall and clumsy, he's not stupid," I said in praise of "Zero Four."

"Yes!" Yaoqun chimed in, "If Mr. Yue goes with us this time, along with Shen Jun and a few subordinates, plus me and Tiger Brother, and a dozen or so good men from the village, we can do anything, whether it's espionage or guerrilla warfare." Yaoqun was a bit animated, expressing excitement.

"Why don't you count me in?" He Jian frowned; I didn't know if he was serious or just acting.

"That would be even better." Yaoqun's eyes lit up even more; his expression suddenly became clear, like moonlight veiled with wisps of clouds, still somewhat incredulous, or like a sudden thought, a layer of suspicion clouded his face again.

"Where would I have this fortune, to be with Miss Yaoqun, Teacher Tiger, Brother Yue, all year round? ... Alas! If only ..." He Jian's sigh was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone, and someone knocked on the door at the same time. Yaoqun picked up the receiver; I got up to open the door, responding as I did:

"Please come in." I was wondering who it was, knocking so loudly.

The person had already pushed the door open. It was Mr. W. Although he looked calm, there seemed to be a hint of unease between his eyebrows.

"Captain!" Little Tiger suddenly stood up straight and saluted.

"More Japanese, and it sounds like a woman's voice." Yaoqun held up the receiver, turning to look at He Jian. At the same time, he saw Mr. W step into the room, also nodding respectfully, since she was wearing a long cheongsam and did not salute.

He Jian greeted Mr. W and asked him to sit down, while taking the telephone receiver from Yaoqun.

"Hello ... yes, ... I'll be right there ..." He Jian finished listening to the call and repeated, "Please sit down, please sit down." In fact, Mr. W had already sat down.

"Is something the matter?" Mr. W asked everyone with a smile; because the atmosphere in the room was rather tense.

"Good news," He Jian said, speaking to Mr. W but glancing at everyone in the room; "That 'Mountain Spirit' Sakai just called, saying that the person we're looking for has been found. They've arrested over a hundred 'unstable elements' in the city this afternoon alone, men, women, old, and young. He suspects that Mr. Wu is among them and wants us to send someone to identify him."

"Nonsense!" Mr. W said somewhat indignantly, "There are probably three or four hundred people, not just over a hundred. I just received a report from my subordinates."

"Hmph! ... Our Mr. Wu is the most important; we'll take a look at the others later ... Uh! Do you have any ideas?" He Jian asked Mr. W, meaning if there was any way to rescue all the arrested people.

"There is a way, but it's not very feasible. You see, Commander Song has gone to Baoding, and the important figures have gone with him. Although General Zhang Zizhong is still here in charge, he can't come forward right now—because of an important reason ..."

"But there's something else at hand that I specifically came to discuss with a few of you." Mr. W paused here, looking at He Jian, then at us.

Mr. W's pause made me realize that the situation must be very serious, so I remained calm, waiting for him to continue. But He Jian was a little impatient:

### Killing the "Fighting Method" People

— Xin Er

Being led by the nose is not the way to go.

Everyone is bullish on gold prices, and basically no one is wrong in their assessment. However, take a look at how gold prices have been rising these past two days?

A jump of a million at a time. Passing through five barriers, six barriers, seven barriers, eight barriers, nine barriers, one barrier after another.

Passing through one barrier after another is not surprising. The Central Bank's allocated price follows the black market, simply being led by the nose.

Being led by the nose is not surprising. How much is allocated, how much is consumed, thousands upon thousands are consumed. After being consumed, the price is left to rise.

So pawnshops take the allocated gold and don't sell it, the shop assistants are lazy;

So speculators make a big turnaround;

So huge production loans are deeply sinful;

So public panic is out of control.

Large amounts of speculative capital are surging up, surging up; powerful figures are flaunting their power, lawless and unscrupulous. They are fighting! They want to defeat the Central Bank's policies in the current situation.

The current problem is a test. Whether the Central Bank's policy changes or not, I personally do not completely agree with the views of those who advocate the "core of internal war." The most realistic problem at present is to seize the opportunity to kill a few people who are using "fighting methods." Not changing has its own methods, changing has its own methods.

Being led by the nose is definitely not a policy.

### Beyond God's Initial Expectations? Humans Will Conquer Nature: On "Artificial Snow" and "Artificial Sunlight"

The progress of human science has been able to change the laws of nature and make up for its shortcomings. Even rain, snow, and climate can be manipulated freely by human power. "Controlling clouds and causing rain" is achieved through human effort!

United Press report: The Australian Scientific and Industrial Research Institute in Sydney conducted an "artificial rain" test on the 6th of this month. Scientists flew in airplanes 50 miles above Sydney. After "completing the deployment," rain poured down from the clouds west of the Blue Mountains.

It is said that this test has not yet been considered a complete success, but we can predict that the time for "complete success" is not far away. Moreover, we can foresee that when "artificial rain" is declared a complete success, "drought" will become a thing of the past in human history!

Artificial Snow Experiment

American scientist Schaefer, in his laboratory, put tiny particles of dry ice into overcooled warm air and discovered the existence of snowflakes. Based on this principle, a large-scale artificial snow experiment was held at the Victory Quetta Airport last winter. Airplanes were used to spread six pounds of tiny particles of dry ice in the sky at high altitude. The snow content in the clouds, due to the effect of condensation and exothermic heat, caused the clouds to stir, eventually resulting in heavy snowfall. It is estimated that a small particle of dry ice can cause dozens of tons of snow to fall after descending two thousand feet.

The dry ice mentioned here is a kind of "waterless ice," the raw material of which is carbon dioxide. It is liquefied under extremely high pressure and then solidified. Its use is for refrigeration. Miners can use it to develop coal mines, doctors can use it to treat diseases, butchers can use it to slaughter pigs, fire brigades can use it to extinguish fires, and machinists can use it to rivet. Mechanics even want to use it to start airplanes. Now, this "artificial ice" has also become the raw material for "artificial snow."

Roses Blooming in the Twelfth Lunar Month

"Artificial sunlight" has also been successfully invented through the efforts of scientists. Professor Whisro of Purdue University in the United States discovered that using "artificial sunlight" to cultivate plants is far more effective than plants grown in real sunlight. Not only is the growth rate faster, but the plants also grow taller. This scientific replanting method can even make roses bloom in December, and allow people to eat summer vegetables in winter.

As early as a dozen years ago, the Soviet Union had already installed sunlight machines, which were placed on the roof and rotated towards the sun. The sunlight collected in the machines was then transmitted to the interior of the room to be used for boiling water, cooking eggs, regulating temperature, and other tasks. These sunlight machines could also store solar energy for use on cloudy or rainy days. However, that was a clever use of sunlight, while now it is being directly manufactured using electric current.

Artificial Climate

Moscow had an "artificial climate laboratory" several years ago, which used coolers, air heaters, humidifiers, and other machines to change the climate of Moscow, making it no different from the climate of southern Turkmenia, Irkutsk, or Leningrad. "Daoyichis" plants can be cultivated in the climate of Leningrad, and "Ukrainiania" wheat can be cultivated in the frozen climate, both of which have been proven by artificial climate. In addition, an "artificial climate factory" was established to create suitable climates for people who need a certain climate, which caused a sensation around the world.

Human science is truly great. After a few more years, even if the sun disappears on Earth, and there are no spring, summer, autumn, and winter, no wind, frost, rain, and snow, humans will still be able to live well—human power will definitely be able to turn the tide!

However, these things may not have been anticipated by God.

### Prophecy Riddles

Answer:

"Since You Left," "Long Thoughts."

### Window of Spring Morning (II)

— Yi Fan

Insurance

When taking a bus, an insurance policy is forcibly included with the ticket; when taking a ship, a life insurance fee must also be collected with the ticket.

By analogy, the day when insurance is included with tickets for trains, airplanes, streetcars, theaters, and zoos is not far off.

The reasoning is as follows: Accidents can happen in transportation, theaters might collapse, and entering a zoo naturally carries the possibility of being bitten in the throat by a certain animal.

Supplement to Prophecy

Supplementing a prophecy that no one else has said:

On this day next year, public places such as airplanes, ships, trains, streetcars, and theaters will post notices: "Life is dangerous, guests are responsible for their own safety, this establishment assumes no responsibility."

Bullish

"The market is unanimously bullish"—this statement makes no sense. It is clearly making it bullish.

You and I are unanimously tightening our belts, watching rice rise, watching gold rise, watching the prices of everything rise. We can only stare blankly, the price rises on its own, what does watching have to do with it? Alas.

Reap Benefits in Old Age

The soaring price of gold bills also has its advantages.

It's better to buy gold bills, who would still lend at high interest rates? There is no better way for the authorities to eliminate usury. This is also a great success.

### The Happiest Period of Life

— Xin Min

Recently, in a magazine of the American International Civil Servants Association, someone raised a simple question: "What period was the happiest period of your life?"

There were more than 500 elderly people who answered this question, their ages ranging from 65 to 98 years old. The majority of them agreed that the period between 25 and 45 years old was the happiest period of their lives. One-fifth of them agreed that it was from 15 to 25 years old, while a small number of people chose their childhood as the happiest.

From the general discussion, they came to an important conclusion: If you are married and have children, then you will pay attention to the happiness of the present and forget the happiness of your youth. If you have not yet married, then your childhood will become a sacred memory. (Translated from the February Reader's Digest)

### Rising Prices and Deception

— Yan Hua

Recently, commodity prices have been soaring, and all that can be heard on the streets is the cry of rising prices. The price of gold has risen past the 9 million mark, and the US dollar has risen to a high price of 17,000. The black market price of white rice is more than 100,000 yuan, and they say there is no stock available; the price of cotton cloth has risen by more than 8,000 yuan, and businesses are rushing to buy it. Other items such as fish, meat, vegetables, matches, and soap have all risen in price. In the market price columns of various newspapers, black triangles are arranged densely, like pagoda tips and snake formations.

How can those who earn 100,000 or 200,000 a month live? How can the unemployed live? Therefore, those who can rob and steal become thieves; the old and weak become beggars. Those who do not become thieves or beggars become swindlers. If you don't believe me, please open the newspaper and take a look. Chen Aying, a prostitute in a brothel on Guangxi Road, was swindled out of a coat and two pairs of overshoes by a guest named Shen Guobin; Hengchang, Zhenguan, and other hardware stores were swindled out of 1.6 million yuan by Sun Guohui, who impersonated a platoon leader of the military police; Fang Jiuhe Silver Building on Jinling Road was swindled out of a large gold bar by a customer; Taitaiyang Bank and Zhongmao Trading Company were swindled out of more than 1 million yuan in membership fees by Cao Zhizhan. Enough. Enough, there are so many fraud cases in one day, just like the trend of rising special prices. Rising prices are the cause of deception, and deception is the result of rising prices. We advise all stores to be careful not to be deceived amidst the cries of rising prices.

### Who is the King of Blood Transfusions?

— Fang Wen

Medical science has invented the art of blood transfusion, and some people make a living by it. Jacob, a Jewish refugee who fled to Shanghai, is one of them. In his 13-year history of blood transfusions, he has transfused blood 96 times, exporting more than 30,000 cc of blood. He has transfused blood twice in half an hour without any adverse reactions, and therefore has the title of King of Blood Transfusions. Since victory, our Chinese people have fallen into the abyss of war, spending years of hardship, and are subject to "liquidation," "struggle," and "liberation" every day, as well as countless bloodsuckers of different blood types such as high prices and high interest rates, transfusing blood without restriction. For a year, everyone has had too much blood transfused, and everyone is as thin as a rake and has a sickly complexion.

Therefore, although Jacob has an astonishing record of transfusing more than 30,000 cc of blood, it is not worth mentioning compared to the Chinese people!

Therefore, the Chinese people can be called the King of Blood Transfusions, and they truly deserve it!

### The Automobile Class Also Has Worries

### Recent Inventions

You Can Use a Book to Wash Your Hands

The most popular thing in Melbourne, Australia, recently is the "Convenient Soap Book." It is made of perfumed soap in the form of book pages. Each book is three inches long and two inches thick, containing thirty pages of sponge-like pages.

Before washing your hands, tear off a page and gently hold it in the palm of your hand. Then gently rub until moist. At the same time, rub your palms to create soap bubbles. The remainder is a small pulp-like ball that can be thrown in the trash.

The manufacturer also said that this book is specially designed to be exquisitely placed in a lady's pocket, and is very beautiful and generous.

X-Rays Used for Detection

The American General Electric Company has designed X-rays to detect counterfeit currency, solids, gases, or adulterants and unknown impurities contained in liquids. This design, called an X-ray photometer, can determine the amount of sulfur in petroleum, the composition of coal, and the composition of heavy metals in glass; as well as the density of fillers in wood, and so on.

When using this instrument, X-rays are emitted through the substance being tested and then transmitted to a fluorescent screen. Some of the radiated light is absorbed by the substance, while the rest is transmitted to the screen, appearing as visible light. An electric photography device is used to calculate and read the final result on a needle surface.

For example, when measuring a suspicious copper coin, first measure the amount of light that can be absorbed from an ordinary copper coin, and then check the suspicious copper coin. If the amount of light absorbed is not relative to the above copper coin, then it is undoubtedly a counterfeit coin.

Chinese Automatic Typewriter

To seek greater benefits for people, the first Chinese automatic typewriter equipped in New York was produced in response to the times. This is another manifestation of modern scientific capabilities.

This typewriter was completed with the guidance and assistance of a Chinese engineer. This machine is also the first to be able to quickly type out more than 5,400 commonly used character symbols. An experienced typist can type between 40 and 45 words per minute, so it is beneficial to Chinese characters.

All the lead characters are arranged on a cylinder and divided into three parts according to commonly used characters, containing a total of 5,400 characters. There are also all the letters of the English alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, and forty linguistic symbols to supplement deficiencies.
