### The Northeast War Situation Has Tended Towards Stability, With National Forces Approaching Gongzhuling From Two Directions, Changtu Recaptured, and Communist Forces Moving West From Siping

[Report from our Shenyang Office, 24th] The Northeast war situation, due to the National Army's offensive and steadfast defense of Siping, though the crisis still exists, has indeed tended towards stability. First, Benxi was recovered, reducing the tension in Guanyang. Then came Changchun and Tieling, with the National Army advancing from both the north and south towards Kaiyuan, creating a significant impact. Especially the southern route, with a large number of fresh troops bypassing Changtu and heading north at forced speed, is notable. The Communist forces have withdrawn a portion of their besieging forces from Siping, attacking north and south. On the night of the 23rd, there was only partial contact in Siping. By 9:00 AM on the 24th, the main force of the Communist troops besieging Siping had moved towards Bamiancheng. Furthermore, according to air force reconnaissance, there are still two or three strongholds on the northern side of the railway's west side that are firmly held by the National Army. It is reported that the Communist forces' siege of Siping has lasted for 14 days. Chen Mingren and Liu Handong, leading military and government personnel with the spirit of success or death, have defended the city with great determination, coupled with the strong support of the air force, creating the victory of preventing the Communist forces from diverting troops to Changchun and Shenyang. The general public has expressed great admiration. However, the tragic deaths of Communist soldiers and civilians, and the fact that Siping has become a pile of rubble, also breaks people's hearts. The National Army in southern Liaoning is carrying out mopping-up operations around the recovered strongholds. A warship has arrived outside the port of Yingkou, and more warships are expected to arrive, which is quite comforting to the people of Northeast China.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] A Shenyang dispatch states: The defending troops in Siping Street eliminated 3,000 Communist soldiers in street fighting, capturing 1,000 rifles and 500 light and heavy machine guns. The Chinese Communist radio broadcast did not acknowledge this news, and continues to claim repeated victories in Siping Street in recent days. On the night of the 22nd, the battle was most intense, with the city ablaze with fire. Government aircraft were very active, conducting as many as 130 bombing sorties throughout the day and night. At the same time, transport planes dropped a large amount of supplies to the defending troops in Siping Street, Changchun, and Jilin.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The National Army north of Kaiyuan is advancing rapidly towards Gongzhuling. The northern National Army arrived at Taojiatun (north of Gongzhuling) on the 22nd. These two National Army forces have launched a pincer attack on Gongzhuling.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] There are no Communist forces on the Shenyang-Yingkou line. Passenger buses on the China Chang Railway are scheduled to run south to Waishiqiao and Yingkou, and north to Kaiyuan, starting on the 25th. The National Army reinforcing Siping recaptured Changtu on the afternoon of the 24th. The southward force has advanced to the outskirts of Gongzhuling.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 24th] The railway between Xiyang and Shuanghezhen on the Jilin-Shenyang line has been repaired and will be tested today.

[Report from our Shenyang Office, 24th] Although the Communist forces have besieged Chaoyang, causing tension, military officials say there is no cause for concern.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] Communist forces moving south from Chifeng attacked Lingyuan and Yebaishou. Another unit of about 3,000 men attacked Chaoyang again on the evening of the 22nd, with fierce fighting lasting all night. On the morning of the 23rd, the railway station (three miles north of the city) was captured. The defending troops retreated to the urban area and mountain strongholds south of the city. The battle is still continuing.

### Joint Meeting of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association, Chief of Staff Chen Reports on Military Affairs, Current Situation is Even Worse Than the "May Third" Incident

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng, reported on the recent military situation on various battlefields at a joint meeting of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association at 9:00 AM on the 24th. His conclusion stated: If military orders and government orders are properly coordinated, the military end can be expedited. He reviewed three facts that prove the Communist forces will inevitably be defeated: (1) The Communist forces are hated by the general public and can be said to have lost popular support, which will inevitably lead to defeat. (2) The morale of the Communist forces has begun to waver, as evidenced by the surrender of more than 130,000 people. (3) Material resources are scarce, so the Communist forces cannot sustain themselves for long and will eventually fail. In answering questions from committee members, Chen also stated: The current war has in fact entered the stage of international war, especially the Northeast battlefield and the Xinjiang incident, which make people deeply feel that there is a danger of falling into the repetition of the "May Third" Massacre of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and even more so. However, the "May Third" Jinan Massacre failed to stop the Northern Expedition, and now our confidence is even stronger, and we will also be able to overcome all difficulties.

Chen stated regarding the general situation: Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in August of the previous year, the government has adhered to a peaceful policy in order to seek a solution to the Communist problem. However, the Communist forces took the opportunity to expand their territory and develop their military strength. Local areas in the Northeast fell into the hands of the Communist forces. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist forces had about three divisions. During the Anti-Japanese War, up to the 31st year, they requested to be reorganized into nine divisions. After the Anti-Japanese War, they requested to be reorganized into eighteen divisions. In October of the 34th year, Mao Zedong went to Chongqing and requested to be reorganized into forty-eight divisions. This proves that their military strength has been continuously expanding. By last year, they had expanded to 850,000 people. The government felt quite dangerous in terms of military strength. We suffered a great deal during this period. After July of last year, the government began to counterattack, driving the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu's Suqian to the north of the Longhai Railway, and continued to capture Zhangjiakou, Siping Street, and Changchun. After the Chinese Communist Party rejected peace talks this year, the government was forced to take the initiative. This stage can be called the critical moment of the Communist forces' survival. The Communist forces took advantage of the Moscow Conference to issue the order "everything for military affairs, everything for victory." In the past six months, we have defeated the Communist forces five times. Now the Communist forces are launching a second large-scale attack against us. After five defeats, the Communist forces quickly recovered their strength and counterattacked us. This is all due to international forces, which deserves attention. In this Northeast war, there are indeed Soviet troops, Korean communists, and Japanese prisoners of war participating in the fighting. To this day, we are still in a passive position.

In northern Shaanxi, although we occupied their old nest of Yan'an, the Communist forces fleeing in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area have not yet been eliminated.

In Shandong, after driving the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu to the north of the Longhai Railway last year, we further occupied the area from Linyi to Lanfeng in February of this year. However, due to insufficient transportation and transportation difficulties, progress has not been as ideal. The 74th Division unfortunately sacrificed heroically. So far, we have not completely resolved the Communist forces in Shandong, which is really due to transportation difficulties. Road repairs are currently underway to facilitate military transportation.

Regarding the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the National Army is reinforcing various strongholds south of Tianjin. The Communist forces' operational goal in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is to coordinate with the Northeast war. In Henan, the Communist forces of Liu Bocheng's troops no longer have the strength to attack again. As for the Shanxi war, after the National Army reinforced from southern Jin, the war situation has tended towards stability. Taiyuan was tense for a while, but it is now believed that there is no problem.

In conclusion, Chen stated: Although the war situation in various places is quite tense, it can be believed that victory will inevitably belong to us.

Following Chief of Staff Chen's report, Hou Teng, Acting Director of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Li Shuzheng, Director of the Second Division of the Third Bureau, reported on the military situation in various battlefields, briefly stating: There are more than 800,000 main Communist forces inside the Pass, of which 600,000 are trained and 200,000 are local troops. There are 520,000 in the Northeast, including 290,000 Chinese Communists, 100,000 Korean Communists, 100,000 Japanese prisoners of war, 20,000 East Mongolian Autonomous Army soldiers, and 42 Soviet advisors (31 in Gangou, north of Jilin, and 11 in Herde, east of Siping Street). There are 200,000 Communist forces in Shandong, commanded by Ye Jianying, with Soviet ships transporting soldiers and using UNRRA relief ships to transport ammunition. The battles in the Pinghan and Tianjin-Pukou Railway's northern sections are aimed at disrupting our public security in Beiping and Tianjin to prevent us from reinforcing the Northeast. The Communist forces in the Northeast are attempting to sabotage transportation in Rehe and eastern Hebei. There are more than 30,000 Communist forces in southern Jin, commanded by Chen Yi, and more than 30,000 in northern Jin, commanded by He Long. There are 50,000 in northern Shaanxi, commanded by Peng Dehuai. Currently, the larger battlefields in the country are in three places: the Northeast, Shandong, and northern Shaanxi. In the Northeast, Siping Street is under fierce battle. The area east of the China Chang Railway is in the hands of the National Army, while the area west is occupied by the Communist forces. The National Army is now attacking from the north and south of Changchun and Shenyang, and the strength of the Communist forces has been greatly reduced. There is no major war in Shandong. It is reported that a decisive battle will begin south of the Jiaoji Railway. In northern Shaanxi, since the National Army recovered Yan'an, the main force of the Communist forces has been exhausted. The National Army is still pursuing, and there may be a decisive battle. If the western route wins, the Communist forces will be easily resolved. Regarding the Beitashan incident, because aircraft with Soviet markings protected the invasion of Outer Mongolian troops, it is definitely not an ordinary border dispute. Our army has obtained many medals and documents in the battle, and has shot down one of the aircraft, which is currently being thoroughly studied.

Li also described his impressions of the battles over the past year, saying: It is not difficult for discerning people to understand the subtle factors behind the failure to unify the Northeast and the failure to smoothly take over Dalian and Lushun. Soldiers have the determination to defend the territory, and at the same time, they must cooperate with diplomacy and politics.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng invited Leighton Stuart, the head of the U.S. military advisory group, to meet at around 4:00 PM on the 24th to discuss matters.

### National Army Enters Tangguantun, Continues to Advance on the Tianjin-Salt Highway, Communist Forces Launch Unsuccessful Night Attack on Baoding Outskirts

[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] The military announced: After the National Army's deployment in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was completed and began to move south, Chenguantun was recovered on the afternoon of the 23rd, and Tangguantun was recovered at 6:00 AM on the 24th. The Communist forces in that area appear to be fleeing west.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] On the Tianjin-Salt Highway, the National Army has firmly occupied Machang, Zhaozong Bridge, and Huihuo Bridge on both sides of the Jian River, cooperating with the advance of the National Army on the front.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] There was fierce fighting near Guye on the Beining Railway last night. The railway was damaged, and all the power lines east of Tangshan were destroyed, so the details are unknown. Five places between Yangcun and Beicang on the Beiping-Tianjin section were damaged last night, and traffic was restored before noon.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 24th] The northern and southern Daran areas on the outskirts of Baoding were attacked by Communist forces overnight. However, because the National Army's defenses were strong, they ultimately failed. At around 1:00 AM on the night of the 23rd, the Communist forces again gathered more than 1,000 people from the Qingyuan Brigade of the 79th Division and other units, and attacked Gouzhatou northwest of Baoding, launching a fierce attack with mortars and machine guns. They were repelled by the National Army before dawn and retreated along the original route.

### Dong Yanping and Shangguan Yunxiang Left Beiping Yesterday, Returning Separately to Shenyang and Tianjin

[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] For the military liaison and consultation matters between North China and the Northeast, Dong Yanping and Shangguan Yunxiang returned separately to Shenyang and Tianjin on the 24th. Dong Yanping said before leaving: The National Army will never give up the Northeast. The reinforcement troops from various routes are continuing to increase. All the major strongholds that have been lost can be gradually recovered.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, returned to Tianjin by special train at 5:40 PM on the 24th.

### The Border Between Mongolia and Xinjiang Has Been Demarcated, The Beitashan Incident Is Not a Border Dispute, A Certain Government Leader Declared to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] According to a certain responsible leader of the government here, in response to the outside world's misunderstanding that the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang was caused by a border dispute between Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, he sternly refuted it. The responsible person stated that China attaches importance to the will of the Outer Mongolian people based on the principle of national self-determination and recognizes its independent government, and has no reason to renege. However, Outer Mongolia was originally a special administrative region of our country, belonging to the Chinese territory. According to central regulations, local governments have no right to demarcate the boundaries of administrative units, except for the central government. And according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the border after its independence should be the original border. Therefore, in law, its border can only be based on what the Chinese government had previously determined (see the map of the Ministry of Interior). Therefore, the saying that the Beitashan incident originated from a border dispute is a distortion of the facts and is very obvious.

### The Report on the Inspection of Dalian and Lushun Will Be Announced Soon

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] The report submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Dalian and Lushun inspection team is expected to be announced soon, but the date is not yet determined.

### Four Committees of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association Held a Joint Meeting

After Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting this morning, he invited Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to report on military affairs. The chairman then invited Peng Zhaoxian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, to report on internal affairs. Peng explained the establishment of public opinion organs, election regulations, autonomy regulations, and the protection of human rights. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Vice Chairman Xu Fulin, to discuss proposals and pass the rules of procedure for the meeting. The government was also requested to strengthen local armed forces. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. At 9:00 PM in the evening, a slide show on constitutional government was shown in the National Assembly Hall to entertain the committee members.

### Leighton Stuart's Birthday

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] U.S. Ambassador to China, Leighton Stuart, joyfully celebrated his 71st birthday today. Envoys from various countries, our leaders, and people from all walks of life came to congratulate him. The ambassador's residence was decorated in an antique style. Although many of the ladies who came to congratulate him had a Western atmosphere, the huge "Search" character and the script of the Queen Mother of the West, as well as longevity peaches and birthday cakes, coupled with the burning red candles, were full of Eastern sentiment. The ambassador, wearing a white suit, greeted the guests with a very pleasant and kind expression. This situation was just like the East-West combined family when the ambassador was born on the banks of West Lake seventy years ago. Chairman Chiang and his wife held a birthday banquet for the ambassador at the residence at 8:00 PM. The alumni of Yenching University in Beijing held a celebration tea party at 4:00 PM. The ambassador received a fine ivory carving from President Zhang Qun and an ancient porcelain vase from Minister Zhang Lisheng today. These treasures are all the ambassador's favorite decorations.

### The Issue of Currency Reform is Currently Collecting Materials

Huang was originally the Commander of the Aid and Assistance Headquarters. At the end of last month, he was transferred with Guo Chan to become Vice Chief of Staff. Now he is transferred to Vice Minister of National Defense.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Flew to Nanjing

[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] Chiang Ching-kuo left Beiping and flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th.

### Sun Ke Talks About Sino-Japanese Relations, Advocating the Early Signing of a Peace Treaty With Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Vice President Sun Ke recently issued a statement saying: China should prepare to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, to ensure that Japan will never again become an aggressor and to help promote permanent peace and stability in the East. Regarding the future relationship between China and Japan, in my personal opinion, China should not blame Japan for its past and should not harbor revenge. It should cooperate with the United States, Britain, and other allies to help Japan restore its legitimate position in the international community. Asia's greatest crisis today is the Communist Party's attempt to undermine economic recovery. Japan should become one of the barriers to contain the expansion of red totalitarianism. This does not mean that Japan should not be punished for its past crimes, but rather that Japan should be given the opportunity to revive militarism. Instead, it should promote Japan to atone for its past mistakes and express its intention for international peace and cooperation through action. China should prepare to fully restore commercial relations with Japan, and if possible, it may be done before signing a peace treaty, because all countries need the goods that other countries can supply. However, we should not over-trust the current reform trends in Japan. The world should know that Japanese militarism has a long history of barbarism, so it must be carefully prevented and thoroughly eradicated. In short, General MacArthur has now fulfilled his excellent work of controlling Japan. His firm determination, eradicating Japanese militarism and ultra-nationalism, and influencing the Japanese people with Christian doctrines have set an example for all victorious nations.

### Regarding Trade Policy With Japan, We Should Focus on Exports, The Conclusion Obtained by Tang, Commercial Commissioner

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After Japan resumed private international trade on August 15 this year, China's trade policy with Japan, which urgently needs supplies, should focus on exports rather than imports. This is the opinion of Tang, the commercial commissioner of the Chinese delegation, and is welcomed by Japan and the Allied Headquarters. Japan is extremely short of raw materials, and China can supply to a considerable extent. A trade policy that focuses on exports can increase China's exports on the one hand, and accelerate Japan's industrial and economic recovery on the other hand. Economic progress in Japan can also reduce the cost of Allied occupation of Japan.

### Adjusting the Exchange Rate of Taiwan Currency, the Central Government Has Authorized Chairman Wei

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] It is rumored that the Provincial Government has reached an understanding with the central government and can freely adjust the exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender. Yan Jiagan, Director of the Finance Department, has indirectly confirmed this. It is said that many Taiwanese hope that the value of the Taiwan currency will be increased to isolate external financial fluctuations. The central government has indeed granted Chairman Wei greater authority over adjusting the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency.

### Pay Raises for Military Personnel Will Be Paid Retroactively From May

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Pay raises for military personnel were previously decided by the Executive Yuan, but have not yet been implemented. It is now learned that the pay raise method has been re-decided. Officers, regardless of general, colonel, or lieutenant rank, will receive a 40% increase across the board. Soldiers will receive at least double the increase. It will be officially announced and implemented in the short term, and will be paid retroactively from May of this year.

### Overseas Members of the Democratic Socialist Party Concerned About Internal Disputes, Telegraph Wu Xianzifu to Continue Mediation

[Our Report] Wu Xianzifu met with reporters yesterday and said: He recently received a telegram from New York stating that members of the Democratic Socialist Party in the Americas held an informal meeting in New York on the 19th and 20th of this month and decided to ask Wu to continue mediating the internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party, and declared four positions: (1) The previous Party Group Committee did not have a quorum and should be reopened. (2) The overseas delegates of 26 people should be recognized. (3) Sun Baogang and others' attack on the party chairman is not a major crime and should not be expelled, but the Reform Committee should also stop its activities. (4) After the two parties in the dispute restore their relationship, a general assembly of delegates will be convened. Wu also stated: This telegram will be sent to Mr. Zhang immediately. If Mr. Zhang agrees, mediation will begin.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Xu Fulin left Nanjing by night train on the 24th and will go to Shanghai on the 26th to preside over the establishment ceremony of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department of the Democratic Socialist Party. Xu is currently also serving as a legislator in the Guangdong Provincial Party Department. Xu will return to Nanjing before July 4th after finishing his business.

### The Sino-French Civil Aviation Agreement is Extended, The French Note Has Been Delivered, We Are Also Borrowing Money From Canada to Build Aviation

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] The French note regarding the extension of the Sino-French Civil Aviation Agreement to the end of this year has been delivered. It is expected to be submitted at the next political meeting and the exchange of notes will be approved. The key points are two: (1) The extension is for six months until the end of this year. (2) Previously, aircraft from both countries had to return to their place of origin after flying to their destination. Now, this restriction is lifted. French aircraft can fly to Japan, Hong Kong, or other places that do not belong to China after flying from Hanoi to Shanghai. Our aircraft can also fly to India, Europe, and other places after flying to Hanoi.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Civil Aviation Carrier An Guo is currently in negotiations with the Canadian government for a new loan, so that the Canadian government can provide us with materials to help us engage in aviation and transportation construction.

### Internal Plan to Formulate Sanctions to Prevent Fraud in Universal Suffrage

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] With the general election about to begin, all parties are paying close attention to election fraud and its sanctions. Based on investigations of provincial, municipal, and county councilor elections conducted over the years, the Ministry of the Interior has listed various possible malpractices and formulated numerous sanctioning measures. The main points are recorded as follows:

(A) Illegal Conduct by Election Organizers of Provincial, Municipal, and County Councilor Elections: The chief election authorities, local administrative officials, and local officials may, in order to manipulate public opinion or collude with candidates, fail to conduct elections in accordance with the law, in order to favor the election of a particular candidate. The situations are as follows: (1) Falsifying voter registration lists or election results. (2) Not conducting election affairs in accordance with legal procedures, such as: 1. Failing to announce the election date before the legal deadline; 2. Holding elections on illegal dates (such as holidays or Sundays); 3. Failing to hold simultaneous elections in all unit areas or groups when simultaneous elections are required; 4. Other situations.

Although situation (1) is rare, specific provisions should be established to clearly define its punishment. Regarding situation (2), when elections are not conducted in accordance with legal procedures, whether they should be deemed invalid or remain valid, or under what circumstances they should be considered valid and under what circumstances they should be considered invalid, should all be clearly stipulated, and how to punish those who do not conduct elections in accordance with legal procedures should also be specified.

(B) Ineligible Voters: There are several situations: (1) Citizens who do not belong to this area participating in the election voting in this area. (2) Persons without the qualifications of vocational group members participating in vocational group elections. (3) Impersonating others to vote. (4) A person has two or more voting rights, and according to regulations, should choose one to participate in voting but does not comply with the regulations and participates in two or more voting activities at the same time.

Regarding methods to prevent ineligible voters, a system of public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted. Those who impersonate others should be regarded as criminal behavior, and in addition to stipulating imprisonment and fines, their voting rights and eligibility to be elected should be suspended for several years. The punishment for those who incite or instruct them is the same.

(C) Ineligible Candidates: (1) Those without the right to be elected, (2) Those whose right to be elected has been suspended, (3) Those who have two or more ballot rights and are not allowed to participate in the competition simultaneously but violate the regulations.

Regarding the prevention of the above three situations, it seems that the methods for public inspection of voter registration lists should be consulted, allowing voters to raise objections to candidates within a certain number of days before the election.

(D) Using means of coercion or violence or other illegal methods to prevent voters from freely exercising their right to vote. The situations are as follows: (1) Kidnapping voters, (2) Intimidating voters, (3) Using force to coerce voters during voting, causing their voting rights to be exercised in a certain way, (4) Disrupting voting with fraud or force, making voting impossible. Regarding situation (1), in addition to referring to the provisions of the Criminal Law regarding crimes against freedom, those who obstruct freedom due to elections should have their voting rights and eligibility to be elected suspended for several years (severely punished). If a candidate or their instigator commits the above crime and is elected, their election should be invalid. Regarding situation (2), the following provisions should be made: 1. Temporarily suspend conscription for a certain period of time before and after the election; 2. Those who commit the crime in (2) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for several years and have their voting rights and eligibility to be elected suspended for several years. Regarding situations (3) and (4), the following provisions should be made: 1. Prohibit non-voters from entering the polling place; 2. Strictly prohibit carrying weapons into the polling place; 3. Suspend their voting rights and eligibility to be elected for several years; 4. Stop all campaign activities during voting.

(E) Bribing voters with alcohol, meat, gifts, loans, positions, or other benefits. To prevent this type of situation, the following provisions should be made: (1) Within a certain period of time before the election, candidates or others are strictly prohibited from holding banquets or entertaining voters for the candidate's campaign, or giving any gifts to voters. Violators will be fined. When a candidate does this or instructs others to do so, their candidate qualification will be revoked. (2) Make specific provisions in the Criminal Law.

### Formal Sino-American Negotiations on Wartime Debts; New Loans Under Discussion; Ambassador Gu Delivers Speech in Washington

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Negotiations between China and the United States on resolving wartime accounts of 2.1 billion US dollars officially began here today. The Chinese delegation, led by Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, and the US delegation, led by Assistant Secretary of State Thorpe, held what State Department officials called an "exploratory" meeting. A State Department spokesperson said that consultations would enter a "working stage" in a few days, and said: China's wartime accounts include 1.564698 billion US dollars of Lend-Lease materials transferred to China during and after the war, a 500 million US dollar loan in 1942, unsettled wartime surplus property (valued and included in the credit loan item), totaling 35 million US dollars, and other financial debts between the two countries. The aforementioned transaction of 35 million US dollars of surplus property includes the following items transferred to China: (1) a shipyard built by the US in Shanghai, (2) a large number of trucks piled up in Calcutta, India after the victory of the war against Japan (valued at 25 million US dollars), and (3) wartime surplus materials of the US Army in Western China. The above items were not resolved in the surplus sales agreement signed on August 30 last year. This bilateral negotiation will also re-evaluate the accounts of the 500 million US dollars of surplus materials under the 900 million US dollars worth of surplus materials sold to China last August. When the State Department announced last month that it would begin negotiations, it stated that the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement negotiated with China would reflect the "same generous resolution principles" of the agreements signed by the United States with other countries (especially Britain). Britain's Lend-Lease accounts, after deducting the US's reverse Lend-Lease accounts and other debts, totaled approximately 25 billion US dollars. The result of the settlement was that only about 25 cents per dollar had to be paid. The members of the Chinese delegation participating in the negotiations included Minister Gong Shouhua, and Wang Jingchun, head of the Chinese Purchasing Delegation in the United States. The members of the US delegation included Nyes, Director of the State Department's Finance and Development Policy Division, and Lin Huaide, Director of the China Department.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 23rd that China may obtain a large new loan from the United States for China's post-war reconstruction. This was a statement made by Ambassador Gu after meeting with Assistant Secretary of State Thorpe, and said: This new loan is still in the exploratory stage, and the amount of the loan has not been mentioned. This loan will be short-term, and the amount will be smaller than a one-time long-term loan. Gu hoped to obtain a large long-term loan, and he found that Thorpe was very sympathetic to this matter. The main part of Gu's meeting with Thorpe concerned the issue of China repaying the Lend-Lease Act loan. The main purpose of his visit to Thorpe was to make Thorpe understand China's situation.

[This Newspaper's Report] The US Foreign Liquidation Commission announced yesterday: According to the Sino-American Surplus Materials Agreement of August 30 last year, materials worth approximately 170 million US dollars had been transferred to China by the end of last month. These include trucks, road construction machines, clothing, food, and medicine, but aircraft, combat materials, ships, and naval equipment are not included in the transfer. The location of this batch of materials is partly in mainland China, and also in Guam, Okinawa, and various islands in the Pacific. When China and the United States established the agreement last fall, it was estimated that approximately 500 million US dollars worth of surplus materials would be transferred to China. After the agreement was signed, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Chinese Executive Yuan and the US Foreign Liquidation Commission began negotiations on how to fulfill the contract, and institutions were established and personnel were assigned at that time, and the transfer work began immediately. Six months later, the US transferred 30 million US dollars worth of materials. In March, April, and May of this year, another 13.6 million US dollars worth of materials were transferred, that is, 4.5 million US dollars worth of materials were transferred each month.

### Wowen Visits the Chairman and Returns to Shanghai by Car That Evening

At 10:00 AM, accompanied by Ling Qihan, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shen Changhuan, Secretary of the National Government, he paid respects to the Chairman and talked for about 15 minutes.

The photo shows Chairman Pan Gongzhan (right) shaking hands with the Indian representative Nehru (photo by this newspaper).

### Pan Gongzhan Expresses Opinions on the Mission of the Far East Economic Commission; Economy and Politics Should Be Discussed Together

[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, National Federation of Commercial Associations, Municipal Industrial Association, Banking Association, Money Industry Association, Shipping Industry Association, Importers and Exporters Association, Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, China Industrial and Commercial Association, National Diplomacy Association, and China International Trade Association, etc., held a cocktail reception at the International Hotel on the 14th floor from 6:00 to 8:00 PM yesterday to welcome the representatives from various countries who came to Shanghai to attend the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. It was hosted by more than a dozen people, including Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Xu Jiguang, Wu Yunchu, Tang Xinghai, Li Daonan, and Li Shuxiong. About 300 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Li Shizeng, and representatives from various countries, leaders from all walks of life, and other guests.

The reporter took the opportunity to ask Chairman Pan for his opinion on the meeting. Chairman Pan said: This is the first international conference held in the city since the Second World War. During the war, the losses suffered by Asia and the Far East were no less severe than those in Europe or other parts of the world, and China was the most deeply and longest ravaged by the enemy. Shanghai was the first to be destroyed at the beginning of the Far East War. The remnants of the war in Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong are still vivid. Speaking of the mission of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Its ultimate goal is to help the economic reconstruction of Asian and Far Eastern countries and create a higher level of economic activity. It is firmly believed that the representatives of various countries will definitely realize the importance of their mission and the urgency of people's expectations. In today's world where politics and economy are inseparable, political stability often depends on the solution of economic problems, and economic stability also depends on political enlightenment and progress. We sincerely hope that the representatives of various countries with far-sightedness will not be satisfied with solving problems within the scope of the economy, but will also do their best to promote genuine political cooperation among all ethnic groups in the world, without any suspicion of each other, and then can seek stability in people's lives from economic recovery. As far as the Far East is concerned, Japan was originally a highly industrialized country, and its cheap goods could even extend to Europe and the United States. However, during the war, Japan's industrial equipment was not severely damaged. If the Allies do not impose reasonable controls on Japan, or even be deceived by Japan's docile disguise, and are too trusting, making the control work lax, it will make the economic recovery of other countries in Asia and the Far East difficult, or even cause the world's people to suffer from war again. Therefore, we sincerely hope that sufficient and deserved compensation will be obtained from Japan as soon as possible and preferentially to help China's economic recovery. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent all activities that can promote the resurgence of Japan's economic aggression, so that the holding of this meeting will not be in vain.

[Another Report] The Philippine delegation held a dance party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel at 9:00 PM yesterday, inviting other delegations to participate and have fun together.

### Our Consul General in Saigon Warns the Viet Minh Authorities Not to Continue Destroying Overseas Chinese Property

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 24th] Chinese Consul General in Saigon Yin issued a statement today warning the Viet Minh authorities not to continue destroying overseas Chinese property, otherwise the Chinese government will reconsider its current neutral attitude. The statement said: The French-Vietnamese conflict has caused heavy losses to overseas Chinese in Vietnam. China has protested to the French authorities several times. It is regrettable that Viet Minh people have taken various destructive actions against overseas Chinese enterprises. It is incomprehensible that Annam people repay China's friendship with this attitude, as overseas Chinese property is the result of hard work. China maintains a friendly neutrality in the current conflict. I hope that the Viet Minh authorities will find a way to stop the destruction of overseas Chinese property, otherwise our government will be forced to reconsider its attitude.

### Luo Zhuoying Inspects Disaster Areas by Plane; Guangdong Actively Raises Funds for Disaster Relief; Zhang Fakui Appeals to Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Chairman Luo today took the main plane of the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade to inspect the flood-stricken areas, accompanied by a Central News Agency reporter. The special plane took off at 9:50 am, and the inspection area included the four rivers of Dong, Xi, Bei, and Han, covering more than ten counties. First, it inspected along the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers, landing in Shantou at 12:40 pm. At the Liaison Office, it convened a symposium of county magistrates from various Hanjiang counties, where the county magistrates reported on the disaster situation and urgent relief needs. At 3:40 pm, it took off again, flying over the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers for a low-altitude inspection, which ended at 6:37 pm. Today's inspection of the disaster areas did not cover the southern route and the areas above Qingyuan on the Beijiang River. Overall, the disaster situation is more serious in the Xijiang River and lighter in the Hanjiang River. Although the disaster has gradually subsided in recent days, most of the rice fields are still submerged in floodwaters, and even those that have emerged from the water have withered. The early rice harvest is feared to be hopeless. Because their houses have been flooded, many disaster victims are gathering on high ground, urgently awaiting relief.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] As the flood situation in Guangdong Province worsens, people from all walks of life in the provincial capital are doing everything possible to raise funds and distribute them to the disaster areas for relief. Zhang Fakui, Director of the Executive Headquarters, made a special broadcast to overseas Chinese, appealing for assistance to the flood-stricken compatriots. Officers and soldiers of the Executive Headquarters are voluntarily cutting back on one meal and donating one day's earnings, and workers throughout the city have also decided to donate one day's labor earnings to benefit the disaster-stricken people. Five theaters here are putting on a charity performance tonight to raise funds, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is also dispatching teams to raise funds. Furthermore, Hong Kong's concern for the disaster-stricken compatriots is no less than that here. The relief funds raised have reached HK$250,000 to date. Yesterday, representatives were sent here to discuss relief distribution methods and to establish a disaster relief liaison office here.

### Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Reports that the Flood Situation is Slightly Stable

More Rains in Store, Floodwaters Will Follow

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Yang Huarui, Director of the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, recently received reporters and reported that the flood situation in the four rivers of Guangdong Province has been slightly stable to date. Due to the impact of heavy rains, this year's flood season arrived a month early. Compared with historical records, the water level of the Dongjiang River exceeded half a meter, the Beijiang River was only 1.2 meters short, the Xijiang River was 0.97 meters short, and the Hanjiang River was also higher than in previous years, resulting in the collapse of dozens of embankments in various places. It is estimated that the loss of submerged rice fields amounts to 1.05 million mu, or 1.5 million dan, with a market value of 300 billion yuan. The loss of other property is even more difficult to estimate. The Water Conservancy Bureau has now dispatched 120 engineering personnel to the four rivers to step up the rescue of embankments and assist in building autumn dams after the flood recedes to protect the late rice crop. The occurrence of this flood seems to be overdue from the major flood of 30 years ago. There are still more than 90 days until the major flood season, and floodwaters will inevitably follow. Therefore, in addition to the Bureau's full assistance, local officials and people must also work together to inspect and rescue the embankment. Otherwise, the disaster will be even more difficult to predict. Furthermore, the weather here has cleared up in recent days, and the floodwaters that have entered the urban area have receded by two or three feet. Traffic outside the city has also gradually resumed. The Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou lines have been opened to traffic. It is hoped that Guangzhou will be spared from the flood.

### Xiaoshan's Toupeng Township is About to Sink; Shen Honglie Goes to Inspect

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] Recently, the tides have been strong, and the collapse of the Nansha embankment in Xiaoshan is intensifying. Toupeng Township is about to sink. All parties are urgently calling for rescue. The Embankment Works Bureau, due to the local government's inability to bear the expenses, has allocated flour for wages and dispatched personnel to design rescue measures, but it has been unable to start construction. Chairman Shen, in order to understand the actual situation of the embankment collapse, made a special trip to Nansha today for inspection. He expressed great concern for the local residents and offered consolation. Also: Chairman Shen, in order to understand the water conservancy projects in the counties under Lake Tai, will personally inspect them tomorrow for a period of one week.

### Far East Military Tribunal Adjourns; Mei Ru'ao and Others Return Home Today

### Wei Daoming Reports on Administration at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, and Answers Questions on the Popular Election of County and City Mayors

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Wei Daoming attended the Taiwan Provincial Assembly this morning and stated in his general administrative report: "The 'February 28th' incident was truly a heartbreaking event. I hope that the unfinished matters of this case will be concluded as soon as possible. In addition to allowing self-renewal for those who blindly followed, I am also separately considering the names of the 30 principal offenders transferred by the previous administration. Those with lighter circumstances will also be given the opportunity for self-renewal. In fact, two of them have already been granted self-renewal, and many others will also be granted self-renewal. Those with more serious circumstances will still be handed over to the court for handling. I believe that the court will also follow the central government's policy of leniency and conduct lenient trials." Councilor Han Yuquan raised an oral inquiry stating: "Chief Executive Chen once promised that popular elections for county and city mayors would be implemented on July 1st. Minister Bai Chongxi also mentioned this matter. Has the Provincial Government made preparations? Furthermore, the qualifications for county and city mayoral candidates stipulated by the central government are not very applicable to the special circumstances of the province. How will Chairman Wei handle this matter?" Wei replied: "If the central government promulgates the law for popular elections of county and city mayors in the future, it will be implemented immediately. The issue of qualifications for county and city mayoral candidates is indeed very important. The situation in Taiwan Province is slightly different. I will do my best to make suggestions to the central government. At the same time, I hope that your council will carefully discuss this issue and seek a concrete solution, formulating a standard suitable for the circumstances of Taiwan Province to be submitted to the central government as a suggestion."

Editorial

### Understand China! Recognize the Far East! ... Welcome to the Visit of American Media Magnates to China

Howard, an American media magnate, and Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, along with a group of 21 people, flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Manila on a Pan American Airlines Constellation "America Clipper" for a round-the-world flight. They immediately switched to a China National Aviation Corporation plane to fly to our national capital to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang and attend a banquet hosted by President Zhang. They then flew back to Shanghai last night. After staying for a day or two, they will take the original plane tomorrow morning to cross the Pacific Ocean and return home. At a time when the international community is full of suspicion and the world is in danger of splitting, the 21 American media magnates are making a bold move to travel around the world, which will not only make a significant contribution to promoting international understanding and thus creating world peace, but also have profound significance for the United States to understand China and recognize the Far East. In addition to expressing our sincere welcome, we also have unlimited hopes for the visit of Mr. Howard and his colleagues, at least hoping that they can bring back to the United States the views of the Chinese people on the world, especially on the United States, report to the whole country, so that the American people can fully understand China and truly recognize the Far East, and then consider the China policy that they should adopt.

First, the basic attitude of the Chinese people towards the post-war world, in a word, is to hope that there can be genuine understanding among nations, to seek cooperation from understanding, and to seek world peace from international cooperation. This basic attitude is completely in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Chinese representatives attend any international conference, and this basic attitude is the starting point. They have more confidence in the ideals sought by the United Nations organization. It is certainly necessary to feel that China is in a position of being between the two major powers of the world if you look at China's foreign policy with colored glasses. But if we can speak fairly, China's foreign policy can be said to be very balanced. In addition to faithfully fulfilling its international treaty obligations, it also strives to live in peace with all friendly nations and seek the progress and happiness of mankind through international cooperation. Even with regard to the United States and the Soviet Union, the position adopted by our country is the same for all, without any distinction between "friend," "enemy," "kin," or "distant." Because China is inherently insufficient and has been disoriented. Before the war, China was invaded by the political, economic and cultural aspects of various imperialist countries, and had already fallen into a semi-colonial position. Although it is said that China is an agricultural country based on agriculture, the farmers across the country adhere to the old ways and stick to the old ways, resulting in the bankruptcy of the countryside. Taking only food as an example, every year they still have to rely on foreign countries to import foreign rice and flour. As for industry and commerce, they are in a slump and are completely an industrially backward country. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the danger of the country was increasingly felt. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the whole country finally won the final victory in the military under the common belief of "victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction." But economically, the whole country suffered heavy damage after eight years of destruction, and was almost full of devastation. Naturally, it needs to recuperate in the post-war period so that it can restore its vitality and then embark on the road of national construction and revitalization. It not only needs international peace, but also needs the economic and material assistance of the great powers. Only under these conditions can China bury itself in national construction to build a peaceful, unified, democratic and powerful country. Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese government did not hesitate to make major sacrifices and signed a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union. Even at present, the Chinese government's attitude towards the Soviet Union is still very cautious and careful, and it still hopes that the Soviet Union can abide by the spirit of the Sino-Soviet alliance treaty. In recent weeks, the relationship between China and the Soviet Union has undergone new brewing due to the invasion of Outer Mongolia into Xinjiang and the evolution of the Northeast War into an international problem, and the situation in the Far East has suddenly become tense. We must tell Mr. Howard and his colleagues that the evolution of this situation should be entirely the responsibility of the Soviet Union, as long as the Soviet Union can abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, not only can all previous problems be easily solved, but it is not impossible for China and the Soviet Union to maintain a friendly and cooperative relationship.

Second, with regard to the friendship between China and the United States, we first hope that Mr. Howard and his colleagues will have more time in the future to observe the Chinese people's views on the United States at leisure and on the spot, so as to fully understand China and truly recognize the Far East. We always feel that American "China experts" are inevitably superficial in their understanding of China, and they often cannot touch the core of any problem, so the conclusions they draw are inevitably frivolous. For example, the Shanghai English-language "Da Mei Evening News" once published an editorial "Who Gave Up Whom?" which misunderstood China's desire for American aid as purely motivated by selfishness. Also, the United Press reporter Rundall also reported that the reason why the US Export-Import Bank refused to release the $500 million loan that had been saved for a long time was that China had abused US loans in the past and that China's current policies discriminate against American interests in China. These two points may seem reasonable to the American government and the public, but in our opinion, they are unnecessary distortions of the facts. China urgently needs American economic assistance, which is formed by the objective situation of the world's general situation. To be honest, China would never want to borrow money from the United States unless it was necessary. After the loan is obtained, it will not be used arbitrarily. As for the Chinese government's discrimination against American interests in China, it is even more unnecessary to explain. Hasn't the Sino-American Commercial Treaty already been signed? Isn't the spirit of the Commercial Treaty completely based on equality and mutual benefit? But China is an industrially and commercially backward country, and in fact, it is China that suffers if it is equal and mutually beneficial with the United States. Moreover, when the US Export-Import Bank refuses to release the $500 million loan that has been saved for a long time, China lacks US dollars and the United States refuses to help. How can it be mutually beneficial with the United States? It is an inevitable and reasonable measure for the Chinese government to implement import and export controls.

In short, "Who Gave Up Whom?" There is no need to argue any further. We hope that Mr. Howard and his colleagues, the magnates of the news media of the country of the os, can bring the feelings and thoughts of our people back to their country and tell the government and the public that we should take the above two points as the basis for re-examining our China policy. The American Far East Business Conference advocates studying the current situation in China. If it can come to China for on-the-spot investigation, we will sincerely welcome it. The friendship between China and the United States has always been friendly. After eight years of blood, it has become closer and has become a friendship in adversity. The recent shadow between China and the United States will not be difficult to disappear. However, from the standpoint of our colleagues, we still hope that American media magnates can use newspapers as a weapon to promote international relations. The lessons of the two world wars make us deeply understand that the outbreak of international wars is often caused by some misunderstandings. We must be careful to prevent problems before they arise. We hope that the news media of China and the United States, in order to promote international understanding and cooperation and to eliminate the causes of war, should make special efforts in this regard.

### US Senate Overturns Presidential Veto; Labor-Management Bill Becomes Law; Union Activities Will Be Restricted in the Future; Workers Across the Country Plan to Launch a General Strike to Protest

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The labor-management bill restricting union activities, which was vetoed by President Truman, was passed by the Senate today with 68 votes against 25, maintaining the original bill. The House of Representatives had already resolved to overturn the President's veto last week, so the bill automatically became a law. The Senate vote in favor of maintaining the original bill was six votes more than the necessary two-thirds majority. Before the vote, the President sent a special letter to Democratic leader Barkley, saying that the bill was dangerous legislation and asking Democratic senators to maintain his veto. The law authorizes the government to order a halt to national emergency strikes for at least 80 days and amends certain provisions of the National Labor Relations Act to restrict union activities. Union leaders called the new bill a slave law, and national unions have sent telegrams to members of Congress, asking them to uphold the President's veto. The Republican viewpoint was summarized by Senator Taft, who said that the Republican Party was entrusted to propose this legislation when it was elected last November to adjust the balance between employers and unions. If the President could consider the will of the people and not add his personal opinion, he would be doing a service to the people. Observers believe that the passage of this new bill will lead labor-management relations into a new era, and its impact will be like the Wagner Act passed during the heyday of the New Deal. It is expected that in the first stage, labor-management disputes and lawsuits will inevitably occur to test the effectiveness of this new law, just like the situation after the Wagner Act was first passed. Many of the provisions of the new law must be interpreted and decided by the Supreme Court, especially regarding union security, the creation of damage, the responsibility of unions for strikes and violations of contracts, and the "unfair" measures taken by unions, which will inevitably be clarified by the court.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Taft-Hartley union control bill has already elicited a rapid reaction from labor, which will call for a general strike to protest. Union leaders are indignant that the President's veto was easily overturned by both houses of Congress and declared that they would retaliate by opposing legislators who supported the bill in the voting.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] After the US Senate overturned President Truman's veto of the labor-management bill, the response in the United States was as follows: (1) Coal miners, who were scheduled to start a vacation before the contract signed with the government expires at midnight on Friday, have already stopped early. Coal mines in Alabama, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia have all stopped. According to the latest news, more than 23,000 miners have stopped working. (2) The San Francisco Labor Organization Congress has requested that its chairman, Moorey, announce a 24-hour strike to oppose the labor law. The United Steelworkers Union of 30,000 members in the Southeastern United States expects that the labor law will cause a general strike of 90 percent of organized workers. (3) Green, the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, announced that the Federation of Labor will immediately launch a campaign to abolish the law and predicted that those who supported the bill will be defeated in the 1948 election. (4) The opinions of the vice presidents of the American News Association are quite inconsistent, with some believing that it will strengthen the party's strength in 1948, and others believing that it will weaken it. (5) Wallace's American Progressive Citizens Society program stated that Truman's failure to implement his veto was the most tragic failure to realize the late President Roosevelt's plan. (6) Keyes, the chairman of the Detroitet Foremen's Association, predicted that the court would test the provisions of the new law, that is, deprive foremen of the right to negotiate. (7) Republican spokesmen warned the administration to prevent mishandling, which would lead to labor's sabotage of the law. At the same time, Van Arkel, the General Counsel of the National Labor Board, due to the feasibility of the implementation of the law, raised serious questions and resigned. (8) Shirreff, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, said that the bill is a cornerstone in American industrial history and will help industrial peace.

### Although the Veto of the Labor-Management Bill Was Overturned, Truman's Prestige Increased Instead; It is Difficult to Say What Impact It Will Have on the Next Competition

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Regarding President Truman's veto of the labor bill proposed by Republican members Taft and Hartley, it has been reported by well-informed sources that although the President's veto has been overturned, his personal prestige has increased greatly as a result. Although President Du Jingmen's views are agreed by the general public, his name has been raised because of his position, but this does not necessarily have any benefit for the Democratic Party when it runs for president in 1948. A considerable number of Democratic members of Congress who take the same line as Republican members and oppose the government, and who take a special position on labor issues, believe that the new labor bill strictly restricts union activities and will prohibit the closed shop system, which is also included, and is really undesirable.

### Moscow Radio Criticizes US Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] Moscow Radio issued a broadcast tonight, severely criticizing US foreign policy, believing that its purpose is to control the world with "meager monetary gifts." The commentator did not directly mention Marshall's economic aid plan for Europe, only stating that the purpose of the new US policy, Trumanism, is only to express US imperialism, to impose economic control on countries around the world, and to promote world peace and security in the name of economic relief. In fact, American imperialists want to establish and consolidate their new political and economic power.

### British Cabinet Officials Meet with Clayton to Discuss the Marshall Plan

### Soviet Advisory Group Arrives in Paris by Plane

[United Press Paris 24th] The advisory group assisting Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in attending the Paris three-way foreign ministers' meeting arrived here today in two planes. Rumors circulated here that Molotov himself had also arrived, but the Soviet Embassy has denied this.

### Expanding the Three-Way Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain Plans to Invite Relevant Countries to Participate, Britain and France Welcome the Soviet Union's Acceptance of the Invitation

[Central News Agency London 24th] Foreign Ministry officials stated today that Bevin is scheduled to leave Britain for France on the afternoon of the 26th to attend the British, French, and Soviet negotiations on the Marshall Plan. The negotiations will begin on the 27th.

[Agence France-Presse London 23rd] Regarding the upcoming meeting in Paris of the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to discuss the plan for economic aid to Europe proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, sources here said that Britain may expand the three-way foreign ministers' meeting and invite all relevant countries to participate. When determining the needs of Europe, Britain will seek a common solution for all related countries, rather than simply listing the individual needs of European countries. Britain will also ask all relevant countries to jointly provide the U.S. government with a final response. This move can prevent the Soviet Union from proposing excessively large needs that are disproportionate to the needs of other countries.

[Reuters London 23rd] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that the Soviet government has accepted the British and French proposal to hold a three-way meeting to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, and the British government has also agreed to the Soviet suggestion to hold this meeting in Paris on June 27th. Bevin expressed confidence that the Soviet proposal would also be accepted by the French government, and said: "I welcome this prompt reply, which requires no explanation. The meeting will begin as scheduled in Paris this Friday, and I am confident that it will achieve good results." Bevin then read out the full text of the Soviet government's reply. Former Foreign Secretary Eden, Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, wished the meeting rapid and definite progress. Bevin also said: He will go to Paris on Friday to immediately begin this work.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 23rd] French Foreign Minister Bidault announced in the National Assembly today that the Soviet government has accepted the invitation of the British and French governments to participate in the three-way foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the plan for economic aid to Europe proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is expected to arrive in Paris from Moscow on Friday, which was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the entire assembly. The Speaker of the National Assembly, leader of the Radical Party, expressed satisfaction with this news and said: The foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France are scheduled to meet in Paris on the 27th of this month, and people express a friendly welcome to them and congratulate the meeting on its success.

### Regarding Atomic Energy Control, Stassen Expresses His Views, the United States Should Directly Negotiate with Stalin

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 24th - Stassen, a Republican presidential candidate in 1948, published an article in "Ladies' Home Journal," advocating that the United States send a delegation to directly negotiate with Stalin on the issue of atomic energy control. It is said that after his recent meeting with Stalin, he firmly believes that such a meeting would be extremely helpful. The delegation members should include Democratic and Republican senators and scientific leaders from the Atomic Energy Commission, and the meeting counterpart should be Stalin, the Soviet Politburo, and Soviet scientists.

### Truman Will Request Congress to Convene a Special Session This Autumn to Review the Progress of the Marshall Plan

[Agence France-Presse Washington 23rd] Informed sources here said that President Truman may request Congress to convene a special session in the fall to review the development of the Marshall Plan. Everyone has become more confident in this view, given that President Truman has appointed three committees to prepare for the European economic recovery plan. Diplomatic sources also believe that this measure by the President proves that the government has the desire to fully implement the Marshall Plan, pending a basic agreement from European countries. It is reported that of the three committees to be established by the U.S. government, one will be headed by Secretary of Commerce Harriman, responsible for determining the scope of U.S. foreign aid, and the method must be wise and safe. The second will be chaired by Secretary of the Interior Krug, studying the extent to which American resources can meet European needs. The third will be chaired by Truman's chief economic advisor Nourse, studying the consequences and reactions that the implementation of this plan will cause to the national economy.

### MacArthur Approves Japanese Antarctic Whaling, Britain, Australia, and Norway Protest to the United States, U.S. State Department Expresses Inability to Help

[United Press Washington 23rd] The State Department confirmed on the 23rd that it had received a British cable protesting the Japanese whaling for the second time, but regretted being unable to help. The British protest also stated that Britain believes MacArthur's actions were unilateral.

[Reuters Washington 23rd] Australian officials here revealed that they have lodged a serious protest with the State Department and the Far East Commission of the Eleven-Nation Organization against MacArthur's permission for Japanese whaling fleets to go to Antarctica for whaling.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 24th] One thousand fishermen from the North Sea met here today and passed a resolution requesting permission to fish in the North Pacific Ocean near the Soviet-occupied Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island. This petition will continue until the goal is achieved.

The Osaka area has always been a concentration of the Japanese shipping industry. Currently, Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, and Yamashita Kisen companies are actively preparing to resume operations.

### The United States Will Reinstate Controls on Oil Exports Starting Next Month

[Agence France-Presse Washington 24th] The Department of Commerce announced last night that the U.S. government has decided to reinstate controls on oil products from the end of this month due to reduced inventories.

[United Press Washington 23rd] The U.S. government today reinstated wartime regulations on gasoline exports. This move was taken because members of Congress criticized the U.S. for shipping gasoline to the Soviet Union. This control does not completely stop gasoline from being shipped to the Soviet Union, but it first requires the Department of Commerce to consider and obtain a gasoline export license before it can be shipped. This measure will take effect on June 30th, 24 hours before the expiration of the Emergency Export Control Act.

[United Press Washington 24th] Ohio Republican Chairman Weichel announced today that the House Merchant Marine Committee received a report that the Soviet oil tankers shipping oil back to the country from the United States were built several years ago specifically for this purpose. One of them loaded 123,000 barrels of gasoline and 12,000 barrels of other oils two weeks ago and set sail from California. Two others set sail at the beginning of this month, carrying 115,000 barrels of oil, and three others are loading cargo in California ports and can leave port before the oil export controls are reinstated at the end of this month.

### The French Government Overcomes Difficulties, the Fiscal Reform Bill is Passed by Congress, Thousands of People Demonstrate Outside the Meeting Place

[Agence France-Presse Paris 24th] The French National Assembly today passed the emergency fiscal reform measures proposed by Finance Minister Schuman, with 320 votes in favor, 241 votes against, and 59 abstentions. The bill stipulates increased tax revenue to make up for the budget deficit. The Congressional Finance Committee first passed it at the second reading yesterday afternoon. It was initially rejected at the first reading last Saturday, but the decision was changed due to the government's urgent appeal.

[Reuters Paris 23rd] The National Assembly began today a two-day debate on a financial plan that could affect the fate of the cabinet. Prior to that, the Finance Committee of the National Assembly had overturned its previous decision and adopted the bill aimed at saving the country's fiscal crisis. While the Finance Committee was discussing, many people gathered outside to protest the financial plan. The police had been ordered to be on alert in advance, and although armored vehicles and tear gas equipment were deployed, they were not used. The demonstrators were well-behaved and no incidents occurred. Under the scorching sun, the crowd shouted "Hang Schuman (the Finance Minister who proposed the plan), the police are on our side!" The crowd gathered at various points near the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the National Assembly. The police estimated that there were 4,000 people. The demonstrators did not attempt to break into the parliament and soon dispersed.

### Brown Sternly Rebukes Stubborn Korean Elements, More Than 500 Groups Agree to Participate in Negotiations

[New Asia News Agency Seoul 24th] U.S. Representative Major General Brown issued a special statement today through the Public Information Department, stating that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is proceeding with its work according to plan, but at this juncture, disturbances by a portion of irresponsible Koreans have hindered the work of the Joint Commission. When the U.S. and the Soviet Union are doing their best for Korea, such unfortunate events have occurred, which proves that Koreans lack the ability to govern themselves. These youths who participate in demonstrations and act in a disorderly manner fully show that they only care about their personal interests and do not start from the welfare of the public. Up to now, more than 500 groups have decided to participate in the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission and jointly discuss the establishment of a Korean provisional government. This still represents the majority of the Korean people. As for the demonstrators and rioters, they can only represent an extremely small number of stubborn Koreans.

### The Soviet Union Agrees to Discuss the Marshall Plan, Various Reactions, Some Optimistic, Some Skeptical

[Reuters London 23rd] Diplomatic observers here have varying reactions to the Soviet Union's unconditional acceptance of the British and French invitation to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. Some are optimistic, while others are skeptical. Everything depends on whether the Soviet Union will actively participate in the common design of Europe and prevent the collapse of the European economy in a timely manner, or whether its acceptance is only a prelude to adopting a delaying strategy in the three-way negotiations. This answer can only be obtained after the three foreign ministers start meeting, but it is expected that Bevin and Bidault will urge Molotov to make a quick decision on this key point. The Soviet Union's future proposals deserve close attention. It is reported that the Soviet Union's attitude is indeed different from the opinions previously published by Pravda, or its acceptance is only to avoid being blamed for resisting the Western countries' attempt to revive Europe.

Observers' speculation is mostly focused on the conditions that Molotov will put forward when he meets Bevin and Bidault on Friday. Judging from the Soviet Union's note announcing its acceptance of the British and French invitation, Molotov will probably first ask to know the content of the recent talks between Bevin and Ramadier and Bidault in Paris. However, in fact, that meeting was purely exploratory in nature, and most of it involved the details of how Britain and France would contact the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is expected that Britain and France will not be able to provide the Soviet Union with more information on that request. Molotov's next step will be to announce his views on reviving the European economy based on the principles of American aid and European self-help. London expects that Molotov will definitely declare that the primary condition for the Soviet Union to participate in the European economic design is that this design must be purely economic in nature and must not be accompanied by any political conditions. It is thought that Britain and France will not oppose this request, because Britain has always advocated that political issues should not be involved when dealing with the aftermath of the world economy, and France's policy is to maintain a strict balance between American and Soviet viewpoints. Furthermore, now that the Soviet Union has expressed its acceptance, it is expected that Eastern European countries will soon also react to the Marshall Plan. People here are very interested in the fact that Polish communist newspapers are still fiercely criticizing the Marshall Plan, but it is expected that such attitudes will soon suddenly change, like the Soviet Union's recent actions.

[United Press Paris 23rd] People here tonight speculate that the three-way foreign ministers' meeting on the 27th will probably become a "showdown" scene to determine whether the Soviet Union and the Western European group can ultimately cooperate to implement European economic policies, or whether they will be divided into two opposing groups. French newspapers also believe that the Paris meeting will have "decisive" significance.

[United Press Moscow 23rd] Observers here said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's happy acceptance of the invitation from Britain and France to discuss the Marshall Plan, and his proposal to hold a three-way foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, has removed a major obstacle to the progress of the meeting. Molotov's willingness to personally go to Paris, rather than suggesting that it be held in Eastern Europe near Moscow, is also a symbol of optimism, which shows that the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate in discussing Marshall's proposal. The point in Molotov's reply that the Soviet government still does not know the exact content of the Marshall Plan and the facts of the British and French Paris meeting can also be remedied before Molotov sets off this week. It is generally expected that the British and French embassies here will provide Molotov with all the information. Although the U.S. embassy here is not involved in this matter today, it is also expected that it will inform Molotov of the detailed meaning of the plan based on Marshall's speech at Harvard University. The general feeling here is that the success of the Paris meeting depends on the participating countries reaching an agreement quickly. Molotov is expected to have full authority to make major decisions on this trip. Foreign observers believe that after the Soviet Union accepted it, it has taken the initiative to potentially break the U.S. diplomatic advantage in Europe. After the Soviet Union cooperates to formulate an acceptable recovery plan, it will cause a problem for the United States, that is, whether to provide economic assistance to Eastern European countries in the same way as it treats Western European countries. If the U.S. Congress does not allocate funds after this plan is formulated, it will cause Europe to turn to the East, or at least the Eastern European countries will develop a dislike for the United States.

[Agence France-Presse Washington 23rd] Although officials here expressed satisfaction with the Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to hold a three-way meeting to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, they adopted a reserved attitude towards the outcome of the meeting. It is said that the Soviet Union has stated that the U.S. production industry has increased during the war, which is actually accusing the U.S. of getting rich during the war. In addition, the Soviet Union has also stated that the primary task of Europe is to restore the national economies of various countries. U.S. observers believe that this argument is difficult to explain, because Marshall's plan for aid to Europe refers to the revitalization of the entire European economy. U.S. government officials have strongly stated that the U.S. government welcomes any constructive measures taken by European countries to implement the Marshall Plan.

### Arrival of the Pan American Special Plane in Shanghai; American Journalist Group Transfers to Two Planes to Fly to Beijing; Chairman Receives Them at His Residence; The Plane Flies Back the Same Evening to Attend a Cocktail Reception and Dinner; Reception for Shanghai Journalists Today, Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow Morning

[Our Own Correspondent] A party of twenty-two people, including Mr. Howard, a leading figure in the American newspaper industry (in addition to the twenty-one names listed yesterday, there is also Mr. Argus, an employee of Pan American Airways), arrived in this city at 1:28 p.m. yesterday on the Pan American Airways "American Clipper" flying boat, which is circumnavigating the globe. It landed on the newly constructed cement runway at the Lunghua Airport. Also on board was the eldest daughter of Soong Tzu-wen. Among the Shanghai officials who went to welcome them were Mayor Wu, American Consul Davis, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Liu Jingyi, and dozens of other Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Mr. and Mrs. Soong Tzu-wen arrived just as the plane was landing to greet their beloved daughter.

The "American Clipper" is a Constellation-type four-engine giant aircraft, silver in color with wing-shaped blue markings painted on the head and tail (see yesterday's edition of this newspaper). The American and Chinese flags were prominently displayed on the nose of the plane. Upon landing, Mr. Trippe, President of Pan American Airways, appeared first, followed by Mr. Howard and others. Mr. Howard was wearing a yellowish-brown khaki suit and a bow tie. Mrs. Reid, owner of the New York Herald Tribune, was wearing a black casual dress. Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, with his white hair, looked cheerful, and everyone looked happy and energetic. Mayor Wu and other welcomers stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings.

Mayor Lapham of San Francisco and Mayor Wu are old friends and were particularly cordial. He said to Mayor Wu: "How have you been, sir? How are the people of Shanghai? The people of San Francisco send their regards to the people of Shanghai." Mayor Wu said, "Everything is fine. I also represent the people of Shanghai in extending greetings to the people of San Francisco." Mr. and Mrs. Soong Tzu-wen's daughter is returning to China for a vacation. Mr. and Mrs. Soong showed their daughter great affection and presented her with a bouquet of red roses.

At the invitation of Chairman Chiang, all the distinguished guests rested briefly after disembarking and immediately transferred to two CNAC passenger planes, XTT91 and 92, and took off at 1:55 p.m. to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang.

Chairman Chiang Answers Questions on the Current Military Situation

This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch reports: Mr. Howard and his party arrived in Beijing at 3:30 p.m. on two CNAC special planes. Director-General of the Government Information Office Dong Xian Guang welcomed them at the airport on behalf of Chairman Chiang. Mr. Howard and others then went by car to visit Premier Zhang Qun at the Executive Yuan for a brief conversation. Premier Zhang had originally prepared a luncheon, but it was canceled because Mr. Howard and others arrived in Beijing after lunchtime. They then went to Ambassador Stuart's residence to celebrate his birthday, and then met with Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang received the American journalist delegation at their residence on Huangpu Road and answered questions raised by the reporters on international and domestic situations, talking for about twenty minutes.

Madame Chiang, carrying a small black Tibetan sleeve dog, sat between Mrs. Reid of the New York Herald Tribune and Mrs. Howard of the Houston Post, and also expressed many opinions. After the meeting, Mr. Howard and others returned to Shanghai at 5:20 p.m. from Ming Palace Airport on the original plane.

Cocktail Reception for Guests

At around 6:00 p.m., the original plane returned to Shanghai from Beijing. Citibank, Standard Oil, and other companies held a cocktail reception at the Central Bank Club to entertain the guests. Foreign diplomats in Shanghai and Mrs. Reid, owner of the New York Herald Tribune, expressed great pleasure with this trip, and said that when they visited Chairman and Madame Chiang in Beijing in the afternoon, the Chairman held a press conference and made very important statements on the current situation, but it could not be published. Mrs. Reid refused to comment on the situation in China; regarding the Marshall Plan, she said that it would be limited to Europe for the time being, and although Korea was also on the list of aid recipients, she had not heard that this aid would be extended to the Far East. Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, with his ruddy complexion and white hair, was energetic and frequently chatted with people, saying that the trip to Shanghai was not only pleasant but also very interesting. Pan American Airways invited the journalist group to make a round-the-world flight, and he himself was not a reporter, but because he was very interested in the company's business development, he was also among those invited, so he had the opportunity to tour famous cities around the world in two weeks. But this trip was entirely for sightseeing, and he did not have any mission. His stay in China was too short, so he did not have time to inspect Shanghai's municipal administration.

Pan American Airways President Talks at Length with Zhang Jia'ao

During the cocktail reception, Mr. Trippe, President of Pan American Airways, had a long conversation with Mr. Zhang Jia'ao alone. He said that Shanghai was an important location on this round-the-world flight, and this was a test flight. Regular flights would begin within the week, taking the route through Guam, not through Shanghai. During his visit to Beijing, in addition to attending Chairman Chiang's press conference, he also met with Premier Zhang, General Yue, and Minister Yu Dawei to discuss Pan American Airways' expansion of its business in the East. He also said that his company had a definite plan for its development in the Far East, and there would be regular flights in the future. However, the development of business in China would depend on the situation in China.

Ministry of Communications Banquet to Welcome Guests

At 8:00 p.m., CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi hosted a banquet at the International Hotel on behalf of Minister of Communications Yu Dawei to welcome the guests. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves very much.

At 3:00 p.m. today, Mr. Howard and others will hold a reception at the Capital Hotel, and at 7:00 p.m., Mayor Wu will host a banquet to welcome them. They will leave Shanghai for Tokyo at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

Two Chief Pilots Talk About Their Round-the-World Trip

The pilots who flew the round-the-world plane were Captains Maxwell and Gordon. Maxwell had served with the United Nations last year, and Gordon was visiting China for the first time. Both are chief pilots of Pan American Airways and were very happy with this trip. Of all the cities they passed through, they thought Bangkok was the most beautiful. From leaving New York to arriving in Shanghai, they had been in the air for 48 hours. The exact dates and times of their flights through each place are as follows: Departed New York on the 17th at 6:05 p.m. local time, arrived in Gander, Newfoundland, at 10:55 p.m., took off at 11:35 p.m., arrived in Ireland on the 18th at 7:25 a.m., took off at 9:00 a.m., arrived in London at 11:08 a.m., took off on the 19th at 0:20 a.m., arrived in Istanbul at 7:55 a.m., took off at 10:20 p.m., arrived in Daluan, Arabia, at 4:35 a.m. on the 20th, took off at 6:18 a.m., arrived in Karachi at 10:58 a.m., took off at 4:00 p.m., arrived in Calcutta at 9:42 p.m., took off at 1:00 a.m. on the 22nd, arrived in Bangkok at 5:25 a.m., took off at 10:25 a.m., arrived in Manila at 4:25 p.m., took off from Manila at 7:45 a.m. on the 24th, and arrived in Shanghai at 1:28 p.m. Except for a slight engine problem when taking off in Karachi, everything else went very smoothly.

### Land Bureau Endeavors to Explore Reasonable Rent Standards

[Our Own Correspondent] Regarding the issue of rent standards in Shanghai, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Land Bureau yesterday to inquire about their views. It was reported that the current rent standard in Shanghai was set in March of the 35th year of the Republic (using the 26th year as the base), at 140 times for residential houses and 160 times for commercial houses. In the past year, prices have soared, and this standard is difficult to maintain. The landlord's rental income is not even enough to cover taxes, insurance fees, and repair costs. However, if the standard is abolished, it will inevitably increase housing disputes and affect social stability. For this reason, the Bureau has repeatedly invited real estate developers, senators, judicial organs, etc., to discuss revising the rent standard. After summarizing the opinions of all parties, ten regulations were formulated, stipulating that the rent standard should be based on the 26th year of the Republic, multiplied by the salary multiple of civil servants (currently 1800 times). This proposal was reserved by the Municipal Senate at the third plenary session, but the municipal government was still asked to revise the rent standard in light of the actual situation and crack down on excessively high rents. The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association advocates setting standards in accordance with Article 97 of the Land Law. According to Article 97 of the Land Law: "The rent of houses in urban areas shall not exceed 10% per annum of the declared total value of the land and its buildings." Article 25 of the Enforcement Rules of the Land Law stipulates that "the so-called total value of the land and its buildings shall be the legally determined land price for the land price, and the price assessed by the local municipal and county land administration agencies for the building price." Although the legally determined land price in this city has been announced, the building valuation has not yet been carried out. This valuation work is extremely cumbersome and requires the cooperation of construction experts. Given the number of houses in this city, it may be difficult to complete in six months. In addition, issues such as (1) depreciation of houses, (2) indoor facilities, and (3) the different convenience of access and use of gardens and lawns on the top and bottom floors of high-rise buildings all make it difficult to set rents. The land price is estimated once every five years in peacetime, but now it is once a year. Therefore, if the standard is set according to the land price, it can be revised up to once a year, but the difference in price increases during the year cannot be predicted, so it is also inappropriate. At present, it is very difficult to find a standard that everyone is satisfied with. The Bureau is currently studying factors such as the land price index, the landlord's actual expenditure, the salary multiple of civil servants, and the affordability of citizens in order to find a reasonable standard.

### Re-election of Conveners of Three Committees of the Senate

Matters discussed by the Police Committee (1) According to citizens, many theft cases have occurred on North Sichuan Road recently, but none have been solved. It was resolved to send a letter to the police station to effectively crack down on "leeches" and strictly prohibit theft. (2) According to the vendor Li Changren, the Changning Branch detained 27 vendors for no reason and imposed fines. It was resolved to send a letter to the police station to clarify the matter.

It was resolved that the content of the case did not match the actual situation and was sent to the Municipal Government for correction before further discussion.

### Symposium on Xinjiang Issues Calls for Strong Diplomatic Negotiations

[Our Own Correspondent] Since the invasion of Xinjiang Province by the Outer Mongolian army, the Chinese people have expressed deep indignation. In order to allow all sectors of society to learn the truth and raise awareness, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department held a symposium on the Xinjiang issue at the Gymnasium at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting Guang Lu, a Xinjiang legislator who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing, and Ma Yunwen, a commissioner of the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior, to be the main speakers. Ling Tiean, a member of the Tongmenghui who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing, Yu Lingyun, former director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, Ma Yanfu, manager of the Xinjiang Trading Company, Situ De, Li Ximou, Luo Dunwei, Yuan Gongwei, and others were also invited to attend. More than 1,500 people attended, and the atmosphere at the meeting was enthusiastic and focused from beginning to end, all captured by the cameras of China Electric Photographers. At the beginning of the symposium, Director Fang introduced Guang and Ma, and then Guang gave a brief description of the geographical environment and abundant resources of Xinjiang Province from his personal experience as a native of Xinjiang Province, and then gave a detailed description of the political evolution of Xinjiang Province since the founding of the Republic of China. Guang then stated that the Beitashan incident was not accidental, and that the background was that a certain country was eager to control the entire Xinjiang Province. It must be known that if Beitashan is lost, Xinjiang will be lost, and China's northwest national defense will also be lost. He called on the motherland to be strong and unified, to conduct strong diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, never to give up, and to file a complaint with the United Nations. Afterwards, Ma Yunwen added a very detailed supplement. Finally, Ling Tiean and others asked the central government to resist aggression and thoroughly investigate the chief culprits who compromised with foreign countries in emotional and impassioned words.

### Adjudication Panel Still Adheres to the Principle of Self-Negotiation for Labor-Management Disputes; Active Handling of Disputes in Various Industries

[Our Own Correspondent] Since the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee decided to establish a Wage Evaluation Panel, labor-management dispute cases that cannot be resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau after the indexation freeze are transferred to the Evaluation Panel for handling. According to Secretary of the Adjudication Committee yesterday, the Wage Evaluation Panel has now begun work, but the evaluation procedure is cumbersome and time-consuming, so it cannot be resolved quickly in the short term. The Adjudication Committee still adheres to the principle of mutual consultation between the two parties for these labor-management disputes. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Adjudication Committee will handle it impartially.

The indexation disputes in the ship repair industry, sewing industry, and silk weaving industry have been sent to the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for handling after the Social Affairs Bureau failed to mediate.

In the Hua Xin Aluminum and Steel Factory labor-management dispute, Director Wu personally convened labor and management for mediation a few days ago, but the two parties still failed to reach an agreement. The case will be adjudicated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

Due to the indexation dispute, a strike occurred in the hand-cranked machine group of the hosiery industry. Most of the workers in one area have resumed work, while the workers in the other two areas are staying in the factory. The factory owner is helpless, forming a stalemate. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided that during the adjudication period, the employer will pay the employees at the rate of 14,800 times for the second half of May. The workers disagree.

A few days ago, in the Changxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a worker was accused of theft by an employee, and a fight broke out between the two parties. The police station dispatched police to arrest them and released them on bail. The employees were dissatisfied and went on strike, and after persuasion, they resumed work. However, the workers went on strike again, and the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered them to resume work first. The assault can be sued in court.

### A Tragedy Caused by Three Pairs of Women's Socks; Merchant Accidentally Kills His Wife

[Our Own Correspondent] Chen Nanchun, 42, from Nantong, lives at No. 5, Chunde Lane, Tibet South Road. He runs a cotton yarn store on Daji Road in the Nanshi area. He has been married to Han Jinmei (26 years old) from Suzhou for many years and has a two-year-old son named Dingkang. At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, because he bought three pairs of women's socks to give to his mistress, Jinmei found out about it, and a dispute arose, which eventually led to violence. Chen was overwhelmed with anger and slammed her against the table, hitting Jinmei in the back of the head. She fell to the ground and bled profusely. Doctors were called to give her injections and treatment, but it was ineffective. She died around 1:00 p.m. Chen, seeing the disaster he had caused, fled without a trace. Afterwards, Shen Zuoluo, captain of the Dangshan Police Branch, and staff member Zhang Jingfang investigated the case. The body was sent to the Tongren Gyuantang for safekeeping, and Zhang was sent out to search for the murderer.

### Distribution of Rice to Professional Workers; Distribution Method Being Considered

[Our Own Correspondent] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that if the distribution of rice to professional workers cannot be done this month, it will be implemented starting next month. This issue is quite troublesome, and the Social Affairs Bureau is considering how to distribute it. Workers such as dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, and tricycle drivers do not have fixed employers, and the labor unions are unable to pay in advance. The Bureau is currently drafting principles to designate specific rice stores as distribution points. If there are fixed employers, the employers will purchase the rice on behalf of the workers and then distribute it.

### Prostitute Registration Deadline at the End of the Year

[Our Own Correspondent] The police station originally set the deadline for prostitute registration at the end of June, but now, by order of the municipal government, it has been extended to the end of this year. According to Bao Tianyi, captain of the Customs and Morals Section of the Bureau, the total number of registered prostitutes to date exceeds 6,000. However, he estimates that at least twice as many prostitutes have not yet registered with the Bureau. Therefore, the Bureau will send staff to conduct detailed investigations during this extension period, and if necessary, crack down on unregistered private prostitutes. There are about 100 licensed brothels in the city, including more than 20 former shelter homes that have been reorganized into brothels.

A letter was sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation to determine whether he violated the measures to crack down on gold speculation, the measures to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency, and the crime of embezzlement under the Criminal Law.

All unregistered grain merchants in this city must apply for registration with the Bureau in accordance with the law before the deadline. If the deadline is exceeded again, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 21 of the Grain Merchant Registration Regulations (punishable for hoarding and profiteering) and Article 22 (punishable with a fine of less than 1,000 yuan and may be ordered to suspend business).

### Bad Check Fraud; Cotton Cloth Boss Flees; Losses of Various Victims Reach Over 800 Million Yuan

[Our Own Correspondent] The day before yesterday, Lu Junfu, a cotton cloth merchant living at No. 9, Lane 676, Fengyang Road, reported to the Old Gate Police Branch, accusing Xu Bingxian, the owner of Zhenchang Cotton Cloth Store at No. 171, Guizhou Road, of using bad checks to defraud goods worth 158.4 million yuan. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Shi immediately ordered Captain Jiang Shangpei to supervise staff member Song Shaomei to investigate. It was learned that Xu rented No. 171, Guizhou Road on April 16 to open the Zhenchang Cotton Cloth Store. After successively purchasing cotton cloth on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, he secretly moved it out through the back door. After being reported, Xu went into hiding. The branch police worked hard to investigate. That afternoon, they retrieved 322 pieces of the original stolen goods. The next morning, they seized another 20 pieces of cotton cloth (a total of 20 sacks) in a warehouse. About two-thirds of the stolen goods have been recovered. The criminal Xu Bingxian is currently being hunted. In addition, it was learned that there were many other households that were defrauded of goods in the same way.

### Novelist Zhang Ziping Prosecuted for Aiding the Enemy

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Ziping, famous for writing triangular love novels, has been publicly prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor because he participated in a puppet organization during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Zhang is 52 years old and a native of Meixian, Guangdong. He studied geology at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, but his interest lies in literature. During the May Fourth Movement, he and his fellow students Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, Cheng Fangwu, Wang Duqing, and others organized the "Creation Society" and published the "Creation Quarterly." His works include "苔莉 [Tai Li]", "飛絮 [Flying Catkins]", "梅嶺之春 [Spring in Meiling]", "明珠與黑炭 [Pearl and Coal]", "冲積期化石 [Alluvial Fossils]", "聖　的前一夜 [The Night Before the Saint]", and dozens of other short and long stories. He was once regarded as the Chinese "Kikuchi Kan." Between 1927 and 1930, his works were popular for a time. Later, his reputation declined sharply after his long novel "待代與愛的歧路 [Waiting and the Crossroads of Love]" was cut short by the editor Li Liewen when it was published in this newspaper's "Free Talk" section. After joining the puppet organization, he published the lengthy "新紅A字 [New Red A]," but its layout was still monotonous, and his career declined. After the victory, he once fled to Taiwan and disappeared, but then returned to Shanghai, where he was reported. After an investigation by the Municipal Party Department, he was transferred to the High Procuratorate for interrogation. It was found that Zhang participated in the Puppet Executive Yuan's Cultural Relics Preservation Committee's Museum Special Committee as a specialist member in the spring of the 32nd year (of the Republic), and later served as a specially appointed technician in the Puppet Ministry of Industry, violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, and was prosecuted according to law.

### Accountant Raises Three Key Points in Chung Yuen Trading Company's Gold Specie Case: Accounting Unit Not Distinguishable on Ledger

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shoutao, the prosecutor handling the case of Iraqi A. S. Garden of Chung Yuen Trading Company illegally engaging in gold specie transactions and disrupting the financial market, had the company's accounts examined by an accountant. According to the accountant's examination report, three key points were raised:

(1) Before February 15 of this year, the journal of Chung Yuen Trading Company was entirely in U.S. dollars. After February 15, the amount in national currency was recorded simultaneously, with an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan of national currency per U.S. dollar. However, whether the receipts and payments were in national currency or U.S. dollars is indistinguishable on the ledger. (2) Since April 1 of this year, the entries in the journal have not yet been posted to the general ledger. (3) From February 16 to April 17 of this year, according to the journal, cash receipts totaled 31,285.29 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 375,423,480 yuan of national currency, and cash disbursements totaled 19,846.99 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 238,163,880 yuan of national currency. Of these, expenditures related to customer securities totaled 17,916.99 U.S. dollars. However, 600 U.S. dollars was paid on April 1 (including 300 U.S. dollars for Customer A's securities and 300 U.S. dollars for expenses, with the words "registration fee" noted in the summary). If this is also included in the calculation, it will not match the amount in the summary. In addition, there is a sales book with a large number of entries from February 25 to April 24.

### Precarious Situation of Jingjiang Levee: Hubei Compatriots in Shanghai Appeal to All Sectors; Zhang Zhiben and Others Report on the Serious Situation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hubei Association of Compatriots in Shanghai hosted representatives from all sectors of the city at the Sullivan on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Zhiben, who recently returned from tomb sweeping in his hometown (Jiangling), reported on the increasingly serious flood situation and banditry in Hubei and appealed to the public to hope that the government would quickly seek effective remedies to save tens of millions of victims.

Unimaginable Situation During the Autumn Flood Season

Mr. Zhang briefly stated: The Jingjiang Levee, which concerns the lives of tens of counties in Hubei, is now in a precarious situation. The Qijia Yuan section of the levee between Shashi and Hao Xue has collapsed, and there is already a deep pool inside the levee. Because the river water level is tens of feet above the ground, the province of Hubei is in danger of submersion once the levee collapses. Fortunately, the spring flood has been barely passed, but the autumn flood season is approaching in the blink of an eye. During the Anti-Japanese War, the levee body was neglected and destroyed by artillery fire. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau, which is responsible for repairing the levee, did not repair it in advance during the winter when the water level was low. Now that the water level is rising daily, the bureau is only hastily repairing it with thin wood, reeds, and weeds. The danger is truly unimaginable when the autumn flood arrives.

Dongting Lake Surface Gradually Shrinking

The area of Dongting Lake is gradually shrinking, and the water storage capacity is sharply reduced because a small number of people with local evil forces enclose the silted land on the edge of the lake, build embankments, and cultivate the lake bottom. Although the government has long explicitly prohibited this and the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan has organized a supervision committee to order the demolition of these private embankments, it has been repeatedly delayed and has not yet been earnestly implemented, causing Dongting Lake to lose its regulatory function.

In terms of banditry, Hao Xue Town was looted by bandits on the first day of the lunar new year this year. It was reported that there were only hundreds of bandits at the time. Later, they crossed the river and fled south into Gong'an County and the border area between Hunan and Hubei. Recently, they have returned to the north bank, harassing Dangyang and other places. The number of bandits has reached thousands. If they are not suppressed quickly, they will become a major disaster for Hunan and Hubei.

Riverbed Higher Than Rooftops

Hu Qiuyuan and Qian Nashui then supplemented the report on the importance of the safety of the Jingjiang Levee. The main points are as follows: (1) The Qijia Yuan section of the Jingjiang Levee has been eroded by the river flow for many years, and half of the levee foot has been destroyed. Now that the flood season is approaching, the rush repair project has failed to meet the actual needs, causing people to panic and be unable to sleep or eat. (2) The Jingjiang Levee is the barrier to the lives and property of Jiangling, Jianli, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and parts of Jingmen and Hanyang. The levee is more than a hundred miles long and rises to more than ten feet high, while the riverbed has already reached the height of the rooftops inside the levee. If any part of the levee collapses, houses within hundreds of miles will be submerged, and millions of people will be unable to escape. (3) Dongting Lake was originally a reservoir for floodwaters from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The various embankments surrounding Datong Lake (with Tianyou Embankment as the general name) greatly reduce the flood storage capacity, which is enough to raise the water level of the river and further increase the burden on the Jingjiang Levee, especially the danger of the Qijia Yuan section. Although the central government has explicitly ordered the demolition, it has not yet started due to the obstruction of a small number of local landlords. Recently, there has been talk of postponing the demolition, which is tantamount to disregarding the lives of millions of people. (4) If the embankments around Datong Lake are not demolished, the result will not only be that the two banks of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will suffer from major floods, but also many counties in Hunan will be harmed. Therefore, in the past, there were many enlightened people in Hunan who advocated prohibiting the construction of embankments around Dongting Lake. At the same time, the harm of reducing the flood storage capacity of Dongting Lake is not limited to this. All areas within Hubei and even along the Yangtze River in the lower reaches will also be in danger of levee collapse due to the increased water level of the river.

Demolition Order Should Be Implemented Resolutely

(4) Even if the demolition of the embankments around Datong Lake affects the livelihoods of some people, it will only be tens of thousands or at most hundreds of thousands of people. Compared with the safety of the lives and property of millions or tens of millions of people, the seriousness of the interests involved cannot be measured by reason. Moreover, the central government has already allocated relief funds to the people of each embankment. (5) The issue of whether to keep or demolish the embankments around Datong Lake is not a dispute between the people of Hubei and the people of Hunan, but should be viewed from the perspective of the entire country and from a humanitarian point of view. If the Jingjiang Levee collapses, millions of lives will be sacrificed, which is a great loss to the country and goes against humanity. The harm of the collapse of the Jingjiang Levee is certainly to the entire country, and the same is true of the collapse of other levees, but the disaster of the collapse of the Jingjiang Levee is even more tragic. (6) The Jingjiang Levee was highly valued in the late Qing Dynasty. If it collapsed, administrative officials at all levels would be held accountable, because the levee had repeatedly received funds from the treasury for repairs and was called the "Imperial Project Levee." It was commonly called the "Emperor's Levee," which shows the importance of its relationship to the lives of the people. To ensure the safety of the levee, Dongting Lake was never allowed to compete with the water for land. After the establishment of the National Government, it did not neglect this important levee. Before the war, funds were allocated every year to repair the levee, as in the past, and it was forbidden to build embankments in Dongting Lake that would hinder flood storage. It is bewildering that the demolition order has been issued for a long time, but its strict enforcement has not been insisted upon. (7) It is hoped that the press will uphold justice and urge the government to supervise the urgent repair of the Jingjiang Levee, especially the dangerous Qijia Yuan section, from the perspective of the interests of the entire country and from a humanitarian standpoint, and to immediately and strictly implement the order to demolish the embankments around Datong Lake.

### Adulterated Dregs Passed Off as Saccharin: Zhou Kuangnan's Peddling Exposed; Denied and Accused Others After Arrest

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, many fake saccharin products have been discovered on the market. The Lao Zha Police Station in this city cracked a case a few days ago and arrested the principal offender, Zhou Kuangnan. Zhou is a native of Suzhou, 31 years old, and lives at 231 Bizhou Road. He used to run a canned food business. Six years ago, he switched to saccharin and established the Zhongnan Saccharin Factory. Recently, the bureau suddenly had a whimsical idea, arbitrarily mixed four large cans of Longpu Ling saccharin from Paris with coarse sugar dregs, and took the goods to the Zhongmao Pharmacy at 238 Guangxi Road to negotiate a sale. The Zhongmao business director, Qi Yungao, saw through the scheme and discovered that the goods were fake. Zhou claimed that the goods were distributed by Yongxing Western Medicine Store at 51 Hong Kong Road. Qi called Yongxing to inquire and rushed to investigate, only to learn that Zhou was using fake goods to deceive the market. He reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Station, which sent officers to arrest Zhou and search his home. More than ten cans of fake saccharin and eighteen small bottles, and thirty-eight packages were seized. The saccharin was mixed with coarse sugar, and the label "Product of Zhongnan Saccharin Factory" was affixed, stating that the sweetness was 500 degrees, as well as other counterfeit stamps and trademarks. After the police station interrogated Zhou strictly, he still tried to deny the charges and claimed that the goods were purchased from Chen Mingxiang, the manager of the Zhongfu Pharmacy at 17, Lane 146, Nanjing Road. Chen was summoned to the bureau to investigate the truth and officers were sent to Zhongfu to inspect the goods. It was confirmed that there were no fake goods mixed in. Zhou finally admitted that he acted alone. The case has been investigated by the bureau and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning in the coming days.

### Ying Changqi Soon to Complete National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Dictionary

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Ying Changqi, manager of the business department of the Bank of Taiwan, will complete a book entitled "National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Dictionary" in July. The telegraph codebook currently used in China uses four Arabic numerals to form a Chinese character, and each telegraph symbol for a Chinese character has five actions, that is, each Chinese character requires twenty actions, which is behind the English telegraph code. Only 1,200 characters can be telegraphed per hour, which is too slow and time-consuming. Ying intends to use Roman letters to spell out the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese, and then send telegrams according to Roman letters, that is, to convert Chinese characters into English for telegraphing. According to his research, after this reform, each Chinese character will only require ten actions, that is, the telegraphing speed will be doubled, and the working speed of telegraph operators can also be increased by more than double.

### Orchid Island Survey Team Returns to Taiwan - National Taiwan University President Lu Zhihong Hosts Tea Party to Express Appreciation - Animal Specimens Include One Bear Rat - Research Reports to be Released Soon

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] The Orchid Island Scientific Survey Team, consisting of sixty members who had worked diligently, with the exception of seven meteorology group members who will remain on Orchid Island for long-term typhoon observation, have all returned to Taipei with their collected specimens. The last group of two professors also rushed back to Taipei a few tens of minutes before the arrival of the typhoon the night before last. The team spent a total of three weeks traveling to and from Orchid Island. They are currently expediting the sorting of various specimens, and various research reports will be released soon. As of now, five team members have fallen ill due to overwork. Lu Zhihong, president of National Taiwan University, held a tea party today to host all team members and express appreciation. It is reported that the professors from the team's marine, medical, botanical, and mineralogical groups collected extremely rich specimens, totaling several hundred boxes. However, the vertebrate zoology professor from the animal group only captured one precious black bear rat. Furthermore, because the island has no venomous snakes or fierce beasts, the two professors studying venomous snakes and fierce beasts returned disappointed, having found nothing. A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed Dr. Ma Shanying, Dean Chen Lijie, and agricultural economist Liu Jisheng of the team, who stated that Orchid Island is rich in marine fish resources and has great potential for fisheries development. During the "village tide" festival, schools of fish migrate to the waters near Orchid Island, and the islanders often extract them by hand. During the transition from spring to summer, schools of extremely delicious flying fish arrive, and at night, the "bonfires" set by the islanders in the shallow sea are constantly swarmed, resembling moths attracted to lights, creating a spectacular sight. The islanders mostly use harpoons to catch schools of skipjack tuna weighing several tens of kilograms. When diving, marine scientists on the team unexpectedly entered a "crystal palace," often seeing colorful fish, shrimp, and live coral, as well as nocturnal shells, roaming among the seaweed and seaweed leaves, a truly enjoyable sight. The aquatic plants on Orchid Island are also extremely abundant. Some experts have determined that it is an "ideal place" for livestock grazing. The sheep raised by the islanders are all released into the wild throughout the island. "Little Orchid Island," located three miles south of Orchid Island, is an uninhabited island. The islanders use wooden boats to transport sheep, release them there, and then return directly, allowing the sheep to live and breed on their own. They return to retrieve them after a few months or years. It is also said that Orchid Island is an uncultivated virgin land, and everything remains in its original state, making it not only a "library" for archaeologists and scientists but also a "Peach Blossom Spring of Wuling," a refuge from the Qin dynasty.

### Qunsheng Suffers Crushing Defeat to Xinghua Team - Team Members' Out-of-Line Behavior Heavily Criticized

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 24th] In last night's basketball game between the Xinghua Team and the Qunsheng Team, Xinghua won the victory they deserved with a score of 46 to 41. The audience numbered about 10,000 people and was extremely crowded. The British Governor of Malaya and Singapore, MacDonald, and his wife, as well as the Chinese Consul General, Wu Bosheng, and his wife, also attended the game. The game began with great tension, and both sides were evenly matched. However, due to the Qunsheng Team's lack of good sportsmanship, a small dispute arose. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Qunsheng Team was penalized one point. The team protested and argued fiercely. Since they could not change the referee's decision, they refused to continue the game. After Consul General Wu persuaded them, they resumed the game. From then on, the Qunsheng Team was often booed by the audience to express their protest. Lacking sportsmanship, the Qunsheng Team also adopted crude tactics. As a result, when the Xinghua Team had a nine-point lead with only four minutes remaining, the Qunsheng Team was penalized again for a personal foul. They threatened to leave the game, and Yang Renhui, their right guard, even insulted the referee who penalized him for the foul. Therefore, he was ejected from the game. When the game resumed, their forward, Chen Jinzhi, deliberately pushed Hou Hu, a star player of the Xinghua Team, to the ground, and he was also ejected from the game. From then on, although the Qunsheng Team made a final counterattack, they were defeated by a difference of five points. In the first quarter, the Qunsheng Team took the lead with a score of 11 to 7. In the second quarter, Xinghua caught up with a score of 24 to 15. After that, the team always took the lead, and by the end of the third quarter, they still led with a score of 36 to 30. In the end, the crowd was very angry. A group of spectators on the field surrounded the Qunsheng Team in a corner of the sports field, preventing an accident. The Qunsheng Team's poor sportsmanship has been severely criticized by various newspapers today.

[Our Report] The rice market opened for business yesterday after a two-day closure on Sunday and the Dragon Boat Festival. Merchants were crowded, and the atmosphere was lively. Due to the holiday closures, various groups were eager to purchase, leading to a sharp increase in decumption. Coupled with the impact of rising prices of other commodities, the public sentiment was unanimously optimistic, and Jingbo rice actually approached the 500,000 mark. The market softened slightly at the close, but was still 20,000 to 30,000 yuan higher than last week. Due to the end of the Dragon Boat Festival, the market for Yinbai rice turned sluggish, so the market trend remained stable.

Yesterday, the total registered arrivals of various groups were 1,796.6 dan at the South Market and 4,263 dan at the North Market.

The supply and demand of flour are balanced, and the market situation is stable. Bran is trending towards softening. Soybean cake rose first and then fell. Factory soybeans are fair and upright, but Yingkou cakes are selling well and have risen by another 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Green soybeans are selling well and rising slowly, increasing by varying amounts of 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. Green beans are selling widely and slightly moving. High-quality goods have rebounded by 10,000 yuan, medium-quality goods have also risen by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but secondary goods are still rarely traded.

Shantou Taiwanese traders are competing to purchase broad beans, and the price continues to rise by 10,000 yuan. The future trend still depends on exports. Wheat is stable. The oil market is extremely volatile. Prices rose sharply in the morning, but many orders were placed in the afternoon, leading to a straight-line decline. In the end, the price was slightly higher than on Saturday by 10,000 yuan. Vegetable sesame oil had no honor or disgrace at the end of the day.

### Shanghai Grain Merchants Registration Extended to the End of July

The Social Affairs Bureau, noting that the grain merchant registration deadline had passed and a small number were still intending to wait and see, which was a clear disregard of government regulations, issued another public notice yesterday stating that, in order to protect the rights of legitimate grain merchants and prevent illegal operations by unscrupulous merchants, the bureau had begun processing grain merchant registrations in October of the previous year, issuing public notices and urging applications within the specified time. It has been found that a large number of applications were submitted within the deadline, but a significant number were also waiting and seeing. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government has forwarded an order from the Ministry of Food to complete the registration within a specified time, which should be implemented. To show consideration for grain merchants, the deadline is specially extended to the end of July of this year for all to complete their registrations. All unregistered grain merchants in the city must come to the bureau to apply for registration according to law before the deadline. Those who fail to do so will be dealt with according to Articles 21 and 22 of the Grain Merchant Registration Rules.

Article 21 of the Grain Merchant Registration Rules states that those who engage in the purchase and sale of grain without registering and obtaining a business license in accordance with the rules will be punished for the crime of hoarding and speculating in accordance with Article 2 of the Temporary Regulations on Punishing Food Management Violations in Extraordinary Times. Article 22 states that those who engage in the business of grain warehouses, grain processing, or grain brokerage without registering and obtaining a business license in accordance with the rules will be fined up to 1,000 yuan and may be ordered to suspend operations.

### Curbing the Edible Oil Price Surge: China Trust Bureau Allocates Soybeans for Oil Extraction

The price surge of soybean oil has been endless in recent days. At the opening of the market on the 24th, the surge was even more intense. Soybean oil was priced at 720,000 yuan per dan, but after hoarders dumped their stocks, it suddenly fell to 660,000 yuan. At the close, it recovered to 680,000 yuan. The average price of all goods rose by about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The China Trust Bureau, aware of this situation, believes that unless it quickly seeks to increase production and prevent the oil from falling into the hands of middlemen, it will not be enough to quell the price surge.

The bureau convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th with key personnel from the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association. As a result, it was decided that the first batch of a large quantity of soybeans previously shipped from the Northeast by the bureau would be allocated, with 2,300 tons to be delivered to the association for oil extraction. The quantity allocated to each factory has also been determined. The China Vegetable Oil Factory will receive 760 tons, Da You Yu 400 tons, Da Chang and Xin Xia De 380 tons each, and Shun Yu, Tong Sheng, and Tai 190 tons each. It is estimated that after the delivery, within a week, based on the oil yield of 10.5 jin of oil per dan of Northeast soybeans, 241.5 tons of soybean oil can be produced, totaling 4,830 dan. At that time, the association will deliver all of it to the China Trust Bureau, which will allocate it to the Civil Food Adjustment Committee for distribution. The processing fee for each factory is set at 20,000 yuan in national currency per dan of raw materials. As for the disposal of soybean cakes, it is planned that the factories will purchase them at a price.

### Social Affairs Bureau Director Talks About the Main Causes of Price Fluctuations: Speculators Create Rumors and Stir Up Trouble

[Our Report] Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday: The recent price fluctuations after the Dragon Boat Festival are mainly due to the many rumors in the market. These people fear that the world will not be in chaos, so they spread rumors that 50,000-yuan banknotes will be issued, which the authorities cannot effectively refute. The rise in rice prices is due to the recent wind and rain, which resulted in fewer arrivals. Now that the weather has cleared, it is believed that prices will stabilize. The Price Evaluation Committee does not plan to convene this month, as gauze is controlled by the Gauze Adjustment Committee, coal is managed by the Fuel Management Committee, rice sales have been liberalized, and sugar prices are set by a subcommittee.

### The Shanghai Stock Market Reverses: Major Players Go From Long to Short

Yesterday, hot money from the Yarn and Cotton Gangs continued to absorb Chinese stocks. The Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams again reported a severe decline. Yong Yarn showed repeated signs of activity midway, but without the support of major players who went from long to short, the upward momentum lacked support. The overnight interest rate rose to 0.36 and 0.405, and with the bullish trend reversed, buyers found the burden difficult. Moreover, retail buyers on the floor added to their positions at lower prices after hearing rumors. Before the close, they were forced to resist no longer within the "breakeven" limit due to time constraints, and finally turned from tight to weak, closing at lower prices.

Although the National Bank had a large gap upward from the previous day's close in the morning, most stocks opened higher except for underwear, which opened half a percent lower, due to the severe decline reported by the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams and rumors from Hong Kong that Sino-US loans were unfavorable. After Yong Yarn opened, it advanced from 14, 104, 142, and 160 to 9,000 yuan, but 97, 148, 8, 24, 91, 223, 55, and 65 took profits at the high, falling to 8,780 yuan. 129, 36, 228, and 231 took advantage of the low to advance to 8,900 yuan, but 61, 97, and 65 continued to sell. At this time, 231, 104, and 105 still had appetite and struggled quite a bit between 8,800 and 8,900 yuan. With money still tight, 97, 134, 24, 56, 207, 105, 121, and 49 dumped their positions, and Yong Yarn fell to around 8,650 yuan. After 224 covered their shorts at the low, 14, 153, 223, 32, 107, 105, 135, 142, 183, and 69 gradually absorbed shares, and prices gradually recovered. 231 and 106 re-entered the market after exiting, rising to 9,060 yuan. After entering, there was a tug-of-war within the 9,000 yuan range. Finally, with the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams reporting a contraction to 11 yuan, sentiment remained bullish. 14, 224, 232, 83, 223, 148, 57, and 185 all entered the market, rising to 9,220 yuan. 186 and 23 took advantage of the high to offer shares, retreating to 9,100 yuan. 218, 102, 152, and 171 bought aggressively, pushing Yong Yarn up to 9,230 yuan. 61, 197, 94, 104, 155, 207, and 163 dumped their shares, retreating to 8,900 yuan. Although 188, 152, and 171 advanced to above 9,000 yuan, 219, 224, 200, 223, 142, 65, and 213 fiercely sold off. 157 even actively offered more spot Yong Yarn for sale. Near the close, there were many taking profits on the floating gains, and rumors of peace circulated. Yong Yarn gradually fell to 8,560 yuan. 104 absorbed shares and closed at 8,600 yuan. After the close, the price was bid up to 8,680 yuan. However, spot Yong Yarn finally closed at a low of 8,400 yuan. Jing Lun once reported a limit down. In the end, compared to the previous close, spot trades of Yong Yarn, Xin He, Mei Ya, and Jing微 declined, Hua Feng, Yong Gong, Qin Xing fell about half a percent, Xin Guang and Zhong Fa each fell slightly more than half a percent, Xin Hua fell strongly by one and a half percent, and Li An, Rong Feng, Match, and Cement fell slightly. Jing Lun rebounded after a limit down, narrowing the decline to half a percent. Commerce, Zhong Fang, Da Tong, Zhong Si, and Guo Huo fell half a percent, and Xin Ya, Underwear, and Wu He fell about 10 percent. In deferred delivery trades, Yong Yarn, Xin He, Mei Ya, Xin Guang, Yong Gong, and Jing Fu all reported slight declines, Hua Feng fell strongly by half a percent, and Qin Xing fell weakly by one and a half percent. Among old stocks traded off the floor, Wu Zhou, Da Sheng, Zha Bei, and Hua Shang saw slight declines, Zhong Hua and Nan Yang saw slight gains, and Shi Jie remained flat.

### National Banks and Bureaus Must Not Engage in Stock Arbitrage

The Ministry of Finance believes that the use of funds by national banks and bureaus should strictly follow the provisions of the professional scope and strengthening financial business management methods, with the main objective of assisting in the production, transportation, and sales of daily necessities and export goods. Their surplus funds must be deposited in the Central Bank. It has come to the Ministry of Finance's attention that recently, some national banks and bureaus have been using their own deposits or entrusted funds from customers to engage in stock arbitrage. If this is true, it is inconsistent with the above provisions and should be prohibited. A telegram has been sent to the Four Banks Joint Office instructing all banks and bureaus to comply.

More than 100 Northern Gang gauze firms in the city, including China Gauze Company, Tianjin Chengxing, Yongfeng Gauze Shenzhuang, and Beijing Guoquan Gauze Shenzhuang, believe that their businesses have been greatly affected since the northern transportation of gauze was restricted. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Textile Adjustment Committee, requesting the revocation of the northern transportation controls on gauze, allowing free transportation and sales, showing compassion for merchants' difficulties, and benefiting the people's livelihood.

### Gauze All See Solid Gains

The cotton yarn market opened flat in the morning, with retail investors selling off. Subsequently, due to the large amount of funds remitted to Shanghai by the Northern Gang, credit on the market eased, and buyers in the market suddenly became active. The prices of various yarns rose sharply from stable to sharply higher. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose dramatically by 1 million yuan, to 16.65 million yuan. 20-count Special Ma was pushed up by 300,000 yuan, Double Ma yarn rose by 150,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming was pushed up to 8.4 million yuan, a sharp rise of 700,000 yuan. Market sentiment was quite bullish.

The cotton cloth market opened in the morning with sellers offering goods, and 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 384,000 yuan. Later, upon hearing that yarn prices were rising, customers actively bought, and the market stopped falling and rebounded. As a result, Longtou fine cloth rose to 400,000 yuan, a rise of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wu Fu, Cai Qiu, Zhen Zhong, and other fine cloths all rose by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.

The prices of other bleached cloth, Yuan Zhi, and Tribute Silk all rose sharply.

### Spot Cotton Bids Continue to Rise

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw prices rise again and again, with Hong Kong exchange rates continuing to decline, and sentiment was extremely bullish. In addition, the prices of cotton yarn in the interior also soared, and those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily, with a consensus that the future was bright, so trading was quite thin. In the afternoon, trades made by the same industry for delivery to factories included Lingbao at 1.9 million, Hankou fine velvet at 1.66 million to 1.7 million, and Chong Shashi at 1.7 million to 1.72 million.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

### Manufacturers Request Restoration of Imports of Pencil Manufacturing Materials

[Our Report] Recently, pencil factories in the city, such as Jincheng, Shanghai, and China Standard, have been prohibited from importing foreign raw materials such as foreign cedar and graphite powder. Domestic wood is obtained from Taiwanese cypress. Recently, due to the reorganization of the Taiwan Provincial Government, the issuance of wood export permits has also been temporarily suspended. These factories have recently requested the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to issue a certificate to apply to the Taiwan Provincial authorities to resume issuing export permits. On the one hand, they still hope that the import management authorities can consider allowing the import of foreign cedar and graphite powder so that domestically produced pencils can technically compete with foreign goods. Domestic cypress and graphite powder can be used to make ordinary pencils. It is estimated that the output of the three factories is sufficient to meet the national demand.

### $60 Million in Daily Necessities Allocated From UNRRA Surplus Materials

[Our Report] Yesterday's report that the United States will assist us in selling six types of daily necessities at low prices has been clarified by relevant parties that the origin of these materials is that UNRRA once proposed that after the agency closed, a portion (worth approximately 60 million US dollars) of the remaining relief materials of 350 million US dollars would be allocated to us, as we requested, with food accounting for the majority, and other items including sundries and pharmaceutical supplies being submitted separately. Currently, UNRRA is still negotiating plans for the distribution of these relief materials. If it is approved and shipped in the future, it may still be allocated to local governments for distribution.

As for the Distribution Materials Advisory Committee to be established by the Central Trust Bureau, this is because some of the distribution materials in this city are directly or indirectly related to the Central Trust Bureau. In order to facilitate coordination, the bureau has specially established this organization, so it has no special relationship with the relief materials distributed by UNRRA.

### Exporters Request Improvement in Methods of Purchasing Export Goods

In order to solve the difficulties of the export industry, the government has specially purchased export goods, and relevant agencies have organized a purchasing committee to be responsible for handling this matter. This is the government's current policy, and exporters unanimously support it. However, exporters have raised two points of opinion regarding the purchase: (1) The purchase price should not be excessively lowered to avoid losses to exporters due to the purchase. (2) The purchase of export goods should be made from exporters at the export port. Purchasing directly from the production area will not only compete with the people for profit but also stimulate prices. It is said that exporters of tung oil and pig bristles will submit these two opinions in writing to the purchasing committee for consideration.

### Jewelry Industry Representatives Return to Shanghai, May Resume Business Next Month

Representatives of the jewelry industry in the city who went to the capital to petition have returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is said that the industry can mostly accept several measures recently stipulated by the authorities, such as separating the prices of gold and jewelry, setting the gold content of jewelry at 70%, and changing the description to handmade products. Therefore, the authorities have decided to formally announce these measures to the public this month. As a result, jewelry stores in the city have been cleaning and decorating in a big way, planning to officially resume business from next month. As for whether jewelry stores that have already closed down will also resume business at the same time, it depends on the will of the person in charge, and it is difficult to say at present.

### Macau Bans Gold Imports

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Macau banned the import of gold from the 23rd, on the grounds that China and Hong Kong have taken the same measures, so the Macau government must cooperate.

### International Gold Price Issue: IMF Notifies Member States to Prohibit Price Increases

### Sugar Market Prices Continue to Tighten

Yesterday, the sugar market was buoyant, with demand exceeding supply and prices rising across the board. Although the market was closed for one day during the Dragon Boat Festival, off-market trading prices had already risen. Yesterday, prices continued to tighten, especially for white sugar, rising by as much as 10,000 to 120,000 yuan. At the guild's closing, Peruvian sand warehouse receipts reached a high of 665,000 yuan. 24-group white was at 600,000 yuan, with warehouse receipts adding 125,000 yuan. Semi-carload free sugar rose from 555,000 yuan to 570,000 yuan.

A total of over a thousand lots were traded.

[Another Report] Peruvian sugar in the sugar market has always been used as a bargaining chip by speculators for "kick the can" trading. However, the prices of various goods in the city have recently begun to rise sharply. Stimulated by this, the sugar market has also risen sharply. Yesterday morning, Peruvian sugar even reached 635,000 yuan, a huge increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. As a result, short sellers panicked and tried to cover their positions. However, the warehouse receipts of Xinyi Company were mostly hoarded by major players, and the amount circulating in the market was decreasing daily. Therefore, it was impossible to cover positions in time, and disputes arose due to failure to deliver on time. Trading in the market was temporarily suspended.

### Silk All Decline

Yesterday, the artificial silk market stopped rising and fell back. 120 High Mountain Guang opened at 22.8 million yuan. Due to the extraordinary tightness of credit, there were few takers, and prices could not be sustained, falling to 2.5 million yuan. After a transaction, it fell again to 2 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, there were many who took advantage of the low prices to buy in, so there was a slight rise. Finally, the selling price was 22.4 million yuan, a drop of slightly more than 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss, the asking price reached 32 million yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the market asked for 30 million yuan, but no transactions were made.

The factory silk market also showed slight weakness yesterday. The opening price for D-grade was 30 million yuan, with five dan traded, a drop of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day's asking price. There were no transactions for the other grades, and the asking price was also about 500,000 yuan lower. The transaction price for small lot silk was similar to the previous day. High-grade small lot Double Tiger brand was priced at 30 million yuan. There was no news of dry warp trading yesterday, and the asking price did not fluctuate much.

Yesterday, the silk goods market also declined due to credit conditions. Dachen surface traded at 11 million yuan, and Huaqiang Bei warehouse receipts opened at 10.08 million yuan. The final asking price was 10.9 million yuan. Dachen Geli Bi Zou opened at 41,200 yuan and traded one ticket before falling back. Transactions were also made at 40,600 or 700 yuan. Later, upon hearing that the stock market was down, there was a greater need to sell off. At the lowest, it once entered within the 40,000 yuan mark, finally maintaining 40,000 yuan at the close, with a difference of 200 or 300 yuan on the next day. Hua Jin Zou's selling price was also slightly inferior due to the decline in raw materials. High-end goods traded at 21,000 yuan. Transactions for the other goods were very quiet, so the selling prices were mostly firm and unchanged.

### Cigarettes Rise Sharply, Fall Quickly

Yesterday, the cigarette market was in a state of rapid advance and rapid retreat, with Wing Tai and opening up Jia, Yi, Bing three cards of Great British, Old Knife, Great South Rice, Great Three Cannons and Turkish and other various cigarettes. The Great New Tobacco Company also dispatched Special Jia, Yi, and Bing three cards of Standard Brand cigarettes. The market chips were suddenly abundant, and there were also resales, so the asking prices retreated rapidly. The final price for ten Great British cigarettes was 6.75 million yuan, a sharp drop of 900,000 yuan compared to the afternoon before the festival (the 22nd). Old Knife brand fell by 850,000 yuan, to 5.8 million yuan. Hardeman fell by 600,000 yuan, and Five Hua only fell by 50,000 yuan. The overall trend was that the factories increased the distribution of goods, and the authorities denied the wind that foreign exchange adjustments were taking place. Market sentiment was lax, buyers were watching, so the other Chinese merchant cigarettes also fell across the board. However, American goods such as Six Horses, Maurice, and Camel cigarettes were quite firm, rising by 1,500 yuan to 4,500 yuan. The sales of Listening Head cigarettes were sluggish, and each carton fell by 500 yuan to 4,000 yuan.

### Coal Market Gradually Turns Around

The prices of Lao Long white coal and Chenxi bituminous coal and other coals have continued to rise in the producing areas, and transportation costs have also increased, while local market prices remain sluggish, with the gap between the two being too large. Most customers are holding onto their shipments in the warehouses, and will not sell them unless they are at a good price. As a result, sentiment has turned firm, and the entire coal industry market suddenly saw a turnaround yesterday, especially with bituminous coal rising the most, and sales of coke and white coal also expanding greatly.

### Industry and Commerce World, Issue 6, Published

The sixth issue of "Industry and Commerce World," published by Pan Shihao and edited by Yuan Baili, was published yesterday. The contents include a special feature on "Should the Government Open Foreign Exchange," as well as Pan Shihao's "Ways to Resolve Labor Disputes," and several behind-the-scenes news articles. The price is set at 3,000 yuan per copy.

### Intense and Tense: The Political Climate in the Capital

— Nanjing, 16th, Quick Report by Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

In September of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], I took the first ship from Chongqing to the two capitals [Nanjing and Beijing]. At that time, this capital was visibly scarred by the iron heel of the Japanese occupation. Japanese soldiers were scattered throughout the streets, and many tall buildings were still occupied by the Japanese. The streets were riddled with potholes, and the few small cars and sparse pedestrians made one feel the desolation of the post-war capital. In October of the same year, I went to Nanjing from Shanghai again. The shops on Xin Jie Kou, Zhongzheng Road, Zhongshan Road, Taiping Road, and other streets were still mostly sealed off, and the potholes in the streets were still mostly unpatched. Only the Confucius Temple on the Qinhuai River remained abnormally prosperous, with people gambling and making noise outside the taverns. In December, I went to Nanjing again on business, but although more shops had opened on the bustling streets, I still felt it was large but impractical. More than a year later, I returned to Nanjing with empty feelings. Before arriving in Nanjing, my mind was filled with the impression of the post-war capital's desolation.

Traffic Control is More Orderly

The capital now welcomes the returning traveler who cares about her with a different appearance. The potholes in the streets have been filled, many dilapidated houses have been repaired, shops are neatly opened, and public buildings have also been renovated. In particular, cars on the roads are lined up like long snakes, driving back and forth in an orderly manner. One car follows another in such an orderly fashion, much better than the chaotic traffic in Shanghai. Perhaps the number of cars in the capital is not as many as in Shanghai, and the road mileage is longer than in Shanghai. However, for someone who previously had empty feelings towards her, now feels fulfilled.

The Political Atmosphere is Extremely Tense

The capital now has an atmosphere reminiscent of Chongqing, the wartime capital. It is tense and enthusiastic, even though it is a time when people generally advocate a low profile due to both foreign and domestic troubles. That is how I feel. I was in Nanjing precisely when Xinjiang was being invaded by Outer Mongolia. Colleagues in the press were busy and extremely nervous. The whereabouts of the Minister of National Defense became a new interest for our colleagues. Therefore, they were too lazy to go to the Director of the Information Bureau's "sesame seed cake meeting." They controlled all means of transportation and used all possible methods to obtain news about how the authorities were handling this foreign invasion.

Determined to Resist Aggression Despite All Difficulties

I asked them about their opinions on the current situation based on the guidelines I occasionally saw in political circles. They believed that "the administration must be reformed, but it must start from the upper levels. The current few powerful families should be punished, otherwise it will not gain the trust of the people." They believed that the reasons for the Outer Mongolian invasion were complex, and the attitude of the Chinese Communists was so strong that it required determination, perseverance, and the elimination of fear and hesitation to make the situation clear with a firm will. Yes, this statement represents a progressive force, and this force is dominating the tense and enthusiastic situation in the capital today.

The Nerve Center Must Not Be Relaxed

Now, the people of the whole country are suffering. The capital is the nerve center of the whole country, and it should make a decision. We must be strong and not weak. We must make further efforts and not allow any relaxation. Today's capital has transitioned from post-victory desolation to tension and arduousness. The work before us is to eliminate domestic troubles, solve foreign problems, and strive for construction. This is really no different from the difficulties of the war of resistance. However, ordinary people believe that since victory has been achieved, they should enjoy themselves, indulging in enjoyment. Production has not progressed, consumption has increased significantly, and prices have soared, leading to an unprecedented economic crisis. All these symptoms have increased the burden on the government. I feel that prices in Suzhou are lower than in Hangzhou, and prices in Nanjing are even lower than in Suzhou, perhaps because, as the capital, there are better ways to control prices.

The Rustic Charm of a Village Girl on Xuanwu Lake

Mr. Xiong Fuxi asked me in Shanghai to meet him in Nanjing and then go sightseeing together. That was the second day after I arrived in Nanjing. It was raining heavily. When we arrived at Xuanwu Lake, the boatmen had not yet put up the awnings. We called a boatman, who quoted a price of 30,000 yuan. We bargained down to 20,000 yuan and made the deal. In the whistling wind, we went around the lake. To the right, we could see Zijin Mountain in the distance, and to the left rear were the towering walls of Stone City. In the center of the lake, there is a Xuanwu Lake Park, which is very large. In the lake, reeds grow densely in clumps. I asked Mr. Xiong, "Which is more beautiful, West Lake or Xuanwu Lake?" He said, "West Lake is like a refined lady, while Xuanwu Lake is like a village girl. Look at the clumps of reeds, the few lotus leaves in the distance, and the huge city walls reflected in the lake, all indicating that she is a village girl." I said, "If Xuanwu Lake is used as a scenic area, of course, there is nothing wrong with that, but if you want people to be able to live in the scenic area, then West Lake is the choice."

The Brocade of Jinling: A Small Flower Adorning Xuanwu Lake. It is just a small flower adorning the brocade of Nanjing, while West Lake is a nest of flowers. Therefore, I talked with many people in Nanjing and said, "Nanjing should be the political capital, Shanghai should be the economic center, and Hangzhou should be the city of culture." They all agreed. Moreover, some people said, "Isn't that right? Hangzhou will establish two national public schools to emphasize this city of flowers." However, today the government is busy with its affairs, and important matters are waiting to be dealt with. How can they have time to plan and build a city of culture? The capital is indeed struggling in distress, expressing enthusiasm and tension in its form. We hope that this enthusiasm and tension will affect the whole country and push the whole country onto the road of construction.

### The Mystery of the "Chinese Pyramid"

— Xi'an, 15th, Airmail News by Our Correspondent Zhang Xianzhou

An American pilot said that he discovered the "Chinese Pyramid" this spring in a place fifty to sixty miles south of Xi'an, and that there is also a small temple on the tower... That is what the telegram said. Once this news spread, everyone asked each other, where is the Chinese Pyramid? What does it look like? Why haven't people in Xi'an ever discovered this "large building" in the northwest? A series of questions were raised, and the Chinese Pyramid became a mystery.

The American pilot's remarks seem to be true, and it is also true that the people of Xi'an do not know. At that time, the reporter interviewed many "old Chang'an" people, but they mostly talked vaguely and reached no conclusion. It was not until two months ago that the newspaper published, "The pyramid south of Xi'an mentioned earlier is a mistake for Guishan Mountain in the Qinling Mountains. Guishan Mountain is located south of Xi'an, and the mountain shape is like the character '圭'...etc." A few days ago, the reporter went to the southern suburbs of Xi'an on business. It turns out that the "Chinese Pyramid" is not Guishan Mountain, but "Jianshan Mountain," which is more than ten Chinese miles west of Guishan Mountain.

Brown Earth and Green Trees

Traveling southwest from Xi'an, the plains stretch for thousands of miles, the Zhongnan Mountains are in sight, villages and towns are quickly passed, and the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard from time to time. The brown earth and green trees have a unique flavor.

After passing Qindu Town (Qindu Town is the location of the large sluice gate of the Fenghui Canal), there are more paddy fields, and willows surround the roads near the rice paddies, full of "Jiangnan sentiment." At this time, you will see many mountain peaks standing among the treetops, all appearing blue in the distance. Among these many mountain peaks, there is a lower mountain peak that forms a regular equilateral triangle, with a small temple on top. This is the one that is recognized as the "Chinese Pyramid"—Jianshan Mountain.

Sheer Cliffs

Jianshan Mountain is located more than fifty kilometers southwest of Xi'an and belongs to the territory of Feng County. The north side of the mountain is a sheer cliff, with no way to pass. However, the south side is not too steep. People who climb the mountain climb up the stone steps and vines from the South Mountain Road. It is more than five thousand meters high. Compared to the other mountains connected to it, it is a "younger" peak, but from the perspective of "danger," most of the other peaks are not comparable to it. The reporter and four others filled a pot of boiling water in a village at the foot of the mountain and bought more than a dozen eggs before setting off uphill. The mountain is made of stone, with no dripping water or large trees. There are only some mountain flowers, weeds, and Chinese medicines such as Chaihu and Yuanzhi. Now is the season of lush grass and blooming flowers, so the scenery is obviously beautiful. Reaching the top of the mountain, we climbed to the small temple. There are several trees next to the door. The temple consists of two main halls and two side rooms, enshrining statues of gods that have been slightly blackened by smoke. Looking north from behind the temple, the Wei River is like a belt, with a network of roads crisscrossing. Looking down the mountain, there are cliffs covered with vines, which are chilling.

Outward Transportation of Mountain Goods

To the east of the foot of the mountain is Taipingkou, one of the sources of the Feng River, with mountain roads leading to Ningxia, Shiquan, and other places. It is a small outlet for "mountain goods." Loads of "fire paper," wood ear, and lacquer are transported from the mountain outwards. It is said that the prices of these goods are very low in the mountains, but because they cannot be transported out and the transportation costs are too high, the cost of transporting them after "export" can be more than ten times higher. China's inconvenient transportation means that many materials cannot be used, which is regrettable.

Harvest in Guanzhong

After going down the mountain, the reporter asked an old man, "What was 'Jianshan Mountain' called in ancient times? What god is worshipped on the mountain?" He said, "It's just called Jianshan Mountain, and the mountain god is worshiped. That's all! I don't know..." We talked to him about this year's harvest. He told me a lot. In general, this year, the wheat in various counties in Guanzhong was mostly affected by "black smut" (i.e., black ear disease). The situation was serious in some places. Generally speaking, the areas west of Xianyang in Guanzhong had a more abundant harvest than last year. The harvest in the areas east of Chang'an was not as good as last year.

A Mountain Road

At the foot of the mountain, there is a mountain path leading west along the mountain. The locals call this road "Shenxian Road" (Road of Immortals). It is said that when Tang Sanzang went to "the Western Heaven" to obtain scriptures, he took this road. Although no one has walked on it for a long time and it is overgrown with weeds, people do not bury the road. Who says that the common people do not have a sense of nostalgia for the past?

About ten Chinese miles east along Shenxian Road is the Caotang Ancient Temple, which was the former residence of the famous monk "Kumarajiva" during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is also one of the "Eight Scenes of Shaanxi" during the Tang Dynasty. It is said that at that time, there was a well in the Caotang Temple, and every morning smoke came out of the well and flew to Chang'an, circling the city three times before disappearing. Some people say that it was "auspicious air," so the "Caotang Mist Closely Connected" in the Eight Scenes refers to this. When we went to see the ancient well, it was just a broken well, already collapsed, and there was really nothing to see.

Four Treasures of the Temple

However, the Caotang Temple still has its "four treasures," which can still be boasted in the major temples of Guanzhong. These are (1) Kumarajiva's Relic Pagoda, commonly known as the "Eight Treasure Jade Pagoda," which is about eight feet high. It is made of jade, has five layers, and is carved with patterns. The workmanship is quite exquisite and seems to be an "antique" without a doubt. (2) Guifeng Stele, this is a Tang Dynasty stele written by Pei Di, a friend of Wang Wei, and topped by Liu Gongquan. It has been rubbed by stele rubbing artisans for generations, and the characters have lost their sharp edges and are covered with broken marks. This stele is quite valuable among the rubbings in Chang'an. (3) History of Buddhist Transmission, about four feet high, recording the major monks and celebrities related to Buddhism from the Han Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty. I think if anyone wants to study the history of Chinese Buddhism, the ancient temples in the southern suburbs of Xi'an should have a lot of information. (4) Smoke and Mist Well, that is, the broken well.

Decline in Incense Offerings

Where is the "Chinese Pyramid"? In the southern suburbs of Western Capital, in the prosperous area of ancient China ("Guo Du Scenic Area"). However, it was not built by people, but is natural. It is not an accumulation of locust stone strips, but a single block. There are few tourists from afar here. There are only mountain visitors and old farmers, who occasionally go to the mountains to collect herbs during their hard lives. It is said that in these days of continuous warfare, the number of people burning incense is not as many as in the past.

Last year, when Li Xiannian's troops of the Chinese Communists disturbed the Qinling Mountains, Jianshan Mountain once donned military attire. Many bunkers were built in the villages around the mountain. Although the banditry has now been suppressed, Jianshan Mountain still has its new mission in maintaining peace in the Qin Zuo area.

### Jiangxi Cotton Fields

— Poyang, 15th, Airmail News by Our Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo

In Jiangxi, cotton is mainly produced in the alluvial lands around Poyang Lake, including Jiujiang, Hukou, Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, Leping, Fuliang, and other counties, where the area planted with cotton is relatively large. Jiujiang borders Konglong Township in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, and is a well-known cotton-producing area in Jiangxi Province. According to estimates by the China Cotton Mill Association, the combined production of the two provinces is about 300,000 dan. According to the association's estimates, the average cotton production in Jiangxi Province from 1919 to 1923 was 426,677 dan; in 1925, it was 807,000 dan; in 1927, it was 597,730 dan; and in 1929, it was 304,100 dan.

Area and Production

Jiangxi Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with rivers and lakes along its borders. The soil and climate are most suitable for cotton planting. The average cotton field area in the province is about 290,000 mu. According to the Jiangxi Economic Commission's estimate in 1933, the province had a total of 350,036 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 0.84% of the province's total cultivated land area. The counties with the most cotton fields were Gao'an and Hukou, each with more than 45,000 mu, followed by Jiujiang with more than 34,000 mu, Yongxiu with more than 32,000 mu, and Duchang and Fuliang with more than 20,000 mu each. Poyang, Yugan, and Yiyang each had more than 10,000 mu, while other counties had anywhere from several thousand mu to hundreds of mu. In 1935, the total area of cotton planted in the province was 378,674 mu, an increase of 280,000 mu compared to 1933.

Although more than 60 counties in the province plant cotton, because Jiangxi Province has always been the richest rice-producing area, most farmers are more inclined to plant rice in fertile land and are not very interested in planting cotton. In western and southern Jiangxi, either because the soil and climate are unsuitable, or because even dry land that is not suitable for rice planting is often converted to plant other crops. Their understanding and habits are only to strive to increase the production of miscellaneous grains and to underestimate the importance of cotton planting. Their labor is only to put in one point of effort and get one point of return. They do not pay attention to studying how to improve the soil or transplant newer agricultural techniques suitable for the soil.

The province's cotton production was about 70,000 dan in the past. According to a survey in 1935, the cotton field area in 29 counties of the province was 199,740 mu, and the total cotton production was 42,481 dan. In the recent eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the impact of the enemy's invasion, famine, and agricultural production, cotton production has declined even more. The planting area and lint cotton production increased in the three years from 1941 to 1943, while the rest decreased. The following table lists the province's cotton field area and lint cotton production from 1937 to 1945:

Year | Cotton Field Area (Municipal Dan) | Lint Cotton Production (Municipal Dan) | Comparison with 1937 | Increase/Decrease Percentage

[Missing values from table]

Excluding 1944 which had no statistics, the increase compared over the seven years totaled 24.800 municipal dan. In the early three years of the War of Resistance, the average annual decrease was about 30 percent. From 1941 onwards, there was an annual increase, with the largest increase in 1942, reaching 85.6 percent. Although there was a decrease in 1945, it was only a decrease of 10 percent.

Quality and Sales Channels

Most of the cotton seeds in Jiangxi Province are of the Huamian variety, and many are named differently depending on the region, but in reality, many different names share the same variety. For easy distinction, there are three types: white seed, black seed, and smooth seed. Among them, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, and a few other counties plant American cotton. Yongxiu's American cotton is of the "Tuozhi" variety, and the harvest results are still good. Most of the counties belong to the "Zhongmian" variety, and the best quality is Hukou's white-seeded cotton, which is the best variety of cotton in the province and has a considerable position among the domestic Zhongmian grades. What the Shanghai and Wuhan markets call Jiujiang cotton belongs to this cotton. Its special characteristics are strong development and high production. The yield of seed cotton per mu is consistently above 120 jin, or even 200 jin. However, because the fiber is short and coarse, it is not suitable for the needs of the times. Apart from this, most of the cotton production in Jiangxi Province is low. In recent years, the cotton field area and production in Leping, Fuliang, Dexing, and other counties in the upper reaches of Poyang Lake have increased compared to before the war, and the cotton quality is also quite good. Because there was very little cotton imported from other ports during the War of Resistance, the raw materials for inland handicraft cotton spinning were all supplied to the safe areas in the rear. As the value of cotton increased, planting became more prevalent. Therefore, the production of crops sometimes shifts according to environmental needs, and the past and present become opposites.

Because of its poor quality, most of Jiangxi cotton is used for cotton wadding for clothing and bedding in the province and for the inland handicraft textile industry. The surplus for export is only from Jiujiang, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, and other counties. The export quantity is only half of the production volume, and half of this was previously absorbed by the Jiuxing Yarn Factory in Xunshi. According to the Jiujiang Customs' statistics on Jiangxi cotton exports over the years, the largest was in 1930, totaling 70,809 dan, and the smallest was in 1920, totaling 466 dan. In 1931, it was 21,699 dan, and in 1932, it was 10,338 dan. In 1933, it was 22,072 dan, which is less than one percent of the cotton export volume of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei and other provinces.

Increased Production and Improvement

Before the war, the Jiangxi Office of the National Economic Commission, in view of the decline in the production and sales of Jiangxi cotton, formulated a plan to promote cotton planting and gradually implemented it. The measures to promote production include: (1) Improving cotton seeds, establishing cotton improvement farms, creating cotton seeds of superior quality and quantity, conducting regional trials separately, and using the "Tuozhi" American cotton in the Xiushui River basin and Hukou's white-seeded cotton in other counties. (2) Expanding cotton fields, selecting high and dry land that is not suitable for rice cultivation to convert to cotton planting. In the northern Jiangxi counties suitable for cotton planting, cotton planting must be compulsory, with each county increasing to at least 400,000 mu of cotton fields, creating northern Jiangxi as a broad cotton-producing area in the province. (3) Cooperative production and sales, with the cotton improvement farm assisting local organizations to form cotton production and sales cooperatives, providing seedling loans for cotton production, and directly selling to various yarn factories.

Regarding the development of textiles: (1) Establishing yarn factories in three phases, each phase lasting three years, to complete the establishment of 200,000 yarn spindles. Yarn factories will be established in Jiujiang, Nanchang, Ji'an on the Gan River, Hekou on the Xin River, Nancheng on the Fu River, and Yichun on the Yuan River in phases. The fineness and coarseness of the yarn and the number of yarn spindles will be appropriately allocated according to the quality and quantity of cotton produced, so that the textile industry in the province will develop evenly. (2) Promoting hand-weaving, with the Cotton Industry Improvement Committee purchasing 10,000 wooden looms and distributing them to rural cooperatives for use by women in various places. Saving labor and reducing costs. (3) Establishing bleaching and dyeing finishing factories, with a dyeing factory established in Nanchang specifically for the use of local cloth in various places.

Last year, the cotton production in Jiangxi Province was generally considered to be a good harvest. However, the area and production volume did not increase significantly. The cotton seedlings in the northern counties did not grow well due to excessive rainfall in the summer. After autumn, the weather was arid, and the late-stage development of cotton was greatly hindered, which was slightly less than the initial estimates. However, the area of ​​cotton fields in the inland slightly increased, which can be described as a good harvest compared to normal years.

Recently, the provincial government, concerned about the decline in cotton production in the province, plans to promote the use of high-quality cotton seeds starting this year. The Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will allocate Dezi cotton seeds and equip them with machinery to prevent insect pests. Hu Jingliang, a supervisor of the Ministry of Agriculture, came to Jiangxi from Hubei last winter to inspect cotton production and conducted thorough discussions with the Provincial Agricultural Institute. For this year's production increase plan, the Agricultural Institute also decided to actively promote the breeding and management of American cotton, and quickly plan to restore the Yongxiu cotton farm and expand the Hukou cotton experiment farm to improve cotton seeds. In the future, due to market needs, the cotton fields and production in Jiangxi Province may be able to promote the possibility of increased production.

### Dunhuang Art Exhibition: The Motherland's Precious Treasures Bring New Understanding to Taiwanese Compatriots

— Taipei 14th Dispatch, Our Reporter Yang Yu

"Dunhuang Art" has become a specialized term in today's art field. It is the greatest and richest artistic treasure that our motherland has left us. Bringing these achievements of our ancestors to Taiwan Province, which had been separated from the motherland for over fifty years and had only recently been recovered, for a public exhibition is more practical and effective than instilling any sense of motherland consciousness. Here, it can tell Taiwanese compatriots, whose understanding of the motherland's geography may be vague: that as far back as fifteen or sixteen hundred years ago, when the rest of the world was still mired in darkness, ignorance, and chaos, our ancestors were already creating such brilliant and outstanding art in the Dunhuang grottoes. Moreover, these were merely created by artisans.

Wall Paintings and Sculptures: Famous Works from the Six Dynasties and Northern Wei

The exhibition features nearly one hundred works, all copied by Mr. Pan Jiezi, a researcher at the Dunhuang Art Research Institute of the Central Research Academy, from the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang and the Yulin Grottoes of Anxi in the thirty-fourth year. To enhance the understanding of Taiwanese compatriots, a large map illustrating the eastward spread of Western culture and the blending of Chinese local art in Gansu's Dunhuang is displayed at the entrance of the venue. In this way, the reporter heard people softly asking at the venue: Where exactly is Dunhuang located in China? The origin of the Mogao Grottoes is also briefly explained in words here. "The ancient Yangguan road connects to Tianzhu (India), bordering Buddhist countries as neighbors. Monks joyfully come with alms bowls, stepping into the singing sands of Dunhuang." These are the opening four lines of Gao Yihan's "Song of the Dunhuang Grottoes." According to research, as early as 353 AD, grottoes began to be built here, the grotto walls were plastered with red clay, and sutra transformations (Buddhist sutra transformations), stories (records from Buddhist sutras), Bodhisattvas, illustrations, and patrons of the Buddha were painted. There were also Buddhist statues and sculptures. The earliest art from the Six Dynasties and Northern Wei dynasties reached the peak of perfection. Therefore, the most preserved works are from this period. The works from the Song and Yuan dynasties are covered in layers. It is said that several layers of works from different eras can be peeled off from the grotto walls.

Mogao Grottoes Inscription: Evoking Infinite Yearning

Many visiting Taiwanese compatriots lamented that we had not been able to properly preserve these national treasures. For decades, the Hungarian Stein, who acted as a spy for the British, spent only five hundred taels of silver to buy nearly twenty boxes of essential scriptures from Wang Yuanlu, a Taoist priest in Dunhuang who had begged for alms. These scriptures were sealed in a mud cave by Song Dynasty monks when they fled the Western Xia invasion, and they were shipped to London. The French professor Paul Pelliot followed suit and returned with a full load. By the time this art shocked the world, we, the descendants, could only shamefully inherit about seven thousand rolls of incomplete books and paper scraps. One Taiwanese compatriot asked me: "Can't we negotiate to get them back?" I blushed and gave him a bitter smile!

What intrigued the Taiwanese compatriots was a Mogao Grottoes inscription from the eighth year of the Yuan Zhizheng era, with six languages: Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Xixia, and Sanskrit. It illustrated the strength of that dynasty and evoked endless emotion and yearning.

Many visitors happily compared it to last year's provincial art exhibition as they looked at it. The works, which were full of Japanese flavor and lacked the simplicity and profound techniques and innocence, finally received an evaluation today. The magnificent and dignified Buddhist statues of the prosperous Tang Dynasty, the skilled lines of the Zhu Dynasty, and the well-structured styles of the Yuan Dynasty wrote a brilliant history in painting techniques that could look down upon the world's history.

Hair Styles of Prostitutes: The Japanese Imitate

Prostitutes of the Tang Dynasty who abandoned their lowly status and became virtuous were also patrons and were painted on the walls. Their hair styles were almost the same as those of Japanese prostitutes seen in today's pictures. In storybooks, several children were dressed in overalls and collarless shirts, similar to the currently popular Hong Kong shirts. These details elicited knowing smiles from the visitors.

Copying is not an easy task. The damaged parts need to be repaired, the missing parts need to be filled in, and the blurred parts need to be carefully copied. Mr. Pan said that he sat in the dark cave facing these faded wall paintings for a whole year. Although it was a belated effort, these works still show the nobility and greatness of the motherland, which has earned the author the most comforting reward. In particular, it is these treasures that can give Taiwanese compatriots who have returned to the embrace of the motherland a new understanding and a new harmony today. This joy does not belong to the reporter alone!

### The Yellow River Flood Area: Swords or Jade and Silk?

— Zhengzhou 14th Dispatch, Our Reporter Fan Shiqin

Some say that Greece has become a testing ground for the world's two major opposing systems. Then we can say: Our Yellow River flood area is actually a testing ground for settling disturbances with construction instead of force. There are still some communist troops there disturbing the local area. The government has already made up its mind: to rebuild this Yellow River flood area. In this reconstruction, will "swords turn into jade and silk" or will "jade and silk turn into swords"?

The refugees of the Yellow River flood area have been wandering for ten years before returning to their hometowns. Their feelings of sorrow and joy are self-evident. Now, the tens of thousands of refugees who are returning must first have a place to live and something to eat. If they want to eat what they grow or build houses with the sorghum stalks they harvest, then they must first have seeds to sow. If they have seeds to sow, they must have farm labor and livestock to help them cultivate. They have nothing and must start like primitive people.

From the Yellow River flood area, one can jump onto the Jinpu Railway to the east, the Longhai Railway to the north, and the Pinghan Railway to the west. It is located within the triangle of these three railways, making it convenient to enter and exit, which is rare in other parts of China. In the past, that area was the granary of the Central Plains, especially the grain produced in the areas of Qixian, Taikang, Huaiyang, and Suixian was particularly abundant. It is said that seven years ago, Huaiyang County alone produced four million dan of wheat per year, while Suixian County could produce 300,000 dan. Just in terms of cotton, Suixian County alone produced more than one million jin, and counties like Weichuan, Tongxu, Qixian, and Taikang all produced a large amount of cotton.

In order to cultivate cotton and wheat agricultural products, experts from the United Relief Headquarters hope to use tractors for large-scale cultivation and have conducted trials in Huaiyang and other places. According to those experts, it is not difficult to train farmers to use tractors, because they can first teach the students of the Henan University Agricultural College, then teach some high school students, then teach some primary school students, and finally the farmers will naturally also be able to use them. What they feel is difficult is that farmers have too little land ownership. For example, in Huaiyang, more than 50% of farmers have a maximum land ownership of only ten mu. For land used in such a scattered manner, it is simply impossible to use large-scale tractors for cultivation, rendering them useless. For this, those experts hope that farmers in every six or eight villages will cooperate to use tractors. If this is done, it will form a kind of collective farm. The Yellow River flood area is, in this regard, another testing ground for a new society.

From an industrial point of view, the Yellow River flood area needs to establish textile factories, flour mills, and oil presses (because the Yellow River flood area produces a large amount of peanuts and sesame), and on a smaller scale, brick and tile factories, shoe factories, mat factories, etc., for self-sufficiency. Regarding the former large-scale factories, the designers advocate establishing them in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, because these two places can use the coal from the Anyang, Jiaozuo, and Jixian areas as fuel. Zhengzhou is currently opening the first stepping stone for the future industrial construction of the Yellow River flood area, which is the preparation of an agricultural machinery manufacturing company with a capital of 2 billion yuan, of which the first phase of 1 billion yuan has been raised. It is said that this company can also manufacture tractors, so there is no need to import them from foreign countries.

In the Yellow River flood area, most of the young people in their twenties are illiterate. The education problem is very serious. There, the land is occupied by snakes and lizards, and people are plagued by fleas, lice, insects, and poisons. To this day, we have not heard an educator or hygienist discuss the education and health problems in the Yellow River flood area. The revival of the Yellow River flood area is not only a matter of agriculture and industry, but also a matter of education and hygiene that cannot be ignored. Since the government is determined to rebuild the Yellow River flood area, it is naturally unnecessary for the reporter to worry about these two aspects.

Everyone will doubt whether this Yellow River flood area can be rebuilt. For example, the United Relief's relief supplies are always becoming the target of communist looting. Then, in the future, while you are building, they will be destroying. Will your construction be successful or will their destruction be successful? If we truly admit that there can be no construction under destruction, then we must deny the fact that construction projects to block the breach were completed before the destructive raging floodwaters. Now, the few communist leaders scurrying around in the Yellow River flood area, like Lou Fengming and Jin Shaojiu, are all from the Yellow River flood area. Almost all of their subordinates are local people. If the construction work in the Yellow River flood area is done conscientiously, even if the communist leaders remain stubborn, their subordinates will feel that there is a broad road for them to take and will naturally break away from their leaders. In this way, destruction will bow before construction. Swords will turn into jade and silk. The reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area is small in the sense of rehabilitation, but great in the sense of settling disturbances with construction instead of force.

Spring and Autumn

### Teaching Field

— Hong Weifa

Kuang Zhouyi's "Selected Lane Miscellany" contains Yan Tingzhong's "Good Words of Yangzhou," set to the tune of "Looking South at the River," one of which says: "Yangzhou is good, taking a walk in the teaching field after a midday nap: a three-foot cloth stall talks about fate, four foreign mirrors reflect amorous feelings; caged crows compete in new songs." This is the scene of the Yangzhou teaching field in the late Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty. Based on what the author saw in his childhood, the writing can be said to be lifelike.

The location of the teaching field belongs to the new city. People from the new and old cities who go to the teaching field are generally called "going down to the teaching field." This word "down" is very special. In the author's childhood, every time he heard the words "going down to the teaching field," he felt a special sense of intimacy, because the teaching field was the place where children liked to linger the most.

Around the teaching field, in the past, there were almost only teahouses and noodle restaurants. Among them, there were also some elegant names, such as Cherishing the Remaining Spring, Emerald Green Spring, Jing Le Yuan, and Nine As Sitting Arrangements. These teahouses and noodle restaurants were places where adults gathered, but not playgrounds for children. What made the teaching field a playground for children was that there was a large open space in the center of the teaching field. In this open space, there was almost everything from food to play.

As far as the author can remember, many candies were made while being sold, such as peanut brittle, sesame brittle, and ginger candy. The children would watch the candy being made first, and only after a pot of candy was made would they take out money to buy it. They would eat a few pieces themselves and also bring a few pieces back. In the hearts of the children, it seemed that eating the candy that they watched being made had a different flavor than just being sweet, and they would feel a different kind of pleasure.

In addition to candy, the places selling insects, fish, flowers, and birds were also very popular with children. Insects were most abundant in summer and autumn, such as stinkbugs, golden crickets, katydids, and crickets. Children could buy and buy again along with bamboo cages, paper boxes, and mud pots. Goldfish were available except in the dead of winter. Most of them were very small. For these, the children could buy several at a time, happily showing off. In terms of flowers, herbaceous plants were the most common, because the price was not high. After the children bought them, it was fine if they withered. The parents would not make things difficult for them. In addition, birds such as larks and thrushes were expensive, so children could only stare at them with appreciation, but they could also buy a few small sparrows to feed.

In addition to the above, there were also those who ran horses to sell tricks and those who performed acrobatics. A group of people shouting "Rely on parents at home, rely on friends when out," "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water," and "Those with money throw money, those without money help out the scene," those so-called Jianghu people also gathered in the teaching field. Although the children didn't have money to throw, they would help out the scene, circling and drilling around the elbows and armpits of the adults on the scene, and their joy was boundless!

As for the "three-foot cloth stall talks about fate" mentioned in "Good Words of Yangzhou," there were actually different types such as character analysis, face reading, fortune-telling, marriage matching, as well as Wenwang divination, Diliuren, and even yellow bird holding cards, etc., scattered in various parts of the teaching field. The children didn't know about fate, but they were very curious, so they often gathered around the yellow bird holding cards. There were also many who wanted to see foreign scenes. Village girls and commoners liked them, and children also liked them. The so-called "four foreign mirrors reflect amorous feelings" was that the paper had one or two secret pictures, which those who wanted to see foreign scenes used to seduce the audience. After seeing them, the commoners were flushed with excitement, the village girls were red-faced, and the children had a sudden expression, but they couldn't openly talk about it. As for "caged crows compete in new songs," the children could only watch. Because the caged crows that competed in new songs were relatively noble. Those who showed off these relatively noble caged birds in the teaching field must be members of gangs in order to avoid being bullied. Originally, there were two types of bird viewing: muffled cages and bright cages. Muffled cages only had one side exposed, and this was available to ordinary people. If it was a bright cage, with no barriers on all sides, and they were not members of a gang, then someone would say, "Friend! Let me see it!" and snatch it from his hand.

Since the teaching field was changed to a vegetable market, many of these scenes have changed. White iron sheds are built on the open space, separated by rooms, which looks much neater, but loses some natural interest. Every day, most of the people coming and going are housewives buying fish, shrimp, vegetables, and fruits. Recently, passing by there occasionally, recalling the old clear scenery, it is truly lamentable!

### Beethoven and Salieri

— Oriental Mist

In 1823, "Music Sage" Beethoven wrote a letter to Salieri, saying: "I respect your work more than all other theatrical works. Every time I hear one of your new works, I am intoxicated, and my interest in it is greater than in my own works. In short, I respect you and love you... You have always been the one I respect most among my contemporaries, and if you would give me the immense honor of writing me a few words, that would be very comforting. Art unites people, especially true artists, and perhaps you would be willing to count me among these people." As it turned out, Salieri never replied to this letter.

### Eccentricities of Writers

— Peeping Through a Tube

The American literary giant Mark Twain liked to wear white clothes in winter.

The American writer Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.

A certain Hungarian novelist and playwright refused to write without using purple ink.

The English writer Farrer wrote all his works standing up.

It should be said that a ghost always followed him.

The French poet Lantree dyed his hair green, claimed to eat human flesh, and lived with snakes all day long.

Shelley folded important letters and hundred-yuan bills into small boats and threw them into the river.

The Englishman Carroll wore black gloves in the summer and wrapped everything in his suitcase separately when traveling.

Dumas only wrote novels on blue paper, only wrote poetry on yellow paper, and wrote short essays on rose-colored paper. But he did not use blue ink.

Despin Lasafa spent many hours every day catching spiders.

The Italian poet D'Annunzio took an umbrella to London and taxed over there very much.

### Songs of Northern Jiangsu

— Zhang Mingchun

Recently, in the "Local Teaching Materials of Taixian" compiled by Shu Rongsong, I found the following two folk songs:

One,

The sun rises in the east, yellow and bright,

Village girls are busy in the fields;

Flower shoes are taken off on the bank,

Pants are rolled up to transplant rice seedlings.

Two,

Coming early in the morning,

The dew is heavy,

I see my sweetheart off on the road;

My flower shoes are wet from running,

How can I go home to see my in-laws?

I lied in front of my in-laws,

Saying I went to the fields to check the rice seedlings:

The early rice fields lack water,

The late rice fields have more weeds,

The soybeans have many empty shells,

The sesame fields have many sparrows.

The in-laws smiled happily,

Truly a good housewife.

Reading these two folk songs, it is as if reading the folk customs in the Book of Songs, making people feel fresh, lively, and full of wild interest. Compared with the works of cultivated poets in the city, it is like comparing a healthy village girl with a city beauty, and one always feels that the latter is too made up and loses its naturalness.

The second one is particularly lovely, and I think there is also an important factor, which is that it can combine labor and love. In order to explain it, it may be helpful to compare it with two famous Hakka mountain songs. One,

Washing vegetables by the pool,

That dear brother is quarrying stones,

If you want to take a vegetable,

You love your sister, come to feed her at night.

Two,

The moon sets over the mountain step by step,

Younger sister carries water out of the riverbank,

A silver coin is secretly dropped into the sister's bucket,

Instructing the younger sister not to bolt the door.

Washing vegetables and carrying water, blended with flirting and secret appointments, clearly shows the shamefulness and odiousness of those young masters and young ladies who do not engage in production but appear as love experts.

The author has a particular fondness for the two Taixian folk songs mentioned above. Indeed, what they praise is the peaceful scene of the northern Jiangsu countryside before it collapsed, at least the prosperous era of the early Republic of China. Now, singing them slowly in a low voice, it is as if one is in a paradise, faintly hearing the chickens and dogs of the village, enough to temporarily forget reality and enjoy a moment; it not only evokes the scenes of childhood rural life. It is a pity that today's farmers are in no mood to sing this light tune.

From the early Republic of China to before the Anti-Japanese War, the countryside was bankrupt, and farmers could not live in peace and work, so they had to "lightly" move to the city, especially Shanghai, to make a living. After mixing around, they could only maintain a minimum animalistic life, so they sang this bitter short song:

Shanghai is good to make money,

It's been many years since I left,

I want to go home,

But I don't have travel expenses!

During the Anti-Japanese War, the people of northern Jiangsu, in addition to being deprived of all human rights, also had to pay grain and miscellaneous taxes to the various governments, so they specialized in singing, no, crying like this:

The captain slapped his gun,

The district chief bought fields and built houses,

The township chief ate big fish and big meat,

The village head wore colorful clothes,

The common people cried loudly in pain!

Here, it should be added that what the common people hated was not specifically the above-mentioned people. They had already listed the enemy and traitors in the "super hate" list, regarding them as tigers and wolves, and disdaining to vent their anger with folk songs. Who has ever found a folk song that hates tigers?

In the period approaching victory, many middle and lower-class families were unable to make a living due to the exploitation of being sucked dry, so they had to exchange their daughters' chastity and happiness for survival. When many rural girls married or were hired by the small leaders of the armed classes, the following songs that were both tearful and funny were produced.

The girl married the captain,

The family finally has someone to support them;

The girl followed the conscription soldier,

It really made the old mother heartbroken.

After the victory, northern Jiangsu suffered even greater disasters. They lived a life of seeking death but not being able to get it in the gunpowder and bloody air. Even if there was a Li Youcai II who was good at writing songs, I am afraid he would have no leisure to create. Moreover, even if folk songs appeared that could observe customs and know the gains and losses, people with numb hearts and wooden spirits—in fact, they didn't listen at all—would think that they violated the traditional poetic education of gentleness and honesty.

### Articles and Prices

— Zhongqi

A female reader who admired a certain famous novelist visited the writer for the first time. After she looked around his house, a kind of disappointment that could not be concealed appeared on her face.

"Is something wrong?" the host asked.

"Yes," the woman admitted, "the house you described in your writings is so magnificent and grand, I don't understand why you live in such a humble place yourself?"

"Dear friend," the novelist replied, "Unfortunately, the value of articles is not as expensive as the price of goods!"

### Open a Canal to Make Statues for Me, Write Bamboo to Repay

— Ye Gongchuo

I dusted off paper to write bamboo, and Fan Jinjun will pass on my spirit. I don't know if there is an image or no image, the scattered shadows still exist in this body.

### Bamboo and Rock

### Remembering "Literary Friends"

— Xiao Kangshi

Sixteen years ago, it was a prosperous period for supplements in major newspapers in Shanghai. At that time, Zhou Jichen, Chen Liang, Zhou Tianyu, Wu Chengda, and the author, etc., more than a dozen people, often wrote for the "Spring and Autumn" and "Local Supplement" of Shen Bao, "New Garden Forest" and "Local Supplement," "Tea Talk" of Xinwen Bao, and "Night Voice" and other supplements of Xinwen Evening News. They organized a "Literary Friends Society" and published a kind of "Life Road Weekly." The writers were all friends who contributed to Shen and Xin newspapers. In less than a year, there were more than 300 members, and branches were all over Suxi and other places.

"Literary Friends" took "making friends through literature" as its purpose. I remember the first gathering was in Bansong Garden in Nanshi. Afterwards, a grand get-together was made in Nanjing Hotel. After that, football matches and excursions were also held.

Since the "August 13th" cannon fire invaded Shanghai, the members of the "Literary Friends" society did not communicate with each other for eight years. At the beginning of the victory, there was a small narrative. On the 22nd of this month, it was the second expanded gathering after the victory. The location of this gathering was the "Lianyi Club" in the Nanyang Shopping Mall. More than 30 guests and members, including Zhan Duhe, Yu Kongwo, Guo Yongxi, Feng Ruomei, Zeng Yan, Han Jingqi, Zhou Jichen, Chen Liang, Zhu Zhensheng, Zhang Mengfei, Rui Hongchu, Zhu Tingyun, Mu Yilong, Zhang Shizhou, and the author, etc., more than 30 people, after ten years of war, the members were scattered, and the world was vicissitudes, which is not a false statement.

The meal was "clean and refined" Sichuan cuisine. Mr. Duhe gave a speech during the banquet, using "clean and refined" to enlighten our "Literary Friends," deducing the "clean and refined" of articles to the "clean and refined" behavior of literary friends, and his words were very alarming. Secondly, Mr. Guo Yongxi and Kongwo Han Jingqi and other gentlemen delivered speeches. Zhang Mengfei and Fan Wencai, two gentlemen, played storytelling and performed an opening chapter on the spot; there was also Zhou Sheng's Kunqu opera, Zeng Yan's humor, and Jing Anbang's magic, all of which won endless applause.

After this dinner gathering, "Literary Friends" decided to restore the organization, and the correspondence address will be set up in the Feibao Newspaper Office. Under the "remaining life of sorrow and hardship," to learn from each other and discuss the "bitter classics," in order to seek cleanness and refinement, is also a happy event in life.

[Editor's note] People engaged in literary writing and those who love literature tend to easily become friends. One reason is that there is a common tendency in spirit, and the other is that mutual understanding can be increased from the works. The era of "women despising each other" should have passed. Especially from the war to the present, the status of writers in society has not only deteriorated, but also their lives have become increasingly difficult. When the Shanghai Writers Association was established, I also said "Works are not divided into new and old, thoughts are not divided into left and right, styles are not divided into Jing and Hai, and ages are not divided into old and young." We must communicate and cooperate harmoniously. We must also follow Zhuangzi's so-called "When the spring dries up, the fish live on land, giving each other moisture with saliva," being friendly and united, and helping each other from unity. Today, reading Mr. Kangshi's manuscript, I am delighted to hear that "Literary Friends" has restored the organization, and will seek clean and refined behavior from the clean and refined articles. As well as the recent establishment of the Chunniao Poetry Society, these are all gratifying things in the literary world in Shanghai. I specially add a few words to express my congratulations.

### A Writer Praised by Tolstoy

— Eastern Mist

Count L. Tolstoy, the author of the monumental work "War and Peace," was by nature quite eccentric and at times an arrogant man. However, among his contemporary writers in the same country, there were many whom he appreciated. For example, he had high praise for Chekhov's short story "The Darling." Furthermore, in his diary, he wrote: "Every great artist must create his own form; if the content of art is infinitely diverse, its form is also like that… We remember all the good works in Russian literature, and their forms are entirely original. As for Gogol, it goes without saying; even take his 'Dead Souls,' what is it? It is not a novel, nor a story, but something entirely original. Then there's the best work written by Turgenev—'A Sportsman's Sketches'; Dostoevsky's 'The House of the Dead' and 'Childhood'; Herzen's 'A Family Drama'; and Lermontov's 'A Hero of Our Time,' and so on."

### Two Prose Pieces

— Zhong Ling

Lamp

Are we heading towards dawn?

Now that the dim torch has shed its last tear, darkness begins to constrict around me. My warmth, the comfort of my soul, will be consumed in this lonely and desolate night. I dare not try to draw back the azure curtain with trembling hands, because outside the window, there is a darkness woven from gloom and emptiness, upon which hideous faces are floating; here, there, greedy tongues are stretching out!

Is the wind blowing through the woods the howling of ghosts? Is the rustling of falling leaves the weeping of ghosts?

Ah! I am afraid.

I have lost the lamp, I have lost the light. Is the night still long?

What to do? ——

Thinking that the lamp will conquer the darkness of the night, bolstering the infinite courage of the lonely…

Thinking that the lamp will sweep away the cold and desolation around, giving me warmth, giving me a sense of comfort…

Thinking that the lamp will reveal the original faces hidden in the darkness, giving me solace…

Like a martyr piously offering his life for his belief in truth, I expect that goodness will have a bright lamp.

Pillow

I once loved the dreams of summer, I once loved this bridge of dreams.

Like the delicate fragrance of lilac, like the tenderness of a bee’s stinger, so softly and skillfully it unveils the brocade box of my daytime fantasies. …

After all, with a pillow, I have no worries. It encourages my energy for the struggle of life; it constantly reminds me that there is a very clear boundary between joy and pain.

From then on, disregarding the hideousness of darkness, the desolation and loneliness of night, slowly, step by step; a delicate fragrance, a tender emotion, brings comfort to my heart.

I often depart from the noise of the city and go to this bridge of dreams to retrieve the fragments of my lost youth. When I look up, I see the inexplicable depression in my heart, incessantly flowing towards the riverbed of a tranquil blue sky. I have never been hurt by any curses or resentments in the world.

So many countless long nights, I quietly embrace the vast storehouse of distant thoughts, throwing myself into the embrace of this dream, gently, blessing it for its eternal youth and companionship with me.

### Jottings on Reading Songs

— Xiao Zao

(1) Waves Beat Stone City

Liu Yuxi's preface to his "Five Poems on Jinling" says: "'The mountain gardens and the old kingdom are all around; the tide beats against the empty city, returning in loneliness. The old moon east of the Huai River still passes over the parapet in the deep night.' Bai Juyi shook his head and chanted sorrowfully, contemplating it for a long time, and said: The poem on Stone City says, 'The tide beats against the empty city, returning in loneliness.' I know that later poets will not be able to add a single word."

The line "Tide beats against the empty city" is appreciated by songwriters and used extensively. Yuan Dynasty writer Dou Eci Jin Yao wrote about ancient times: "Listen to the deep night, the loneliness beats the isolated city, the spring tide is swift." The application is superb, making it popular and well-known.

Also, Wu Meicun's "Linchunge Genealogy: Madame Xian Mobilizes for Royal Affairs" says:

"Don't think about the mountains surrounding the cold old palace, the tide beating against the empty city, the blood of the cuckoo choosing the southern branches directly below. It's just that I stand in the west wind, scratching my white hair, only able to cry towards the horizon, entrusting my heartbreak to the crying crows. Who faces the fallen flowers at the river's edge? Ah, my eyes, unable to see the Stone City carriage, ah, my tears, unable to sprinkle on the cultivated pines and junipers, only year after year, autumn moon and sorrowful bugle."

Compared to the line "I was originally the chickens and dogs of Huainan, not following the immortals to return to the human world," it is even more moving.

(2) Chang'e's Grievance and the Book of Han

Guan Hanqing's Yuan Dynasty Zaju play "The Injustice of Dou E, Moving Heaven and Earth" has already been listed as one of the world's famous tragedies today. Operas and theaters have staged it many times, and translated works are especially numerous. The "June Snow" story circulating among our people is adapted from one or two plays about Dou E's grievance, but the vulgar language loses too much of the truth. Guan's original work has excellent dialogue and can be called a masterpiece. There is a passage that says: "Don't say that I am reciting the deceased daughter to reduce her sins, but it is only pitiful to see the three years of great drought in Chuzhou Prefecture. In the past, Yu Gong once defended the filial woman of the East Sea, and indeed it was that which evoked the spiritual rain like a spring. How can it be shirked off by saying that natural disasters have always existed? Don't you think that the people's intentions can communicate with heaven? Today, re-correcting the documents, it shows that the laws of the King do not allow the people to be wronged."

Checking the "Filial Woman of the East Sea" in the Former Book of Han: "There was a filial woman in the East Sea who was widowed early and had no children. She cared for her mother-in-law very diligently. Her mother-in-law wanted to marry her off, but she refused. Her mother-in-law told the neighbors, saying: 'The filial woman cares for me diligently. I am old and have long burdened the young men.' Then she hanged herself. The daughter of the mother-in-law told the officials, saying: 'The wife killed my mother.' The officials examined the matter urgently, and the filial woman falsely confessed. The entire case was submitted to the prefect. Prefect Chu ordered the woman to be killed. The prefecture experienced a three year drought. Later, a new prefect went to the tomb of the filial woman and personally sacrificed, and the heavens immediately poured down heavy rain, and the crops ripened." The Later Book of Han, Bi Mao's biography, says: "In the past, the filial woman of the East Sea suffered injustice and was killed unjustly. Her wronged spirit moved and transformed, and the heavens responded with drought." Although such consciousness is very corrupt and backward and not worth mentioning, it can be seen from this that most of the stories in ancient scripts were based on records.

(3) Zhao Yi (Oubei) Did Not Write Plays
During the Qing Dynasty, there were many cultural composers, including Hong Sheng, Kong Shangren, Jiang Shiquan, Li Yu, and Huang Bianqing, among whom were particularly noteworthy. Only Zhao Yi (Oubei) did not compose. In the "Oubei Poetry Collection" there is a poem that says: "Unable to bear the idleness, some advise me to write miscellaneous dramas to pass the time, but I am old, how can I do this cunning thing? I refuse."

"Middle age is easy to be sentimental, so I should use silk and bamboo to dispel the fleeting time. How can I bear the flowers and the moon, Zhang San's shadow? I composed Zhao Wuniang on the pipa myself. Luo Yin had three generations of mutes, and Guo Men Gao died in the end.

Only Wang Mingtang Kaiyuan remains, leaving a clear fragrance on the battlefield."

It is permissible for literati not to write plays and novels, but to take Shi Nai'an and Guo Men Gao as warnings is unavoidable, as if eating one millet and being punished by a hundred beating is like Han Yu's ambition to be a historian. (Note: Guo Men Gao was the pseudonym used by Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang when he appeared on stage in court dress.)

### Rambling Musings on Solitude

— Wang Cong

Milton said:

"Where no hope is left, is left no fear." From this sentence, I thought of another poet who said that hope and fear are inseparable. There is no one who hopes without fear, nor one who fears without hope.

We might as well let go of the threads of our thinking and gallop through our past life experiences, and we will believe the above sentence without reservation.

Prejudice often causes suffering between people.

However, to completely remove subjectivity, that is, to completely remove prejudice from conversation or writing, is both unnecessary and absolutely impossible. It is just like there being no absolute vacuum in the world.

The American biographer Emil Ludwig's view is correct. He said that we read Xenophon's and Tacitus's greatest historical works about their own times precisely because we find them fascinating because of their prejudices. There is a big difference between personal views and partisanship. Only writers who transcend partisan feelings and interests can have fair arguments.

People will have different choices for everything. The attitude of taking or leaving implies one's own prejudices. The so-called objectivity has its own considerable limits.

Kant's so-called Critique of Pure Reason, in my humble understanding, is not too simple a question.

The impossibility of absolute objectivity is just like we cannot put our soul into the body of the blue sky.

Therefore, Sologub's interpretation of neo-realist literary works is not merely simple realism, but must contain the writer's sharp criticism. Naturally, these criticisms cannot follow popular opinion in order to seek objectivity.

My conclusion is that prejudice is not a bad thing. The problem is whether it can leap over the fence of selfishness. If one can think more for the opposite side for five minutes, this so-called prejudice will not mislead the world.

### Casual Chat of a Train Person, Part One

— Train Person

Editor's note: "Train Person" is one of our contributing writers. Because he does not wish to reveal his real name, he is publishing under a pseudonym. Readers should take note.

For the past few months, due to my profession, I have had to travel back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai line almost every week. This short journey of more than 300 kilometers would not have been complicated, but after traveling back and forth three or five times, I realized that I was almost daily related to the Beijing-Shanghai train line. For example—

Sunday, I take the train from Nanjing to Shanghai, using a ticket that I obtained from the office three days earlier.

Monday, in Shanghai, I start preparing for my ticket back to Nanjing.

Tuesday, the ticket back to Nanjing is in my hands.

Wednesday, in Shanghai, I jump on the night train back to Nanjing.

Thursday, I arrive at the Xiaguan train station in Nanjing in the morning.

Friday, in Nanjing, I start preparing for my ticket back to Shanghai again.

Saturday, the ticket to Shanghai is in my hands;

If I continue to travel back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai, the above seven days of actions will have to be repeated…

What kind of life is this—hence some call me "Train Person"—however, 26 years ago, it was only necessary to buy a round-trip ticket between Beijing and Shanghai once a week to be considered "all under heaven is peaceful"!

The name "Train Person" is not too awkward, and because I have become a "Train Person," all kinds of things related to trains naturally leave a particularly easy impression; now I will temporarily record some of them below.

A Polish Person

On one occasion, a Polish person sat with me and said that he had been in China from Warsaw for nearly half a year and was very satisfied with the equipment on the Beijing-Shanghai line. The European railways he had recently traveled on could not compare to the Beijing-Shanghai line. This kind of national diplomatic speech at least did not make me feel uncomfortable; but later when I talked to him about his journey from Poland to China, I learned that the European countries he had recently passed through were Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Poland. Of course, the European railways he had recently passed through were also the railways of Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Poland. So "cannot compare to" and so on, whether it was diplomatic speech or not, was really enough to make one taste it carefully!

Answer the Name · Increase Salary

A month ago, the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai line asked passengers for their consent to increase fares in order to increase salaries. According to reports, more than 10,000 passengers have signed their approval for the price increase. We should express our sympathy and seek to raise the low salaries of the employees, but it is said that the Beijing-Shanghai line has about 50 million passengers every year. If the above-mentioned "more than 10,000 people" is correct, then this number compared with "50 million people" is inevitably a percentage that is close to ironic!

Fortunately, this problem was soon resolved by the state allocating subsidies, saving social statisticians from having to XY it!

Dust and DDT

The weather is hot, and mosquitoes and bedbugs are out. For travelers, this is certainly an unpleasant thing, at least! But the Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers reported half a month ago that the authorities of the Beijing-Shanghai line use DDT every day to disinfect the passenger cars. Good news! Good news related to national health! I think this must be truly a well-deserved message, especially since it is the holy product of the golden ocean ally. The spirit of service of the railway authorities is really remarkable. All in all, several tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of DDT must be used every summer. From then on, the national health will inevitably have a new good atmosphere!

But it must be said that the spraying of DDT is probably carried out in the passenger car's "maintenance field" (please forgive me for borrowing the term from the highway), and it is difficult for us people boarding at the station to witness it, but what we witness is the cleanliness of the car. The dust and dirt in the third and fourth class cars are all over the floor, chairs, and even walls, so there is no need to publicize it much. Even in the first and second class cars, the dust is only transformed into ashes but still exists. The railway authorities do not seem to have any news of dealing with this dust and dirt. Perhaps this is the misfortune of mosquitoes and bedbugs but the good fortune of dust and dirt. Otherwise, perhaps the golden ocean allies have not yet developed magic medicines and tricks to remove ash and dust, so the railway authorities have nothing to draw on or imitate!

Clean Water and Electricity Categories

This must be said again: I think "water" is something that should be available in every country, everywhere, and the method and equipment for preparing "water" in passenger cars should have long been familiar to the railway authorities or their subordinates. Of course, this does not require the invention of the golden ocean allies. However, in the passenger cars of the Beijing-Shanghai line, only one of the third and fourth class cars has water, and almost half of the first and second class cars have no water. So although both ends of the car have that ashy black little washbasin and a seemingly half-dead little "faucet," it is difficult to find a spoonful of clean spring water to wash off the mixture of ash and sweat on the hands of the passengers, or to wash off the "blood plasma" left on the hands of the passengers by mosquitoes and bedbugs!

This may be said to be negligence on the part of the car, but their non-negligence is placed elsewhere. For example, the electric lights in any passenger car, they never forget to save money, so the electric lights are so few that passengers can only distinguish how many finger joints they have on their hands at night, while the sleeping cars are as bright as day. Also, for example, meals, they never forget to try their best to increase the price, so the meals are more expensive than any restaurant in Shanghai, while the portions are less than any restaurant in Shanghai. A large part of their plan is only to teach passengers to be hungry, not to teach passengers to be full—however, the people in charge of this kind of plan are public servants who manage the railway for the country! Perhaps none of this has anything to do with national health, in the calculations of these public servants!

Reasons for Increasing

Recently there was another thing that came out of their calculations that was even more incomprehensible. On June 17, various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published the news that "railway prices will increase by 200%," and the reason for this increase was:

In recent months, the expenditures of the Yinlu and Postal Bureaus have increased daily, and the losses have been increasing daily. The income of the two lines (Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou) in April was about 26.2 billion yuan, and the expenditure was about 32.1 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of about 5.9 billion yuan, and the losses in May were even more than this number, so the price increase is inevitable.

We slightly pick up our passenger's abacus and tap it, and we find that once this increase is implemented, then the number of 26.2 billion belonging to income will not be difficult to immediately become 78.6 billion, in other words, it is "turning one into three," but then, for the sum of 32.1 billion belonging to expenditure, I don't know what the public servants of the railway bureau can calculate in their calculations! I think that in the commonly used general calculation method, the price index should of course be used as the basis for calculating the increase or decrease. The basis for the railway's special calculation method is of course not something that we passengers can guess, but in general terms of prices, if the three times the income from the actual price increase is used to offset the number of expenditures, it is obviously more than enough, so why increase the price to 200% at once!

So "price increase is inevitable" and so on is inevitably just the railway authorities' "belly scripture." Although it is not necessary to immediately call it a hammer on the passengers' heads!

With my experience as a train person, I close my eyes and think: In the past two or three months, the railway authorities have promoted a lot of "belly scriptures" to society!

### "The Sword and the Lute"

— Shi Feng

If you are a lover of the violin or classical music, then I believe that "The Sword and the Lute," which is currently showing at the Majestic Theatre, will give you great satisfaction. You can carefully appreciate it, whether in the script, acting, or music.

"The Sword and the Lute" not only tells us the story of the rise to fame of the world-renowned violin virtuoso Paganini, but also deeply points out that great and sincere love cannot be forced by money and status. It is an immortal faith and inspiration that grows forever in the fields of love. If Paganini had not met his lover, Jenny, his achievements in music might not have been as brilliant as they are today. Of course, the encouragement and assistance of his manager, Jimmy, was also one of the reasons for his success; but it was only Jenny who inspired him to muster the courage to devote himself to playing. For her sincere and close love, he could sacrifice everything to duel with his rival in love—Paul. Although he was not a swordsman, the fire of love burned fiercely in his heart, making him bravely gamble everything for his destiny!

Stewart Granger, the handsome leading man who played in "Sorrowful Jones," perfectly portrays Paganini's stubborn, decisive, and passionate character. Many violin performances are presented in graceful poses. His facial expressions depict the different emotions revealed in his heart, whether it is sorrow, anger, hatred, or passion. As for Phyllis Calvert, who plays Jenny, she also achieved success in acting. I believe that many viewers will be moved by her extraordinary acting skills. She portrays Jenny's infinite joy and passion when the love that has long been planted in her heart for Paganini suddenly erupts very sincerely and deeply. Later, under the control of cruel fate, she had to say goodbye to Paganini. At that moment of soul loss, she asked him to play a piece for her. So, in the plaintive, weeping, leisurely, and desolate violin music, she left Paganini with a heart full of resentment, disappointment, sadness, and attachment that could not be expressed! She loved him, and the violin was her life, how could she leave him!

However, sincere love is immortal. At the concert in the Vatican, Paganini played the piece from their separation again. Jenny could no longer bear it. She felt that only his violin music could exist in her heart forever. Money and status are just fleeting clouds. Sincere love is eternally valuable. She finally threw herself into Paganini's arms again.

The behind-the-scenes performance of modern violin master Yehudi Menuhin contributed to the musical success of the film. His technique is worth appreciating.

This is a film worth seeing, even seeing again. I would like to recommend it to all those who love music and pursue true love.

### Homework

— Jing

The teacher gave a very difficult arithmetic problem as homework. Only Tom, the dumbest in the class, got the right answer.

"Your brother must have helped you with it," the teacher said to Tom.

"No, he did it himself," Tom said honestly.

Why Does Swimming Have to Be in a Pool?

Upper-class Chinese people living in Shanghai feel the lack of swimming pools. Going to Gaoqiao to swim seems too far. The swimming pools in the city that are privately run are small and expensive, and if there are too many people, they are not very hygienic. In the United States, there are places to swim in every city, but they are not limited to swimming pools. Most are on the banks of streams. Some have the banks slightly piled up, becoming like swimming pools. Some are simply natural, with green grass and lush thanks wood, embellished with red and green swimming suits, which is much more beautiful than artificial swimming pools. In southern cities such as San Antonio, Austin, and the San Marcos River cross, there are places to swim everywhere. Local residents choose places where the river channel is relatively neat and the river bed is relatively flat, build diving platforms, and build cold drink rooms on the shore, which becomes a swimming pool, and swimming tickets can be sold in the same way. The fountains in the park usually accommodate children swimming. Since the pool is not deep, there is no need for lifeguards. There are still plenty of public gardens in Shanghai, and some have the beauty of vast lakes and algae. It seems that the existing ponds can be slightly modified to make them swimming pools. The municipal authorities spend very little, and it is of great benefit to the health of the citizens. With Shanghai's dense population, 20 or 30 swimming pools are not enough to meet the needs of the citizens. Since summer is approaching, our wise municipal authorities, who have high and bright garden villas to escape the heat, I wonder if they have ever thought of the ordinary people who are huddled in attics and between ten compartments? In the United States, the common practice is to pay 25 cents for swimming each time, which is 7,000 or 8,000 yuan at the black market rate. Calculated by 1% of Shanghai citizens, the income is quite considerable. Using this to repair the swimming pool has more than enough surplus, and it will definitely not affect the municipal budget. Merchant ships sailing the sea still have deck swimming pools. Modern cities, how can they not have them! (2)

### The Death of Ji Kang—One of Miscellaneous Essays on Figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties

— Zhou Leng

Historians have always described the figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties as uninhibited and affected. Kang was naturally one of them. His "Letter of Severance with Shan Juyuan" contains a passage that is a perfect self-description:

"I was orphaned early, seeing my mother and elder brother in distress. I didn't delve into the classics, and my nature is lazy. I don't wash my head and face for fifteen days a month, and I don't mind much, being unable to bathe. I often urinate and can't bear to get up, only getting up when my bladder is slightly full. Moreover, I have been indulging for a long time, my anger and arrogance are unrestrained, simplicity is contrary to propriety, laziness and slowness have become my nature, yet I am lenient with my friends and don't attack their faults."

When he offended Zhong Hui and was falsely accused and sentenced to death, Chen Shou also wrote about him vividly: "As Kang was about to be executed in the Eastern Market, he looked at the shadow of the sun, took the zither and played it, saying: 'In the past, Yuan Xiaomin often followed me to learn Guangling San, and I always cherished it. Guangling San is now lost forever!'" From life to death, he was always unrestrained and unconventional, so it's hard to avoid such criticism.

However, when viewing the ancients with modern eyes, the advantage is that we are far removed from them, and gains and losses are irrelevant, so our views are not biased and our arguments are more fair. But the disadvantage is that we are too far removed from them and often cannot feel the era in which they lived, imagining ourselves in their position from all sides. As a result, we inevitably miss the point and fail to discover the true meaning of the facts. The Wei and Jin periods were notoriously chaotic and dark. In half a lifetime, the dynasty changed twice. The higher-ups openly usurped power on one side, while using various excuses to cover up their crimes on the other. The lower-downs were busy fighting for power and profit on one side, while preventing others from intervening on the other. The literati with conscience had no choice but to feign madness and be cynical with a heart of sorrow and pain, self-anesthetizing themselves with medicine and wine, and using the method of "speaking about other things" to avoid attention and pass the long, dull, dark days.

The "Difficult Times" chapter of the Outer Chapters of Baopuzi says it well:

"Those who exhaust their integrity without concealment can be employed. But if you want your words to be accepted and your body and mind to be at ease, you must wait for the right time. In times of adversity, treacherous and evil people are jealous of what they cannot achieve, suppressing those above and below, hating the upright and disliking justice, fearing the impartial attacks on evil and injustice. Therefore, they strive to eliminate those who surpass them, to relieve their resentment... So that those who practice the art of cherishing life, on the contrary, incur the crime of immediate death, and those who offer plans to pacify the emperor, instead suffer the calamity of endangering themselves. Therefore, it is said that it is not the difficulty of speaking, but the difficulty of speaking out."

The Kang Zhuan says: "Wang Rong himself said that he lived with Ji Kang in Shanyang for twenty years and never saw him show joy or anger." It seems that Ji Kang had long been mindful of his own cultivation, but unfortunately, his cultivation was not sufficient, and he offended the powerful with "What did you see when you came? What will you see when you leave?" and ended up with a death sentence.

Ji Kang, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, died an unnatural death. Talking about wild and strange things and offending others, Ruan Ji was even worse than him. Talking about disregarding propriety and indulging in his own desires, Liu Ling and the others were not inferior. Why did the autocratic axe fall on his neck alone? According to my speculation, it was probably because he had no backstage support. The Ji Kang Zhuan says: "At first, Kang was poor, and he and Xiang Xiu forged iron under a large tree to support themselves." Naturally, those who bully others always start with those who are easy to bully. Liu Ling and the others didn't have his great reputation, but Ruan Ji had a great general backing him up. He had no special connections, but he refused to buy anyone's account. As a result, he was naturally doomed to die.

Book of Jin, Volume 49, Biography of Ji Kang:

"Kang met a hermit, Sun Deng, in the mountains. Deng said: 'Your talent is great, but your opinions are few, so it is difficult to avoid the present world!' When he encountered the Lü An incident, he became conceited and said: 'I want to reduce my faults, but slander is rife. My nature does not harm things, but I often invite resentment. I used to be ashamed of Liu Xia, but now I am ashamed of Sun Deng. I have guilt in my heart and betray my good friends!'"

In fact, what Sun Deng pointed out was not necessarily entirely correct, and Uncle Ye himself also vaguely admitted it.

If you want to be noble and aloof, you should also have some capital!
