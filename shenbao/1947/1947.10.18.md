### Report on Wedemeyer's Visit to China: Marshall to Issue Statement Reaffirming Support for China's Democratic Development

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Although President Truman announced on the 16th that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement in the next few days regarding Envoy Wedemeyer's report on his visit to China, observers here generally believe that if Marshall were to disclose any information from this closely guarded secret document, it would not reveal too much of its content. Speculation regarding the content of Envoy Wedemeyer's report, especially the increasing speculation about aid to China proposed in the report, and the growing criticism caused by the delayed release of the report's findings, have compelled U.S. officials to respond to the matter. At a press conference on the morning of the 16th, when a reporter asked if the President would make General Wedemeyer's report public, President Truman seemed to have a plan in mind. He immediately replied that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement on the matter in the next few days, indicating that he had recently discussed the matter with Marshall. Senior White House and State Department officials are aware of the intense public interest in Envoy Wedemeyer's report, and the rumors surrounding it have apparently compelled Marshall to at least temporarily clarify the current situation. Marshall is currently in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly, so it is not yet known whether the statement will be issued in New York or by the State Department here. It is generally believed that Marshall's statement will not contain any surprises, and is expected to be a general and vague statement reaffirming America's deep concern for China's fate and Washington's determination to find a satisfactory and feasible way to support and assist the Chinese government in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation. Marshall's statement will be an interim response to some comments on his attitude toward Wedemeyer's report.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] General Wedemeyer strongly urged the United States to aid the Chinese people, issuing a warning: "Unless the Chinese government initiates rigorous reforms, China will be drawn into the Soviet sphere of influence, and American aid will be of no avail." Wedemeyer declared: "The majority of the Chinese people do not wish to become communists, but they will accept any form of government that provides them with food and clothing." Wedemeyer expressed this view in a letter to Mrs. Coolidge, vice-chairman of the United China Relief Association's Women's Group, and agreed to its public release.

In his letter, Wedemeyer emphasized that if the United States were to provide any assistance, it must only reach "good Chinese people" and not be used to embolden those who "harm the principles of the United Nations Charter." (Continued on the left corner of the second page)

According to a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1946, it was recommended that member states withdraw any armed forces stationed in the territory of other member states without the consent of the host country. Therefore, our government has issued a formal statement clarifying that the U.S. troops in China are stationed with the consent of our government.

### Overseas Assets of Chinese Nationals

Regulations on Declaration Referred Back for Review

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The issue of utilizing overseas deposits of Chinese nationals was submitted to the State Council for discussion on the 17th. As some issues still need to be discussed, it was decided to refer it back for review. It is understood that some government officials believe that these regulations are impractical and contrary to international law, making them difficult to implement. The main purpose of the regulations is to encourage voluntary declaration. If they do not declare, they will be sentenced to five years of imprisonment. However, foreign banks do not publicly disclose the names of depositors, and if they do not declare themselves, it will be impossible to imprison them. Therefore, the regulations are merely a formality. Most committee members believe that it is necessary to review them again, and it was decided to refer the original proposal to the Economic Review Committee of the Council for review. At the same time, it was suggested that the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs draft a statement to inform the public of the progress of the negotiations with various countries concerned regarding this matter over the past two years. The English statement will be announced shortly.

### Japan Seeks to Join the United Nations: Government in Nanjing Rejects Sternly; Wang Chonghui Says Japan Aims to Sneak into Peace Conference

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama expressed his views on the Japanese peace conference in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 16th, hoping to join the United Nations, which has drawn attention here. When asked by our newspaper reporter on the afternoon of the 17th, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Katayama's so-called hope to join the United Nations as soon as possible and to send a delegation to the Japanese peace conference is just a hope and, at most, just a propaganda ploy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not intend to say much at this time. In fact, Japan is still a defeated country under Allied control, and its future will be determined by the Allies. It is difficult to say whether it can speak at the peace conference and whether it will enjoy more favorable treatment than Italy. At the end of the war, Italy had fought alongside the Allies against Germany, but Japan did not. Former Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying criticized Katayama's remarks, saying that Japan cannot have any hope before the signing of the peace treaty, and can only hope to have a speaking opportunity after the signing of the treaty. Wang Chonghui said that Japan's surrender was unconditional, and Japan must accept any conditions proposed by the Allies.

Editorial

### The Issue of Adjusting Prices for Public Utilities

Recently, Shanghai's public utilities are brewing price adjustments. According to news from the Public Utilities Bureau, the public utilities requesting price adjustments this time include electricity, gas, telephone, public buses, ferries, and small trains. Except for tap water, which will remain unchanged for the time being, it can be said that there will be a comprehensive adjustment. The last time public utilities adjusted prices was on July 1st. Because the adjustment standards were fair, the impact on prices after the adjustment was not too great. Although citizens felt that the burden had increased, they could forgive the difficulties of public utilities. It is said that the adjustments currently being brewed could increase prices by more than double, with the highest reaching 2.2 times. In particular, the "automatic adjustment" requested by the electricity company, the proposed price increase standard is even more alarming, and the government authorities have not yet approved it. This is a matter of unanimous attention to Shanghai's public and private institutions and the four or five million citizens today.

Public utilities are enterprises that serve the social population and have an impact on the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of people in urban society. They cannot be equated with ordinary commercial goods. Moreover, public utilities are closely related to general economic construction and social stability, and must be given serious consideration. For example, postal, telecommunications, and railways are operated by the state for the purpose of facilitating the people and preventing monopolies. The more widely postal, telecommunications, and railways are used, the more opportunities people have for knowledge exchange and information dissemination, and the greater the opportunities for market regulation and mutual exchange, the convenience of which is not limited to those who use postal, telecommunications, and railways themselves. Electricity, that is, the electrical industry, is an enterprise that supplies electric lights, electric heating, and electric power. It is not only needed for family life but also the driving force of industrial and mining production. Gas, telephone, trams, and automobiles are all power needed by the people, and their purpose of use is the same as postal, telecommunications, and railways, and they are especially closely related to small and medium-sized citizens. There are many types of public utilities, which develop with urban civilization. The establishment and management of public utilities, whether state-owned or private, government-run or business-run, inherently has a service spirit, and the government grants special patents, so it should not be purely for profit. This should be no doubt.

Because public utilities are for the purpose of service and are closely related to the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of the people's lives, the government must regulate them. Regulation is neither a monopoly nor obstruction, its purpose is to prevent free price increases by controlling prices. There was a time when the government implemented a subsidy policy for public utilities, which considerably delayed the general price increase, but later abandoned the subsidies and only used passive methods to control, which was tantamount to allowing them to raise prices freely. Thus, as the water rises, so does the boat, and general merchants inevitably follow suit by raising prices to "keep up" with public utilities. This time, various public utility companies, citing reasons such as the growth of foreign codes, rising fuel prices, and rational fields, decided to automatically adjust prices, requesting very high standards, and the adjustment method also seems to be not properly adjusted. The municipal government has no opinion on this and only forwarded it to the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for deliberation; and the Municipal Council, which represents public opinion, has not had a detailed discussion on raising the prices of public utilities after passing a bill on conserving electricity and levying high fines. In today's difficult situation, approving price increases for public utilities would impose too heavy a burden on the people; not approving price increases would make public utilities feel strained. Therefore, the government's handling is very cautious, and the result is still inevitable to allow, but only the issue of which standard to adopt and what limits to set for the price increase. And what ordinary citizens are concerned about is the issue of this price increase limit!

As we see it, the subsidy method is indeed not very appropriate because the national treasury cannot bear the burden, but allowing free price increases would also have too great an impact on the people's burden. Urban public utilities should, in principle, be borne by the citizens, but today the citizens' direct burden is too heavy and is worth considering. Please do not forget by the municipal government: What is the use of the 10% municipal construction donation attached to the public utility charges? Can it be used to subsidize some public services? On the government side, unnecessary administrative expenses and waste can be eliminated; and for the items most closely related to small and medium-sized citizens, it is necessary to review and subsidize the income. In terms of various public utilities, we must recognize the difficulties of the times and try to save as much as possible in management, avoid wasteful angles, and price increases must have standards and proportions. Otherwise, various goods will stimulate each other, leap cyclically, the burden on citizens will be difficult, and public service will lose its spirit of service, which is also not a good thing!

### The Unfolding Economy Movement

The conservation movement has gradually materialized from theory, and all parties are promoting it separately. In this city, except for the implementation measures for the ban on dancing, which are still being requested from the central government, the rest, such as the conservation of paper, the restriction of banquets, and the punctuality movement, have been officially implemented one after another. Although there are no fundamental differences in the attitude of all parties to this matter, their views are not entirely the same. Some focus on the point of rectifying social discipline, believing that the world is too extravagant and too lewd and should be corrected in time; others focus on the military aspect, believing that during this period of general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, one should not be too indulgent in enjoyment. The motivation for implementing conservation this time comes from the general mobilization outline. The government's intention may also be glimpsed from this. However, in our opinion, the main factor of this movement is not so much social or military as it is economic.

Recently, the price increase has been rampant and endless, making people panic and at a loss. Although there are many reasons for this, the key lies in the shortage of materials. Because if there is no problem with supply, people will not panic, speculation will not be rampant, and black markets will not appear. Even if there is inflation and the value of the currency falls, it will not cause the price increase to form a crazy state. According to statistical reports, the multiple of the current price index far exceeds the multiple of the issuance of legal currency, which shows that the reason for the soaring prices is partly due to the fall in the value of the currency, but the other part lies in the lack of materials.

Why are materials so scarce? Simply put, it is nothing more than that production is depressed, transportation is not smooth, and imports are severely restricted. It is feared that these kinds of problems cannot be solved smoothly in the short term. From the point of view of the third point, requesting an increase in the export of goods in order to increase the amount of foreign exchange holdings, which means that we must first seek an increase in export goods. Therefore, countries such as England and Japan are tightening their belts and implementing their "starvation export" policies. Because without exports, imports cannot be obtained, and without imports, their biological products cannot be enriched. Therefore, the role of the conservation movement is not only destructive, but also truly active.

Currently, all countries are working hard to promote this movement, regardless of whether they can borrow dollars, whether there is war in the country, or whether their own materials are scarce, just because of the passive saving and frugality, hoping to alleviate the severe situation of their lack, and also with a kind of active role. The above-mentioned increase in exports and exchange imports is only one of these roles. Others, such as suppressing price increases, reducing inflation, balancing the national budget, stabilizing people's lives, and revitalizing the economy and aiding other countries, fundamentally cannot but start with restricting consumption. Therefore, simply regarding the conservation movement as a means of reducing government spending and rectifying social customs underestimates the value of "conservation."

No one is concerned about the current economic chaos, and no one does not want to come up with practical solutions to overcome the difficulties. Such as increasing production and stabilizing the value of the currency, these are indeed important plans to save the situation; however, when implemented, requesting speed and universality, which can be done immediately, and everyone can devote themselves to, is nothing more than the path of conservation. Everyone should be careful not to underestimate it, thinking that it is just an old saying and not worth paying attention to, and also be careful not to be too indulgent to themselves, thinking that the enjoyment of one person and one family has nothing to do with the overall national situation. It should be known that the various economic emergency measures announced by countries such as England, France, and Japan, although grand and detailed, with outlines and objectives, are all about asking everyone to save practically first and to survive the difficulties.

Some people think that people's livelihood is so difficult that many people are already on the brink of starvation, and there is really nothing to conserve. This is indeed the case. However, current life is very different, and enjoyment is too unequal. As the ancient poem says: "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." In the class of vermilion gates, they should abandon extravagance and advocate simplicity, strive for conservation, and retain a bit of vitality for the country, which is to alleviate the resentment of those who are on the verge of starvation!

Moreover, the promotion of conservation should not be biased towards the people; all the words such as setting an example in person and being a model for the people have already been mentioned by others and need not be repeated. However, programs such as streamlining redundant agencies, eliminating redundant personnel, and reducing unnecessary expenditures, although the authorities have repeatedly discussed and decided to implement them, often use various reasons to put the resolutions on the shelf in the guest room, and fail to fully meet the ideals of the general public. On the contrary, some special civil servants are extremely extravagant and wasteful, spending tens of millions of dollars a month, all paid by the public. This matter has been seen in official documents and is not entirely fictitious. Therefore, we have two very important suggestions for the economy movement: It must be promoted by officials and the people together, especially the wealthy officials and magnates who enjoy too much, should take the spirit of self-denial and set an example first. All implementation measures should still be based on facts and carefully drafted, especially do not set the theory too high, so as to avoid obstacles to implementation and still become a typical official article.

### Our Proposal to the ARO Preparatory Meeting

(Continued from page one) The secretary of the delegation told reporters: "The conference is scheduled to begin on the 27th of this month and end on November 8th. It is stipulated that after the opening of the conference several times, four committees will be established to study various issues and proposals separately, and then submit reports to the conference for discussion. The subjects of the four committees' research are divided into: Social security, labor policy, implementation of the standards stipulated in the International Labor Convention in the Asian region, and the socio-economic background of Asia, including industrialization issues. After our delegation arrives in India, it will first hold an internal meeting. Proposals from both labor and management and government representatives will be submitted, discussed first, and if there are similar natures, they will be merged first before being proposed to the conference. After the meeting is over, except for one government representative who is scheduled to go to various parts of Southeast Asia to inspect overseas Chinese affairs, the remaining fourteen people will immediately return to the country." Furthermore, the important cases that our delegation is preparing to submit to the conference are as follows: Please ask the International Labor Office to organize an investigation team to collect information on Asian workers in preparation for the International Labor Organization's expansion to Asia. Please ask the conference to determine the Asian labor inspection standards. Please formulate and promote standards for employee welfare undertakings. Universally implement the protection of tenant farmers, stabilize rural areas, and reduce the reserve army of labor to stabilize the lives of workers in service. To protect the employment opportunities of Asian workers, industrialized countries should assist underdeveloped countries in implementing industrialization plans, and the latter can also adopt protective tariff policies to maintain the minimum living standards of workers. Limit Japan's industrial level to between 1912 and 1916, so that its living standards will not be higher than the average level of Asian countries, and it will not become an aggressive country again.

### The Stalemate of Political Parties Nominating Candidates Has Not Yet Been Broken

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The issue of the allocation of nominated candidate quotas for the three parties has almost become a stalemate as of the evening of the 17th. Xu Chuanlin, the State Council member of the Democratic Socialist Government, has scheduled a banquet for Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, and Hong Lanyou at 7 pm on the 18th, which may bring about a turnaround. However, according to people from the Democratic Socialist Party, the party's State Council members and political committee members have ceased to participate in the State Council and political affairs meetings held by the government in the past week.

[Another Dispatch] The issue of the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the provincial, municipal, and county councils in principle was approved by the 12th meeting of the State Council on September 26, and it was decided to hand it over to the Legislative Yuan to amend the organizational laws and regulations of the provincial, county, and city councils. The Legislative Yuan, upon receiving the order, held a symposium on the 17th. During the talks, the Legislative Yuan members of the Democratic and Youth Parties hoped that this case could be passed based on the following reasons: Candidates for supervisors must be nominated by more than five councilors, and there are currently no members of each party in the councils of various places, and members of each party cannot participate in the election of supervisors. According to Article 12 of the Basic Principles of Governance, the councils of each province, city, and county should be jointly participated in by all parties and non-party members as much as possible. Those who adopt the selection method in the institutions of public opinion have precedents such as the Political Participation Council and the National Assembly. Opponents claim that although the principles of governance stipulate the inclusion of all parties, the method is not necessarily limited to selection, etc. The meeting did not reach a conclusion, and the original case will be handed over to the Legislative Affairs Committee and the Autonomous Law Committee for review, and then submitted to the General Assembly.

### More Than 100 Unscrupulous Merchants Were Arrested in Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 17th] In view of the recent rampant price increases in this city, which obviously have unscrupulous merchants speculating and manipulating, the local price supervision group, in order to effectively curb it, dispatched personnel from military, constitutional, political, police, and other agencies at 10 am this morning, and after gathering at the county party headquarters, immediately went to the three markets of oil, flour, and miscellaneous grains, and seized 116 people, including illegal outsiders and speculative unscrupulous merchants such as Meng Xianpu, who had no documents, and escorted them to the Wuxi Command for strict handling.

[Another Dispatch] The Wuxi Command believes that there are a considerable number of food ships blocking the inland rivers, all of which are speculative merchants trying to avoid taxes and save expenses, and waiting for speculation. This has led to the phenomenon of soaring grain prices when new rice enters the market. At this time of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it is urgent to control them. The county government is ordered to strictly register the grain ships arriving at the port, and those who stay in the commercial port for more than three days shall be banned and advised to enter the warehouse in order to prevent speculation. Today, it is specially telegraphed to the county government to comply, and the daily arrivals, inventory, transactions, and closing prices of each market must be investigated and reported on a daily basis.

After the final sacred worship service was held in the evening, the conference concluded.

### Wedemeyer Calls for Aid to China

(Continued from Page 1) Wedemeyer stated, "China is undergoing a revolutionary and evolutionary stage. The high illiteracy rate in China makes it difficult to expect genuine democratic procedures."

He continued: "Even so, we, the American people, should support the Chinese people's motive to improve their cultural situation and support them in wisely and practically building their government. I retain my confidence that Chairman Chiang is sincere in practicing these goals. If foreign countries (especially the United States and the Soviet Union) can provide assistance or interference, Chairman Chiang's ability to achieve these goals will greatly progress. The post-war situation in the Far East is similar to that in Europe, with a chaotic economy, political division, and widespread awakening. The Soviet Union is fully utilizing the disorganized and turbulent situation in this region, as it did in Europe.

Soviet propaganda and Soviet support for the Chinese Communists make it difficult for China to establish [stability]. In addition, corruption within the National Government is also greatly hindering stability and reconstruction.

Wedemeyer said: "The Chinese people only seek any government that can provide food and shelter, and do not have time to consider the complex issues involved in leaning towards the Soviet Union." He warned that the reputation of the government is now declining and said, "In the conflict of various concepts and the power struggles of general political leaders, millions of innocent men, women, and children are being drawn into the vortex. This is a common example. I believe that the Americans and overseas Chinese should do their best to help these unfortunate people. I agree that our assistance must be targeted at those who deserve it, and not be an accomplice to unruly military and political leaders. According to my interpretation of American policy, we are not trying to impose our economic and political institutions on other people, but we are trying to create an environment where people have the freedom to express their opinions on how and by whom they are governed, and to protect individual freedom and establish courtesy in human relations. I admire and respect the Chinese people and deeply feel that they deserve our friendly assistance, but with one provision, that this assistance must be supervised to ensure that the honorable Chinese people receive this assistance. If the American people are asked to assist in strengthening the position of certain people or groups who are undermining the United Nations Charter, this would be the most unfortunate thing."

U.S. Congressman Cole's Remarks Support Bullitt's Proposal

[United Press, Manila, 16th] Republican Congressman Cole of the U.S. Congressional Military Survey Team to Okinawa stated at a press conference here: "I strongly agree with former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt's proposal to lend one billion U.S. dollars to aid China. This matter should be supervised by MacArthur. If he cannot, it should be presided over by General Wedemeyer."

[United Press, Detroit, 16th] The American Council of Christian Churches resolved today to request President Truman to aid China in order to save China, and even the world.

The resolution stated that unless we act decisively at this moment, the world is destined to suffer the most terrible bloodshed and unimaginable destruction.

British Press and Parliamentary Leaders Request the Abolition of the Potsdam Agreement

[Central News Agency, London, 16th, United Press] The British government is currently under pressure from the press and parliamentary leaders to declare the abolition of the Potsdam Agreement and to endorse the theory of dividing the world into two, namely the separation of the Soviet Union and Western countries. Liberal Party leader and parliamentary minority leader Davies recently visited Prime Minister Attlee, requesting the abandonment of the Potsdam Agreement.

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] It has been learned that, according to the Gallup Opinion Research Institute's survey results, Secretary of State Marshall is even more popular than former Secretary of State Hull was during his tenure. Eight out of ten survey votes praised Mr. Marshall's difficult work in the State Department.

### U.S. to Formally Propose to the United Nations Assistance to Korea in Achieving Independence Advocates Forming a Committee to Supervise Elections and Negotiating Troop Withdrawal After Government is Established

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] Authoritative sources stated today: The United States may formally raise the issue of Korean independence at today's meeting of the 57-nation Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The United States will not propose a trusteeship arrangement, but will propose allowing Korean independence, but with a transitional period before the government is established. The withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops should take place after the government is established, so as to avoid internal unrest in Korea.

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] It was learned today: The United States is about to formally propose a Korean independence plan to the UN General Assembly in response to the Soviet Union's simultaneous troop withdrawal request, and has already notified China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of the plan in advance. It recommends gradually implementing the wartime Allies' promise to restore Korean independence, requiring the United Nations agency to comply with this procedure, appointing a committee to monitor the election of a national assembly in Korea, then establishing a government, and then the United States and the Soviet Union will negotiate troop withdrawal with the Korean government. However, the United States will refuse direct supervision by the United Nations agency, believing that the primary responsibility belongs to the four countries of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The opposition to immediate troop withdrawal is similar to the opposition to the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Palestine, in order to avoid creating a vacuum in Korea and causing chaos.

### British Representative Jones Reaffirms Determination to Withdraw from the Holy Land as Soon as Possible Refuses to Implement the UN Plan Alone

[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] British Colonial Secretary Jones told the UN Palestine Committee today that the British government is willing to clearly declare its determination to terminate the Palestine mandate and withdraw from Palestine within a limited period. We believe that when the UN decides on the nature of the solution, it should also decide on the method of implementing the solution. It would be unreasonable to assign the British government to be solely responsible for the administration of Palestine and to implement the reforms deemed necessary by the United Nations agency.

It is heard that there have been suggestions that during the transitional period before Palestine's full independence, the United Kingdom should be responsible for implementing the policies of the United Nations agency under the assistance plan proposed by the U.S. representatives. The British government hereby wishes to clearly state that the United Kingdom has not only decided to terminate the Palestine mandate, but has also decided to withdraw from Palestine within a certain period. However, the British government is willing to: after the establishment of a Jewish-Arab settlement, continue the administration of Palestine for a limited transitional period; consider being invited to participate in the implementation of the solution together with other United Nations member states. In short, the British government will never accept sole or major responsibility.

Arab Group Representatives Make Final Resistance

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] Arab countries are making a final stand, intending to refer the possible UN decision to partition Palestine to the International Court of Justice for review. Representatives of Syria and Egypt proposed to the Palestine Committee that the United Nations should postpone voting until the International Court of Justice determines whether the United Nations has the authority to decide on this matter.

### Debate on the Holy Land Partition Problem Concludes The Strength of the Proponents and Opponents is Equal

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] The general debate of the UN Special Committee on Palestine concluded yesterday. Regarding the partition of the Holy Land, according to the speech records, 14 countries support it and 12 countries oppose it. The strength of the two sides is equal, making it difficult to reach a conclusion. The ultimate fate of the partition plan depends on the opinions of the 31 countries that have not yet spoken, but they may not announce their positions before the vote.

### UN General Assembly to Convene Next Monday The Dispute over Security Council Membership Awaits Resolution

[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly has been scheduled to convene a plenary session at 4 PM and 8 PM standard time next Monday to resume voting to resolve the dispute between India and Ukraine over a seat on the Security Council. In last month's plenary session, nine votes were held for this seat, and neither India nor Ukraine obtained the required majority, making it impossible to resolve. Reliable sources say that India is preparing to formally propose the principle of geographical distribution of non-permanent members. United Nations personnel believe that if Czechoslovakia can agree to succeed Poland as a member, this dispute may not occur.

### The Soviet Bloc Unanimously Opposes the "Little Assembly" Proposal Special Attention to the "Acheson Plan"

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 17th] The UN Political Committee continued to discuss the establishment of a standing committee proposed by Marshall today. During yesterday's meeting, India, the Netherlands, Greece, and Sweden all expressed support in principle, but Poland and Belarus joined the Slavic bloc in expressing opposition.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 16th] The Slavic bloc today formally mentioned the so-called "Acheson Plan" compiled by Acheson, which is widely discussed among the general public and published in the "Foreign Affairs" quarterly. The plan generally suggests: that several member states of the United Nations establish supplementary agreements in which all countries can participate, stipulating that participants must implement the obligations stipulated in the Charter to resist armed aggression; that this agreement, after being decided by more than two-thirds of the signatory countries, can be implemented according to the provisions of the Charter that require collective action, when the Security Council fails to act. It is heard that Acheson's plan has been supported by Vandenberg and several other influential figures in the U.S. diplomatic community. Judging from the attacks made by Belarus, the Kremlin is clearly very concerned about all aspects of this plan.

### Two Republican Giants in the U.S. Demand Strengthening the United Nations

[United Press, Columbus, Ohio, 16th] Republican presidential candidates Stassen and Taft both agreed today that world peace has not been lost. Stassen called the Democratic Party the "party of hidden worries" and called for strengthening the United Nations to help the world live together in peace. Taft denounced Soviet diplomats stationed at the United Nations, but said that the United Nations "remains the hope for future world peace."

### All German Parties Protest the Compensation Plan Promulgated by the U.S. and Britain The U.S. and Britain State That Orders Must Be Enforced for Dismantling Factories

[Reuters, London, 16th] Berlin Radio reported: The Advisory Committee of Germans in the British Zone, in protest against the Anglo-American compensation plan made public today, decided to stop working at a meeting in Hamburg today. At the plenary session of the Advisory Committee of Germans in the British Zone, all committee members, in order to express their protest, disregarded the wishes of the British military government and withdrew from the meeting in a group.

Furthermore, the German left and right-wing parties unanimously opposed the compensation plan. Entrepreneurs, economists, and trade union leaders in Hamburg fear that this plan will make Hamburg a barbaric place. The Secretary-General of the Joint Committee of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union stated that this compensation plan is an interference in Germany's economic life, and the consequences cannot be estimated for a while. The headquarters of the Communist Party in North Rhine-Westphalia also issued a statement, stating that the dismantling of factories will seriously affect the economic foundation of democratic construction, as well as the possibility of offsetting compensation with manufactured goods. British Commissioner Blair in the Hamburg area has warned Hamburg political leaders and trade union personnel that if they resist the dismantling by means of passive resistance or strikes, they will be regarded by European countries as Germany's unwillingness to repent.

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The Anglo-American military government plans today to dismantle 687 German factories and arsenals to pay for compensation. This plan is determined to be implemented, regardless of the German side's opposition. The dismantling work should be completed as soon as possible to accelerate the economic recovery of Europe. Only 69 factories remain to be dismantled in the U.S. occupation zone, and it is expected that no unexpected incidents will occur. U.S. Army Commander Hayes solemnly stated that the orders must be enforced, "resorting to force if necessary."

### Japanese Cabinet Secretary-General Criticizes the New Conservative Party

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Cabinet Secretary-General Nishio met with a group of journalists in Osaka on the 17th and clarified the government's views on the recent political situation, saying: "Recently, Liberal Party President Yoshida believes that Japan must establish a new conservative party and form a strong government organized by a single party in preparation for participating in the peace conference. Therefore, he requested a general election before the peace conference. However, the government believes that this is unnecessary.

Hoping that All Parties Will Cooperate, Not Wanting to Dissolve Parliament

Even if a general election is held, the existing parties such as the Socialist, Democratic, National Cooperative, and Communist parties will all coexist with the new conservative party and will not disappear. The truly united government that is necessary for participating in the peace conference will still have to be a coalition cabinet similar to the current one. Therefore, on this position, the current government can only hope that the opposition parties will join the government and will not consider dissolving parliament and holding a general election.

Confident in Coping with Labor Offensive

Secondly, there have been rumors recently that there will be a political change in November, but these are all unfounded rumors. The reason for these rumors is that it is believed that by November, the labor offensive will intensify, with the correction of the 1,800-yen base wage as the center. However, the General Confederation of Labor, which currently occupies more than half of the unions, firmly supports the Katayama Cabinet, so the labor offensive can also be resolved. Moreover, the supplementary budget is also expected to be limited to about 80 billion yen, so there is no place for further inflation.

Understanding Can Be Reached on the Issue of Left-Wing Members Within the Party

It is also rumored that my opposition to Agriculture Minister Hirano has led to disunity within the cabinet and that a dispute is about to occur within the Socialist Party. I would like to state that this matter can be understood in the near future. This problem is due to slightly opposing views on the handling of the left-wing members of the Socialist Party, because Agriculture Minister Hirano said that the left-wing will always be the left-wing and wants to cut ties with them. But in fact, due to changes in the surrounding situation, there is no so-called left-wing anymore, and it is natural for us to be able to coordinate with them.

### Stalin Tells British Parliamentarians that the Soviet Union is Willing to Cooperate with Western Europe Hoping to Unite Forces to Engage in Construction

[Reuters, Warsaw, 17th] Stalin told British left-wing Labor Party parliamentarians when he met them in Saki on the Black Sea earlier this week that "the Soviet Union does not want an Iron Curtain. If we unite our forces to engage in reconstruction, the Iron Curtain will not exist." According to members of the parliamentary delegation, Stalin said that the United Kingdom and Western European countries must cooperate economically with the Soviet Union and Eastern democracies. Cooperation can drive away the demons of war. According to British parliamentarians: "After visiting countries such as the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, we are more convinced that there is a need to cooperate with Eastern countries. We have found that the Soviet Union is ready and willing to sign a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, and we sincerely hope that this negotiation can be resumed."

### Far East Tribunal Releases Japanese War Criminals Prosecutor Explains Reasons Says the Emperor and Business Community Have No War Crimes

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Since the prosecutors of the Tokyo Military Tribunal for the Far East announced the decision not to prosecute 23 Class A Japanese war criminals a month ago, people from all countries have been criticizing it. Chief Prosecutor Kipping of the International Prosecutor's Office published a statement on this matter in the "Japan Times," believing that Japanese industrialists have no crime of manufacturing war.

Kipping said: "It has now been decided that the Japanese Emperor and business figures will not be subject to war crimes trials. This matter has caused some controversy in the past two years, but now it has come to an end. Japanese industrialists do not have sufficient evidence to believe that they should bear war responsibility. Although there has been some discussion that the Japanese Emperor and major industrialists should be subject to war crimes trials, after a long investigation, this discussion cannot find proper reasons. We have no example of anyone providing a plan or starting a joint agreement to participate in the war by major figures in the Japanese business and industrial community, and this supporting evidence cannot be collected. Of course, we are also unwilling to unconditionally declare that a certain group or the entire group is innocent. After consideration, we believe that those who participated in planning at the beginning of the war should be the object of accusation. There are no figures from the Japanese business community among the 25 war criminal suspects who are currently on trial, such as Tojo, and this is no coincidence. Japanese industrialists are different from German industrialists. In Germany, Hitler rode on a horse, and figures from the industrial community led the horse, but Japanese bankers or business leaders led the horse under the threat of guns."

### Japanese Exports to Increase Prices The National Treasury No Longer Subsidizes Trade Funds

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The restoration of Japan's foreign trade has made it difficult for the Ministry of Finance to cope with the issue of trade funds. It is reported that last year (fiscal year 1946) had already been short more than 3 billion yen. According to the current import and export situation, by the end of this year, the deficit will be as high as more than 16 billion yen. The only way to make up for it is to increase the price of exports and reduce the price of imports such as food. Consumer goods will still be priced at the current domestic price, and the higher prices paid by consumers will compensate for trade losses. The Trade Agency and the Ministry of Finance are currently in negotiations. In addition, the Trade Agency is studying methods to increase exports, and will determine the conversion rate of yen by referring to foreign market prices. Exports that have the potential to increase prices will be increased in the future. The Japanese government has also decided that the national treasury will no longer continue to bear the foreign trade fees. Trade funds will be completely balanced by adjusting trade prices.

### Anglo-Burmese Treaty Scheduled to be Signed

### The U.S. Steps Up Aid to France and Will Issue Huge Amounts of Gold and Silver European Representatives Urge the U.S. to Provide Assistance Again

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources say that France is expected to receive new financial assistance from the U.S. this weekend, and will receive gold and silver seized from Axis countries by the Allies, worth approximately 90 to 100 million U.S. dollars.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Two European leaders of the "Marshall Plan" stated today: If the U.S. fails to provide appropriate assistance in a timely manner, the future of Europe will be a real disaster. The two are Franks, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the European Economic Cooperation Conference, and Alphand, Secretary-General. According to Franks, the report of the Paris Conference was based on the economic level of Europe in 1947. Afterwards, the situation deteriorated, making the smooth implementation of the Marshall Plan more difficult.

### The U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations Supports the Third Party's Election Campaign

[United Press, Boston, 16th] Jack Kroll, Director of the Political Action Committee of the U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations, told reporters at a reception on the 16th that the Congress of Industrial Organizations will support the third party in the 1948 presidential election.

### The French Labor Strike Remains Deadlocked The Government Deploys Troops into Paris

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The French government deployed troops into Paris on the 16th. The troops were carrying tents and full equipment. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of the Army refused to comment on the movement of these troops, which may be related to the labor strike situation.

[United Press, Paris, 17th] Although the two small unions in Paris, the Christian Workers and the Autonomous Workers' Groups, which participated in the strike three days ago, have decided to resume work, the government also hopes to use it to restore the tram traffic throughout Paris, but it failed. On the 17th, there was still no public transportation in the entire city of Paris.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] The French labor strike has shown signs of resolution today. Among the 700,000 striking workers, 3,000 have decided to resume work. Prime Minister Ramadier has been consulting with various unions overnight in order to clarify the labor situation before the Paris City Council election on Sunday.

It is expected that the result will have a major impact on the future direction of the anti-Franco faction. The meeting between the two is the first meeting since the eve of the Spanish Civil War. London Spanish Republican figures believe that the two will discuss the possibility of taking joint action to restore democratic rule in Spain.

### The U.S. Invents a New Radio-Controlled Bomb

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 16th] The Franklin Institute has invented a radio-controlled bomb that does not need to be transported by aircraft and can be directed as desired in both forward and backward separation and left and right directions.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Unlikely to Be Optimistic; The Berlin Four-Power Structure Should Be Maintained

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Lieutenant General Robertson, who is about to succeed Douglas as the Deputy Military Governor of the British Zone in Germany, stated at a press conference in Berlin on the 16th that he believes even if the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in November fails to reach an agreement on Germany, the four occupying powers will continue their current quadripartite structure in Berlin.

Without a consensus-based agreement among the powers, there can be no appropriate solution not only for Germany but also for all issues concerning Europe. The Berlin Four-Power structure serves as a bridge between East and West, and I do not believe that any leader of these four allied nations intends to dismantle this bridge.

### Five Manufacturers Hoard 100,000 Reams of Paper; Police Bureau Orders Review of Account Books to Investigate Hoarders; Garrison Headquarters Mobilizes Over 2,000 People Yesterday; More Than Ten Businesses Suspected of Major Offenses Discovered

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the authorities took active measures, the price surge in the city has tended to stabilize, but the price of common newsprint has risen sharply and there is a shortage of supply, which is obviously due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market. The Economic Division of the Police Bureau has been secretly investigating since the day before yesterday, and yesterday afternoon they dispatched a large number of economic police officers, led by officers, to begin their operation. By nightfall, they had discovered suspects engaged in hoarding, including four paper mills and one paper merchant: DAHUA Paper Mill with over 40,000 reams, TANG YINJI Paper Mill with over 30,000 reams, GUOHUA Paper Mill with over 10,000 reams, DAFENG Paper Mill with over 6,000 reams, and YICHANG HENGJI Paper Merchant with over 3,000 reams, totaling over 100,000 reams. According to the persons in charge of each factory, all of this newsprint was entrusted to them by customers to be held on their behalf. The Police Bureau is currently reviewing the account books of each factory to determine the detailed amounts and the names of the hoarders, which will be announced once completed.

[East China News] The Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters divided into nine groups yesterday, mobilizing over 2,300 officers, and by evening had investigated multiple major hoarding cases. The department has now submitted all the details to Commander Xuan for review, and operations will begin within one or two days after approval. The department received dozens of tip-off letters from citizens yesterday, and is currently conducting a grain investigation. If the information is verified, severe punishment will be imposed.

[DA GUANG News Agency] Director Tao Yishan convened an emergency meeting of the chiefs of various investigation brigades at the headquarters at 11:00 AM yesterday to discuss and determine specific implementation measures. According to investigations over the past week, more than ten unscrupulous merchants suspected of major hoarding have been discovered. The main ones include three companies hoarding more than 8,000 bolts of cloth, and two companies hoarding more than 3,000 bales of yarn. One company was found to be dealing in more than $300,000 US dollars on the black market, and three companies were hoarding rice in particularly alarming quantities. A re-investigation is currently underway, and once the facts are verified, the criminals will be arrested first.

### Thousands of Seized Telegrams Carried to the Capital Overnight for Review; Merchants in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin Secretly Report Black Market Prices to Each Other via Commercial Telegrams

[East China News] Premier Zhang Qun believes that merchants are using the convenience of telecommunications to report market conditions to each other, directly raising prices and affecting people's livelihood. He issued an urgent telegram to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, ordering an investigation into commercial telegrams sent to and received from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin by the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and international radio stations since the 11th of this month. Those found to be manipulating prices will be directly reported for severe punishment. After receiving the order, the department immediately dispatched personnel to the Telegraph Bureau and international radio stations yesterday to investigate. It was found that over 1,000 telegrams were sent from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Guangzhou each day, mostly reporting the black market prices of gold, banknotes, cotton, and cloth. Between 500 and 1,000 telegrams were sent back and forth to Tianjin each day, mostly concerning the prices of yarn and cooking oil. Approximately 500 telegrams were sent to Hankou each day, mostly reporting yarn prices. After the Garrison Headquarters sorted through the commercial telegrams, it discovered dozens of large organizations manipulating gold, banknotes, yarn, and cooking oil. Over one flat file cabinet's worth of telegrams were seized and dispatched to the capital late last night for review.

### Encourage Reporting of Black Market Gold and Banknotes; Restrictions on Rewards Temporarily Lifted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 12th Economic Inspection Conference is scheduled to be held in the City Hall conference room at 10:00 AM today. Furthermore, due to the rampant black market trading of gold and foreign currency in the city, the Economic Inspection Conference believes that in order to encourage citizens to provide information and to facilitate the inspection work, it is appropriate not to place numerical limits on the proportion of rewards given to informants and those who contribute to the handling of cases. After the City Government telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for approval, it has been learned that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed back a few days ago, temporarily approving the removal of restrictions and granting rewards at rates of one to two percent.

### The Drainage Pipe Construction on South Bund Road Is the First in Pudong

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to connect the traffic on the Pudong Avenue and Pudong branch line and to meet the needs of the car ferry, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has decided to first construct South Bund Road so that trucks loading and unloading at the pier can directly reach Pudong Avenue. The road is 790 meters long and construction began on the 13th of this month, including asphalt pavement and drainage pipe laying, with a total estimated cost of over 970 million yuan and a scheduled completion in three months.

### Before Requisitioning Land Enclosed During the War, the Railway Bureau Negotiates Rental Payments with Residents

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." enclosed civilian land in the Qiujiang Road and Mingde Road area, and the buildings built on that land were taken over by the Two Railway Bureaus after the victory. The main industries in several areas requested their return, and the Two Railway Bureaus intend to requisition them in accordance with the law and have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. Before the Executive Yuan's instructions and approval are issued, the bureau and various business owners agreed yesterday that from October 1945 to May of this year, the Two Railway Bureaus would pay a monthly rental fee of 125,000 yuan per mu (unit of land area). From June to the end of this month, the monthly rental fee per mu will increase to 350,000 yuan. However, from next month until the date of approval of the requisition by the Executive Yuan, the Railway Bureau intends to continue paying 350,000 yuan per mu per month, while the business owners insist on renegotiating at that time. As for the future method of requisition and price, both will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan.

### Italian Monk to Promote Buddhism Around the World; Giving Sermons Starting Tomorrow; Firmly Believes This Is the Path to Truth

[Report from Our Newspaper] Italian monk Luo Genna arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago and has taken up residence at Wangfo Temple. He is scheduled to give sermons at the Buddhist Jingye Society starting tomorrow. Luo Genna is a prominent monk in Italy, born in Italy but raised in the United States, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Influenced by Master Dharma, he changed his entire outlook on life and converted to the Three Jewels, becoming a devout Buddhist. One of his brothers is currently a bishop in Rome. Despite being brothers, they each pursue truth through their respective faiths.

This time, the monk came to Shanghai via Burma, Penang, and Singapore, preaching and promoting Buddhism along the way. After preaching in Shanghai, he plans to travel to Manila and Honolulu before heading to the United States. He will establish a Buddhist publishing house in New York, planning to publish a Buddhist bible that collects all the essences of Buddhism in one volume. He also plans to build a skyscraper in New York to pray for world peace, expressing the spirit of promoting Buddhism in the United States.

Luo Genna has walked across southern Europe, Central Asia, and many other countries. In 1925, he spent eight years in seclusion in Burma, meditating and attaining enlightenment, and then decided to travel the world to promote Buddhism. The monk is also the founder and leader of the World Buddhist Propagation Association and has organized Buddhist preaching expeditions, leading believers from various places to visit famous Buddhist sites.

The monk has a kind appearance and a natural demeanor. When meeting with reporters, he said that he firmly believes that only Buddhism can show the path to truth in the current world. His motto is "Do and do bravely, regardless of all obstacles." He said that life is a dream, and there is no permanent life in the world, so people should love others as themselves, and even small animals should be cared for. Only through Buddhism can the world be saved, and only through boundless love can boundless hatred in the world be eliminated. If Buddhism and science go hand in hand, the world can be saved. Science alone is enough to destroy the world.

When reporters asked about his views on Chinese Buddhism, he said that he greatly admires the hard work of Chinese monks, deeply believing in the principle of "better to wear out than rust." The monk also said that it is currently the Buddhist year 2491. By the year 2500, Buddhism will be able to reach its peak and illuminate the world. There are only eight years left to strive for its realization, so he has deep hopes for preaching in the United States.

It is reported that the monk's four-part sermon program is: Buddhism is a science that saves people and the world. How to achieve complete virtue and wisdom. Buddhist studies are scientific doctrines. Subduing the ego with truth. He is scheduled to give sermons at 5:30 PM every day starting tomorrow at the Buddhist Jingye Society, 418 Hecheng Road, and plans to broadcast Buddhist teachings on the Great American Radio Station every morning.

### Five Squatter Settlement Sites to Be Reclaimed as Municipal Public Land

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government held its 98th Municipal Meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday, and the resolutions were as follows: Proposal submitted by the Mayor, regarding the joint report from the Bureau of Public Works and the Land Bureau on the conditions and consultations regarding the five squatter settlement sites on Gonghe New Road, Jiaotong Road, Zhaozhou Road, Fuyao Bridge Road, and Caoyang Road, requesting instructions for discussion.

Resolution: The municipal public land on each road should be reclaimed immediately; for private public land in the civilian housing areas, the Land Bureau will convene the landowners to negotiate leases. The Shanghai Economic Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on Gonghe New Road is municipal public land and should be reclaimed immediately. The farm leased the public land to citizens, and all rental fees should be returned to the city government by the farm. New sheds are not allowed to be built on any of the roads. The railway workers who have built many sheds in the civilian housing area on Jiaotong Road are requested to be relocated by the Railway Administration. The Mayor submitted a proposal signed by the Health Bureau, stating that the number of poor pregnant women and patients with acute illnesses in the city is increasing daily, and the original number of free hospital beds is too small. It is proposed that, starting from November 1947, additional subsidy fees be allocated to various municipal hospitals, maternity hospitals, and health centers to expand the number of beds to accommodate more patients. The proposal was submitted for review and signed with opinions for discussion, and the resolution was amended and passed. The Mayor submitted a proposal from the Police Bureau regarding the obstruction of lanes in the city, and whether to ban them. The resolution was to ban them.

### Reorganization of Land in the Western District of Zhabei Approved; Methods for Redrawing Boundaries Passed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Land Bureau stated that in the western district of Zhabei, many of the original buildings were destroyed by artillery fire during the Anti-Japanese War, and the boundaries are indistinguishable, causing many disputes. The current usage situation includes areas still enclosed by barbed wire and overgrown with weeds, or occupied by temporary sheds built by refugees, resulting in a chaotic situation. In order to thoroughly reorganize and achieve rational use, the draft of the Shanghai Zhabei West District Land Redivision Method was prepared in accordance with laws and regulations and submitted to yesterday's municipal meeting for approval, and it was submitted to the Ministry of Interior and the Council.

### Lou Guowei Fails to Appear After Being Summoned; Chief Investigator Chen Youji Interrogated

[Report from Our Newspaper] The corruption case of Lou Guowei, the former director of the Direct Taxation Bureau, is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Yu Yixin, said that Lou failed to appear after being summoned on the 9th of this month. He was summoned again yesterday, but Lou again refused to appear. Chen Youji, the chief of the Third Section, who was also summoned, appeared and was questioned about the fraudulent circumstances in the collection of business income tax from the Asia Bank in 1946. After repeated questioning by the prosecutor, he was still released on bail and summoned again at a later date.

### Central Mint Planning to Supplement Missing Parts; Restoration of Coinage Only a Matter of Time; Machinery from Northeast China to Be Transported to Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Mint in Zhabei suffered severe losses during the war. At the beginning of the restoration after the victory, the factory compiled a budget and submitted it to the ministry, estimating that the cost of restoring the factory would be 10.2 billion yuan. However, the Ministry of Finance reduced it to 4.5 billion yuan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. Meanwhile, 2.5 billion yuan was allocated as restoration funds. Later, when Song Ziwen was the head of the Executive Yuan, he ordered the restoration plan to be postponed. The Ministry of Finance repeatedly requested the Executive Yuan to maintain the original proposal, but the matter remains unresolved. The factory believes that the budget at the time of the victory is no longer applicable due to price factors. It has recently recompiled a budget, estimating that it will require 30 billion national currency and 2-3 million US dollars, and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment and to find that the coinage machinery left by the former "Japan-Manchuria" in Northeast China can supplement the missing parts, is currently negotiating with the Central Bank to advance 4 billion yuan as the cost of transporting the machinery to Shanghai. The Mint has also sent personnel to Northeast China to start investigating everything. However, due to inconvenient transportation and the arrival of severe winter, it is difficult to determine when the transportation will begin. According to general observations, it is believed that the restoration of the Central Mint is only a matter of time. Even if metal currency is not minted in the future, the minting of subsidiary coins is inevitable. No country in the world, apart from its main currency, uses non-metallic subsidiary coins.

### Military Medical Tuberculosis Sanatorium to Be Established Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line

Zhu Jing, the director of the Press Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday, under the order of Commander-in-Chief Guo, and held a symposium on the business and training work of various military hospitals in Shanghai at the Military Medical Office of the Port Headquarters.

### Domestic Kerosene Should Not Be Banned; Nine Refineries Explain Reasons: Can Save Foreign Exchange and Benefit People's Livelihood

[Report from This Newspaper] The Price Review Council decided to ban "artificial kerosene" because the raw material used, diesel, harms the proper industrial use of diesel. Yesterday, nine oil refineries, including the Yongda Oil Industry Association, invited the press to appeal, stating that the name "artificial kerosene" was corrected to domestic kerosene at the Petroleum Management Meeting of the Public Utilities Bureau on April 17th, because imported kerosene is also refined from diesel. Now, domestic factories are refining it themselves, and after repeated improvements, the product is no longer inferior to imported products. Once China develops oil fields, the establishment of oil refineries will be strongly promoted. There are currently more than 20 oil refineries of all sizes in Shanghai, with more than 1,000 workers, all of which are of considerable scale. It would be unwise to summarily ban them, destroying the emerging national industry and creating a large number of unemployed workers. If the government can increase diesel imports and reduce kerosene imports, allocate a portion of diesel to various oil refineries, and stipulate the output quantity to be sold by the government at parity prices, it would not only save foreign exchange, but also benefit people's livelihood. Currently, the selling price of diesel is only 4.06 million yuan per ton, while kerosene requires 8.34 million yuan per ton. Eighty percent of diesel can be refined into kerosene, and there are also by-products of mineral oil, which is far more cost-effective than importing kerosene from abroad. Finally, it was pointed out that the move to ban domestic kerosene this time was instigated by foreign merchants, who feared that they would lose their ability to manipulate the kerosene market after the Chinese refined kerosene themselves, so they used this excuse to ask the government to ban it.

### US Military Court Opens Trial for Theft and Sale of Empty Gasoline Barrels; No Way to Investigate Related Russian National Who Returned to His Country; Zhou Genshou Admits to Being Entrusted to Resell

[Report from This Newspaper] The case of Major Frederick Piers, a member of the US Military Advisory Group, stealing and selling a large number of empty US military gasoline barrels to Chinese merchants opened in the US Military Court at the American Cemetery in the Racecourse on the 15th. It is alleged that on July 15, Piers colluded with Georgy, a Russian national serving in the Supply Office, to sell 600 empty US military gasoline barrels stored in Jiangwan through Zhou Genshou, who repaired typewriters at the office, to a Zhou姓 (surname Zhou) on Lafayette Road, obtaining two gold bars and $1,200 USD. Initially, this was not discovered. On August 1, Piers again sold 540 empty gasoline barrels to Wang Jinrong, who lived at No. 14 Chenjia Bridge, Yiyun North Lane, South Railway Station, stating that the value was $1,600 USD, to be paid after delivery. Just as they were about to be shipped out from Jiangwan Airport, they were discovered by the guards of the Chinese Air Force. Wang Jinrong and Piers were detained, and all 540 gasoline barrels were returned to the Air Force. Georgy, the Russian national involved in the case, has already returned to his country and cannot be investigated. As for whether the two gold bars and $1,200 USD paid for the first transaction were taken back by Georgy, or split equally, or stored elsewhere, it remains to be investigated. The whereabouts of the barrels missing from the first transaction is also under strict investigation. On the 15th and 16th, the US Military Court held closed-door trials, summoning witnesses and Chen Chang, the former Major Chief of the Second Section of the Second Service Brigade of the Chinese Air Force.

The trial continued yesterday morning. Sakura, who previously worked for the US military and is now employed by Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft (DAPG) , testified that in July of this year, Major Piers asked her to sign a shipping manifest, stating that 540 gasoline barrels were sold for $1,600 USD, and then handed it over to Wang Jinrong. At this time, Piers's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Bowie, said that prosecutor Major Mackey did not provide photographs as evidence, and that Major Piers did not sign, and should not be held responsible. Presiding Officer Colonel Palmer corrected him. Piers's female secretary, Bernaldo, then testified that she had encountered Sha three times at Piers's place, and had seen Piers and Sha have one very long conversation. In the afternoon, Zhou Genshou testified that he was ordered by Major Piers to have Georgy entrust him to

find a way to resell . As for the Zhou who made the purchase, he was introduced by two of my friends, and I don't know him. After the second incident occurred, Georgy came to tell me again that Major Piers had ordered me to go to the Chinese Air Force Headquarters to find the person in charge and see if I could find a way to help. After I went to that place, I only saw the gasoline barrels. Wang Jinrong was reportedly handed over to the Chinese Air Force Headquarters on the afternoon of August 1. Yesterday's trial was not completed, and the court will continue the trial at 9:00 AM this morning, summoning other witnesses and Wang Jinrong, etc.

### Unemployed Workers from the Rear Area Arrive in Shanghai and Beg for Relief After Starving for Two Days

[Our Newspaper] More than one hundred unemployed workers arriving in Shanghai from the rear area formed a line yesterday morning to surround Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau. They demanded a continued supply of meals because the unemployed workers' reception center had been ordered to dissolve on the 15th, and the supply of meals had been stopped from that day, leaving the unemployed workers to starve for two days. Deputy Director Li agreed to give each person 12,000 yuan for lunch, ordered them to return to the center first, and also issued half a month's ration of rice. According to Deputy Director Li, the Executive Yuan has agreed to provide blankets, cotton clothing, and severance pay for the dismissal of these workers. If they return to their hometowns, the government is also prepared to provide assistance, he said.

### Xiao Linggui's Estate Totals 2.1 Billion; Yue Opera Circle Expresses Two Points; Suicide Was Not Due to Economic Hardship; No Illicit Affairs During Her Lifetime

[Our Newspaper] The issues surrounding the estate of the famous Yue opera actress Xiao Dangui have been causing quite a lot of disputes. Xiao Ling's estate is estimated to be around 2.1 billion yuan, including her own real estate in Hangzhou valued at 600 million yuan, 400 million yuan in savings, and opera costumes, jewelry, gold bars, etc. Her husband, Zhang Chunfan, has already compiled a list, signed it, and sent it to Huang Jinrong. The day before yesterday, Xiao Ling's brother, Qian Boquan, came to Shanghai from Shengxian County, and Huang specifically gave the list to Qian, instructing him to take the lead in handling everything. Qian only hopes for the following regarding his sister's death: Xiao Ling's coffin should be moved back to Shengxian County and buried in the original coffin to avoid unnecessary expenses; the entire estate of Xiao Ling should be inherited by him; the funeral expenses, including the 200 million yuan in compensation for the Paradise Theater's losses, totaling 600 million yuan, should be the responsibility of Zhang Chunfan; he does not recognize the marital relationship between Xiao Ling and Zhang Chunfan. However, nine people from the opera circle, including Yuan Yunfen and Chuan Quanxiang, believe that the handing over of Xiao Ling's estate depends on two points: Xiao Ling's suicide was definitely not due to economic reasons. Even if the rumored 600 million yuan of debt before Xiao Ling's death were true, the current amount of the estate would be more than enough to repay it. Furthermore, Xiao Ling lived a frugal life and rarely went outdoors. The rumors of her having illicit affairs with others are definitely not true. They will continue to negotiate with Zhang Chunfan based on these two points and appeal to the outside world to uphold justice to clarify the truth about Xiao Ling's suicide. It is said that Yin Guifang, one of the famous Yue opera actresses, will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong twenty days from now. At that time, they plan to jointly hold a grand memorial service for Xiao Ling. Furthermore, the Hongguang Theater will stage a Yue opera about Xiao Ling's unjust death, which is expected to cause a sensation again.

### Tragedy on Yangshupu Road: Truck Collides with Tram; Fifteen Injured, One Dead

[Our Newspaper] At about 6:30 PM the day before yesterday at the intersection of Yangshupu and Linqing Roads, a tram number 73, traveling west to east, collided with a truck number 65265 from the Materials Supply Bureau, traveling east to west. Because a vehicle from the China Agricultural Machinery Company was stopped in front, the truck number 65265 veered to the left. Unexpectedly, the front of the truck slipped and collided with the tram. Both male and female passengers were severely injured. Guo Yuzhen, Ding Jinzhou, Sun Guoxiang, Pan Fulin, Cai Yuanming, Jiang Yushan, Wu Jinfu, Li Genming, Sun Jiehao, Tang Xiaomei, Wang Shaomin, Zhou Jianqi, Huang Shenzhi, Shen Binbao, Lin Sheng, and Zheng Bailin all suffered injuries to the head, forehead, chest, back, and limbs.

### Two Actresses Reduced to Prostitution; Sisters Kidnapped and Fled to Shanghai; From Nantong, Heading to Qingdao

[Our Newspaper] Li Yushan, a 59-year-old Shandong native residing at No. 2 Xiaobaojia Lane in Nantong City, was formerly a performer. He adopted four daughters: Hai Cha, Hai Hong, Hai Yun, and Hai Lian. Hai Lian is ill at home, and Hai Yun was kidnapped by a soldier last spring. Currently, only Hai Xiang (19 years old) and Hai Hong (17 years old) earn a living by performing. Last year, they had no performances, and the two sisters were reduced to prostitution. Two soldiers, Liao Guoan and Yuan Ming (quartermaster), both had sexual relations with them. On the 12th of this month, Liao and Yuan invited the two girls to watch a movie at the Xin Xin Theater and agreed to meet at the bus station the next morning. The four of them took a long-distance bus to Yangzhou, stayed overnight, and on the third day, they went to Zhenjiang and then to Shanghai. They stayed at the home of Liao's father-in-law at No. 40, Lane 751, Lingao Road, Pingliang Road. On the 16th, they went to Liao's father, Zhi Liang's residence at No. 40, Jing'an Villa, Nanjing West Road, where the four of them slept on the floor. After the two daughters disappeared, Li Yushan learned that they had been kidnapped by Liao and Yuan and that Liao's Shanghai contact address was No. 40, Jing'an Villa. He tracked them to Shanghai and loitered in the lane all day. In the evening, he caught sight of the Hai Hong sisters going out to play and called the police to take them to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. The police rushed to Liao's residence, but Liao and Yuan had already fled upon hearing the news. According to Hai Hong and others, the boat tickets had been bought, and they were scheduled to go to Qingdao together on the 18th. After interrogation, the sub-bureau plans to transfer the two girls to the Jiliang Institute, while the two soldiers, Liao and Yuan, are still being pursued.

### Embodying Experimentation in Relief: New Facilities of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Chongqing

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th (Airmail)] Located beside the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, the "Shangri-La" of Huatan Creek curves into an "S" shape, covering an area of approximately 300 acres, with twenty-odd new-style houses. A large wooden sign reads: "Embodying Experimentation in Relief, Advancing the Great Question of Mankind." At first glance, visitors realize that they have stepped into the Chongqing Experimental Relief Institute of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

The Relief Institute is divided into six sections: Home for the Elderly, Vocational Training Center, Home for the Disabled, Orphanage, Medical Center, and Maternity Home. Each section has its own person in charge and forms a separate unit.

The Home for the Disabled currently has 20 deaf-mute students (5 female), 23 blind students (4 female), and 23 lame students (8 female). Deaf-mute teacher Rui Gufeng graduated from the vocational class for the deaf in the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf. He cannot speak, but he can use gestures to train the deaf-mute students in "conversation." Another teacher of pronunciation, Jiang Mingjian, has a missing arm and leg. Originally a refugee receiving relief, he was successfully educated by the institute and also serves as a teacher. He said: "Deaf-mute students practice pronunciation entirely using phonetic symbols, but there are still three letters among the forty, 兀 (e), ㄘ (ci), and 方 (f-old) that they cannot pronounce. Even the most intelligent deaf-mute student needs three months to learn the pronunciation of these forty letters." Blind students rely entirely on tactile writing. Blind writing has a total of fifty-four letters, consisting of eighteen consonants and thirty-six vowels. One consonant combined with one vowel forms one blind character. Before the war, the Shanghai China Welfare Association for the Blind printed a large number of blind books and songs using machines. Due to financial difficulties, they now only use manual typesetting to publish one type of monthly publication called "Qiming," which is distributed to various schools for the blind and deaf. The government does not have an accurate statistic of how many blind, deaf, and mute disabled people there are in all of China, but the disabled who have received blind, deaf, and mute education do not have to worry about finding a way out. Their professions after graduation are mostly sacred educational work.

The Home for the Elderly has thirty-one elderly men (the oldest being 81), and fifty-three elderly women (the oldest being 89). The youngest age is 60. After entering the home, even the coffins are supplied by the institute. According to the statistics table, from March 31st to September of this year, twenty-four elderly people have died one after another. Their lives are comfortable. They sleep on wooden plank beds. Fishing, playing chess, and taking walks are their daily activities. There is freedom of religion: there are Buddhist halls and chapels, and on Sundays, Adventist teacher Yang Xinsheng preaches. Lin Shusen, a 62-year-old man, automatically gives lectures on "The Biography of Ji Gong" every night.

The most complicated and arduous work is the Vocational Training Center. Currently, there are eighty-one male members and fifteen female members, most of whom were transferred from the police bureau. Few are literate, but there is one named Chen Mianzhi, who graduated from the Department of Economics at Fudan University. The entire management is militarized, and there were many escapes in the beginning, but there are fewer now. In the morning, they learn skills, and in the afternoon, they are taught to read. Unemployed vagrants can learn skills such as gardening, fishery, animal husbandry, crafts, sewing, cotton weaving, and printing. The sewing department has eight sewing machines, the cotton weaving department has four flat carpet machines and four towel machines each, and the printing department has six lithographic presses and one rotary press. The training period is tentatively set for one year. After the period expires, the Ministry of Social Affairs' Employment Service Center will introduce them to work and maintain close contact with the institute.

Dr. Wei Yongqing, the director of the institute, is a social work expert. He said: "The more advanced a country is, the wider the scope of social relief is. Social relief in China is just beginning, while the United States has developed from passive social relief to universal subsidy relief. Although the relief institute currently implements out-of-hospital relief and out-of-hospital treatment subsidies, due to limited funds, it cannot actively promote them." This young student who studied in the United States has a great and lofty ideal. He is preparing to build a new type of mental hospital—one that fully applies psychology—but the question is: where will this huge sum of money come from?

In terms of medical equipment, the Experimental Relief Institute has four doctors, fourteen midwives and nurses, and seventy beds. Ms. Zhong Wanfang, who is in the isolation ward, once studied at Guangzhou Zhongshan University. Because the institute did not have Western medicine to treat her lung disease, she reported to Director Wei Yongqing: "There is a Chinese medicine prescription that may be able to treat it, but no patient has ever tried it to see if it is effective." She wanted the institute to provide the cost of the medicine. Because Director Wei was open-minded, he finally spent 250,000 yuan to buy her fifteen doses of medicine. According to Ms. Zhong's statement to reporters, "The symptoms are indeed much better than before. She has been taking it for more than 20 days, but it must be taken for three consecutive months to get a definite result." The Chinese medicine prescription is copied below for reference by those suffering from lung disease:

Mulberry bark, Sichuan fritillary bulb, asparagus, apricot kernel, radix rehmanniae, white peony root, angelica, anemarrhena, licorice, ass hide glue, tortoise shell (crushed), small cyclic disc, two qian each. (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

### Bandit Leader Gao Deng Flees to Gather Forces in East Taihu; Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters Orders Wuxian County to Dispatch Troops for Joint Suppression

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters recently received a confidential report stating that a large number of bandits have been discovered in East Taihu, gathering in the tide and near Platform Mountain.

### Wuxian County Government Formulates Two Measures: Dredging Grain Sources and Eliminating the Black Market

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Wuxian County Government has now received a provincial order stating that the grain supply in Jiangsu Province relies mainly on transportation from Anhui Province. Recently, due to the situation, the sources are insufficient, and grain merchants from Wuxi and Shanghai are also absorbing large quantities, causing a sharp rise in prices. In order to dredge grain sources and stabilize the market, the following measures have been formulated: Regarding the counties in northern Jiangsu, if legitimate grain merchants from southern Jiangsu go to purchase grain, they should be provided with as much convenience as possible. The county government should encourage grain merchants to raise funds to purchase and transport grain from the production areas. The four counties of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Changzhou should use the previously approved 10 billion yuan in collateral to actively purchase grain directly from the production areas to ensure sufficient inventory. Each county should order the police bureau to secretly investigate the reasons for the sharp rise and fall in grain prices, as well as the daily quantity of grain arriving from grain merchants and the transaction situation. The daily grain price should be clearly labeled and announced in the newspapers to eliminate the black market. If there are any violations, the people are allowed to report them, and rewards will be issued in accordance with the Shanghai market measures.

### Yang Zhishan's Family Committed Treachery and Continuously Killed 53 People; Captured in Wuxi and Escorted to Nanjing for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 16th] Yang Zhishan, from Niuyangzhuang, Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, served as the captain of the Youth Team and the captain of the Model Team of the bandit army, as well as a member of the Anti-Traitors Committee. He was ruthless and killed a large number of civil servants. He also kidnapped Yang Yu, a fellow villager, and extorted 30 dan of rice and a gold ring. Because he could not bear the harassment, Yu fled to Wuxi and lived in a thatched shed outside the East Gate. The day before yesterday, Yu learned that Yang Zhishan had arrived in Wuxi from the Dagan bandit area of Yancheng on a small wooden boat, which was docked on the riverbank of Sanliqiao outside the North Gate. He reported this to the Southern District Military Police Team and requested the arrest to avenge his previous grievances. After receiving the report, the team dispatched four plainclothes officers, along with the informant Yang Yu, to carry out the arrest. They successfully captured the bandit Yang Zhishan. During the interrogation, he claimed that after the communist New Fourth Army occupied Yancheng in 1940, his entire family participated in the work. His father was a member of the bandit army's Senior Citizens Association, his elder brother Yang Gaoshan is currently the head of Xincheng Township, his second brother Yang Qingshan works in the bandit Model Team, and his elder sister-in-law and second sister-in-law work in the bandit Women's Association. He served as the captain of the Youth Team. In March 1945, he officially joined the party. Last fall, he and his elder brother Yang Gaoshan killed Bian Chenpinjia, a subordinate of Han Deqin, former chairman of Jiangsu Province. After Yancheng fell again on August 12th of this year, he dragged 53 civil servants, including Chen Chengge, the district chief of the eighth district, Liu Linxiang, the district chief of the seventh district, Wang Yilong, the assistant of the second district, Pu Wenfu, the township chief, and Yuan Guorui, a member of the Returning Home National Corps, to Shangzhuang, where they were brutally killed. He came to Wuxi this time at the request of his elder brother Yang Gaoshan, using business as a cover to gather information about the situation of the Yancheng Huxiang Corps. At the same time, the team summoned five witnesses, Zhi Zhenyi, Dong Zhenzhi, Hua Jiefu, Dong Caiyuan, and Zhi Baiheng, to testify. The facts they stated matched Yang Zhishan's criminal behavior. On the 16th, he was handed over to the 9th Regiment Headquarters and transferred to the Capital Military Police Headquarters for interrogation.

### Side Views of the World YWCA Conference Venue

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 16th] Delegates from 23 countries around the world, selected from around the world and gathered in Hangzhou for the World YWCA Conference, have different appearances and different clothes. Among the delegates, some wear heavy furs, while others wear openwork summer cloth shirts. Chinese delegates mostly wear embroidered cheongsams, while Korean costumes are the most eye-catching.

Hangzhou is very cold in the morning and evening, and those from Myanmar are shivering. However, those who grew up in cold regions such as Finland still find the climate too hot.

As usual, at any international gathering, the venue is often full of national flags, but the World YWCA Conference is an exception. In the venue, national flags are nowhere to be seen, and there are only many fresh flowers.

The most unique hairstyle belongs to the Burmese, who comb their hair neatly, towering half a foot above their heads, topped with a large piece of ivory.

The youngest are the Czech and Mexican delegates, aged 18 and 20. Most of the others have gray or white hair.

The average age of the delegates is mostly over 40. According to the list of delegates, among the 102 delegates, only 42 are married women, with unmarried women accounting for the overwhelming majority.

Hangzhou baskets are a famous product of our country. Each delegate has one in hand, carrying documents to the venue every day.

On the evening of the 15th, Madame Chiang held a tea party at her private residence. The snacks prepared were purely Chinese, including: soup noodles, osmanthus sugar, and peanuts. Before leaving, each was given a bag of high-quality Longjing tea.

Most of the delegates are not good at using chopsticks and spend a lot of effort to eat the soup noodles.

Most of the delegates did not know what osmanthus sugar was, so some smelled it but did not dare to taste it. Also, most of the delegates used ivory chopsticks to try to eat peeled peanuts, but they failed repeatedly, causing laughter throughout the hall.

Korean women are good at singing. When invited by Madame, Korean delegate Ms. Jin Zihuan immediately sang a love song.

The living room of the foreign guests' reception center displays the work achievements of the YWCA in various countries during the war, with the UK, the US, and the Netherlands being the most outstanding. Germany and South Korea are missing. This is enough to fully demonstrate the heavy losses during the war, and all activities were crippled.

The most depressed person at the venue was the German delegate, who sat alone in a corner, silently.

The most active should be the Chinese delegates.

The person with the most diamond rings is also the Chinese delegate. (Reporter Hong Xucai)

### Exporters Lack Funds to Purchase Goods; Can Borrow from Designated Banks; Loan Procedures Have Been Notified to Various Industries by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

[Our Dispatch] In order to promote export trade, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has formulated loan measures for designated banks. The committee has sent these measures to the export promotion office of the Import and Export Control Commission, which has in turn issued a circular to various industry associations through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for their information. The original measures are summarized below: In order to promote export trade, these measures have been formulated to enable designated banks to have funds available. Exporters who wish to purchase export goods but lack funds may be granted loans according to the following conditions:

All loan applications from exporters must be used for normal commercial purposes and not for speculative activities.

This loan must be repaid by the exporter within one month through the remittance of foreign exchange from exports.

### Representatives from Sixteen Industry Associations Petitioned the Import-Export Control Commission Yesterday; Chairman Zhang Scheduled a Discussion for Today

[Our Dispatch] After the government announced the measures for handling goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, the sixteen relevant industry associations in this city once discussed the issue and submitted eight points of opinion. They prepared a written petition and sent representatives Zhang Yaozhang, Ge Shuming, Zhan Peilin, Li Yushu, Wu Liefei, and over thirty others to visit Li Duo, the Deputy Chairman of the Import-Export Control Commission, yesterday afternoon. Mr. Li received the representatives and promised to forward their opinions for consideration. The representatives then went to visit Zhang Jiaao, the concurrent Chairman of the Import-Export Control Commission at the Central Bank. Mr. Zhang was away at a meeting and had not returned, so Qu Shijie, the secretary of the bank, received them on his behalf. Mr. Qu agreed to forward the petition. Finally, it was agreed that Chairman Zhang and Deputy Chairman Li would meet with the representatives in person at 11:00 AM today to discuss the issue.

A Glimpse of Industrialists' Opinions

(Our Dispatch) Summarizing the opinions of industrialists in this city regarding the handling of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, the following are some of the points: These goods should be released to the market as soon as possible to meet the needs of society. The government's current procurement measures freeze merchants' funds for too long, and the volatile situation is also a reason why merchants are afraid to be at ease. It would be better to confiscate all prohibited goods, and the government can purchase the permitted materials at a lower price. From the standpoint of industry, it is hoped that the government will allocate the purchased raw materials to factories at a low price. If the government requires factories to use cheap raw materials to manufacture products, pay a certain amount of processing fees and legal profits, and purchase the finished products together, it would also be a reasonable approach.

### Executive Yuan Allocates Special Funds for China Farmers Bank to Purchase Domestic Cotton; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Cessation

There were still many sellers of flour, but the market was weak and unable to rise, continuing to fall by 10,000 yuan. The supply and demand of wheat bran was still balanced, but the market sentiment was weak, and it fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake also fell with other commodities. There were a few inquiries from foreign merchants, but the sellers were very anxious to sell, so the price continued to drop by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybeans continued to fall sharply by more than 30,000 yuan. Kidney beans were still traded little, and prices continued to decline by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Broad beans were transacted insignificantly, and the price was generally weak.

There were inquiries for corn from northern ports, and the price was stable. Red sorghum sales were sluggish, falling another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Oil factories took small amounts of sesame oil, but the local market still had little demand, and it fell sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Both foreign and local merchants were not interested in raw peanuts, and the price continued to plummet, falling sharply by another 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Cowpeas were slightly active in Shantou, but the situation was average. Soybean oil was dull in Southeast Asia, and there were few transactions, and the price was weak by 10,000 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Fall Back

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to fall by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan due to the tight monetary situation. The association's quote was 1 million yuan for 20% medium granulated white sugar, 1,055,000 yuan for Taiwan red sugar, 1,170,000 yuan for 40% white sugar, and 1,050,000 to 20,000 yuan for 24% coarse white sugar at the wharf.

### Human Hearts Frail and Soft, Forced Sales Abound; Cotton Yarn Weak and Weary, Cloth Prices Fall

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a sharp drop in cloth prices. Furthermore, due to strict government supervision, human hearts were frail and soft, causing the market to decline step by step. Subsequently, due to purchases by dyeing and weaving factories, new buying became active. However, the amount of yarn available in the market was exhausted due to the registration deadline. Shouts of regret led to a sharp rise. After the morning, 21-count and 20-count Double Horse yarn returned to good levels of 5.8 million. Throughout the day, in addition to 40-count Blue Phoenix, 32-count Silver Moon, and 20-count Golden City Goddess yarns rising, other fine yarns remained stable. 16-count coarse yarn continued to fall by varying amounts of 500,000 to 600,000.

Cotton cloth opened in the morning with floating surpluses, still subject to forced sales. Furthermore, with tight credit conditions and sluggish absorption by merchant guilds, coupled with rumors of the Textile Adjustment Committee limiting exports, the market felt even more unsupported. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 7.7 million, a drop of 45,000 compared to the previous day. Five Blessings Color Ball, Zhenzhong and other brands also fell by smaller amounts, ranging from 10,000 to 40,000. Throughout the day, apart from purchases remaining stable, fine twill, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, plain cloth, khaki cloth, and other types of cloth uniformly declined by varying amounts of 10,000 to 45,000.

[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, selling only 963 pieces of Class A yarn to various manufacturers, equivalent to 1,429 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 528 purchase orders were submitted.

Yarn and Cloth Registration Will Not Be Extended

[Our Report] On the 15th, the Textile Association publicly announced to all relevant trade associations that all packaged yarn and cloth within the industry as of the 16th of this month must be registered within three days. Yesterday was the final deadline. External rumors suggested an extension, but the person in charge of the association has denied this and reiterated to all relevant trade associations that the registered information should be submitted to the association as soon as possible for verification.

Yesterday, the association's cotton yarn price negotiation remained unchanged, with 20-count yarn still priced at 15.2 million.

Spot Cotton Declines

Yesterday's spot cotton transactions were very sparse, and the market was generally weak. There was an ample supply of lots on the market, with many sellers and few buyers. Prices were unsupported and continued to decline, with few transactions. The highest price actually traded was 4.3 million, a decrease of 200,000 from the previous day. Other trades were minimal. The trend was extremely soft, with 620 bales traded. The price for factory delivery was 4.45 million for 1 1/16-inch American cotton, 4.2 million for European cotton, and the price for delivery at the warehouse was 4.2 million to 4.3 million for Lingdou cotton, 3.25 million to 3.3 million for Huoji cotton, and 650,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.

Straight Stripe Serge Scarce

Straight stripe serge in various colors and patterns is extremely scarce. Only Huaxin, Dacheng, Dachun, and Yonghe in the Qipan Street area have some goods, and other stores rarely sell them. General shops are even more depleted. Due to the long absence of imported goods, old stocks are being sold at opportune moments. Because local factories consider the profits from producing serge to be less lucrative than those from flannelette, they have successively reduced production. Currently, due to the cold weather, demand from clothing and shoe industries is rising, and customer purchases are particularly strong. Therefore, the value of this serge is becoming increasingly popular, and the market is rising quietly. Yesterday, the ordinary price for each yard was over 900,000.

### Although Banks Extended Credit, No Loosening of Money Supply Was Seen

[Our Report] Yesterday, national banks extended 4.3 billion yuan at the clearing house. The tight money situation remained the same in the morning, improving slightly in the afternoon. However, cash was still tight, with an implicit interest rate of 2.2%. Outside the stock exchange, Hua shares were discounted by 3%. In the detailed breakdown of clearings, the Central Bank issued 8.8 billion yuan, with a large clearing inflow of 24.6 billion yuan, foreign merchants inflowed 29.4 billion yuan, small clearing outflowed 59.7 billion yuan, the Bank of China inflowed 12 billion yuan, and other banks had slight inflows and outflows.

### Arrival Sources Gradually Thriving, Inventory Increased; Black Market for Coal Expected to Be Eliminated

[Our Report] The Coal Management Committee recently reported that the arrival of coal has increased due to improved transportation on the northern rail lines. It is estimated that over 200,000 tons of coal will arrive this month (including over 10,000 tons of Taiwanese coal). Regarding white coal, the committee recently ordered 20,000 tons of Hongji white coal, which will be shipped successively from November this year until the end of April next year. At the same time, it is negotiating with the Jiaozuo Zhongfu Coal Mine to transport over 100,000 tons of white coal stored in that mine to solve the fuel problem for industrial workers and public educators. Furthermore, the committee's emergency coal reserve has reached 200,000 tons by the end of last month. It is expected that the target coal reserve of 300,000 tons will soon be reached. After October, the committee will be able to steadily increase the amount of coal allocated. According to the person in charge of the committee, the current supply of coal is sufficient for public utilities and transportation. There will be no shortage. The amount of coal allocated to factories and civilian use has also increased to 20,000 tons this month. If the allocation can be increased by another 40,000 tons after October, then the black market for coal can be eliminated invisibly.

### Paper Industry Temporarily Suspends Tea Parties, No Price Increases Allowed

In order to promote the government's economic policies, the Paper Industry Association has not only temporarily suspended tea parties but also advised its members to sacrifice personal interests and substantially reduce sales prices. On the 17th, it convened a meeting of retail members to discuss methods for stabilizing prices. It was decided that paper prices should only be reduced and not increased, so as to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices as soon as possible. Retail prices are as follows: 8.5 million per ream for white newsprint, 4 million per ream for folio newsprint, and 7 million per ream for white glazed paper.

### Domestic Tea Market Active

Yesterday, the foreign-style tea market for this year's Ping Shui, Shunyuan, and other major brands saw a resurgence of interest from export companies, but the asking price was far different from the premium goods, leading to stagnant transactions. On the other hand, domestic tea, which has been selling continuously for days, remained active due to the insatiable demand from stores in this city and in Suzhou, Wuxi and other places. However, sellers, seeing the shrinking market inventory, have intensified their efforts to hold firm, gradually leading to an imbalance between supply and demand. The number of transactions has frequently declined, while prices have remained consistently high.

### Hua Shares' Buying Sentiment Sluggish; Small Caps Suddenly See Vigor

Yesterday, the Yong Yarn situation in Hua shares was chaotic, with financial panic ultimately forcing prices down. However, amid rumors of large-denomination banknotes and personnel changes among important officials, small-cap stocks suddenly surged. Huaxin, Underwear, Liann, Xinya, and Commercial stocks hit their daily limits, while Yong Yarn recovered easily after falling.

Morning

The overnight money market saw general tightness, with panic in current accounts and uncertainty. After the opening, No. 97 and others offered, Yong Yarn retreated to 309 yuan and 332 yuan. Nos. 4 and 5 came to buy, rising to 314 yuan and 327 yuan. Nos. 156 and others continued to sell for forward delivery, while Nos. 8 and 9 offered for spot delivery. The off-exchange interest rate opened at 2.55% and 3%, with tight money conditions. Yong Yarn was forced down to a low of 30800 and 321 yuan for immediate delivery. No. 54 and others absorbed spot Yong Yarn, and No. 322 and others continuously absorbed forward delivery.

### Request that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Provide Services for Elderly and Weak Passengers

I absolutely agree with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's policy of not allowing people to see passengers off on board. Because whenever a ship is about to depart, the ship is extremely crowded, and the passage is congested, all due to too many people seeing passengers off. However, it seems somewhat inappropriate for the elderly and weak women and children to board the ship without anyone accompanying them. The last time I saw my mother and two children off to Ningbo, I was not allowed to board the ship because I did not have a ticket. But my mother is already seventy years old, and the children are only five or six years old. The high ladders cannot be climbed without someone's help, and arranging luggage on board also requires someone to take care of it. That day, I watched my mother take the two children up, trembling, while the passengers behind were pushing and shoving. I felt very uneasy, and I think many passengers feel the same way. I wonder if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has any way to improve services for elderly and weak passengers? I have always known your newspaper to be the voice of the people, with the widest circulation. Could you publish this openly so that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can pay attention and make corrections? This is submitted by Qian Chaozhen of Shenbao. Address: No. 1, Lane 28, Huixi Street, Xujiahui.

Spring and Autumn

### Continuing Dreams of Yangzhou, No. 23: Yangzhou Noodles and Dim Sum

By Weifahong

Tea houses and restaurants in large cities often display the sign "Weiyang Fine Dim Sum," indicating the deliciousness of Yangzhou dim sum. In fact, apart from dim sum, the sliced noodles also seem to have a special flavor, so let's briefly discuss Yangzhou noodles and dim sum.

Yangzhou sliced noodles, people from northern Jiangsu think that they are not as thin as those from Dongtai. Dongtai noodles can be called silver thread noodles, but Yangzhou's braised noodles are also unmatched by Dongtai and other places. There are many kinds of braised noodles, mostly varying with the seasons, such as knife fish braised noodles, crab braised noodles, wild duck braised noodles, etc. In addition, there are general ones such as shrimp braised noodles and shredded chicken braised noodles. The beauty of these braised noodles lies in the freshness of the noodle soup, the softness and tenderness of the noodles, while avoiding the soup and noodles becoming mixed and unclear. In the past, Yi Bingshou served as the prefect of Yangzhou, and Yi Mansion Noodles were created by him. It is said that braised noodles were also created by Gao Tuo Weng, the owner of Xiyu Spring. Yi and Gao were both from Fujian, and it seems that the creation of braised noodles was influenced by Yi Mansion Noodles.

As for dim sum, there are even more exquisite ones. The Shufanglu discusses the various tea houses in Yangzhou, believing that "their dim sum each occupies a prominent position. Shuanghonglou sesame cakes took the lead, with sugar filling, meat filling, dried vegetable filling, and Chinese cabbage filling. Yixing Ding Si opened Guan Kaixun Fang Ji Fang, famous for their fermented steamed buns. Ermeixuan is famous for its soup-filled buns, Yulian is famous for its spring pancakes, Wenxingyuan is famous for its shaomai, called 'ghost hair', Pinlu is famous for its Huai dumplings, and Xiaofang is famous for its vegetable dumplings, each extremely prosperous." As times change, these many tea houses that "each occupied a prominent position" are no longer seen. I remember that when I was still young, I saw "Pinlu" on Nanmen Street, a small tea house that was neither in its old location nor famous for its Huai dumplings, but even this no longer exists now. In recent years, apart from Chen's sesame cakes, I think that Cuishao shaomai, thousand-layer oil cakes, honey cakes, and soup dumplings are all worth mentioning.

I have mentioned jade shaomai and thousand-layer oil cakes in my Sequel to Xiyu Spring. Honey cakes are purchased by the catty from tea food stores, and are often not made by themselves. This cake is known for its softness, sweetness, and refreshing taste. The so-called "honey" should represent "honey." From this, it can be inferred that honey oil cakes are honey cakes, but they are quite different from honey cakes in other parts of Jiangnan, so they have a different flavor. It is already difficult for others to imitate them to be soft and sweet, and it is even more difficult to find them refreshing.

Let's talk about soup dumplings, also known as soup-filled buns in the Shufanglu, which are different from those made in Zhenjiang or Huaian. Zhenjiang and Huaian are both famous for their soup dumplings, but Zhenjiang only makes two kinds of soup dumplings in a year: fresh meat and crab roe. Yangzhou has more varieties such as wild duck and bean sprouts. Those made in Huaian, compared to those in Yangzhou, seem to be inferior in taste, only they are twice as large, making them uniquely large.

Yangzhou noodles and dim sum are as delicious as described above, so Yangzhou people are happy to go to tea houses for breakfast. People say that Yangzhou people "wrap water in their skin in the morning," and the deliciousness of the noodles and dim sum is a great temptation in the formation of this "skin-wrapped water" habit. Even for me, when I live in a foreign land, I often think of my hometown's noodles and dim sum for breakfast, like Zhang Han who missed the perch soup and minced meat from his hometown. However, although Yangzhou noodles and dim sum are good, Yangzhou tea houses are no longer what they used to be. In the past, tea drinkers ordered very few noodles and dim sum, but drank a lot of tea. They thought that drinking tea should not be too far removed from elegance. If they ordered too many noodles and dim sum, to the point of leaving a mess of cups and plates, they would inevitably reveal a vulgar air. They seemed to abide by a creed, which is "a gentleman tastes flavors lightly." But nowadays, those who come and go to tea houses do not mind ordering a lot of noodles and dim sum. If they only order a little, the waiter will not serve them well, and they will feel embarrassed themselves. Therefore, those who are short of money or who admire elegance no longer frequent tea houses. Even when they return to their hometown, they are like the visiting Zhang Han, and still keep the noodles and dim sum of their hometown in their memories!

### Recollections in Cold Clouds

By Shoujuan

It has been sixteen years since he passed away; August 31st was the anniversary of his death. His disciples, brother Yu Yifen, etc., specially chanted scriptures and held a memorial service at Jingtu Nunnery. Because I live in Wujin, I was not notified and did not go to participate in the sacrifice, but I felt ashamed to my old friend! I remember in 1915, Brother Han wrote a poem to advise his father against proclaiming himself emperor, titled "Mingfen": "The thin cotton barely withstands the cold, the uncertain clear weather is not clear until evening, the southward-returning geese drown the lonely moon, (Brother Han went south once) the eastward-going proud wind assaults nine cities; (referring to his father's involvement with Japan) time slips by and one fights for a moment, the sound of crickets urges dreams into the third watch; it is especially pitiful that there is much wind and rain at high places, do not reach the highest level of the building." The last two sentences subtly say that one cannot be an emperor. At that time, Congressman Sun Bolan based on this poem and declared opposition, saying that Xiangcheng's second son, Kewen, did not approve of the imperial system either, let alone others; finally, it triggered General Cai Songpo's Yunnan uprising, which overthrew Hongxian. My late friend, Brother Bi Yihong, once taxed this poem, which will surely have a place in history in the future; and Brother Han's disdain for the imperial prince shows the nobility of his character. Between 1920 and 1921, Brother Han came to Shanghai to work as a public official. I was concentrating on editing the later issues of "Saturday" Weekly. He gave me a letter, praising me greatly, saying that he was willing to be a friend with me. From then on, we became acquainted and had extremely close contact. Whenever there was a literary gathering, he would invite me to attend. All the antiques, cultural relics, ancient coins, stamps, etc. that he collected, he would let me stroke and admire them. Later, he became fond of Western ancient gold coins, and collected them extensively. Whenever he obtained one, he would discuss the Western characters on the gold coin with me. After two or three years, we had become close friends. Later, I edited and published "Bimonthly," "Violet," and "Violet Slices." Brother Han also helped me wholeheartedly. He was responsible for all the title slips used. He published famous works such as "Thirty Years of News and Travels," as well as countless other poems and essays. He wrote many poems specifically for me, and I now record one or two of them, such as the inscription on Violet Slices: "Still able to shed tears like pearls, the fragrance of violet has not moved away; the eyebrow marks of Wusong are still there, bitterly remembering the temples reflected in the blue waves." "Infinite love waves secretly communicate, violet slices are within inches; idle sorrow written into new lyrics, tears and ink are red as well." Inscription on the Violet Goddess Statue: "The goddess endlessly transforms into violet, the cloud carriage and star pendant fall into Jiangqian; in vain teaching oneself to flow immortal scenes from the stone, the ten red building dreams are already cold." "In the past, there was a wish to be mandarin ducks, snapping fingers, the hatred between the immortal and the mortal is long; the Luo River and Wushan are faintly visible, slightly remote dreams are already spiritually injured." Violet Goddess Praise: "Better than flowers, more round than the moon, fragrant, gentle, dream forever, a special sky of love. Holding a pearl in the right hand, waving tears in the left, may the goddess of flowers hold happiness and not fall." The elegance and refinement fully demonstrates his skill in poetry. Later, he returned to Tianjin and still often sent letters, and fondly remembered Jiangnan with a song: "The sound of the cuckoo is bitter, who shares my melancholy? I have long entrusted parables to convey my skills, now I record my travels from the small record. (At that time, Yu was traveling in Mogan Mountain, and there was a work of "Mountain Trivia," published in Shanghai newspapers and periodicals.) Dreaming of old violet thickets." Attached was a letter, saying that when we were in Shanghai, we were so compatible that we were like hands and feet, and he wished to become sworn brothers. He asked me for my approval. I was grateful and ashamed, and immediately wrote back agreeing. In 1932, Brother Han gave up his habits and lived a free life in Beijing and Tianjin. Unfortunately, he suffered from wool rash and died. When I received the bad news, I almost fainted from grief. Because I was involved in personnel matters, I was unable to go to offer condolences in person. I could only look north at Yanyun and break off from the world in the wind. Now he has been dead for sixteen years, and most of his posthumous works, apart from his diary, have been lost, which is truly a regrettable thing! Fortunately, his son, Zhong Yan Shuxuan, is studying in the New World and has achieved success, which can be used by the country; Brother Han's spirit should be smiling in the afterlife.

### Three Chapters of Dawn

— Cao Guoping

Morning Glory

Indeed, in this desolate garden, only the morning glories blooming wildly before dawn can be proud.

I see them smiling arrogantly, flaunting their beauty and despising the withered and faded flowers and plants nearby. They seem to be grateful that this harsh environment has given them a richer destiny.

Some branches bear pure white flowers, while others are a mix of purple and white. No one irrigates them, but no wild children come to break their branches and leaves. They live quietly and happily...

One day, I approached them, bending over to look at them. I suddenly noticed that these flowers were drooping their heads and sighing on the ground. I saw that the dew, which had always nourished their lives, had turned into the most bitter tears flowing from the depths of their hearts. These hot tears are a sign of the end of their lives, and a lament for their own death...

I seem to faintly hear their complaint; — "As soon as we see sunlight, our bodies will wither and decay, and the vitality of life will immediately disappear..."

I will always feel sorry for these flowers that can only live where there is no light—living a life of complacency and happiness. ...Because who can say that there will be no sun in the sky? That the earth will have no light again?

Seagull

Awake, the seagull on this beach, its body as white as a saint's dress. It flapped its wings, which had been curled up all night, and began to fly in the sky.

All around is silence. The fishing boats have not yet taken down their awnings, seeming to be comfortably letting the waves lick their bodies.

The seagull is soaring freely, sometimes riding the wind steadily forward, and sometimes flipping its wings to resist the wind and surge forward...

The seagull swoops down nimbly, urgently kissing the sea surface, reporting the news of dawn. Then, the vast sea shakes its calm body and opens its throat to sing the sound of roaring waves, praising the coming of light... The calm surface of the water is stirred, instantly becoming high hills and low mounds on the sea. It brings the vitality of life and marches forward with its responsibility.

The seagull busily but happily sings the morning song on top of every fishing boat. In an instant, the boats resting overnight by the shore raise their sails; the boatmen row their oars, making a sound of oars striking the water. The people on these boats, with great hope and full strength, begin their day's work.

The crashing sound of waves, the creaking of oars, and the loud songs weave together a welcome song. May the life of hope forever proceed in the song with happy days!

At the edge where the eastern sea meets the sky, a streak of red clouds appears.

Rising Sun

Finally, the rising sun, its fat face flushed red, struggled out of the embrace of the red clouds. The entire universe is illuminated and warmed.

Aren't the sweet songs sung by the little birds on the branches, the splashing sounds made by the fish in the water, and the spiritual songs in the hearts of mankind all praise for receiving its warmth and light?

Rising sun, I should thank you. Not a day goes by that you are willing to stop coming to the universe. From east to west, the fields and villages you pass through give the source of life—light and heat—. The wealthy in the garden have your warmth, and the beggars who have spent the night on the road can also enjoy your grace. You are not biased.

Rising sun, I praise you. Your ultimate love extends to all directions, and your pure love is sown in your own garden. The blood of your life personally pours into the bodies of us anemic people. You are the trunk of life, and you have stored rich nourishment to supply us branches that belong to you.

Rising sun, I will comfort you. Our branches will not waste the life you have given. We will bloom bright flowers and bear plump, sweet fruits. The nutrients in our branches—which you provide—will never be swallowed by aphids and caterpillars... We will do our best to preserve this indispensable vitality.

Rising sun, the sincere praise and gratitude of thousands of people is what you deserve, please accept it!

### Presented with a Painting Exhibition of Wu Lifu and a Verse from Su Shi

— Zhu Yingpeng

The more beautiful the mountains and rivers, the more tireless the mind becomes; the eyes exhaustedly follow the solitary wild goose on the edge of the setting sun. There is still a clear interest in the dream, and occasionally a poem is written without needing to be compiled.

Traveling ten thousand miles halfway across the world, with poetry and books in the belly, one's spirit naturally flourishes. Clouds and smoke fall on the paper after being drunk, and the north window startles my eyes with flying flowers.

Suddenly feeling that Mount Emei's emerald green has been swept away, the true form still exists in the painting. Directly use eyesight as the boundary, counting to which peak of the cloud peaks.

The rise and fall of the universe are within a speck of dust, and everything is obtained with a wave of the hand. Not understanding how to pursue worldly favor with painting, I am like a brother when I meet you.

Shaking hands and smiling for three thousand years, who among old friends can comfort the present? Great hermits originally have no boundaries, and have already been instructed to summon the flower-scattering fairies.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Originally, this kind of thing is born with a cunning heart, and with training, the main lesson is practical psychology, specializing in peeping into people's minds. First, give you many "sweeteners," while figuring out your goals, and then give you a big hope, hanging your appetite. You know it's not easy to deal with, but under the conditions of using a trick to counter a trick, you think it can be used and are unwilling to let go. Ji Qun is now facing such a thing—how do you think she should deal with it?

"What is your honorable surname, Mai?" Qun waited for it to stop, then broke her silence. "Oh, I'm really sorry, you were walking so hurriedly just now, I didn't hear it clearly, but your surname is Mai,—the Mai of barley?" Qun launched a surprise attack like a startled goose, using fleeting shadows.

"No," it smiled, showing that Yao Qun's opening was like its supreme glory: "Mai—the Mai of buying and selling."

"The Mai of trade?" Yao Qun's eyes moved, probably silently reciting "Zhao Qian Sun Li" to see if there was such an unpopular surname.

"You don't know," it understood Yao Qun's intentions, "this is not a Chinese surname."

"Then:" Yao Qun wanted to say "Then it must be a foreign surname?"

"But it's not a foreign surname either," it cracked open its thick lips again, "There's a tragedy inside." Speaking of the word tragedy, it sighed softly, as if it had stirred up endless feelings: "When my late mother was pregnant, she originally had two husbands, one surnamed Maikotorovskysky, and one surnamed Markosav. My late mother, in order to commemorate them both, gave me both surnames as soon as I was born, as legal heirs of both families. But because I went to a Chinese school in Harbin, the teacher said that the name was too cumbersome, so I cut off a large section in the middle, leaving only the head and tail as my name."

"Went to a Chinese school?" Jie Qun noted this point.

"Because my late mother was probably of Mongolian or "Manchu" nationality, she especially liked the Chinese language. That's why I went to a Chinese school. You know, my mother and I can speak four or five dialects besides Russian, including Japanese... But besides language, I like music the most, so I later specialized in music..." it promoted itself again.

"Vocal music? Or..." Yao Qun used the words to study its details.

"Alas, my old mother has a familiar voice, and my son can learn how to solidify it." It stretched out a pair of hands, "This pair of rakes, so I can't talk about musical instruments; I can only learn music theory and composition... Besides music, I am also fascinated by art. Although I can't do it myself, I can comment and research... In addition, Mongolian things, shooting, pride, wrestling, and fighting, can also be dealt with, but they are just tricks."

### About Kawashima Yoshiko

— Xia Xi

Everyone knows that Kawashima Yoshiko is a "rare object" in the history of the Sino-Japanese War. She used her charm and skills to engage in espionage work and participated in every conspiracy of Japanese aggression. She had lived all kinds of bizarre lives, as a princess and a commander-in-chief, and also as a dancer and a prostitute. And now, she is experiencing another environment—prison life. This may not be interesting to her, but in the hearts of thousands of Chinese people who have suffered, it should be satisfying enough. Didn't you see the record in the newspaper the day before yesterday? The public trial of Kawashima Yoshiko in Beiping almost broke the courtroom. Naturally, the mood of these observers, in addition to the pleasure of revenge, also carried a bit of curiosity. Curiosity is due to Kawashima Yoshiko's complicated and bizarre life.

Speaking of this "Far East Mata Hari," it's a long story. Everyone knows that she is the seventh daughter of Prince Su, originally a genuine Chinese product. After Prince Su committed suicide in Lushun due to the failure of his restoration, the Japanese ronin Naniwa Kawashima adopted her as his adopted daughter. According to Kawashima Yoshiko's autobiography: "My adoptive father is a well-known "China expert" in Japan. Through this relationship, I was able to meet some Japanese people and obtain the meaning of "Sino-Japanese friendship" from them. I have tried to integrate with their ideals and regard them as my motto, and even willingly dedicate myself to achieving them."

In fact, the first object of her "dedication" was her adoptive father. Later, there were some entanglements, and the father-daughter relationship was severed. Yoshiko lived a licentious life until the Black Dragon Society discovered her. She was transformed from a dissolute socialite into the current identity of a pro-Japanese traitor.

Kawashima Yoshiko was first given to Prince Baling of Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia as a tool of the Black Dragon Society. The Japanese wanted to use this relationship to occupy Inner Mongolia, which they had coveted for a long time, but Yoshiko couldn't get used to the desert life and secretly slipped back to Japan, making this "beauty scheme" finally fall short.

Subsequently, Yoshiko was sent to the Northeast and had a relationship with the Kwantung Army. Under the training of Doihara Kenji, she became a capable female spy. She often disguised herself as a female teacher or traveler to spy on military intelligence in the Northeast, and sometimes disguised herself as a Chinese or Korean prostitute, mingling in gambling dens and opium dens. She helped Doihara plan the Shenyang Incident and put Puyi on the throne. Four hundred female spies were once under her command. She also disguised herself as a Chinese student and was sent to Vladivostok to socialize with Soviet officials and spy on military secrets east of Lake Baikal, and even received a medal from the Japanese government for this.

During the "January 28th" battle, Kawashima went to Shanghai to work as a dancer, seducing Chinese military and political officials. The enemy army invaded Shanghai based on her intelligence. After the outbreak of the Rehe War, she actually organized an "army" and appeared as the Commander-in-Chief of Jin Bihui.

Since she was a child, she disguised herself as a man and chanted in middle school. In North China, she liked to wear a robe as a coat, silk boots, a melon-skin hat, and spoke fluent mandarin, completely in the style of a warlord, entering and leaving with guards and attendants, with great prestige.

Sometimes, this Commander Jin turned into General Wang, and sometimes into the dancer Wan Xianbai. After "August 3rd," she turned into a Chinese soldier and was active in the North Railway Station. Later, she turned into Li Songxiang and mixed with Chen Yaozu, the brother-in-law of the traitor Wang Jingwei, in Hong Kong. Finally, she returned to Beiping.

Her lovers can be said to encompass everything: warlords, Japanese ronin, barbershop owners, boxers, famous actors, and newspaper reporters. Wu Sheng Li Wanchun

The age of Kawashima Yoshiko is still a mystery: according to her testimony in court, she is thirty-five years old, according to the Beiping Chronicle, she is forty years old, according to the Shenbao reporter's interview, she is thirty-eight years old, and according to the household registration of the Third District, it is even more different. The household registration states: "Kawashima Yoshiko, Jin Bihui, forty-four years old, native of Manchuria, occupation Commander-in-Chief of the Manchurian National Corps." This was investigated in 1938, so calculating this year, she should be fifty-three years old.

It is said that her residence in Beiping was heavily guarded, such as raising twenty-nine military dogs and many monkeys, and two white chickens, specially trained to guard the door for her, but it was useless. On the first Double Tenth Festival after the victory, she was finally arrested in Beiping. In the courtroom, she was still "attacking east and west," sophistry, but the spy's tricks were ultimately not very useful in front of the judge! We are waiting for October 22, which will be the day to judge the crimes of Kawashima Yoshiko's life!

### The Third International

— Broken Wheel

Recently, the Soviet Union has announced the establishment of a new Communist International, which is enough to be exciting news. Regarding the resurrection of the Third International, let us look back at a brief history of it.

The Communist International, also known as the Third International, is also called the Comintern, because it is centered on the Soviet Communist Party. The so-called Third International has gone through three evolutions; the life of the First International was only eight years; while the Second International only lived for twenty-five years. The First and Second Internationals were both led by Lenin. The Third International was also produced under the leadership of Lenin, but after several twists and turns, it was stillborn; after the success of the Soviet revolution, it was established in Moscow from March 2nd to 4th, 1919. Representatives from 34 countries participated, gradually increasing to 65 countries.

From the birth to the dissolution of the Third International, it can be roughly divided into five periods: The first period was from its establishment to 1923. This period was when the Soviet Communist Party was engaged in seizing power. Although four years of civil war enabled the Communist Party to gain state power, the radical war communism had not yet found a way out. Therefore, within the Soviet Union, a new economic policy was adopted. The second period was from 1924 to 1927. The political struggle between Stalin and Trotsky was very fierce. Although both of them advocated world revolution, Stalin advocated slow progress, while Trotsky advocated rapid progress; as a result, Trotsky failed. The third period was from 1927 to 1935. The Soviet Union buried itself in domestic economic construction, and the so-called world revolution was temporarily suspended. Because the countries participating in the Communist International were in fact equivalent to vassals of Moscow, they also formulated their own party programs. The fourth period was from 1935 to 1938. At that time, the Nazi and Fascist forces were extremely consolidated, and the Communist International adopted a people's front policy to counter them, but without success. The fifth period began at the beginning of the Second World War in 1939. Because of the Soviet Union's treaty with Germany, the international nature of the Communist Party gradually shrank. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union and stood on the Allied side, the Third International organization was formally dissolved on May 22, 1943.

But in the two years after the Allied forces defeated the Axis powers, the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union became increasingly clear, and the gulf dividing the entire world into two became increasingly deep. The establishment of a new Communist International has dragged the earth closer to the brink of war!

### Two or Three Things About Roosevelt

— Wan Gongyu

On the last day of the Yalta Conference, everyone had free time to socialize and rest. A British attendant chatted with Roosevelt and asked him: "Mr. President, how old are you this year?"

Roosevelt replied: "According to the calendar, I am sixty-two years old this year, but when I have work to do, I am thirty-five years old."

A White House visitor asked: "Mr. President, how do you get so much patience—encountering so many troubles and uninvited guests in a day?"

Roosevelt replied indifferently: "When you spend two years learning how to wiggle your big toe, you will have patience."

### Conversation Between Sun Yu and Li Lili — A Record of the "Made in China" Welcome Tea Party

— Gong Wang

At the "Made in China" studio in Jin Situ Temple, a tea party was held, which, although not grand, was quite

Mr. Sun Yu raised the issue of "cooperation." He said: "...Film production in the United States is quite complicated and is based on a division of labor. Even a very small matter has a dedicated person in charge of managing it. If a small part of the work is selected poorly or delayed, it will affect the entire work..." He also said: "...Except that the United States has better scientific and technological equipment than us, their artistic level and spirit of hard work are not necessarily stronger than ours..." Mr. Sun's first question should alert our domestic film workers, and the latter words give us great comfort and encouragement.

In today's environment of poor material conditions and scarcity of film and equipment, if our film workers are still selfish, then we can only let this career, which has been struggling for more than twenty years, go down the drain.

Miss Li Lili is much slimmer than she was during the military parade. She said that she lost weight in the United States by not eating butter and milk, because in the United States, a fat girl will be considered "stupid." The United States is a country that loves beauty, especially girls, perhaps because of the abundance of butter and bread.

Miss Li said: No matter what in the United States, as long as a movie is a hit or a play is the most popular, then the director and actors of that movie or play are the most popular and best directors and actors. I believe we will never agree to this kind of system.

Miss Li talked a lot about her learning experiences in the United States and the jokes she shared with Mr. Sun Yu. But I have to raise a matter that deserves attention: that is, Americans do not understand China very well and often distort things. For example, they believe that the Cantonese films produced in Guangzhou a long time ago represent the Chinese film industry, and some even think it is surprising that China has movies.

Once, an American company asked Miss Li to star in a film for six weeks, with a remuneration of 26,000 US dollars. The subject matter of the script was about how a Chinese girl defrauded foreigners in an exchange and killed a foreigner and ran away. Miss Li resolutely refused because it contained places that insulted the Chinese people. This is quite commendable.

Miss Li also proposed striving for the foreign film market to exchange for foreign exchange, which is a very worthy issue to study. But I think that today, we should first consolidate ourselves, stabilize ourselves, and then strive for the foreign market. What we need today is everyone's sincere cooperation to strengthen our strength and consolidate the foundation of our career.

### The Next World War

— Yi Feng

In the process of the Second World War, mankind also repeatedly felt the preciousness of world peace. The late President Roosevelt of the United States, who led the Allied countries in the war, put forward the great slogans and plans of the Four Freedoms and the United Nations, drawing a beautiful vision of a peaceful post-war world for mankind who were still immersed in the war. However, even in the middle of the Second World War, many sensitive human beings were discussing the matter of the Third World War. As William C. Bullitt, the former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, said in the preface to his book The Great Globe Itself:

"In August 1944, on the eve of the Allied French forces attacking southern France, the generals gathered in General Petiot's restaurant. What they were talking about was not the current war, but the next world war. They all knew that the major powers at the time were studying how to use atomic energy for war, so they anticipated that the future war would be a contest between rockets loaded with atomic bombs and jet-powered aircraft."

So, "General Petiot ended the conversation with a wonderful metaphor. He said: "Do you want to ask about the outcome of the next world war? I think the human race will be completely destroyed by atomic bombs in this war. In the end, only two planes and two aviators will be left. They will pursue each other around the earth again. When they fly over Africa, the fuel will suddenly run out, causing them to fall and perish in the jungle one after another. At that time, an old gorilla squatting on the edge of the tree, seeing this scene, repeatedly shrugged its shoulders and said to its mate: Look, they are all finished, you and I have to start all over again."

Although this is full of humorous satire, it can be seen that the first atomic bomb did come to Hiroshima, Japan, and the second bomb came to Nagasaki, prompting Japan to surrender and shortening the end of World War II. The power of the atomic bomb is just as General Petiot and the other generals imagined. If used without restriction, mankind will be completely destroyed. Unfortunately, reality is too cold and ruthless, and the world situation after the war has become a "replica" of the pre-war situation; "atomic bombs" have also become a shadow on the fate of mankind, and people are enthusiastically discussing when the Third World War will occur.
