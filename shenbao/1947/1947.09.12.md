### Continued Joint Meeting of Party Groups: Lively Discussion of Organizational Outlines; Content of Political Outlines Still Requires Supplementation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the joint meeting of party groups continued its session at 9:30 AM on the 11th. Chairman Sun Ke presided. Over 280 Central Executive Committee members, Supervisory Committee members, and central cadres and supervisors of the Youth League attended. The assembly listened to two important reports. First, General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, gave a report on Xinjiang and answered inquiries regarding the Baitashan incident. Next, Gu Zhengding, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, gave a report on the Communist Party issue, offering a severe criticism of the CCP. After a 20-minute break, the assembly continued discussing the "Party's New Construction Outline" and the "Radical Reform Outline." The two outlines had already been merged into a single proposal by the Proposal Organizing Committee of the joint meeting of party groups. This morning's discussion focused on the "Political Outline" portion. Attendees continued to express their opinions until 12:00 PM, when the chairman adjourned the meeting. In the afternoon, starting at 3:30 PM, President Chiang Kai-shek chaired the session to discuss the draft of the Kuomintang Reform Outline proposed by the Organizing Committee. This draft was compiled by the Organizing Committee based on the "Party's New Construction Outline Draft," the "Party's Reform Outline Draft," and the opinions expressed during the previous days' sessions. It consists of two parts: (1) Current Organizational Outline, and (2) Current Political Outline. The latter was discussed first. Liang Hancao, convener of the Organizing Committee, explained the compilation process. Cheng Zhongxing, Lin Lin, Zhang Daofan, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Shizeng, He Haoruo, and others then spoke, offering opinions on disciplining the military, exposing corruption, recruiting talent, promoting national sports, and fostering a spirit of mutual aid and struggle. After a 10-minute break at 5:00 PM, the chairman announced that the content of the Political Outline still needed to be supplemented and would be submitted to the Presidium for research before further discussion. Then, the Organizational Outline was presented. Huang Shaogu, convener of the Organizing Committee, explained it, and the chairman presented each article for discussion. Attendees enthusiastically expressed their opinions. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. Several items were amended and passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The joint meeting of party groups will continue on the 12th to discuss this outline.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The joint meeting of party groups continued its session at 3:00 PM on the 11th. The President presided. Speakers were very enthusiastic, but due to time constraints, only the discussion on the party member section of the Current Organizational Outline was completed by 7:00 PM. The full text is as follows: As the Party and Youth League unify their organization and concentrate revolutionary forces to carry out the tasks of the later stages of the revolution, a thorough review of the Party's organization should be conducted to improve shortcomings, strive for enrichment and progress, adapt to the demands of the times, and nurture the driving force for the construction of a new China. Therefore, this Party Reform Outline is specially formulated as follows:

(1) Current Organizational Outline: (1) Principles: 1.

Absorb outstanding farmers, workers, and young intellectuals as the main force of the revolution to strengthen the Party's social foundation. 3. Establish the Party's style during the constitutional era, improve organizational operation. In the future, Party departments at all levels should strive to serve the people, earnestly improve the people's lives, alleviate their suffering, and increase their intellectual level. 4. Based on the Party's principle of democratic centralism, leading cadres at all levels should be elected democratically, with the minority subordinating to the majority and the majority respecting the minority. The President leads the entire Party, and the lower levels subordinate to the upper levels. Agencies at all levels should regularly submit work reports to Party members, and Party members should earnestly review work and offer candid mutual criticism. 5. Strengthen the spirit of learning, create a research atmosphere, and improve the theoretical level of Party members to achieve the effect of reforming thought and improving propaganda.

The specific measures will be determined separately.

### Zhang Zhizhong Reports to the Plenary Session: Three Stages of the Xinjiang Problem; Stability Must Be Sought in Construction in the Future

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] General Zhang Zhizhong, who arrived in Nanjing yesterday, reported on the Xinjiang issue at the joint meeting of the Central Party and Youth League on the morning of the 11th. After briefly describing the past and present situation of Xinjiang, Zhang made a prediction of the future situation. According to Zhang's report: Speaking of the past of Xinjiang, of course, we cannot talk about the too distant past. We must start from the time when Zuo Zongtang arrived in Xinjiang or when Xinjiang was established as a province. However, what I want to talk about today is the past situation of Xinjiang from the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in 1944 until Maisud became chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in May of this year. This period can be divided into three stages: The first stage was the military period. The Yining Incident began on November 7, 1944. As everyone knows, when Sheng Shicai left Xinjiang, the Central Army was fighting the War of Resistance. However, in order to rescue the people of Xinjiang and recover the national territory, the Central Government transferred a small number of troops to Xinjiang. However, after Chairman Wu Zhongxin took office for less than a month, riots broke out in Yining. The Central Army was weak in Xinjiang, and due to weather, supplies, and other reasons, it had to withdraw, and Yining was lost. In September 1945, rebellions broke out again in Yining. The three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan all fell. During this period, because it was at the beginning of the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Central Government, in order to strive for domestic peace, sent me to Xinjiang. President Chiang instructed me to save the crisis, stabilize Xinjiang, and deal with the Xinjiang issue with the Central Government's peaceful policies. After I arrived in Xinjiang, I negotiated with Yining. It took eight months to reach an agreement. This can be regarded as the stage of peaceful negotiations. Until July 1 last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government was reorganized according to the peace terms. Six committee members from Yining participated in the provincial government, but only four committee members actually took office. Until May 28 this year, when Maisud was ordered to be the chairman of the province, the situation in Xinjiang transitioned from military action and peaceful negotiation to the stage of political struggle. Over the past year, I have discovered that Yining attempted to use the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan as a base to develop to the remaining seven districts to specialize them, and then use special means to control the Xinjiang regime. In May, when I inspected southern Xinjiang, I discovered the seriousness of this situation and had to suggest that the Central Government find ways to restrain the development of this trend, and suggested that I resign from the position of chairman of the new province, and Maisud take over as chairman. The above is a rough overview of the past situation. The current situation in Xinjiang should start from Maisud's appointment as chairman until all the members of the Yining Provincial Government withdrew. In these three months, according to common sense, since the Central Government appointed Maisud as chairman, there was no reason for Yining to oppose it. Maisud's Uighur (i.e., Turkic) ethnicity accounts for 90% of the entire population of Xinjiang. It is the majority ethnic group among the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Maisud's appointment as chairman can prove that the Central Government respects ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, after Maisud's appointment was announced, the people of Yining were in an uproar and opposed it, and still asked me to continue to preside over the provincial government. This is truly a contradictory phenomenon. However, in the eyes of the people of Yining, it is not contradictory, because they have their own understanding, psychology, and attempts. The situation has become deadlocked. The Central Government's order cannot be changed, and Yining has also expressed its final decision. Therefore, after the opening of the New Provincial Council, it did not become a meeting. I tried to mediate, but it was still ineffective. Currently, the committee members of the Yining Provincial Government and the staff of various agencies in Yining have all withdrawn. This can be regarded as their final attitude. For this reason, on September 1, I sent a letter to the people of Yining with three questions: (1) Whether they intend to unilaterally tear up the peace agreement, (2) Whether they intend to launch another armed rebellion and are willing to bear the responsibility for destroying peace, (3) If they do not have the above two intentions, whether they are willing to come to peace talks again. However, this letter had not yet reached Yining when I learned of it on the 8th when I left Dihua. Currently, we are waiting for a reply. As for the future situation in Xinjiang, I dare not make a definite judgment on how it will develop, but what I can report to the assembly is that, judging from today's situation in Xinjiang, it will not deteriorate too much. It seems that there will be no more armed rebellions. Of course, we cannot be too optimistic and careless. What's more, the future of the Xinjiang issue will not depend on Yining's attitude, but everything should be sought from ourselves. Generally, there are three views on the Xinjiang issue: (1) The Xinjiang issue is a diplomatic issue, (2) The Xinjiang issue is a ethnic issue, (3) The Xinjiang issue is a problem intertwined with diplomatic and ethnic issues. However, to solve this problem in the future, we should take both ethnic and diplomatic approaches, especially from the Central Government's standpoint, we should first focus on ethnic issues. Today's Xinjiang is a Xinjiang illuminated by the brilliance of the Three Principles of the People. As Party members, we should faithfully implement the Three Principles of the People policy in that area. Among the 4 million people in Xinjiang, more than 3 million recognize the Central Government and support the Central Government. The majority of the remaining 700,000 people in the three districts of Yining are also forced by tyranny and dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Over the past few years, the ethnic policy has been implemented in Xinjiang. The most important thing now is to actively promote the policy of the People's Livelihood, because the people of Xinjiang are the poorest, and their culture, education, and everything else are backward, but what is hidden under the soil is the most abundant. Zhang emphasized at the end: The Xinjiang crisis is over today. Xinjiang will always be Xinjiang of the Republic of China. The question is how to build Xinjiang in the future, because building Xinjiang is the only good way to stabilize Xinjiang and win the people's hearts.

### Party Member's Oath: Oath of a Chinese Kuomintang Party Member

"I solemnly swear to believe in the teachings of Premier Sun Yat-sen, to join this Party, to strive to realize the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution in a new China, and to obey resolutions, abide by discipline, implement political programs and policies, accept the leadership of the President, share weal and woe, be of one heart and one mind, and carry through to the end. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe sanctions from this Party. I solemnly swear."

### The Chairman Sternly Denounces the Mentality of Relying on Foreign Aid

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the joint meeting of party groups last night. After analyzing the current situation, he said: Our economic, political, and military situations are not dangerous. If the Kuomintang Party members can strictly follow the government's orders, the economic situation will naturally stabilize and improve. People from all walks of life sympathize with the Kuomintang, and the people also support the National Government. The Communist Party is now doomed in China. When the war ended, I originally planned to issue new currency. At that time, there were 900 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange that could be used as a fund, but it was shelved because financial and economic experts believed that it could not be done without foreign aid. This kind of psychology of relying on foreigners is unlikely to succeed. If this plan could have been accepted at that time, today's situation would have been completely different. Now, in terms of economy and military affairs, if foreign aid can be obtained immediately, success will be achieved sooner. However, without foreign aid, the government can still overcome this difficulty, but it will take longer.

### Madame Chiang Organizes Northeast Relief Association to Raise Funds to Help Refugees in Disaster Areas

Raising relief funds will be completed within two weeks. The main work is to provide relief to the flood-stricken areas in the Northeast and the refugees in Sipingjie.

### Supervisory Committee to Hold First Meeting Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang was previously decided by the Standing Committee to hold its first meeting at 1:00 PM on the 12th at the Committee. After the meeting, all committee members will still participate in the Plenary Meeting of the Central Executive Committee of this session.

### Low Appeal from Hainan Island

— Bu Shaofu

Miscellaneous Notes from a Southern Tour, No. 5 (Part 1)

After the C47 aircraft took off from Baiyun Airport, my mind was imagining the solitary island in the South China Sea that I would reach in two hours. In the subtropical zone, what kind of face does it have?

Since this southern journey, Hainan Island is the only unfamiliar place that has not been visited by all members of our small group. Except for Mr. S who bombed Xiuying Port with American fighter planes during the war, and except for me who took a sea liner from Hong Kong to Haiphong before the Pearl Harbor incident and anchored outside Haikou Port for three hours and was subjected to enemy inspection, our past knowledge of Hainan Island was a blank piece of paper for everyone.

I was imagining, and my companions were also imagining:

Palm trees, coconut groves, towering everywhere. In the moonlight, men playing guitars, women humming tropical love songs, a group of sitting men, women, old and young clapping in rhythm...

The flood-stricken area of the Xijiang River overflows. This tragic scene was exposed under the wings, disappointing us Honolulu daydreamers.

No one found the Honolulu impression until four days later when we left Hainan Island. Although we only lingered in Haikou, and even the nearest Wenchang was not visited, all the friends we contacted in Jiaji, Lehui, Wanning, and even Danxian smiled and told us that this beautiful reverie was probably an infection from Hollywood movie scenes. At this time, we couldn't help but admit it.

Zhudao, Zhuyai, Qiongzhou, Qiongyai, these are all names for Hainan Island. This island with an area of nearly 100,000 square li is geographically similar to Hong Kong. Hong Kong faces the Kowloon Peninsula across the sea. Hainan Island is like a pearl in the mouth of the Leizhou Peninsula. However, Hainan Island is almost a thousand times larger than Hong Kong, and the narrowest sea distance between it and the Leizhou Peninsula is also four times greater than Hong Kong and Kowloon. This is a very interesting geographical reprint, the difference being in large and small sizes only.

In fact, the urban landscape of Haikou, that kind of mood, is somewhat like Guangzhou Bay, and somewhat like Haiphong. And what is presented is clutter, lifelessness, and all activities of people seem aimless. I had this feeling in Beijing and Shenyang two months ago, and I was also puzzled by this atmosphere in Hankou and Changsha this time. This is a universal internal injury, a basic decline, and it was unseen in various cities during the War of Resistance. The air is very quiet, but it cannot hide the anxiety in people's hearts. The question of restructuring has been delayed for nearly a year, and administrative agencies at all levels from the commissioner's office down cannot be unaffected by it. Four hours after we arrived in Haikou on August 9, at a symposium held by Cai Jinjun, the commissioner of Qiongyai (District 9) in Coconut Garden, I asked him about this issue. He replied very simply: "As long as I am in office for one day, I will work for one day." From this sentence, I dare not guarantee that he has longer-term plans, and I dare not guarantee that everyone under him can be so calm.

Coconut Garden (place name) used to be the headquarters of the Japanese Hainan Island Expeditionary Army. The houses are all Japanese-style, and there are still grass mats in Cai's office. However, the scenery in the garden is full of tropical scenery. Except here in Haikou, you can see clusters of lush coconut groves. You can only appreciate the charm of these forests when you get to Wenchang. Coconut Garden has now been decided to allocate to Hainan University as the school site. This vast reclaimed land on the beach will be a good place for students to relax their minds in the future.

### The Four-Banks Joint Treasury Approves Increased Loans for Salt and Tea

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Four-Banks Joint Treasury held its 352nd board meeting on the morning of the 11th. Yu Hongjun acted as the chairman and passed three important cases:

(1) Salt loan quotas for the Shanghai and Changlu areas were decided. The production and sales loans for the Shanghai area will be increased by a total of 46 billion yuan, bringing the total to 89.9 billion yuan. The production and sales loans for the Changlu area were approved at 29.4 billion yuan.

(2) This year's tea loan was resolved: 1. According to the actual situation, the pledge amount per dan will be increased to 1.4 million yuan for Qihong, 1.2 million yuan for Tunlv, 1 million yuan for Pinglv, 1 million yuan for Ninghong, 800,000 yuan for Minhong, and 800,000 yuan for Wenhong. 2. Those whose quality does not meet the standards will not be mortgaged. 3. The maximum mortgage period is two months. If it is not redeemed by the due date, the China Farmers Bank will dispose of the mortgaged goods and absolutely no extensions are allowed. 4. The original approved mortgage fund was 81.9 billion yuan, which will be used for turnover within the quota, and will not be increased for the time being.

(3) The Huainan Salt Reclamation Company applied for a loan to restore cotton fields in the Huainan salt area. In order to assist the government in grasping materials and reducing foreign exchange expenditures, the company was approved to borrow 5 billion yuan. The company will repay all principal and interest with raw cotton upon maturity. The China Farmers Bank will immediately negotiate with the company to determine the amount of cotton to be repaid, based on the current market price of cotton, to facilitate conversion.

### Soong Ching-ling Campaigns for National Assembly Delegate and Registers with the Guangzhou City Party Headquarters

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 11th] Soong Ching-ling decided to campaign for a National Assembly delegate for Guangzhou and, in accordance with the Kuomintang's guiding principles for comrades participating in the election, entrusted Mayor Ouyang to fill out the form on her behalf and apply for registration with the Guangzhou City Party Headquarters.

[This Newspaper News] An important member of the Democratic Socialist Party stated that the list of general election candidates is still under review and may not be submitted before the 15th of this month, because after the list is sorted out, it must still be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. Nearly 200 people within the Party have applied to be candidates for the Legislative Yuan, and even more have applied to be candidates for the National Assembly.

### Case of the United Logistics Command Embezzling and Selling Military Cloth: Ma Fengbo Sentenced to Death

Production Department Director Xiang Ren Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The case of Ma Fengbo, the director of the Shanghai Temporary Tailoring Plant of the United Logistics Command, and others embezzling and selling 2,500 bolts of military cloth has been clearly investigated by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense. With the President's approval, Ma Fengbo was sentenced to death for jointly embezzling public property. Xiang Renlan, the Major General Director of the Production Department of the United Logistics Command, was sentenced to seven years in prison for failing to report known corruption by his subordinates. Other accomplices, such as Xu Ying, the section chief of the Production Department, were all convicted according to law and sent to prison to serve their sentences.

### Soviet Union Uses Puyi to Build a Puppet Organization in the Northeast; American Expert Writes an Article on the Soviet Union's Refusal to Extradite

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] According to Yang, an expert on Far Eastern issues: The Soviet Union may want to support Puyi, the "Manchu" puppet emperor, and establish a Communist province in the Northeast. Yang wrote a special article for the Hearst newspaper today, stating: The Soviet Union's refusal to extradite Puyi to the Chinese government may be preparing to send Puyi to the Northeast to serve as "the head of the proletarian government, becoming a pro-Soviet buffer state, completely the same as when Japan used Puyi from 1931 to 1935." Yang said: "It seems contrary to common sense for a communist country to set up a monarch, but in terms of Puyi's strange fate in his life, it is not inconsistent." The article pursues the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of a "convention" with Puyi in 1935, selling the Sino-Soviet jointly owned Middle East Railway in the Northeast for 40 million yuan. However, the Soviet Union did not give China a penny. Since the pro-Soviet Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union has now obtained joint control of the Northeast Railway. The 40 million yuan that the Soviet Union obtained from selling the railway in 1935 is now not mentioned at all. Yang supports our country's request, claiming: Puyi should be returned to China to be tried for treason, because Puyi is the abdicated emperor of China, so he is a citizen of China. He and Japan jointly rebelled against his own country, so he should be tried for treason and war crimes.

### Amidst Calls for a Peace Conference with Japan, the U.S. Emphasizes China's Stance; Marshall States Negotiations with Various Nations Will Commence

[United Press International, Washington, 10th] Regarding the rumored statement by Chinese Premier Zhang Qun in his speech, suggesting that China would not participate in a peace conference with Japan if the Soviet Union did not attend, official sources here expressed astonishment tonight. According to well-informed sources, the United States has not received formal notification of this position from the Chinese side. However, U.S. government officials acknowledge that if China were to adopt such a stance, it would further complicate the prospect of an early peace conference with Japan. Chinese sources here suggest that Zhang Qun's remarks may have been misinterpreted. As far as the embassy is aware, China's current position remains consistent with its response last month to the U.S. proposal. The point of disagreement between China and the U.S. was the U.S. proposal to abolish the veto power in the conference and replace it with a three-out-of-four majority vote among the major powers to make decisions. This modification of the veto power would prevent any single power from dissenting. Therefore, China informed the U.S. that it would be willing to reconsider its position if other countries had different opinions. It is reported that some members of the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission believe that China is likely to adopt this stance.

According to sources close to the Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission, China's views at recent meetings of the Commission have shifted closer to the Soviet Union's position, with growing concerns that the U.S. will rebuild Japan on too grand a scale. If China were to adopt this position, and both the Soviet Union and China did not participate, the U.S. would need to re-evaluate the entire issue of a peace conference with Japan.

According to reliable sources, U.S. officials are currently planning to issue invitations to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, inviting them to the U.S. to hold preliminary meetings on Japan during the UN General Assembly session. It is acknowledged that the Soviet Union may refuse to participate, as the Soviets have twice notified the U.S. that the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan should be handled by the Council of Foreign Ministers, not by the eleven nations. However, the U.S., with the support of the British Commonwealth, the Philippines, and other countries, is reportedly proceeding with the plan. Official sources also acknowledge that if China aligns with the Soviet Union, the situation will change completely. The U.S. risks proceeding with the conference without Soviet participation, but cannot do so without the participation of both China and the Soviet Union. Some sources believe that even if China adopts this position, U.S. and British influence may still persuade them to adopt their original approach.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th] Marshall stated today at a press conference that the U.S. is currently negotiating with ten relevant countries regarding the peace treaty with Japan. However, he declined to comment on whether a preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan could be convened during the UN General Assembly session.

### The Flames of War in Anhui Spread to the Central Region; The Situation in Tongcheng and Lujiang is Unclear

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 11th] The flames of war in western Anhui have spread to the grain-producing areas of central Anhui. Currently, there are communist bandit disturbances in the counties of Lujiang, Tongcheng, and Wuwei.

### The Association for Comforting Soldiers is Established; Respects Paid to Chairman and Frontline Soldiers; Decision to Raise 50 Billion Yuan for Comfort Funds

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The National Association for Comforting Soldiers Fighting the Rebellion held its inaugural meeting at Jieshou Hall in Nanjing at 7:00 PM on the 11th. The meeting was chaired by Minister Gu, and over 500 people from all walks of life attended, including Yu Bin, Chen Qitian, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Lifu, and Shen Yi. Minister Gu first reported on the significance of the association's establishment, stating that in order to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible, it is necessary to encourage frontline soldiers to strengthen their fight against the rebellion. During the War of Resistance, we organized the National Comforting Association, which had a positive effect on boosting morale. Although the current war is internal, striving for national independence and freedom means that suppressing the internal rebellion is a continuation of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we should respect and encourage the soldiers to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. Peng Erkang of the Central Party Headquarters then declared that today's meeting welcomes the Central Military Comforting Delegation, and that the comforting work for new recruits in various places has been best performed in Shanghai. He then announced that the targets of the association's work are frontline soldiers, new recruits, and the general public.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 11th] The proposal to improve military discipline and administration submitted by the Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei Military and Administrative Supervisory Group to the National Government is reportedly divided into three parts: a preamble, methods, and an introduction. It analyzes the causes of corruption in military discipline and administration in great detail. There are twelve points regarding methods to rectify military discipline: (1) Improve soldiers' pay. (2) Office expenses and non-staple food expenses should be adjusted according to the price index. (3) Military rations and clothing should be delivered on time, and attention should be paid to their quality. (4) The price of non-staple food and horse feed for the military should be based on market prices. (5) The use of troops should be coordinated with personnel relationships. (6) Political and military affairs should be closely coordinated. (7) Officers and soldiers should live together. (8) Strengthen military training. (9) The military and local governments should closely cooperate. (10) Rewards and punishments should be clear, from top to bottom. (11) Strengthen the organization and training of the masses. (12) Strengthen the people's armed forces. The administrative section proposes: (1) Improve the salaries of civil servants to maintain a minimum standard for a family of five. (2) Agency expenses should be matched to the actual work. (3) Consolidate redundant agencies and eliminate superfluous staff. (4) Simplify and unify laws and regulations. (5) Civil servant salaries in the same region should be equal, and the salaries of employees of state-owned production agencies should be equal to those of ordinary civil servants. The special treatment of civil servants close to the front lines or those who are rushing to repair railways should be improved. (6) Rewards and punishments should be clear, with equal emphasis on rewards and punishments.

[Another Telegram] The Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei Military and Administrative Supervisory Group telegraphed the National Resources Commission on the 11th, requesting an investigation into Yu Changju, manager of the Peiping branch of the Hebei Electric Power Company, because his poor management of personnel and machinery has caused repeated breakdowns in the Jingshan power plant, plunging Peiping into darkness. They have also received repeated anonymous letters accusing him of corruption, which is still under investigation. The group also announced today that, according to anonymous reports, the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Regional Direct Taxation Bureau and the Peiping Branch have been involved in major corruption cases, and evidence has been found. It is reported that the cases involve the estate of Xiao Zhenying and the legacy of Feng Xinzhuan, owner of the Mu Zeng military uniform store. Both of these estates are worth tens of billions of yuan and have not been taxed.

### Guangdong Province Rectifies Administration; A Large Number of County Magistrates Dismissed or Transferred

According to sources in the provincial government, a large number of county magistrates may still need to be adjusted in the coming days.

### Coal Supply for This Winter is Not Expected to be Scarce; Coal Shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area Can be Avoided; The Ministry of Economic Affairs No Longer Controls Household White Coal for Residents

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the coal shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai area last winter was due to the freezing of Qinhuangdao, which prevented the southward transportation of Kailuan coal for several months. This year, preparations have been made in advance, and it is expected that a shortage will not occur again. As for household white coal for residents in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the Ministry's Fuel Management Committee is no longer controlling it. It is claimed that the main sources of fuel coal for the Nanjing-Shanghai area are currently the Kailuan, Taiwan, Huainan, and East China mines. Kailuan produces 450,000 tons per month, Taiwan 220,000 tons, Huainan 65,000 tons, and East China 45,000 tons. In terms of transportation, Kailuan coal is transported by the Beining Railway to Qinhuangdao and then by sea to Shanghai. Currently, there is no shortage of ships for maritime transport, but the Beining Railway is limited by the lack of railcars, and its transport capacity is only about 110,000 tons per month, which is insufficient. As for Taiwan coal, it is transported by ship to Shanghai, about 40,000 tons per month. Coal from the Huainan and East China mines is transported to Nanjing via the Jinpu Railway. The former averages about 40,000 tons per month, and the latter about 3,000 tons. If transportation can be improved, the amount of coal transported from each mine will certainly be more than the above figures. The coal demand in the Nanjing-Shanghai area is more than 150,000 tons per month for Shanghai and 50,000 tons per month for Nanjing.

### Coal Shortage in Changchun Becomes More Severe; Civilians Dig for Coal Slag

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 10th] The coal shortage in Changchun is severe, and parks have become coal mines. In Zhongshan Park, the most prominent park in the city center, the levee between the lakeside and the sports field, which is over ten zhang long, is currently being desperately dug up by hundreds of civilians to search for coal slag. This levee was formed by the dumping of coal slag over many years and is now covered with lush trees, with elm and locust tree trunks exceeding a foot in diameter. After the excavation, each pit is more than a zhang deep, and the roots of the trees are visible, their pale white contrasting with the black coal slag, creating a particularly poignant scene. When asked, the coal diggers said: "We were afraid of the cold last year, so we have to start thinking about it early this year." In reality, coal in the Northeast is more important than food for general livelihood during the six months from the winter months of October to March of the following year.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 11th] Amidst the coal shortage, local newspapers here reported the discovery of a coal seam at Dimingling on the Jichang Line, which is generally believed to be connected to the Yingcheng Mine. The relevant authorities may engage in mining after surveying the area.

### Tractors in the Northeast Gain the Favor of Farmers

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] The Northeast Agricultural Tractor Management Office led reporters to Tiexi today to observe agricultural tractors. These powerful iron oxen have won the favor of farmers, who have gone from skepticism to trust. This is a testament to the achievements of the office's work in April. The office was established on May 1st and has 174 tractors. It has trained 40 drivers and technicians. However, due to the impact of the war north of Shenyang, the work is currently limited to the Shenyang area and has not yet been expanded. The Northeast has superior conditions for agricultural mechanization, and a quarter of the arable land requires 3,000 tractors.

[United Press International, Tianjin, 11th] The Tianjin Police Chief told reporters on the 11th that a U.S. Marine Corps colonel had been arrested by the U.S. Navy authorities here on suspicion of smuggling drugs to North China after arriving here from Qingdao.

The Tianjin police recently detained Bo Hoff, director of the Western Medicine Department of the Swiss Red Cross, for questioning about the smuggling of Western medicine. The Tianjin Police Chief said that the smuggled Western medicine included 576 bottles of penicillin pills.

Editorial

### Our Country's Basic Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Conference

According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th, American officials have expressed surprise at Premier Zhang's statement that "China will not attend a Japanese peace conference in which the Soviet Union does not participate." However, as of now, we have not seen the full text of Premier Zhang's speech or address in the newspapers, so it must be a misreport by the American press. However, these few words are related to our country's basic attitude towards the Japanese peace conference, and we cannot allow the United States to misunderstand, so we need to explain it.

The American misunderstanding of our country's basic attitude towards Japan may have been caused by Foreign Minister Wang's recent speech in Shanghai. Foreign Minister Wang frankly stated regarding the American proposal to convene a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty: "China has already made it clear that if the Soviet government refuses to participate in the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty proposed by the United States, then China will reconsider its position on this matter." He also said: "We cannot lightly abandon the cooperation of certain countries and propose to make peace with Japan alone. The purpose of our efforts should be to conclude a treaty that is beneficial to all Allied countries and supported by all Allied countries." This statement is extremely appropriate and accurate, with a positive meaning. Striving for the Soviet Union's participation in the Japanese peace conference has won unanimous praise from the Chinese and foreign press. Unexpectedly, the United States misunderstood, believing that China's position would be the same as the Soviet Union's because China wanted to strive for the Soviet Union's participation in the Japanese peace conference. Such a misunderstanding by American officials is not only unfortunate for Sino-American relations but also unfortunate for the entire Far East.

China's basic attitude towards Japan has been repeatedly stated by the government. Even recently, when Premier Zhang reported on domestic and foreign policy guidelines at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, he also pointed out China's basic attitude towards Japan in regards to the Japanese peace treaty issue: In short, although we do not adopt a retaliatory approach, we will never give up our right to demand due compensation from Japan. We are willing to see Japan's peaceful recovery, but we must prevent Japan from becoming a threat to peace in the Far East again. These few words have expressed China's basic attitude most thoroughly. Not only is it unanimously supported by the government and the public in our country, but it will also certainly be welcomed by all Allied countries. However, as of today, the issue of the Japanese peace treaty is no longer about differences in principles and ideals but about the inconsistencies in the interests of the Allied countries. Especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, because of the difference in interests, they cannot tolerate and trust each other, so they tend to extremes, creating the current stalemate of being unable to move forward or backward. Although the United States has tried every means in diplomacy to break the deadlock in the Japanese peace treaty, it has consistently failed to achieve results, so it has the intention of excluding the Soviet Union and making peace with Japan alone.

The suggestion of making peace with Japan alone was first proposed by former US President Hoover. At that time, the State Department stated that this was Hoover's personal opinion and not the view of the US government. However, the American media felt great interest and attached great importance to it, and they commented on it one after another. Everyone believed that Japan had surrendered for nearly two years, but the situation in the Far East had not yet stabilized, and a Japanese peace treaty should be concluded immediately so that the Far Eastern political situation could be brought into order as soon as possible. Therefore, they unanimously demanded that the Soviet Union reconsider its attitude. The so-called making peace with Japan alone was only a threat to the Soviet Union at that time, and no one expected that Hoover's proposal would have the possibility of being realized. But now, because of the changes in US-Soviet relations and the sharp turn for the worse in the situation in the Far East, the United States is considering excluding the Soviet Union and making peace with Japan alone.

How to clean up the mess in the Far East after the war? It is most closely related to the security of our country, and the resolution of the Japanese reparations issue is of particular importance to our country's interests. Therefore, from the day Japan surrendered, China has hoped to conclude a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible so that the situation in the Far East can be stabilized as soon as possible. However, due to the international situation, it has been delayed until today, and not a single word of the Japanese peace treaty has been drafted, which has long made China impatient. Therefore, from this perspective, the United States and China share the same desire for the Japanese peace treaty to be concluded successfully as soon as possible. However, the wishes of the United States and China have not been realized. What is the crux of the matter? It is obviously the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union that has caused the work of the Far Eastern Commission to be almost at a standstill and unable to move forward. The first to suffer from this stalemate is our China. On the one hand, being caught between the United States and the Soviet Union, we often feel the pain of being in a dilemma. Although our country has done its best to be a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, the facts have proven that it has not been able to achieve its wishes. On the other hand, we have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's delaying policy, which has hindered the convening of the Japanese peace conference due to our own interests. At the same time, we cannot fully agree with the United States' Far Eastern policy.

First, the United States' current Far Eastern policy has not yet broken away from the approach of "Europe first, the Far East second." For Europe, under the Truman Doctrine, the United States has spared no expense in assisting countries such as Greece and Turkey to prevent the intrusion of foreign forces. However, for the Far East, it has not yet implemented its Truman Doctrine in the Far East. The crisis in the Far East is deepening day by day, which is enough to constitute a source of international turmoil, but the American diplomatic authorities are still turning a blind eye and letting it develop naturally. This policy is enough to cast a major mistake in American diplomacy.

Second, MacArthur's treatment of Japan is all about appeasement, even bordering on indulgence. The speed of Japan's recovery as a defeated country is almost unparalleled in modern history. Even today's Germany is far behind. Although the Japanese are doing their best to show their submissiveness on the surface, their ambition to engage in aggression again has not only never been abandoned but has also been rekindled. MacArthur trusts Japan too much, and the result is enough to cause another catastrophe in the Far East. It is nothing less than a major threat to China's peace and security. The early opening of Japan's foreign trade has made our country even more uneasy economically.

Third, some people in the United States are even advocating supporting Japan and want to make Japan the stabilizing force in the Far East in the future. This view is completely contrary to the US's view of China as a stabilizing force in the Far East during the war. Although it is currently only the opinion of the American people, the United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign affairs are based on public opinion. This view may be adopted by the government in the future. Moreover, this view also contains other effects. We assume that the United States will forget the bloody lesson of Pearl Harbor in the future, recognize the enemy as a friend, and cooperate with Japan. Then, the great tragedy of the Far East will be staged immediately.

From the above, China cannot help but be suspicious of the United States' Far Eastern policy. Therefore, we must be very cautious about the future Japanese peace conference. Although our country's basic attitude towards Japan has always remained unchanged, we must strive for the Soviet Union's participation in the form of the peace conference. As Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao said: "Peace is indivisible. We hope to see collective security. I hereby warn any country not to hope or advocate making peace with Japan alone." At the same time, regarding the voting method to be adopted by the peace conference, in order to maintain its position in the peace conference, our country's public opinion unanimously advocates maintaining the veto power, because this power is really too important for China. China cannot be in a leading position like the United States, nor can it have many satellite countries like the United Kingdom, nor can it be as powerful as the Soviet Union. When encountering major issues of interest, if China cannot exercise its veto power, it will inevitably be sacrificed.

In short, our country has long decided on the basic attitude it should adopt towards the Japanese issue. It does not focus on its own gains and losses but focuses on the peace and stability of the entire Far East. Although we are eager for the Japanese peace conference to be convened as soon as possible, we are also unwilling to immediately conclude a peace treaty that is not conducive to peace in the Far East. Our efforts to secure Soviet participation in the peace conference do not mean that we will stand or fall with the Soviet Union but that we hope that the Japanese peace conference will take into account the interests of all Allied countries and that peace in the Far East will be established on a rational basis. That's all. Therefore, we hope that the American public and political circles can deeply reflect that, whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of the United States' own interests, the current policy towards Japan really needs to be changed. In any case, the United States is not allowed to make major mistakes in diplomacy at this time.

### France's Peace Proposal to Vietnam Resolutely Rejected by Ho Chi Minh: No Ceasefire Without True Independence

[Reuters, Saigon, 11th] Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh broadcast to the Vietnamese people this morning, stating that the proposal broadcast by Vietnamese Governor Bollaert last night was completely disappointing and unacceptable. Ho called on the country to awaken from its current state of lull, to resume actively fighting the French immediately. Ho pointed out that Bollaert's proposal was so unsatisfactory that, if the war were to end tomorrow, the Vietnamese would ridicule allying with France in any way. Ho claimed that, except for the French, no one in the world was still trying to control the diplomatic affairs of other nations. Yet while the French proposed independence for them, they still did not allow them to comment on the country's foreign relations, which was not independence, but foolish, laughable, and despotic imperialism. They solemnly opposed it, and would continue to maintain a state of war with France, hoping that their young compatriots would enlist and go to war. The war has been going on for more than ten months, and the people's spirit has inevitably become slack, and must be reinvigorated immediately. Bollaert's latest proposal brought from Paris was no more than a bone without meat thrown to a dog.

The Wise Policies of Britain and America: Do Not Follow the Old Tricks of the Netherlands

What they demanded was complete independence within the French Union, an independence equal to that granted by Britain to India and Pakistan and that granted by the United States to the Philippines. The French, now powerless and beggars, still wanted to practice the lowest form of 19th-century imperialism, which they would never accept. Independence must be complete independence, or they would never accept it. The French should pay attention to the fact that peace negotiations in other parts of Asia have yielded perfect results. Now, they want to force them to accept peace by force. Look at Indonesia, where the Netherlands is already pleased with the development there. What their high commissioner is proposing is precisely a false copy of the old tricks of the Dutch, and the consequences will be equally bad. They will never stop fighting until they achieve their goal. If they continue to maintain their current position, they will sever all ties with the French Union, in which case French commercial interests in Vietnam will be cut off for many years. They will never stop fighting. The Viet Minh Liberation Army will continue to fight in the cities and battlefields until the last French invader is driven out of the Vietnamese coast. Ho finally called on the Viet Minh to nurture the influence of its call to war, saying, "The honor of our nation has been stained, and it is up to you to restore its purity. Quickly take up your sharp blades and fight! Strive to fight!"

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] Vietnamese representatives who came to Hong Kong to attend the meeting convened by Annamese Prince Bao Dai expressed dissatisfaction with the broadcast speech of French High Commissioner in Vietnam Bollaert on the 10th, believing that the French authorities should not ignore the importance of Vietnamese independence and unity. These Vietnamese representatives held a symposium at their hotel on the morning of the 11th, but Bao Dai did not participate. According to the Vietnamese in the French-controlled areas of Vietnam, they hope that France can make peace with Bao Dai and restore the monarchy.

### US-Soviet Talks on Korea Cannot Proceed: US Considers Unilateral Action; US Military Governor of South Korea, Lerch, Dies of Illness

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Responsible parties today stated that the United States is prepared to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations for handling as soon as possible in order to break the US-Soviet deadlock and promote the unification of Korea. Since the Soviet Union has rejected the State Department's proposal to hold a four-power conference, the United States has no choice but to make other preparations.

It is expected that the United Nations will appoint an investigation team to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and then submit a proposal requesting the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops from the north and south of Korea respectively, and then hold national elections under the supervision of the United Nations to form a unified government. If the United Nations takes action as predicted, the Soviet Union is expected to oppose it. If so, the United States will take this as a signal to unilaterally implement its long-shelved plan to develop the economy of southern Korea. In addition, the State Department also plans to allow southern Korea to hold elections and form a fully elected parliament, which will then produce a provisional government with one president, one prime minister, and several ministers. This election will be held around December 1, and all adult men and women will be able to participate in the election in accordance with the new election law. After the US Congress reconvenes in January next year, it will first discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid, and then it hopes to be able to immediately discuss the plan for economic construction in southern Korea.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall recently confirmed that the Soviet Union has rejected the US proposal to convene a four-power Korean conference, and said: The State Department is still studying the Soviet Union's reply before taking the next step. The next step the United States takes may be to discuss the Korean issue with other relevant countries, namely China and the United Kingdom. Marshall continued to confirm that the US delegation to the US-Soviet Joint Commission has sent a report to this place, saying that it is impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the working principles of the Joint Commission.

[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Lieutenant General Lerch, the US military governor of the US-occupied zone of South Korea, died here on the 11th at the age of 53. Military doctors said the cause of death was coronary venous congestion.

[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in South Korea, said on the 11th: "The sudden death of General Lerch is a great loss to me, to the United States, to Korea, and to the Korean people. The General worked too hard, which led to his inability to enjoy a long life and his death for the independence of Korea."

### Indo-Dutch Dispute: Security Council Urges Submission of Report

Dutch Government to Issue Statement Regularly

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] With the Security Council now in recess, the representatives have now shifted their attention to the Dutch-Indonesian issue. According to Soviet representative Gromyko, chairman of the Security Council in September, the Soviet Union insists that the consular investigation team should submit a report on the Java war immediately. If the Security Council does not receive a preliminary report within days, then I, as chairman, will have to pay attention to this and include it in the agenda.

[Reuters, The Hague, 11th] The Dutch Lower House concluded its current session today, and the next session is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. The Speaker announced that the Dutch government will issue a statement on the Indonesian situation in parliament next Thursday.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Dutch Governor-General van Mook and Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens met with US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett for 75 minutes today. The two said they only discussed the facts of the Indonesian situation.

### US Government to Convene Special Session of Congress to Discuss Interim Aid to Europe; Time to Be in October or November

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall said today that some European countries need US aid this year to cope with the urgent threat of hunger and cold. Such aid cannot be issued without convening a special session of the US Congress. This meeting may be convened in October or November.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today that he can prepare to submit a report of facts and figures on interim aid to Europe to the congressional subcommittee by the end of October.

As for the question of how to obtain the consent of Congress, it will have to wait for the developments in the next few weeks to decide.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Marshall and other senior officials did not deny that Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton had urgently telegraphed Washington from Europe last week, requesting that a special session of Congress be convened to vote on a 2.5 billion dollar relief plan.

### Bevin Suddenly Suggests US Restore Lend-Lease

British Political Circles Believe Bevin Misspeoke

[United Press, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech to the American Legion today, explaining for the first time his recent suggestion that the United States redistribute the gold stored in Fort Knox, advocating that if the United States does not approve of the redistribution of gold, it should restore the wartime Lend-Lease Act to save the economic crisis in European countries. It is said that I don't care whether to use Lend-Lease or other methods. Even if Britain lacks US dollars, it will never lack determination.

[United Press, London, 11th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's suggestion that the United States should re-adopt the Lend-Lease Act to save Britain's economic collapse has made British political figures quite bewildered. According to well-informed sources in the British Foreign Office, this is another slip of the tongue by Bevin, just like the speech he gave in South Port last week, saying that the gold stored by the United States in Fort Knox should be drastically distributed.

### Italian Political Situation Is Unstable: US State Department Is Paying Close Attention; Left-Wing Members of the Italian Socialist Party Ask the President to Resign

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] US officials told reporters today that the Italian situation is Secretary of State Marshall's top priority. It is said that US Ambassador to Italy Dunn warned the government that the Italian situation is no longer a matter to be considered in months but a pressing matter to be decided in weeks. The Italian issue has now gone beyond the scope of political and economic discussion and has been presented to senior officials of the State Department for decision-making.

It is said that the government firmly believes in the following points: (1) The strike of farmers in Italy is manipulated by the Communist Party behind the scenes in an attempt to deepen the crisis; (2) If the United States deems it beneficial, it will not hesitate to use force; (3) Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Togliatti assured Nenni that the winner in Italy will be Moscow, not Washington; (4) Another leader of the Socialist Party, Lombardo, who was originally considered a moderating force in Nenni's party, will split with Nenni and lead the socialist party members who do not approve of communism himself.

[Also] Left-wing Socialist Party leader Nenni today urged Italian Prime Minister Gasperi to either let his non-left-wing government step down or be overthrown by an irresistible force of opposition.

### Stalled Progress in Convening Peace Conference Causes Deep Anxiety in Japanese Government and Public;  Mizukubo Writes to Bevin Urging Assistance

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Katayama Cabinet takes great pride in being a "peace-making cabinet," meaning it can be responsible for concluding a peace treaty with Japan that is favorable to Japan. From the beginning of its formation, the Katayama Cabinet intended to cater to the wishes of the United States, hoping that the United States would make proposals favoring Japan in the peace conference. However, after the United States proposed convening a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty, the Soviet Union took the lead in suggesting discussions, and the opinions of the Commonwealth of Nations Canberra Conference were not entirely consistent with those of the United States. The Chinese government and people have paid close attention to the issue of the peace treaty with Japan and have broken away from their usual practices, not fully accepting the suggestions of the United States. The Japanese government and the public are quite anxious about such delicate international relations. Some national entities and private individuals are currently studying the question of "how to break open this deadlock in relations with Japan," intending to engage in behind-the-scenes activities through informal diplomacy. Mizukubo Ryokichi, the first Minister of Labor in the Katayama Cabinet, yesterday wrote to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, appealing for friendship and assistance in Japan's peaceful reconstruction, based on his personal relationship with Bevin, whom he had met once at the International Labor Association in Geneva in 1931. Mizukubo's action is the first instance of Japan exceeding the United Nations control over Japan's diplomatic activities since its defeat in the war. Its repercussions and developments are worthy of attention from the international community.

### Representatives from Eight Bureaus and One Office Bravely Venture into the Countryside Under Rain to Survey the Boundary Lines of Qibao and Dachang; Subsidy Amount After Demarcation Still Awaits Central Government Instructions; Villagers from Xinzhuang and Zhudi Petition to be Under Municipal Jurisdiction

[Report from this newspaper] The issue of boundary demarcation between this city and Jiangsu Province has been unresolved for nearly twenty years. Disputes have arisen repeatedly. In November of last year, the Ministry of Interior specially dispatched Inspector Cheng Jing to Shanghai to jointly survey the area with representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Municipal Government. In March of this year, the Ministry of Interior convened representatives from all parties concerned in Beijing to discuss the matter. It was not until recently that the Municipal Government received the Executive Yuan's approval of various regulations regarding the division of jurisdiction between this city and Jiangsu Province (see this newspaper on the 6th for details).

After receiving the order, the Municipal Government, in addition to notifying the relevant county governments in Jiangsu Province to schedule handovers and dispatch personnel to negotiate handover procedures, yesterday also sent representatives from the eight bureaus of land administration, police, education, social affairs, health, finance, public works, and public utilities, as well as representatives from the civil affairs office, braving the rain to Qibao and Dachang districts to survey the boundary lines and investigate the distribution of agencies, schools, and organizations. This reporter accompanied them, departing at 10:00 AM and returning at 6:30 PM. Representatives from various bureaus are sorting out the information gathered to serve as a reference for improving governance and construction after the official takeover.

### The Entire Picture of Qibao Town

Qibao is located between Songjiang, Qingpu, and Shanghai, covering three li east to west and ten li north to south, with a total of 4,188 households and 17,646 residents. The streets are narrow, less than a zhang wide. There are two municipal primary schools, Qishi and Mingqiang, and a private Zhaojian Primary School run by the Catholic Church. Recently, the Municipal Education Bureau established a municipal agricultural vocational school in the area, and school buildings are under construction. The prestigious private Nanyang Model Middle School has also acquired a site in Qibao and will move there once the school buildings are completed. The entire area severely lacks sanitation and medical facilities, and flies swarm. There are very few community organizations, with only one charity organization called the San Shan Tang. The hall owns more than 260 mu of land and recently donated 100 mu for the establishment of a municipal agricultural vocational school. Local residents are responsible for guarding, with more than 120 members of the militia and volunteer patrols. They also maintain contact with the 152nd Brigade stationed nearby.

Xinzhuang Residents Petition

When the survey team arrived in the autumn rain and mud, the streets were covered with red-bordered slogans from the people of Xinzhuang, opposing the inclusion of Xinzhuang into Shanghai County. After a trip to the South Temple for rest, more than 200 villagers from Xinzhuang, holding paper flags and shouting slogans, demanded respect for public opinion and the inclusion of Xinzhuang into Shanghai City. Li Yusheng, the district head of Longhua, introduced five representatives from Xinzhuang to Wu Zunyi, a specialist from the Land Administration Bureau, presenting a petition stating that Xinzhuang has a total of 6,861 residents, and its military service, education, baojia, and tax matters are currently managed by the Municipal Government. There are six primary schools, Zhangyi, Xinzhuang, Chunshen, Xinnongcun, Banqiao, and Central School, with a total of more than 1,800 students, and their educational expenses have long been allocated by the Municipal Government. The petition concluded by stating the disadvantages of including Xinzhuang into Shanghai County. Specialist Wu addressed all the petitioning villagers, expressing great sympathy for their cause and promising to convey their requests to the government for consideration and decision by the central government. The district representatives then raised several questions regarding the boundary demarcation regulations approved by the Executive Yuan, and Specialist Wu also promised to forward them to the central government for clarification.

Subsidy Issues

In the afternoon, the team continued to Dachang, which is sixteen li north to south and twelve li east to west, with a population of about 40,000. There is an airfield and barracks in the district, making it a military zone. There are five private primary schools, sixteen municipal primary schools, one Xingci Middle School, and a Dachang branch of the People's Education Hall. Currently, in addition to land registration, finance and education are under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. A health office has not yet been established, and medical facilities are lacking. Last year, the Baoshan County Government attempted to collect land taxes from the residents of the Dachang district, but the residents refused. Currently, the northern part of Dachang is bounded by the Yunzao Creek with Baoshan County. The Executive Yuan's regulations restore the pre-war boundary, extending the boundary line to Huangnitang, several li north of the Yunzao Creek. Therefore, the Dachang district needs to prepare to receive this land several li beyond the Yunzao Creek. According to the Executive Yuan's regulations, a small piece of land in the northwest corner of Dachang needs to be incorporated into Jiading County. Comparatively, the land being incorporated is larger than the land being ceded. The problem lies in how to subsidize the Baoshan County Government after the boundary demarcation, which may cause disputes in the future. The subsidy amount determined before the war was said to be around 16,000 yuan. What multiple of this amount should be used to calculate the subsidy still needs to be requested from the central government for negotiation and decision.

### Worlds Apart

Yesterday, this reporter accompanied the Municipal Government survey team between Qibao and Dachang, which are far apart north to south, passing through the bustling Nanjing Road with its tall buildings. Compared to Qishi, whose streets are less than a zhang wide and difficult to navigate due to mud, although both are districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City, the lifestyles and enjoyment of their residents are worlds apart. This reporter once asked the residents of Xinzhuang why they were so determined to oppose being incorporated into Shanghai County. The answer was: "For no other reason than it's easier to develop after being incorporated into Shanghai City!"

### Request from Zhudi and Jianxie Representatives: Please Send Internal Personnel for Re-Survey

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Zhudi Town Local Improvement Association yesterday sent representatives Huang Buyi, a special commissioner from the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan's Directorate General of Supplies and Transportation, and Zhang Zhiqi, the principal of the Zhudi National School in the 25th District of Shanghai, to petition the Municipal Council, stating that the boundary line in the western part of Shanghai should not be based on the Hulong River but should be based on the natural boundary line of the Suzhou River and Gaosongtang River, so that the four northern areas of Zhudi Town could still be incorporated into the Shanghai municipal area for completeness. At the same time, they requested that the Ministry of Interior send personnel to conduct a survey to determine the boundary.

### Bogus Yarn Company; A Case of Obtaining Goods with Empty Promises and Fleeing Without a Trace; One Case Under Investigation, One Case Prosecuted

[Report from this newspaper] Li Houmao, Yang Bingfa, Gao Mingdao and others falsely established the Dahua Chang Yarn Company on the second floor of the Central Apartments in Jiu'anfang, Jinling Middle Road, and used Yang Chengshun (Yang Bingfa's father) as the accountant, and Kong Zhiqin, Li Xinpu, Ma Songhua, Jiang Weihua, Ji Chenshi and others as brokers. They successively obtained more than 300 million yuan in legal tender from 14 companies, including Xinchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, by issuing bogus cotton yarn warehouse receipts. After obtaining the money, Li Houmao, Yang Bingfa, Gao Mingdao and others fled without a trace. The victims reported the incident to the Taishan District Police Station, which sent personnel to investigate and found the facts to be true, and sealed up the company's account books, seals, and bills of lading. After two weeks without results, the responsible persons of the 14 victim companies, including Xinchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing Li Houmao and other nine people of jointly defrauding them. Yesterday, the prosecutor summoned both parties to the court for questioning. All 14 plaintiffs arrived, but only Kong Zhiqin and Li Xinpu arrived from the defendants. After the investigation, the court hearing was adjourned for further questioning, and Kong and Li were released on bail pending trial.

Also, the Taichang Yarn Company at No. 38, Lane 285, East Zhongzheng Road, engaged in illegal transactions without registration. Ma Zhongyi, the manager of the company, Wang Genyan, the deputy manager, colluded with the accountant Jiang Guansun. In late last month, they successively collected 85.65 million yuan from Xiecheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory and other places for the purchase of cotton yarn. Ma and others were supposed to deliver the goods the day after payment, but they avoided meeting. At the same time, Chen Ruiliang deposited one piece of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn worth 19 million yuan, and one piece of 32-count Harvest yarn worth 16 million yuan, in the Taichang Yarn Company on the 23rd and 25th of last month, respectively, all of which were embezzled by Ma and others. After the victims filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing Ma and others of fraud and embezzlement, the prosecutor investigated and found the facts to be true and has already filed a public prosecution. Jiang Guansun is in custody, and Ma and Wang are still at large.

### "Renting" a Wife and Regretting the Agreement; Lawsuit Filed to Enforce

[Report from this newspaper] Mao Yupin and a young woman named Ding Xiuling entered into a "rental" agreement in 1944. The content was quite peculiar, roughly stating that the man had a wife and the woman had a husband, but from the date of the agreement, both parties voluntarily cohabited. The man would provide the woman with 10 jin of grain for pocket money and 75 jin of grain for living expenses per month, both calculated and paid in cash at the market price. The woman was allowed to live in her original place, and the man was free to come and go, and no one was allowed to interfere. If the woman gave birth to children, they would be raised by the man. It was stated that the term was ten years, and this was written as proof. However, after the two cohabited for six months, the man stopped going and stopped paying the price of 85 jin of grain. Ms. Ding then filed a complaint with the Civil Division of the District Court, requesting that the defendant Mao Yupin be ordered to perform the contract. The case was heard yesterday in the Civil Division Seven by Judge Lu Pinru, and both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. Mao initially denied the agreement, but after being shown the contract in court, he lowered his head and admitted it, stating that he felt very uncomfortable every time he saw her husband, so he stopped going after six months. Ding Xiuling gave birth to a daughter in September 1944 and received a letter from Ding asking him to settle the procedures, but he did not reply because it was not his responsibility. Ding Xiuling stated that the defendant broke the contract and that the girl was indeed born as a result of the relationship with the defendant, and the defendant should be held responsible. The court ordered the two parties to go outside and reconcile, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Laid-Off Workers from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Invite the Press and Call for Action

[Report from this newspaper] Due to austerity measures, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to lay off more than 400 of the 600 workers in its first, second, and third repair shops, retaining only one-third. The workers once petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, which decided that a nine-person team, composed of representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the laid-off workers, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the Shipowners Association, would be formed to handle the matter. The team went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for on-site investigation the day before yesterday. According to Shen Yixin, the director of the company's business department, the past monthly expenses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including labor costs, required 2 billion yuan, but the income in August this year was only 800 million yuan, which could not be sustained. Therefore, it was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to economize and retrench. Currently, about 400 of the 600 workers are machine workers, and even if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company builds ships, it does not need so many machine workers proportionally. Yesterday, the repair workers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company posted slogans on streetcars to arouse the attention of the public. At 2:00 PM, they also invited the press to report the process and asked for justice and to appeal on their behalf.

### Higher Court Retrial Pronounces Judgment: Pan Da Not to Die, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Report from this newspaper] Pan Da, who was accused of serving as the director of the Fourth Division of the Puppet 76th Special Agent Headquarters and the head of the Puppet Shanghai West Special District Police Department, was previously sentenced to death by the Higher Court for treason.

### Theater Industry Laments Hardship, Requests Extension of Business Hours

[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Jianxing, the chairman of the Shanghai Theater Industry Association, requested the Municipal Council to forward a letter to the central government requesting an extension of business hours, as the government is implementing austerity measures and plans to shorten business hours. He listed several reasons, roughly stating: (1) After shortening business hours, a large number of actors and staff will inevitably be laid off, which will cause unemployment problems. (2) The theater industry has always made great efforts for the public good of the country and society, whether it is for comfort or fundraising, and it bears a large amount of taxes and levies. Therefore, it is hoped that it will not be included in the general entertainment venues in the austerity program. (3) The focus of the current austerity is on the economy, and foreign exchange is extremely important. The theater is operated by Chinese people, performed by Chinese people, and watched by Chinese people. What is gained from Chinese people is still used by Chinese people, and the rights and interests are not leaked out. (4) Business has been sluggish for many years, and the off-season months are even more depressed. In normal business, there are often incidents involving soldiers and police, resulting in unbearable losses. The only hope is in the autumn season, but once the time is shortened, audiences will arrive at the venue after dinner, and the play will be over, and it will be difficult to arrange famous actors and famous plays.

### Huang Bohui's Sniping Case: Public Trial Held for the First Time Yesterday; Huang Said That Zheng Desheng Was Originally a Close Friend; Hatred Arose Because of the Recovery of the Landlord Rights

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Desheng, who is suspected of instigating the shooting of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao, in February of this year, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for attempted murder. The first trial was held in the District Court yesterday. The victim Huang Bohui personally went to court to describe the experience of being injured, saying that he and Zheng were originally friends. He had entrusted Zheng to rent out all the properties of the Shibao Building in the past and collect the rent on his behalf. Later, Zheng used the rent for his own purposes, so he notified the tenants to pay the rent directly to him, and thus formed a hatred with Zheng. Zheng has two American friends, one named Ghas Welltop and the other named Mark Xiu, who are the first and second officers on the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Wanshin ship. When he returned home at around 10:00 PM on February 18th, he was suddenly rushed out by two Americans between the third and fourth floors of the Shibao Building. One held his left arm, and the other stared at him and said, "This is the person we need." The other American heard this and shot at him. He lowered his body, feeling something pass over his head. Fearing that he would shoot again, he said in English, "I am a friend of President Roosevelt." The two Americans then left him. He has no grudges with foreigners, and this act was obviously instigated by Zheng." Then, the witness Wu Kechang, a worker at the Shibao Building, gave testimony: "When I went home on the night of February 18th, just as I was about to enter the door, I saw two foreigners coming out, and at the same time, I saw Zheng Desheng's daughter standing next to the escalator, seemingly seeing them off." The court then questioned the defendant Zheng Desheng, who flatly denied the conspiracy to assassinate. Because further investigation is needed, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Four Supervisory Committee Members Thoroughly Investigate Foreign Exchange; Collect Abundant Data; Scheduled to Stay in Shanghai for Another Week

[Report from this newspaper] The four supervisory committee members, Gu Fengxiang, He Wenhan, Du Guangxun, and Wang Guanwu, have been working intensively in recent days since being ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the case of Yangzi, Fuzhong Company, and other companies using special relationships to import a large number of luxury goods, as well as the use of foreign exchange by state-owned banks. They are currently reviewing the foreign exchange accounts of state-owned banks. It is learned that the scope of the investigation has been expanded beyond what was originally planned, and preparations are being made to conduct investigations from the side. The materials obtained in the past week are very rich. The Central Auditing Office has also sent two members to assist in solving various technical difficulties such as reviewing accounts.

### Economy Helps Education, Kindness Extends Years; Nianci Jun Benefits the Poor; Donates 5 Million from Birthday Celebration

Yesterday we received a letter from our reader "Nianci Jun" and a donation of 5 million yuan. In his letter, he said:

"The 7th of this month was my 50th birthday. I received congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, including 15 million yuan in cash. I have decided to divide the money into three shares and donate it to Shanghai charitable organizations to help suffering compatriots, to benefit all my relatives and friends. Among them, 5 million yuan will be donated to the Anti-Tuberculosis Association and 5 million yuan will be donated to the flood victims in Guangdong and Guangxi. Another 5 million yuan will be donated to your newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" to help poor students. I was unable to attend school as a child and deeply feel the lack of knowledge, which I regret. Although the amount is small and does not solve the problem, it is also intended to be a humble offering."

The letter from "Nianci Jun" reveals sincere enthusiasm in every line. He was unable to attend school as a child and currently feels the pain of lacking knowledge. He does not want to see countless poor students suffer the misfortune of not being able to attend school again. Congratulating a birthday is "icing on the cake," while helping education is "sending charcoal in the snow." Now Nianci Jun combines the two into one, which can be said to be rare and beautiful.

Since the special fundraising began, "Nianci Jun" has broken all previous records in individual donations. We hope that people in society will follow suit, so as to achieve the perfect state of "economy helping education."

"Nianci Jun" does not want to reveal his real name and refuses our planned praise for him, and repeatedly instructed that photos not be published. "Nianci" is his alias, because he is purely filial to his mother, and uses it to commemorate his late mother.

Yesterday, Yong'an Advertising Company raised nearly 4 million yuan in donations for us. We would like to express our gratitude to the gentlemen of the company for their enthusiasm in helping education. (Donation report published in the Social Service column)

### Provisional Dredging Bureau Dismisses Two People After Petition Fails

[Our Dispatch] Shanghai Dredging Bureau temporary workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, demanding improved treatment. More than 300 petitioning workers stayed overnight in the Social Affairs Bureau as they couldn't return to Wusong, Pudong, and other places that evening. Yesterday morning, they sent six representatives to the Dredging Bureau to appeal. The responsible person of the bureau told them that it needed to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and then decided. After the six representatives returned to the Social Affairs Bureau without results, more than 300 workers gathered in the Social Affairs Bureau square and refused to disperse. The Social Affairs Bureau considered the Dredging Bureau a state-run institution and found it inconvenient to handle the dispute. However, because the workers gathered and refused to leave, disrupting order, they telegraphed the Songshan Police Sub-bureau. Around 4:00 PM, a red emergency vehicle arrived from the police station. At the same time, Fan Zhenbang, chief of the Mediation Section of the Labor Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech to the workers, telling them that the Social Affairs Bureau could not mediate this case and that the workers should apply to the Dredging Bureau through reasonable and legal procedures. By 5:30 PM, the workers finally accepted the advice and dispersed.

In the 27th year [1938], Wu transferred to Chongqing, and in February of the 28th year [1939], he was ordered to return to Shanghai to engage in military and party affairs work.

### Misappropriation of Troop慰勞 Donations: Chairman of Yangjing District People's Assembly Suspected

Cheng Jiaju, a resident of Yangjing District, yesterday filed a petition with the Municipal Council alleging that Zhang Ruoxu, chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly, was suspected of illegally misappropriating "ten thousand yuan of troop慰勞 donations" and requested a thorough investigation. The original petition stated: "Yangjing District was allocated 400 million yuan for troop慰勞 donations, and the people enthusiastically donated. I learned from a conversation with the staff of the No. 8 Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bank that the amount paid by each 保 to the special account for troop慰勞 in Yangjing (32058) has exceeded 100 million yuan, but for some reason, Yangjing District has not transferred it to the General Assembly. According to Director Li, on September 6th, Zhang Ruoxu, chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly, came to the bank to negotiate the use of 50 million yuan from the troop慰勞 donations because Yuchangtai South Goods Store, which he operated, needed to pay the sixth installment of the household sugar payment, and his funds were not circulating smoothly. The bank could not refuse because his check procedures were complete, so it cashed 50 million yuan."

### Recommendations to Rescue the Industrial Crisis: Central Government Responds with Four Points

Regarding the Municipal Council's proposal to the central government to rescue the industrial crisis, after the Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Four Joint Offices Import Temporary Management Committee for review, four measures have now been decided and replied to the Municipal Government yesterday as follows:

(1) Regarding the need to continue and strictly supervise the management of large production loans, according to the response from the Four Joint Offices and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, although commercial credit loans are currently being controlled, assistance is still being provided to daily necessities and production enterprises, and a roving inspection team is organized to specifically audit and eliminate malpractices. (2) Regarding the relaxation of foreign exchange amounts and allocation methods for imported raw materials, and that emphasis should be placed on national industrial sectors and direct production agencies, according to the response from the Import Management Committee, the quota for rubber was originally set at US$1.1 million for the first quarter and increased by US$900,000 in the second quarter, totaling US$2 million. The feeling that it is still insufficient is indeed a fact, and attention will be paid to it at that time. Regarding the direct allocation of industrial raw materials to production agencies, such as the direct allocation of cotton to various yarn factories, it has already been handled. The direct allocation of raw rubber to various production agencies is still pending due to the inability to adjust the machinery and equipment directly. Regarding the original proposal to prioritize the allocation to national industries and direct production, it has been found that imported raw materials are allocated to various importers based on the quota approved by the government, whether they are distributors or manufacturers, and are limited to merchants who have previously imported the goods before or after the war and have actual contact with foreign countries. If it is allocated to manufacturers who have not previously imported, it does not comply with government regulations. (3) Regarding assisting and handling the procurement, unified planning, and unified allocation of production raw materials, according to the response from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, matters such as the procurement and distribution of industrial and mining raw materials in various places should be handled by the respective industries in consultation with the Ministry's industrial and commercial guidance offices in various places. (4) Regarding restricting the periodic increase of taxes to support the development of industry, according to the response from the Ministry of Finance, the current taxes, except for the export tax, which has been abolished, the import tax still uses the tariff rates of the Import Tariff Regulations of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], and is levied on foreign goods. The income and profit taxes are levied on the income and profits of foreign businesses, and there is no provision for periodic increases.

### Shanghai Domestically Produced Bicycle Manufacturers Go to Beijing to Petition, Expressing Satisfaction: Government Guarantees No Import of Japanese Goods

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 11th] Representatives from Shanghai domestically produced bicycle factories, led by Xia Zhichao, a group of seven people, after arriving in Beijing on the 9th, went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant agencies to petition, explaining that the bicycle manufacturing industry in Shanghai alone has reached 300 companies, directly and indirectly supporting more than 100,000 people, producing more than 200,000 bicycles annually, coupled with products from various places, fully meeting the needs of the country, and that there is no need to import Japanese goods of the same level. Now, reading the implementation outline proposed by the Committee for Directing Trade with Japan, it is surprising that transportation equipment is included in the imported goods. At the same time, 2,000 bicycles obtained from the Sino-Trust Bureau's barter trade have also appeared on the market, and they sincerely hope that the government will reconsider this matter and that the Sino-Trust Bureau can actively strive not to import Japanese bicycles again. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that there are no regulations allowing the import of bicycles in the implementation outline, and guaranteed that this will not happen in the future, and that the military vehicles imported by the Sino-Trust Bureau will not appear on the market and compete for profits with the people, and that there will be no more imports in the future. The Executive Yuan expressed its attention to the matter and guaranteed that it would never allow Japanese bicycles to enter the country, hoping that they would produce with peace of mind. The representatives were very satisfied with the successful results.

[Our Dispatch from Hong Kong, 8th] Deposed Vietnamese King Bao Dai has been living in Hong Kong as a recluse for more than a year.

His spokesman, Liu Dezong, has recently been sending news to reporters frequently, and the news about Bao Dai's return to Vietnam is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. Bao Dai telegraphed representatives of various Vietnamese parties on the 4th of this month, inviting them to Hong Kong to discuss national affairs together, and it was scheduled to be held on the 9th. Although Bao Dai has come to this scenic Hong Kong, he has not been able to forget his homeland.

Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Election: Calm as a Well

After the news of our government's regular general election was announced, Chinese and English newspapers in Hong Kong have repeatedly criticized it, especially expressing aversion to the point that our overseas Chinese maintain "dual nationality." A Hong Kong government spokesman also said that our overseas Chinese holding elections in Hong Kong violates international law, but if China and the UK establish a special agreement in advance, such elections can proceed. It was also said that if elections are held by proxy without the need for public election gatherings in Hong Kong, it is not illegal. A spokesman for the External Affairs Office of the Two Guangxi Special Envoy in Hong Kong declined to comment on this issue, but admitted that he had made representations to the British side. Therefore, until now, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese have remained as calm as a well regarding the general election campaign.

A film company specially sent a photographer to put this uncommon procession of workers on the screen, but the employers are not as "comfortable" as the workers. They had agreed to increase wages from 20% to 45% a few days ago, but the workers still insisted on the demand of 100%. People from all walks of life hope that both labor and management will continue to make concessions and resolve the serious atmosphere as soon as possible.

[Our Dispatch from Kunming, 11th] The railway tracks of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Bisezhai to Hekou were severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and due to years of disrepair, the road surface was also heavily damaged. After the victory, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the formation of a rapid repair team to actively repair the railway to enable the full line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to be opened.

The starting point of the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway is Kunming, passing through Dingliang, Xingyi, and Hechi, and connecting with the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, directly to the border of Guizhou. However, because the instruments used by the survey team are too old, it is feared that it will be difficult to complete the work within the predetermined three-month period.

### Changzhou Water Monster Scare: A Night of Fright, A Case of Unnecessary Worry

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 10th] For the past few days in Changzhou, along the riverbanks where boat dwellers and water residents live, shadowy figures have been seen, arousing suspicion of ghosts and "water monsters" or fears of "flower-snatching gangs." Rumors spread wildly, causing widespread panic. Several frights occurred each night, stirring up a great commotion throughout the city. Upon closer investigation, most of these incidents were based on imagined appearances and baseless fears, often stemming from sheer nervousness and unnecessary worry. However, there may also be malicious individuals deliberately creating confusion to disrupt public order, which should not be overlooked. In the water monster case, several individuals were apprehended in our county, but after interrogation, it was found that they were all victims of misunderstanding and undeserved beatings, turning the situation into a laughingstock. For instance, Chen Chunfa, a farmer from Beitang Township, recently hired a small boat on the 7th to come to Changzhou to purchase timber from the Yuansheng Lumber Company outside the East Gate, intending to take it back to repair his dilapidated house. The boat was anchored by the East Gate archway that night. In the quiet moonlight, he was fishing for amusement on the dock beside the boat. At the same time, a fishing boat on the opposite bank was obscured in the dim light, its shadowy movements leading people to suspect the presence of a water monster. Someone shouted loudly about the monster, and dozens of boat dwellers and nearby residents along the river, hearing the cry, armed themselves with bamboo poles, short sticks, and kitchen knives, surrounding the dock. They seized Chen Chunfa and beat him, causing injuries all over his body. The Self-Defense Force arrived to maintain order and took Chen Chunfa to be questioned. He explained the situation, and it became clear that it was a misunderstanding, leading to a disorderly dispersal. Similar incidents have occurred in Benniu and Lucheng.

### Mayor Wu Receives Reporters, Announces Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices; Commander Xuan Orders Strict Prohibition of Rice Smuggling Exports

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice price in the city has recently risen sharply, and Mayor Wu is very anxious about this and is looking for ways to suppress and stabilize it. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, he received reporters in the City Government conference room to report on the reasons for the rising rice prices and to announce the city government's new measures to suppress and stabilize rice prices, as follows:

(1) Unblocking Sources: Rice-producing areas have been affected by the war, leading to a decrease in sources. It is also reported that rice-producing areas in southern Anhui and other places have regulations prohibiting the export of rice. Mayor Wu contacted Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan by telephone yesterday afternoon. Premier Zhang stated that in addition to ordering various places to lift the bans, the Executive Yuan is actively handling measures to unblock the sources of rice in Shanghai.

(2) Strict Prohibition of Smuggling: The rise in rice prices is closely related to smuggling. According to reports obtained by the City Government, large-scale smuggling has been discovered in rice-producing areas such as Wuhu. The targets of smuggling are Japan and the bandit areas. The Ministry of Food has now ordered that rice produced in Wuhu can only be transported to Shanghai.

(3) Increase Allotment: Starting this month, it has been decided to increase the allocation of rice by 70,000 dan, specifically for workers and the poor. The original monthly rice allocation in the city was 180,000 dan, which has now been increased to 250,000 dan, which is believed to be sufficient for distribution. The City Government has reached an agreement with the Central Trust Bureau, and additional allocation can be made internally.

Mayor Wu stated: In two weeks, the new grain will be on the market, and the rice problem will tend to improve.

Another report: Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, in response to the fluctuating rice prices in the city in recent days and reports of unscrupulous elements smuggling rice for export, which is illegal, issued an order on the 11th prohibiting the export of food and confiscating all shipments without proof of documents from the competent authority. This order has been instructed to the Maritime Inspection Brigade for strict implementation.

### Investigation of Rice Market

Another report: The police局 received an order from Mayor Wu yesterday to investigate the rice markets in the north and south of the city to determine whether there were any illegal activities to raise rice prices. The results are as follows:

Regarding the Pu Rice Market: (1) Due to rumors that rice from Hunan was being blocked and that transportation in northern Anhui was obstructed, sources suddenly became scarce, and prices in various producing areas were reported to be rising. Meanwhile, retail sales in the city were active, and purchases were not weak, so rice prices generally tended to be high.

(2) The city's old rice supply is gradually shrinking, while demand has not decreased, and people are expecting higher prices.

(3) During the inspection of entry permits, it was discovered that Chen Shiqin of Chen Hengtai Rice Store No. 5 in Caohejing Town used the temporary entry permit of Yuxingsheng Rice Shop No. 2 on Nanchang Road to enter the market, and Zhong Chunyang, an employee of Tongfengyi Rice Shop on Malong Road, entered the market without a permit. After presenting their ID cards and obtaining certification from the Nanshi Rice Industry Market, they were not taken to the局.

(4) The Nanshi Rice Market issues unlimited temporary entry permits to member stores, and the validity period is one month. To prevent illegal elements or non-industry people from taking the opportunity to sneak in and raise prices, the person in charge of the market should be instructed to regulate the number of temporary entry permits and shorten the validity period to one day.

Regarding the North Rice Market, police局 personnel arrived at the site at 11:25 AM, but the market had already closed. (The business hours there are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM). According to Xu Songren, the director of the market, the reason for the rising rice prices is the high prices in the producing areas and the fact that it is the lean season. The severity of the situation will be difficult to eliminate in the short term.

The police局, acting on Mayor Wu's order, has sent personnel to strictly investigate the smuggling of rice for export.

### Unified Purchase of National Cotton Temporarily Difficult to Achieve; Strict Implementation of Cloth Management; Free Sale of Private Yarn Mills to Be Abolished

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the "Implementation Plan for Coordinating Yarn and Cloth Supply and Demand for the Development of the Textile Industry," which was previously discussed by the Textile Adjustment Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review, the National Economic Commission believes that the plan would not allow the government to effectively control materials and insisted on modifying it to uniformly purchase and sell cotton and cloth. The Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Yunwu, was appointed to preside over the formation of another review subcommittee. The subcommittee held a meeting in Beijing on the 9th. President Zhang of the National Bank, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Economics Minister Chen Qitian, Agriculture Minister Zuo Shunsheng, and members of the National Economic Commission, among others, attended. The six regional cotton spinning guilds sent Tang Xinghai, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Wu Weijing to automatically provide opinions. The subcommittee also summoned Gao Bingtai, director of the Textile Adjustment Committee's Business Office, and Liu Wenteng, chief engineer of the Textile Construction Company, to attend and provide information. It is learned that the subcommittee, after two days of review meetings on the 9th and 10th, believes that the unified purchase of cotton should take into account the opinions of all parties, because for the unified purchase of national cotton: (1) The cotton purchase funds, calculated at 6 million dan, would require 12 trillion yuan, and the revolving funds would require at least 6 trillion yuan. If the government issued such a large amount of funds, it would likely cause further inflation. (2) Private yarn mills would have no cotton to purchase, and their funds would inevitably cause trouble in the market, easily affecting sharp price increases. (3) The government lacks a large number of technical personnel for the unified purchase of national cotton. (4) The required cotton quality varies from factory to factory, and the number of spindles also varies. Given the current difficult transportation situation, distribution problems would be difficult to solve easily. (5) The yarn counts and quality of spindles vary from factory to factory, and the amount of national cotton required for manufacturing also varies. If the government does not have a large number of specialized personnel to manage it, it will reduce quality, sharply reduce production efficiency, and easily waste raw materials. (6) Unified purchase and sale requires a large number of specialized personnel. During the War of Resistance, there were only 168,000 spindles in the rear, and even then, more than 2,000 management personnel were needed, but even then, the ideal could not be achieved. Now, there are more than 4 million spindles nationwide, and more management personnel would be needed. Looking around the country, it is impossible to recruit them. The National Economic Commission believes that the above problems are difficult to solve at present. Therefore, it was decided to shelve the unified purchase of national cotton. However, in order to effectively control cloth, facilitate the supply and demand of training agents, and thereby stabilize market prices, it was decided to completely and thoroughly conduct joint distribution of finished yarn and cloth from national and private yarn mills. The free sale of parts of private yarn mills in the past will be cancelled. It is reported that the plan will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for review and approval, and then it will be announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee and implemented.

### Rice Reaches New High Prices

Yesterday, a total of more than 5,800 shih of grain arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market trend was influenced by rising prices in the interior, slow transportation from Anhui Province, slow arrivals from the Yangtze River, and high prices. Shops and merchants had no goods, just as the autumn harvest was not yet connected. Indica rice rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and early thin rice continued to increase by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, reaching new highs again. Xian rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan, and white round new rice increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. New rice from Wuxi, Kunshan, and West Road has appeared on the market.

The number of flour allocations has increased, and Lilo foreign flour has decreased by 20,000 yuan. The market is not moving. Factory flour and miscellaneous brand flour are 12,000 yuan per four small bags, and the situation has softened. Unified flour is flat, and bran is rising sharply, increasing by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan alone.

The oil market has mixed fluctuations. The consumption of raw oil is still sluggish, and the market is flat. Sesame oil has little change, and clear oil has rarely changed. Vegetable oil has very slight fluctuations, and soybean oil is exceptionally popular, continuing to rise sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

### Transshipment of Grains, Rice, and Wheat from Provinces and Cities along the Yangtze River Must Be Approved by the Ministry of Food

Jianghai Customs posted Proclamation No. 154 yesterday, stating briefly: The General Inspector of Customs has received a telegram from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance stating that the Ministry of Food stipulates that if grains, rice, and wheat from provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are transported out of the mouth of the Yangtze River and transferred to other coastal provinces for sale, they must be approved by the Ministry of Food. The export of flour should be handled in accordance with the flour quota transfer method. Furthermore, grain merchants transporting grain from the coastal provinces outside the mouth of the Yangtze River must first apply to the Ministry of Food for approval. In addition to the Ministry of Food replying for notification and telexing the customs (or tax authorities) of the place of origin and Jianghai Customs for verification and release, the customs (or tax authorities) of each place of origin shall, based on the Ministry of Food's telegram and the Ministry's approval held by the grain merchant, approve the declaration and shipment. Jianghai Customs is responsible for instructing the Wusongkou checkpoint to conduct inspections. Those who have not been approved by the Ministry of Food will be treated as smuggling. The order has been issued for compliance, and commercial grain transported through Wusongkou will be strictly inspected to prevent smuggling.

### Many "Spot" Shares Sold Off in Panic; All Chinese Stocks Experience Broad Declines

Yesterday, Chinese stocks faced the "roll-over" (期掉) day, and there was no stimulating factor. Holders of "spot" shares, particularly those in "Yong Sha" (永紗) that were due for immediate delivery, engaged in frantic selling. This made the effect of the rise of 500 yuan in the US dollar market price very short-lived. After the initial surge, prices steadily declined. The shares listed on the American and Asian Exchange suffered even greater losses. Even small stocks like "Xin Guang" (新光) and "Jing Fu" (景福) appeared bleak. The trading day closed with these shares hitting new lows.

At the start of the morning, "Yong Sha" shares for immediate delivery opened low, at 230 yuan, causing all cotton yarn stocks to show weakness. "Yong Sha" for forward delivery fell to a low of 240 yuan. When the US dollar market price surged to a high of 500 yuan, market sentiment briefly improved. "Yong Sha" for immediate delivery rose to 242 yuan and for forward delivery to 248 yuan. However, when the prices rose, some investors sold off their holdings, causing the price of "Yong Sha" for immediate delivery to fall back to 239 yuan. In the off-exchange (場外) market, interest rates (息價) opened at 1.65% and 2.1%, with some opening at 1.8% and 2.25%. The situation shifted uncertain. In any case, yarn prices declined by a small amount of 200,000. Unable to hold. Near noon, prices fell to lows of 232 yuan and 238 yuan before closing at 233 yuan and 238 yuan. After the close, quoted prices stabilized slightly, and in the afternoon, off-exchange quoted prices rose to 239 yuan.

Ultimately, compared to the previous close, "Yong Sha," "Xin He," (信和) and "Qin Xing" (勤興) stocks for immediate delivery fell slightly. "Xin Hua" (新華) remained unchanged. "Zhong Fa" (中法) rose slightly. "Mei Ya" (美亞), "Hua Feng" (華豐), "Xin Guang" (新光), "Yong Gong" (永公), and "Jing Fu" (景福) each fell by 5%. "Shang Wu" (商務) "Li An" (麗安), and "Shang Ping" (尚平) were unchanged. "Zhong Si" (中絲) and "Xin Ya" (新亞) fell by less than 5%, while the rest experienced slight declines. For forward delivery, "Yong Sha" rose slightly. "Xin Guang" (新光), "Jing Fu" (景福), "Mei Ya" (美亞), "Xin He" (信和) and "Qin Xing" (勤興) all fell. In the off-exchange market, the older stocks such as "Zhong Hua" (中華), "Shi Jie" (世界), "Zha Bei" (閘北), and "Hua Shang" (華商) saw lows, while the rest remained stable.

Currently, the interest rate for the current "roll-over" transaction is between 9% and 11%. The price of "Yong Sha" shares was initially discounted by 6.3 yuan (貼價), then fell from 6.5 yuan to 5.6 yuan, before closing at 5 yuan. "Mei Ya" fell from 11 yuan to 8.5 yuan, but closed at 11 yuan. "Hua Feng" traded between 1.5 yuan and 2.8 yuan. "Xin Guang" traded between 3 yuan and 4.5 yuan. "Xin He" reached a high of 4 yuan and a low of 2.8 yuan before closing at 3 yuan.

Datong Yarn Factory (大通紗廠) is undergoing a capital increase, and trading of its shares will be suspended starting today. New shares of the Zhabei Water & Electricity (閘北水電) company will be listed today. The number of shares for trading is temporarily set at 100,000. Preferred and common shares will be delivered equally, without distinction.

### Two Brokers Suspended from Trading Floor

Yang Zhichang (楊智昌), broker number 211, also had account discrepancies and was suspected of engaging in off-exchange transactions. The matter was jointly reported to the relevant ministries for instructions on how to handle it. Now that the ministry's decision has been received, the exchange is instructed to implement it. The exchange specifically announced yesterday that broker number 143 is suspended from trading on the floor for two weeks, and broker number 211 is temporarily suspended from trading on the floor.

### Indian Cotton and Cloth Inspection Delegation Visits Japan; Discusses the Reality of the Japanese Cotton Spinning Industry

[Report from this Newspaper] An Indian cotton and cloth inspection delegation of several people recently returned to their country via Shanghai after completing their inspection in Japan. According to the delegation leader, Mr. Jila Jiang (吉拉疆), although the Japanese cotton spinning industry currently has favorable conditions such as low wages and excellent equipment, problems have arisen with the supply of coal, and there is a labor shortage. Therefore, it is expected that by the end of next year, the Japanese cotton spinning industry's goal of operating 4 million spindles will probably not be achieved. The number of Japanese spindles has currently decreased to 2.2 million. Japanese 20-count yarn is currently priced at US$280 per piece. During this trip, the delegation concluded a contract with Japan to purchase 170,000 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton payment will be made through a credit loan, with payments spread over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 3%. It is said that the price of Indian cotton yarn is the lowest in the world. 20-count yarn currently costs only 440 rupees per piece, which is equivalent to only US$137.50 per piece.

[Another Report] According to informed sources: Japan's current asking price for 20-count yarn is US$280 per piece. Our country's cotton yarn can also be sold at this price. The Indian cotton and cloth inspection delegation had informal discussions with related parties in our country during their visit to Shanghai. Our side stated that if the Indian side is interested in importing our country's cotton cloth, we are also willing to consider it.

### Unified Bonds Waver Unsteadily; Foreign Stocks Become Increasingly Popular

Government bonds showed mixed results yesterday, wavering uncertainly. Unified Bond C opened at 13,200 yuan and steadily declined from 13,600 yuan to around 12,800 yuan at closing. Northern gangs and room 555 sold, while rooms 550, 360, 503 and 614 were buyers. The transaction volume did not exceed 5 million. As a result, compared to the previous close, types A, B, and E remained flat, type C fell by 200 yuan, and type D rose by 200 yuan.

Foreign stocks felt good yesterday as trading increased. The supply from foreign and Guangdong merchants (廣帮) could hardly satisfy the strong demand from the securities and cotton yarn (紗花) gangs. Jardine shares (怡紗) opened at 940,000 yuan in the morning and approached the 1 million yuan mark at noon due to the reduction in the Hong Kong exchange rate. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Brewery rose by 10%, Jardine Textile, Guangdong Shipping, Telephone, Steel, and Xiang Tai each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly.

### Artificial Silk Unchanged; Factory Agents' Positions Firm

The artificial silk market was unchanged in the morning. Guang (光) shares from company 120 sold 6 million yuan out of 25.9 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, market sentiment was bullish, and the shares ultimately rose to 6.5 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Toyo's (東洋) "Pi Zi" (脾子) brand goods were in short supply, rising by 500,000 yuan more than "Jin San Ma" (金三馬) and other brands. The final selling price was 7 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan from the previous day.

Factory Agents

The positions are quite firm, with buying activity varying. The market situation is the same as the previous day. D-grade remains at 32 million yuan for seven days. Yesterday, five recent lots were traded, and Monday's bills were transacted at 1.3 million yuan. The spot transaction price was the same as the previous day. Dried silk was more popular. Yesterday, the market price for 2.8-point, 5-dan heads (擔頭) was quoted at 22 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan from the previous day.

Silk Fabrics

The market was very stable at the opening, with prices similar to the previous day. Dachen (大誠) and Juqiang's (舉强) silk quilt covers were initially traded at 434,000 yuan, but later rose due to supply and demand imbalances. The closing price was 2.6 million yuan for deferred date. The quoted price for "Ge Zi Bi Zhou" (格子璧縐) also rose by 500 yuan, but there were no transactions. Ordinary Hua Jin Zhou (華錦縐) goods were priced at 25,000 yuan. Min Sheng's (民生) "Hua Ti" (花綈), Han Bian (漢汴) and other goods were in high demand. Yesterday's market price was 27,000 yuan.

### New Longan Production Prices Rise

After the new longans appeared, prices rose again due to strong purchasing interest. According to telegraphic information, prices have risen by another 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in recent days, and the supply is very limited, making it difficult to procure them.

To Ms. Fan Yi, a Reader from He County, Anhui: Your letter has been received and your illness noted. We immediately sent it to Dr. Liu Jianqiu, a gynecology expert, for an answer. We received a very detailed reply yesterday, which is transcribed below for your reference! "If your menstrual cycle has always been every six months or three months since it first started, it cannot be considered a disease. The normal color of menstrual blood is dark red. If it turns brown as it is about to end, it is because the flow is gradually slowing down. Small blood clots are common for ordinary people. If the blood clots are large, you should consult a doctor to check if there are tumors in your uterus."

"If you are mentally weak, have a pale complexion, and have headaches and fever, you should use a thermometer to check your temperature twice a day, morning and evening. If your temperature is elevated, you should consult an internist to check your body for tuberculosis, heart disease, kala-azar, etc. Your stool should also be checked for parasites, as parasites can also cause fever and abdominal discomfort."

Publishing World

### Pioneer of the Common People's Century

— Yang Tongfang, written by Chen Yuan, published by Kaiming in early June this year

Most young people like to read biographies because the characters in biographies have a strong appeal and can evoke emotional resonance. A great historical figure who struggles against fate with unwavering spirit and achieves great success naturally deserves the love, respect, and praise of millions of people. However, we must not regard him as a god or superman. Viewing him as a god or superman easily creates a sense of separation in our minds, making us think that he is unattainable and that he lives outside the realm of reality. This is not a true understanding of him.

Many books about famous people that are published in bookstores tend to depict the characters as gods or supermen. Young people who read them may admire and praise them, but they only "worship" them and rarely feel motivated to emulate them further. Heroes are worthy of worship, but we don't need to teach young people to engage in incorrect hero worship by viewing them as gods or supermen. The traditional distorted concept of hero worship should be broken.

The great historical figures, like us, had flesh and blood, reason and emotion. For the sake of humanity, they lived among the people and relieved the suffering of the masses. Biographers should naturally grasp their true character—their human character—to express their great spirit. If they are written as gods or supermen, they lose their true character. Even if it inspires admiration, it is only worship of a deity, and it will not have any inspirational effect in the reader's heart.

"Pioneer of the Common People's Century" is Chen Yuan's new book. The thirteen articles collected here depict the people who heroically undertook arduous pioneering work in this unprecedented great century of the common people. The characters in this book can all be called heroes, true heroes, unlike the so-called "outstanding" emperors, officials, warlords, rulers, capitalists, and powerful politicians who are only concerned with their own positions. Their careers are a series of arduous struggles. In difficult and solitary battles, they are tested by the times and ultimately fulfill their aspirations of transforming society and saving humanity.

From the careers of these heroes, we can see that their achievements are entirely due to the purity of their motives and the sincerity of their work. From ideals to practice, we cannot find any miracles or any luck. We can all learn from them, and we should learn from them. As for how to learn from them, we must first have a correct and thorough understanding of them, recognize the process of their arduous struggles, and absorb their courage and spirit to nourish our own lives, so that our own blood is also infused with the blood of these people's heroes. Giants were originally the same as us. Once we understand why they became giants, we can no longer doubt that they are gods or supermen.

Having a correct understanding of these historical figures, let us briefly describe them one by one. The book is divided into four parts. The first part describes Roosevelt's great aspirations and achievements, divided into three articles. Roosevelt not only had an enlightened political mind but also transcendent vision. He is truly worthy of being a pioneer of the democratic century. Many people lament his death: if he were still alive, the world after World War II would not be so chaotic.

The second part consists of three articles, including Stalin, Kalinin, and Soviet scientists. The Stalin article quotes a majestic song by the famous poet Innokenty Annensky, comparing a great revolutionary to an eagle. Reading the article "Soldiers on the Scientific Front" allows us to understand how Soviet scientists lived and the predictions, organization, work, and development of many scientists in this new world. Their scientific research is for the happiness of the masses, and the results of their research are immediately integrated with practice, with the electrification of industry and agriculture, coupled with the high progress of industry and agriculture. The last section includes a translation of Pavlov's letter to young people, which can serve as a guide for scientific workers.

The third part is about Franklin, Thomas Paine, and Nehru. Franklin's greatness lies in "a popular scientist, a practical practitioner, and a brave fighter for democracy, all three personalities combined in one." It is no accident that a poor child from a printing worker's background still lives in the memory of Americans. Writing about Paine, the author uses the title "The Pursuit of Human Rights," which makes us yearn for it. Paine's epoch-making masterpiece "The Rights of Man" was published 155 years ago. Now that it is the century of the people, what profound significance should we have when reading this vivid and concise story of the birth of "The Rights of Man"? Only the first half of Nehru's life is written about. Nehru said: "Prison is my second home." Yes, revolutionaries go in and out of prison, just like going in and out of their homes. Prison life makes revolutionaries stronger and more courageous.

The four articles in the fourth part are about Romain Rolland, Tolstoy, Lu Xun, and Wells. These four prophets of culture all exposed the ugliness of society with their pens and shouted for the people. Romain Rolland is indeed the lighthouse of European wisdom. The radiance of his thought forever shines on the world. Where there is justice, there is Rolland's thought. Where there is truth, there is Rolland's thought. Tolstoy was equally great. He left the world two years after Rolland's death, in February 1945. His immortal literary legacy no longer belongs only to the Soviet Union, but to the entire world and all of humanity. Mr. Lu Xun was even more of an unprecedented cultural fighter for the Chinese nation. His anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-fascist thoughts have already sprouted in every corner of China. Wells, who was both a scientist, historian, and thinker, passed away not long ago. He always had hope, and all of his works consistently looked at the optimistic side of the future history of humanity.

The clear and lively writing and vivid descriptions in this book are sure to interest readers. Although the characters written about are diverse and multifaceted, they are all restored to being human, not "legendary" figures growing up in utopia. The good images used inside can also make people feel a sense of intimacy and admiration. This is a good reading material for young people to improve their self-cultivation and a material for self-education.

### Research on the Psychology of Propaganda

— Shi Pei

(Compiled and translated by Sa Kongliao, published by Gengyun Publishing House)

In the modern academic world, there has been significant progress in applying psychology to study various sciences, such as educational psychology, criminal psychology, literary psychology, and commercial psychology. Based on the theories of psychology, various problems and viewpoints are examined in detail, and there are good results in both theory and practice. The book "Research on the Psychology of Propaganda" uses psychology as a starting point to analyze and explore various issues in propaganda. A close reading of the book's contents reveals that it partially develops the theories of child psychology, differential psychology, social psychology, abnormal psychology, and applied psychology. However, the book's purpose is not only this. Its main purpose is to target the propaganda methods of the Nazi fascists and use psychology to explain how the deceptive propaganda methods of the Nazi fascists could grow, and then prove the reasons for their eventual failure.

The translator compiled and translated the book from the English book "The New Propaganda" by Amber Blanco White. White's purpose in writing this book was to discuss whether the Nazi fascist propaganda methods could be adopted by progressive political parties in Britain, but the compiler expanded the content, aiming to make Chinese readers understand the nature, influence, and inevitable results of Nazi fascist propaganda.

The book is divided into three parts: Part 1, Propaganda in the Eyes of Dictators; Part 2, Reasons Why People Accept Propaganda; and Part 3, Psychological Effects of Propaganda Rule by Dictatorial Governments. Each part is further divided into five or six chapters. In particular, the chapters discussed in Part 2, such as "On the Masses," "On Leaders," "Anxiety, Criminal Intent, and Hostility," "People and Rulers," and "Substitutes for Happiness," have novel arguments and in-depth explorations, which are thought-provoking! The various sounds discussed in Part 3 seem trivial and scattered because the issues involved are too broad. If this third part is compared with the first part to illustrate the confirmation of both the success and failure of Nazi fascist propaganda, the strength seems to be lacking. However, because the original author was deeply influenced by the theories of Freud, a famous modern Austrian psychologist, he applied psychology to the study of political and economic phenomena and concluded with the problems of propaganda psychology. His research methods pay attention to social roots and focus on the analysis of human psychology. From this point of view, the book is still of great academic value.

Using propaganda as a political tool dates back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in our country. Shang Yang had stories of posting notices with rewards for moving a pole and posting notices with punishments for moving a pole. At that time, it was to establish the government's credibility through propaganda. However, it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that propaganda was truly used as a weapon for political struggle, starting in Europe. By the time of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, propaganda was completely played with and became the most powerful weapon in politics. They tightly grasped the reaction of the people's psychology and even launched wars of aggression. In the past, during the war, we often talked about the issue of "nerve warfare," which was when Hitler used psychological warfare to the extreme. Internally, the aggressors created anxiety, criminal intent, and hostility in the minds of the people. Externally, they sought satisfaction through offensive looting. However, they finally suffered the consequences of deceiving the people and were defeated and destroyed! This is a great lesson for future generations.

Now, after the end of World War II, unfortunately, mankind is still living an anxious and psychologically insecure life. At present, the two major groups, the United States and the Soviet Union, are showing various political and economic confrontations, and they are fiercely competing with each other with major propaganda efforts. In fact, these situations are also using psychological warfare tactics to compete. However, history has painfully revealed to us that in order for propaganda to be effective, it must be compatible with the psychology of the receiver of the propaganda. That is to say, we must understand the psychological state of the public. After the second tragic war, the only thing the public needs is world peace and a longing for a happy and prosperous life. Therefore, we have no reason to create incidents of anxiety, criminal intent, and hostility in people's minds and repeat the mistakes of the Fascist Nazis!

The book said in the introduction: "Studying propaganda can help people understand that propaganda has a vital interest in them and can be alert; it can also make the government understand the true value of propaganda, and that abuse is not only useless but also harmful. It will no longer regard propaganda as a panacea for politics, but will recognize that only true democracy can stabilize the country. … Although the research center of this book is placed on the propaganda policies of Nazi fascist countries, its purpose is not only to study their propaganda policies, but to hope that readers can draw inferences from one instance, thereby acquiring more useful practical knowledge."

After reading this book, I thought about the overall situation of the world, and my mood felt both relaxed and heavy. I think readers are all concerned about the current situation, and if you read this book, it may give you some benefits.

### A New Lecture on Chinese Geography

### Yu Ru's "Distant Love"

First, let me state that this book has been introduced by many people already. Mr. Mao Dun's preface is the best interpretation of this book. In just two or three thousand words, he has fully covered the strengths and weaknesses of this work by Huo, regarding structure, layout, writing techniques, and the depiction of human nature.

But I still want to express my feelings. "Distant Love" is a biography of a newcomer's growth, a record of a warrior's battle with her inner self and with the environment. It contains too much of the spirit of the times. It writes about the joys, sorrows, and anger of the youth of the era, and there is a part of you and a part of me in it. "To see the world in a grain of sand," perhaps your and my gains are not entirely the same, but frankly speaking out these trivial impressions will not detract from this book that records the pulse of the times.

A noble woman, yet not a illusory figure, she is flesh and blood, a product of this era. As Mao Dun said well:

"Rowena's era is different from that of her mother's generation twenty years ago, but it can also be said that some things are still the same. Twenty years ago, Nora stepped out of the circle of etiquette and the puppet family to become a 'dignified person.' Now, Rowena must break away from the narrow circle of selfish love, from the comfortable but numbing living environment, and turn away."

The author, Yu Ru, uses "the lyrical atmosphere that female writers are good at" to carefully analyze the psychological process of the heroine Rowena's struggle with "selfish love." It is the era that allows Rowena's discerning eyes to see through everything; it is also the era that creates a distance between Rowena and her husband, Porter. He could comfortably arrange his life in a small family, but after a struggle, she finally jumped out of this small cage. The era is the force that determines everything. It is vast and surging, rushing forward, washing away sand, stones, and mud. But who is leading this irresistible force? — Still people, still the Rowenas who have been influenced by the times and in turn influence the times.

What is lovely is Rowena's awakening; no, what is even more lovely is the psychological struggle after Rowena's awakening, and her actions put into practice after a cruel psychological struggle.

Gao Yuan doesn't understand her. — As a little wife, he understands her; as a social fighter, her actions are far beyond his understanding.

Lei Jia may not understand her either — perhaps Lei Jia understands this era better and is closer to her, but a "Rudin-type" character, able to speak but not act, even if he understands the needs of this era better, he will still not completely understand their own needs. Or even if they understand a little, they are only "giants in words, dwarfs in action."

Rowena is normal, is ordinary, she does not have excessive heroic character, and doesn't like to show off. She just does what the times demand of her, and she does it — without the slightest mistake.

But in the eyes of Lei Jia and Gao Yuan, what kind of person has she become? — When Gao Yuan quietly asked Lei Jia: "Have you proposed to her?" "No way, to her, we are not her match... She is a devil, she is a god, not a human being! Their whole family is like that!" This is Lei Jia's answer.

What moves us is how Gao Yuan and Rowena married out of a simple love, and after marriage, only lust remained. Gao Yuan loves her, but what he loves is not her knowledge, understanding, awakening... but the aspect of her as a little wife. She also loves Gao Yuan, but she finds inadequacy and dissatisfaction in this simple love. How did a distance arise between them, and what kind of psychological struggle did they go through? Rowena crossed Gao Yuan's constraints and walked her own path. The author writes about this entire process vividly.

What I want to explain is: Rowena seems very real in our eyes, and is not damaged by her heroic character. I think this is because the author has infused "humanity" into the heroine. The author subtly writes about her psychological changes, one layer deeper than another. Therefore, her actions, in our eyes, do not feel sudden at all.

When Gao Yuan misunderstands her, she is in pain.

"I can't get his understanding," she murmured to herself, "He won't understand me, he hasn't even tried to understand the whole era... Between us, there is already a very deep chasm. I can't go back. These times, I have spurred myself with a harsh will, without even time to stop and breathe. But I can only move forward endlessly..."

She is the embodiment of reason. She sees deeply, thinks deeply, and therefore, she also works very calmly. But she is not a person without emotions. When Gao Yuan finds someone else and writes to her to show off, destroying the little bit of simple love that was maintained between them, her pain is extraordinary — she was sick for three weeks because of this.

A person of flesh and blood, a person who dares to love and hate, a person who can hold reason and control emotions — originally, she is just an ordinary person. But she is unfamiliar with this world, and this world is also unfamiliar with her. Society cannot tolerate her, and friends, even her husband, cannot understand her. If she is a brave person, she has to fight the environment; if she succumbs, the fate of a "domestic pigeon" awaits her.

This ordinary person, we call "a newcomer." This is the tragedy of the times — not that she is not close enough to us, but that we, due to some selfish mentality, dare not get close to her, not that she has any fault that makes us unable to approach, but that we have too many weaknesses. Before these weaknesses are completely washed away, we are afraid to approach her, even ashamed to glance at her face to face.

However, she will eventually slowly influence us; because of the results of her struggle, she will influence this era.
