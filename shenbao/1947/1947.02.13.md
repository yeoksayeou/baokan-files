[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The Supreme National Defense Council has scheduled a temporary meeting for the 14th at 9:00 AM to discuss issues such as suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Chairman Chiang summoned Song Ziwen, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Xiao Zheng, Huang Bodu, and others to his official residence at noon on the 11th to inquire about the current financial and fiscal situation. He instructed them to quickly formulate plans for suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods and to implement them as soon as possible. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will be in charge of this matter, and it was decided to telegraph Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Shu Yunjun, and the person in charge of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee to come to Nanjing for a meeting within days. A plan will be decided in the shortest possible time and implemented immediately.

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Song Ziwen received Bei Zuyi at his residence on the morning of the 12th after Bei arrived in Nanjing that morning. He listened to a report on the turbulent financial situation in Shanghai. At 10:00 AM, he summoned Yu Hongjun, the American financial advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and Bei Zuyi to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures, which lasted until noon. In the afternoon, Xu Baiyuan and others continued to visit and discuss the matter. It is reported that Song will go to Shanghai that night and make a final decision on the countermeasures based on the actual situation in Shanghai. It is said that Song visited the Chairman in the afternoon to report on the countermeasures. Furthermore, Bei Zuyi is scheduled to return to Shanghai with Song on the night of the 12th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] According to a senior official who participated in the temporary meeting convened by Song Ziwen on the 11th, plans to suppress commodity prices are being studied separately by all relevant parties and will be presented soon. The senior officials will continue to meet in the coming days. When asked by reporters whether a new organization would be established to handle this matter, he replied that an organization might be established if needed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The authorities have made concrete decisions on effective measures to suppress the current financial fluctuations. An important meeting was held at Premier Song's residence on the morning of the 12th, with Minister Yu Hongjun and Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi participating. These effective measures will be implemented within days, and the prices of gold and US dollars are bound to fall again.

Central Standing Committee Resolves to Establish Economic Policy Research Association

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The Central Standing Committee convened a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, with more than 30 members of the Standing Committee attending. President Chiang himself presided over the meeting. Song Ziwen was unable to attend because he was holding a meeting with Bei Zuyi and others at his residence at the same time. The meeting first discussed various routine cases, including the passage of the Organizational Law of the Central Election Guidance Committee. Then, the President inquired about the recent gold and banknote turmoil and commodity price fluctuations and solicited opinions. He instructed the government to care for the people's livelihood and that appropriate measures had been decided upon and could be used to suppress the fluctuations. Subsequently, Standing Committee member Pan Wei-zhan reported on the financial market in Shanghai and the lurking manipulative elements and presented his opinions. Liu Jianqun, Lai Lian, He Zhonghan, and others then spoke in succession. Finally, it was decided to re-examine the current economic policy and to organize a committee by the Central Government, consisting of seven or eight Central Committee members, to be established as soon as possible to determine policies. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. In other news, in addition to the Central Committee appointing several Central Committee members to serve as members of the Economic Policy Research Committee to be established, it will also invite well-known figures from the industrial and commercial sectors to join.

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] According to a senior government official, the current gold rush has caused a general rise in commodity prices, which the government is paying close attention to. They are currently seeking appropriate measures to separate gold from commodity prices, so that it loses its connection. As for rumors that the government will adopt measures to nationalize gold and suspend gold trading, the former has already been proposed by the Legislative Yuan, and the latter is quite possible.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Official sources stated tonight that the government has decided to stop the circulation of US dollars and restrict the open trading of gold. These decisions will be implemented as soon as they are approved by Chairman Chiang. As for the gold nationalization plan proposed by some members at yesterday's Legislative Yuan meeting, it will not be implemented.

### Commodity Prices Can Be Naturally Suppressed Based on the Cost of Living Index Over the Years; An Economic Official Analyzes Commodity Prices

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] When an economic official analyzed the current commodity price problem to reporters on the morning of the 12th, his views were not as pessimistic as those of the general public. He cited specific figures to show that although commodity prices are rising, they will eventually return to a reasonable path. According to statistics on the commodity price index over the years, commodity prices have risen by an average of 2.7 times per year. Since the "July 7th" Incident, a total of nine years have passed. Goods worth one yuan at that time should now be worth 7,811 yuan (i.e., 2.7 to the power of 9). Before the war, the price of rice in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas was 12 yuan per dan, which multiplied by 7,800 times would be 93,000 yuan. The price of gold was 115 yuan per tael, which should be 897,000 yuan. The current soaring commodity prices, in some respects, have not exceeded this by much. Moreover, according to past experience, commodity prices will inevitably rise in February and March each year, and the rising momentum will weaken after May and June. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by the curve indicated in the commodity price index table over the years. After a period of time, commodity prices will naturally be suppressed. He went on to analyze the impact of commodity prices on the lives of people at all levels, pointing out that workers at that time could earn 8 jiao to 1 yuan per day (one dou of rice), and their current income is more than one dou of rice. Farmers do have various sufferings, but they still have real goods.

### Sharp Drop in Gold Notes in Nanjing

Gold Drops by 200,000 Yuan per Tael

US Dollars Differ by 500,000 Yuan

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The price of gold in the capital soared during the day on the 11th, with a great momentum to break through the 1 million mark. However, by the time the market closed in the evening, it had shown signs of fatigue. Because the authorities will take emergency measures to stop the rising trend, speculators were nervous and soft-handed, and they sold off en masse. Since then, the price of gold has plummeted like a flood. When the market opened on the morning of the 12th, some were still quoting 950,000, but the price immediately fell as news of the soft Shanghai price was received. At around 9:00 AM, the bid was 795,000, and the offer was 740,000. An hour later, it rose again, with the bid at 825,000 and the offer at 755,000. At around 11:00 AM, it fell again, with the bid at 765,000 and the offer at 695,000. At 12:00 PM, the bid was 745,000 and the offer was 675,000. At 1:00 PM, the bid was 715,000 and the offer was 645,000. In the evening, there were continued ups and downs. At closing, the bid was 680,000 and the offer was 640,000. The surging gold wind has gradually subsided, but the rise in commodity prices triggered by the gold wind has already become impossible to reverse. For example, the rise in rice and grain prices has already become irreversible. It is reported that the government will take effective measures, and if they can be implemented in the short term, commodity prices should be able to stabilize.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The market prices of gold and US dollars suddenly fell. On the morning of the 12th, the bid for gold was 715,000 yuan per tael, and the offer was 645,000 yuan, a difference of 200,000 yuan from the 915,000 yuan per tael on the 11th. The fall in the price of US dollars was even greater. On the 12th, the bid for 100 yuan was 1.1 million yuan, and the offer was 1.2 million yuan, a difference of 500,000 yuan from the 1.7 million yuan offered for 100 yuan on the 11th.

### Government Will Take Necessary Steps to Deal with Current Economic Situation; Minister Peng Speaks at Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 12th. Minister Peng answered important questions from reporters as follows:

Question: What is the reason for the sharp rise in the exchange value of the US dollar in China? Is there a plan to control it, and what is this plan?

Answer: The government is confident and capable of dealing with the economic situation and will continue to take various necessary steps. However, the current economic situation is the result of eight years of war against Japan and two years of unceasing destruction by the Communist Party. The people of the country are now gradually realizing the responsibility that they should bear for deliberately destroying transportation, industry, and mining. We must not harbor any illusions about this anemic state and think that changing the name of the currency, the exchange rate, or the tax rate will have unexpected effects. Only by restoring economic construction as soon as possible and strictly adhering to the creed of diligence and thrift can we achieve a fundamental cure.

Government Reorganization

Question: What proportion of power will be given to minority parties in the reorganization of the government? How much time will it take to complete the reorganization? When will the reorganized government be able to start working?

Answer: All parties will negotiate to participate in the National Government Committee, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the National Political Council during the transition period, and the Standing Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. It is difficult to say for sure when the reorganization will be completed.

Hope for Peace

Question: Is there still hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party?

Answer: In the current situation, it is difficult to talk about peace. The Communist Party is attacking the National Army everywhere, partly for the purpose of international propaganda and boosting the morale of its troops after repeated defeats. At the same time, it is doing its best to incite workers to strike, students to boycott classes, and launch so-called "anti-American goods campaigns" and "anti-constitutional movement," in order to create international disputes and panic among the people. However, as the Western saying goes, "Wood is destroyed by fire, but iron is tempered and strengthened." After this hardship, the Chinese National Army will become stronger, just as it did after the war against Japan.

Gold Policy

Question: What is the government's gold policy? Will the Central Bank continue to sell gold? What is the policy on the legal exchange rate? Will other measures be adopted to replace export subsidies?

Answer: Any answer will inevitably have a direct impact on the market, so I beg to be excused from discussing it.

Zhang Xueliang's Affair

Question: Will Zhang Xueliang, the mastermind of the Xi'an Incident, be released? Answer: At the end of 1936, Zhang Xueliang was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment by the High Military Tribunal of the Military Affairs Commission for conspiring with accomplices and using violence to coerce superiors. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang requested a special pardon from the National Government. On January 4, 1937, the National Government approved the special pardon and ordered him to be placed under strict supervision by the Military Affairs Commission. This was all because Chairman Chiang had always preserved Zhang and showed him his love. During the war against Japan, Zhang lived in Guizhou, and his family often lived with him and visited him from time to time, which was not prohibited. Last year, he moved to Taipei, and his life is as usual. However, under the current circumstances, the National Government has not yet been able to revoke the order of supervision.

### National Army Recaptures Shan County and Yucheng; Fierce Fighting Continues on the Border of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui; Liu Bocheng's Troops Are Being Annihilated in Separate Encirclments

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] It is confirmed that the National Army has made smooth progress in the overall situation of the battles in southern Shandong and along the Longhai Railway. In southern Shandong, they are steadily approaching Linyi. Fierce battles have been fought near Lanfeng along the Longhai Railway for days, and the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th brigades of Liu Bocheng's Communist troops have been defeated, suffering heavy losses. One brigade of the 3rd brigade was completely annihilated on the morning of the 12th. Most of Liu's troops have lost their combat effectiveness, and it is expected that the battle situation on the border of Shandong and Henan will take a sharp turn for the worse within days. Furthermore, some Communist troops north of the Jiaoji Railway are attempting to reinforce the south by crossing the railway, but they have been blocked and are unlikely to succeed.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] The National Army in southwestern Shandong recaptured Shan County at 1:00 PM on the 11th. The Communist troops were routed and retreated to the northwest, and the National Army is following up in pursuit and rapidly advancing towards Chengwu. Another unit of the National Army recaptured Yucheng on the evening of the 11th and is advancing towards Huanggang. A Communist battalion of 600-700 men near Minquan surrendered to the National Army on the 10th, and the situation in eastern Henan is expected to become clear. More than 10,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops south of the Longhai Railway are being encircled and annihilated by the National Army northwest of Ningling.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] After Liu Bocheng's Communist troops fled to the north and south of the Longhai Railway in eastern Henan, the National Army along the railway line strengthened its deployment to deal a heavy blow to the Communist troops when they attacked. The Communist troops, overestimating their capabilities, launched a fierce attack on the National Army in Minquan, Yejiagang, and other places in three directions at 12:00 PM on the night of the 11th. The main force of the 7th column attacked from north and south of the Longhai Railway, the 1st and 2nd columns attacked from southwest of the old Kaocheng, and the main force of the 3rd column and the 6th column attacked from the area north of Liuhe to the west. The total strength of the three routes was more than 40,000, intending to encircle the National Army in Minquan, Yejiagang, and other places. The fighting was extremely fierce on the morning of the 12th. The National Army counterattacked jointly according to the planned plan, and by noon, it had eliminated more than 6,000 Communist troops and their regimental commander. At the same time, a brigade of more than 2,000 men from the 2nd column of the Communist troops rushed into Zhengzhuangzhai (southeast of Yejiazhai) at 10:00 AM. The entire unit was completely surrounded by the National Army's powerful troops. All the Communist troops from the brigade commander down were annihilated. As of the time of the telephone call, the Communist troops there were still being eliminated separately by the National Army.

[Our Bengbu Office, 12th] After Liu Bocheng's troops fled, the center of the battle shifted to Shangqiu and north of Ningling, where they are fighting fiercely with the National Army. The Communist troops west of Yongcheng are withdrawing to Bo County, and the Communist troops north of Lingbi are fleeing back to the north of Si County.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The situation in the border area of Henan and Anhui is gradually returning to normal. After Liu Bocheng's remnant troops fled back to western Shandong, only Zhang Taisheng and Wei Fenglou remained between Bo County, Ninglingwen, Luyi, and Zhecheng, and the National Army is continuing to clear them out.

[Another Dispatch] A replenishment battalion of the 3rd Column of Liu Bocheng's Communist troops surrendered to the National Army in the area between Minquan and Liuhe on the evening of the 10th. The 1st, 6th, and 7th columns, which had been fleeing in the border area of Henan and Anhui, suffered continuous heavy blows from the National Army, and little remained of them. On the afternoon of the 10th, Yang Yong led them to sneak across the railway and return to western Shandong. They were intercepted by the National Army in Minquan and suffered heavy losses again. Now Liu Bocheng's five columns and an independent brigade, which had come east from southern Hebei, have been routed and lost their organization.

### National Army Enters Lijiazhuang; Suburban Linyi Under Control

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in southern Shandong entered Jijiazhuang at 1:00 PM on the 12th, which is 45 li south of Linyi. This place is the five strategic strongholds south of Linyi. From then on, the National Army's heavy artillery can directly fire at more than a dozen important villages and heights adjacent to Lijiazhuang in the suburbs of Linyi, including Cangshan, Shenshan, Dicheng, and Bianzhuang on the west side, and Balitun and Qidazhuang on the east side, all of which are under the control of the National Army. The Communist troops reorganized themselves with a part of Jie Si, Jie Jiu, and the New 63rd Division and stubbornly defended the line. After being fiercely attacked by the National Army, they were unable to resist for more than six hours and retreated in disarray to Linyi.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] The battle situation in southern Shandong is deadlocked. The National Army near Huabu, south of Linyi, is repairing roads and sweeping away scattered Communist troops every day. More than 40,000 Communist troops who fled from Huandunbu to the north continued to move towards Juxian.

[Our Jinan Office, 12th] The National Army in Xintai recaptured Aoyangzhen on the 12th. The National Army Wang Yaowu's troops, which recaptured Xintai, swept away the stray Communist troops in the suburbs of Ji City and redeployed. Starting from the morning of the 12th, they continued to advance towards Mengyin with a new attitude. The area has entered the heart of the Yimeng Mountains, and the terrain is more dangerous than before. The National Army adopted a steady and solid strategy. At 1:00 PM this afternoon, they first drove out the Communist troops occupying Aoshan and the 410 Heights, and at about 2:00 PM, they took advantage of the victory to occupy Aoyangzhen south of the mountain. The total distance from Xintai City to here is 10 kilometers, and the National Army is still advancing.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 12th] The National Army advancing from Xintai to Mengyin had already crossed Guanshan on the 11th and continued to advance. The county seat of Mengyin is already in the hands of the National Army.

Gold Shops Raided in Xuzhou and Nanchang

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] After Taipei, Guangzhou, and Chengdu decided to stop trading in gold notes and adopted strict controls, they are all trending downward today. Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places are also trending downward due to the soft shadow of gold notes in Nanjing and Shanghai.

Will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan General Assembly for discussion

### 11th and 12th War Zones to be Reorganized into Pacification Offices Next Month

Wang Hongshao Talks About the Current Situation

[Our Beiping Office, 12th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, met with reporters at noon on the 12th and made a statement on the current unstable situation: (1) Although Tong County was once attacked by the Communist troops, it cannot be regarded as a poor defense of Beiping. The security of Beiping is definitely not in danger. Even if the Communist troops intend to attack Beiping, in fact, small groups cannot get out after entering, and large groups cannot get close. The reason why Tong County was attacked was because there were too few defending troops and because of negligence. Responsible agencies have now been strictly ordered to pay attention and take mutual defense measures. Although it cannot be guaranteed that similar incidents will never happen again in the future, it can be said with certainty that the situation is becoming safer. (2) The Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway greatly disturbed the Baoshi section, leaving the Pingbao section empty. The National Army took the opportunity to recapture Yixian, and Mancheng can also be recaptured recently. However, since neither side is sure to win the city, it is not difficult to recapture it. Whether the Baoshi section will be opened up in the future depends on whether the Pingbao section can be secured. (3) The reorganization of the 11th and 12th war zones into pacification offices has been ordered and can be realized next month. There will not be many changes in personnel. (4) Daming was a voluntary withdrawal by the National Army.

Song told reporters that the Pingbao Road is becoming stable, and the current military focus is on protecting the road. Although the situation in Baoding is tight, the city defense is secure. To open up the Baoshi section is a just and urgent action. To remove the threat to Tianjin and Baoding, it is necessary to clear the Tianjin-Baoding triangle area. Furthermore, there are no changes in the battles in western Hebei. The two armies are in a stalemate northwest of Qicun in Mancheng. The Communist troops surrounding Baoding are being transferred north one after another in an attempt to intercept the National Army going south in Yixian.

### Caring for Civil Servants and Teachers; Preparing to Distribute In-Kind Benefits; Ministry of Economic Affairs Establishes Daily Necessities Supply Office

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The manual workers and industrial classes are now under the dual pressure of high wages and high interest rates and are struggling to catch their breath.

### The US Concerned About China's Economy Considers the Possibility of Waiving Additional Taxes on Subsidized Exports

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: China's export subsidy method is currently not feasible due to US tariff rules. The US is considering remedial measures to stabilize China's currency system. The US government is awaiting a report from the US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, and will make a decision on the 13th.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] A State Department spokesperson said that the US government is increasingly concerned about China's deepening economic crisis. The State Department is closely monitoring all developments in China, receiving constant reports from the US Embassy in China and the Consul General in Shanghai, but is unwilling to announce the nature of these reports.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] US government officials stated today that the US tariff decision of 1930 has greatly hampered China's export subsidy plan, and the US is now considering the possibility of canceling this decision. However, the extent to which this move will help curb inflation is questionable. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, may announce the US Treasury Department's decision on the 13th.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Reliable government sources say that many government officials here believe that Chinese exporters subsidized by the Chinese government should be exempted from the additional taxes stipulated in the Tariff Act of 1930. It is said that the US Treasury Department will decide within 24 hours whether to grant this exemption. Some officials have explicitly requested the government to exempt Chinese goods from additional taxes, and the United States has in the past exempted allied nations facing economic difficulties from additional taxes, so there is a precedent. They also believe that this move could improve the current severe economic crisis in Shanghai. Other officials insist that the Tariff Act of 1930 cannot be arbitrarily violated without special congressional approval, but they also believe that if the Chinese government's subsidy of its exporters is not a true subsidy but a disguised exchange rate adjustment, then there may indeed be a possibility of waiving the additional tax.

Officials from various departments of the US government discussed this issue again last night and this morning but are unwilling to predict the outcome. The issue will ultimately be decided by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank. Proponents of waiving the additional tax say that taking this measure now is not excessive in order to restore Chinese exporters as soon as possible and stabilize China's economic situation, but if a decision cannot be made soon, it will be too late.

### Military Mediation Department Actively Concluding Government Employees Dismissed Yesterday All Groups to Return to Peiping Within the Week

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] The government side of the Military Mediation Department is concluding. Zheng Jiemin will not return to Peiping and has telegraphed Cai Wenzhi to handle matters with full authority. There are over 400 government personnel, including over 240 employees who will be "suspended without pay" from tomorrow, with three months' salary paid in severance. The 160 staff officers will also be assigned to work in various locations starting tomorrow. Today, all personnel sang a farewell song and took a group photo as a memento.

Ye Jianying Bids Farewell to Peiping Reporters, Will Issue Statement on Military Mediation Department Work

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 12th] Ye Jianying attended a press conference hosted by the Communist Party News Agency today to bid farewell to the Peiping press corps. Ye analyzed the war situation and political situation from the Communist Party's point of view. In general, he believed that the Battle of Xuzhou, which would determine the outcome of the war, could be fought decisively, quickly, or as a protracted war, depending on how the commanders of both sides viewed the situation at the time. Regarding the political situation, he said: "After February and March, the military situation will change, and peace can be expected to be re-established." When asked whether the Communist Party would insist on restoring its military position as of January 13th of last year, and whether it had the confidence to achieve this goal in terms of military strength, or would use indirect methods to accomplish it, Ye replied: "The military position at midnight on January 13th can be said to exist, and it can be said not to exist. Of course, we can draw a map of this position, but if the two parties can establish political understanding and the Kuomintang agrees to this condition, then the Communist Party does not necessarily have to realize this condition, and then the so-called military position of January 13th will be useless." Regarding the work of the Military Mediation Department over the past year, he will issue a statement, and is currently consulting with Yan'an on the content.

Li Denghui Advocates Peace, Says Current Need is Unconditional Ceasefire

[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Li Denghui, 75 years old, who has been engaged in education for 50 years and has never asked about foreign affairs, is now one of the five conveners of the peace movement. At a time when the financial situation is chaotic, prices are soaring, and people are extremely uneasy, a reporter visited Dr. Li at his residence and was received by him. The questions and answers are as follows:

Q: Prices have been rising recently, and people are unusually uneasy. What are your thoughts?

A: The country's situation has reached this point, and it is truly serious and regrettable. If it is not resolved fundamentally, there is no solution. I believe that all problems are tied to peace. To stabilize finances, it must begin with the realization of peace.

Q: Besides achieving peace, are there any other methods?

A: Everything must start with peace.

Q: What is the motivation for you and others to launch the peace movement?

A: I believe that today's China, without peace, nothing can be discussed. Months ago, I wanted to make this appeal as a citizen. Recently, I spoke with many friends and classmates, as well as leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors, and they all shared the same sentiment, so we jointly launched this national salvation movement. I believe that since the War of Resistance, there has not been a national salvation movement that meets the urgent needs of the entire nation, which is the peace movement.

Q: What is the goal of the peace movement?

A: Immediate unconditional ceasefire.

Q: Besides public opinion appeals, are there any other effective methods for the peace movement?

A: The eight-year history of the War of Resistance demonstrates that once the national will and conscience are concentrated on a single, simple goal, its power is sufficient to exceed any tangible power in the world. If the majority unanimously demands peace and does not encourage war, I believe that no one can fail to obey peace.

Q: Then how can the national will be concentrated on peace?

A: If there is no favoritism and no purpose other than peace, who would not agree? This is the purpose of the peace movement.

Q: You and others advocate an unconditional ceasefire, but can there be peace without conditions?

A: Unconditional ceasefire is the people's demand. As for what conditions are required by both sides, that is their business. We have no intention of interfering with their conditions, but we hope that they will not harm the public interest.

Q: The peace movement advocates not questioning past right and wrong, and some people disagree. What do you think?

A: During wartime, discussing right and wrong is biased. We advocate that today's right is peace, and other right and wrong can wait until after the ceasefire.

Q: There is a lot of speculation about the peace movement. Have you heard anything?

A: Just ask whether peace is needed and wait for the facts to prove it.

Q: Do you and others intend to mediate peace?

A: Today, we are appealing to the conscience of our countrymen. We have not yet appealed to the warring parties.

Q: Does the peace movement not welcome other parties to participate?

A: This is not entirely true. We do not ask about parties, but whether they agree with the peace declaration. Free members of all parties, and those who have occupations and prioritize peace, unconstrained by party opinions, we welcome to participate.

Q: How do you view the future of this movement?

A: I deeply believe that the peace movement will succeed. At this point, the gentleman, in a sincere tone, sent the reporter out the door and said, "I am old, but I hope to see a peaceful and prosperous China after the victory. I deeply hope that my younger friends, in addition to their own professions, will unanimously make peace their greatest goal and promote its realization as soon as possible, so that you will enjoy the happiness and glory of peace for much longer than I."

### Democratic Socialist Party Holds Meetings Yesterday and Today to Discuss Candidates for Government Participation, Youth Party Central Standing Committee Discusses Internal Affairs

[This City Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday (12th) afternoon. Because of insufficient numbers, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting. It was decided to continue holding a meeting this afternoon to discuss and decide on candidates to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Political Participation Council, and Constitutional Government Promotion Association. A certain key member of the party told reporters last night that the discussion meeting discussed who was more suitable to participate in which institution, but no conclusions were reached. The list of personnel participating in the four government institutions will be decided at the meeting tomorrow (13th), and then Jiang Yuntian will take it to Nanjing to submit to the government. It is not yet known whether Zhang Junli will accompany him to Nanjing. The list decided tomorrow is not the final list, because possible participants are scattered at home and abroad. The party headquarters has sent telegrams to each of them to seek their consent. Before the replies arrive, it is naturally not possible to give consent on their behalf, but the majority of participants can still be decided tomorrow. It is said that the Democratic Socialist Party has a total of 34 places to participate in the four government institutions, including 12 in the Legislative Yuan, 6 in the Supervisory Yuan, 11 in the Political Participation Council, and 5 in the Constitutional Government Promotion Association. As for whether they will soon participate in the National Government Committee, the Executive Yuan, and local governments, it has not yet been decided. It is also learned that the Democratic Socialist Party plans to issue a statement within days to explain the reasons for participating in the four government institutions, believing that this move will benefit the promotion of constitutionalism and the promotion of peace.

[This City Report] Sun Baogang, commissioned by the Democratic Socialist Party, is the director of the Shanghai branch and is in charge of the party affairs of the Shanghai party.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] The Shanghai headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party sent a letter to Hu Haimen and Yang Qiushui, asking them to go south to discuss the issue of participating in the government. Hu and Yang had just returned to Peiping and had not even had time to settle down, so they have indicated that they do not intend to return to Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper Report] The Youth Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee yesterday, focusing on internal work and agreeing to pay attention to the restoration of party affairs in various places. According to a certain key member who told reporters, someone has recently been using the name of the director of the Youth Party's Shanghai office to conduct activities outside. The Standing Committee has decided to issue a public statement to correct this. Regarding the party's participation in the government, a final decision can only be made after the Standing Committee members stranded in Nanjing return to Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The 125 members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association were originally planned to be decided, with one-quarter divided between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, and three-quarters distributed among the Kuomintang, social figures, women, overseas Chinese, and other 49 units. It is now learned that the three-quarter quota, totaling 93 places, will have one person per unit for each of the 49 units, and the remaining 44 places will be selected by each unit.

Education expenses account for 23%, close to the ratio stipulated by the constitution.

### Jiangxi's Population Sharply Declines, Less Than Half of Pre-War Levels, Only Over 12.8 Million

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 12th] According to statistics from the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department: the current population tax number in Jiangxi Province is 12,819,157, less than half of the pre-war level. In addition to the impact of the War of Resistance, epidemics are also a major cause, such as the "8" shaped disease in De'an, the blood-sucking disease in Xingzi, and the plague in Nancheng. As of last month, the total population of Nanchang City was 203,101, a decrease of about 100,000 compared to before.

### Zhou Fohai's Wife's Appeal Still Rejected

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 12th] After the traitor Zhou Fohai was sentenced to death, his wife, Yang Shuhui, filed another appeal, requesting a retrial. On the 12th, it was rejected by the Supreme Court. The main text: "Zhou Yang Shuhui's appeal for a retrial of Zhou Fohai's traitor case is rejected."

### Original Text of the Reasons for the Judgment Against Traitor Ding Mocun Continued from Yesterday

Purely Empty Words

Moreover, after the defendant arrived in Shanghai at the end of 1938, within two or three weeks, he had a relationship with Li Shiqun (see the court record of November 19, 1946). This further confirms that the claim in the Fourth Seven Three One Public Document of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission of the previous army: "Ding Mocun served as the director of the puppet Special Ding Headquarters from the spring of 1939 to March 1940" is true. The defendant's claim that he only joined the special forces in the autumn of 1939 is obviously unbelievable, even though the defendant claimed that Hu Junhe fabricated the facts because of his refusal to allow Hu Junhe to go to Zhejiang to work, however, the investigation revealed that it was purely empty words and not sufficient to be taken as evidence. As for the letters presented by the defendant from Zhao Binggu on November 25, 1946, and Jiang Bocheng on November 7, 1946, proving that the activities of the 76th were often manipulated by Li Shiqun, Wu Shishi, etc., however, the investigation revealed that Jiang Bocheng obtained this information from hearsay (see his reply on December 9, 1946), and Zhao Binggu was also not an insider of the 76th, so he naturally had no way of knowing. This kind of evidence is difficult to accept. Moreover, according to Yu Runzhi's brother Yu Nanyang's testimony: in March 1939, Ding Mocun once said to Yu Runzhi, "Your father used to be a prosecutor at the Gao Er Branch, why don't you participate in the Peace Movement? If you insist on not participating in the Peace Movement, the 76th will take your father's life." In November of the same year, after Yu Huaguo was arrested by the 76th, Ding said to my sister, "Kill Yu Huaguo to show the monkeys" (see the interrogation record of the Shanghai High Court on December 11, 1946). This is consistent with the various newspapers presented by Yu Yin, which recorded the situation at the time. It is clear that Yu Hua's assassination was instigated by the traitor Ding Mocun.

Testimony Difficult to Believe

Regarding the murder of Zheng Pingru, the Public Letter No. 5167 of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is sufficient to prove that Zheng Pingru's arrest and death were related to the exposure of Ding Mocun's plan to lure and kill him. The defendant was in charge of the 76th at the time, and the arrest and killing were undoubtedly carried out by him. The defendant shirked responsibility onto the Japanese invaders, and his defense has no value in accepting it as evidence. Furthermore, eight underground workers from the Military Intelligence Bureau were killed. The location of the killings was in Shanghai, and the date of the killings was also during the defendant's tenure as the director of the puppet Special Forces Headquarters. Moreover, the bureau has provided clear evidence, making it difficult for the defendant to deny it. There is also the New Year Special Edition of the puppet Central Daily News in 1944, which can be used as evidence, and the evidence is conclusive. Although Heng Shiwu and Cheng Denzhi both participated in puppet organizations, their testimony is difficult to believe. Even if it is considered true, it is not sufficient to prove that the article was drafted by the puppet Propaganda Department and published in the defendant's name. This defense is also not sufficient to accept as evidence.

Regarding the third point: The Public Letter No. 235 of the Chinese Kuomintang Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, dated December 17, 1946, has the effect of an official document. The defendant did not provide accurate evidence proving it to be untrue, and it is consistent with the situation in other provincial governments and puppet provincial party departments at the time, so it should be presumed to be true. Regarding the fourth point, according to Cheng Gongshu's report, the puppet Assault Brigade was discovered in Songjiang and Shaoxing. The Songjiang part was scattered because it did not contact the local enemy army, and the Shaoxing part was dispersed or revolted after the Japanese surrender. This is sufficient to prove that the defendant's claim that "the Assault Brigade has never been established due to lack of funds and other items" is not true. Cheng Gongshu's report can also prove that the purpose of the defendant's organization of the Assault Brigade was to engage in guerrilla warfare after the Allied forces landed on the coast of eastern Zhejiang. As for his claim that it was to prepare to meet the central counter-offensive, it is purely empty words and cannot be accepted as evidence.

In summary, none of the reasons given by the defendant in his defense can be established. The defendant's collusion with the enemy to plot against the country is undeniable and should be held liable for the crime of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Although he committed many crimes, they all stemmed from the same intention of "colluding with the enemy to plot against the country" and are absorbed into the same crime of treason, so there is no need to punish them separately.

Special Commentary

### The Low Tide of China's Foreign Relations

— Dong Lin

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we have missed the opportunity for peaceful unification, idly talked for more than a year, and the opposition parties have not yet cooperated with the central government. A unified national government has not been formed, coupled with the scramble for territory and the civil war, not only has the domestic political economy been paralyzed, but to this day, we have fallen into a low tide of foreign relations.

During this World War, China single-handedly shouldered the arduous task in the Far East. Although it suffered repeated military defeats, it long contained the majority of Japan's forces, giving the United States a chance to breathe and organize its army for the eastern expedition. Various countries recognized China's contribution to this war, so its international status was steadily rising, leaping from a semi-colony to one of the four powers. Looking back at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in the United States, France's national strength was still very weak. However, because of its traditional geographical relationship in Europe, it was later included in the ranks of the great powers, but ranked fifth. Unfortunately, we failed to seize the opportunity. As a result of more than a year of civil war, we lost the precious seat of one of the four powers. On the contrary, France strove to become stronger, catching up and replacing China's position. Now, the four powers mentioned in newspapers refer to the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, and the term "five powers" is rarely used anymore; sometimes even seeing the phrase "the four powers and China," which is such a sad thing! In the middle of the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union suddenly objected to China's participation in the discussion of European affairs. Later, at the Paris Peace Conference, China was not listed as one of the invited countries; the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow also has no opportunity for China to participate. Although it is said that China cannot assume the important responsibility of discussing European peace because it did not actually fight against Germany, Italy, and other countries, is the underlying reason not because our internal disunity has reduced our voice in international politics? In recent years, the evolution of China's international status has been truly frightening. Now, analyzing the relationship between various countries and us, there is even more of a feeling of "the unjust have few supporters"! From the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, China has always received the sympathy and assistance of the United States. After the war, the issue of the Nationalists and Communists became unsolvable, and the United States volunteered to send General Marshall to China to mediate; after spending more than a year and trying various methods, it hoped that China could complete a unified and democratic country. In the end, we disappointed people. Following General Marshall's return to the United States, the U.S. mediation mission was declared over, and now it has announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. Although this cannot be said to be a change in the U.S. policy towards China, it seems to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude at present.

Britain, which enjoys significant interests in the Far East, also has a very weak relationship with us. Since the "September 18th Incident," Britain, because of its alliance with Japan, has taken a passive attitude towards our appeals in the League of Nations. Later, because the United States' Far East policy became increasingly tough, and Japan's territorial expansion showed signs of expanding from the mainland to Southeast Asia, Britain deepened its sympathy for China; however, actual assistance was relatively rare. It was not until the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War that China and Britain shared a common hatred of the enemy, and the alliance turned closer. However, due to the different geographical environments of China and Britain, they had different views on the strategy of which to defeat first, Germany or Japan; and because each was preoccupied with its own affairs, there was not much mutual assistance during the war. This was not due to the weakness of the Sino-British relationship, but due to the situation, and what could Britain do? After the war, Britain was troubled by European problems, and the handling of issues such as India and Palestine was also tricky, so it had the suffering of being too far away to help China. Unfortunately, recently, there has been a sudden occurrence of discussions about interfering in China in the parliament, which has given us a deep shock. The strange theory of Labour MP Lord Lindsay not only obliterated the friendship between China and Britain but also insulted our sovereignty. Lindsay's prejudice was due to immature observation and was refuted by the leaders of various parties, but it reminded us that we should promptly strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries. International friendship either advances or retreats, and the current stage of Sino-British relations seems not active enough.

With the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, China recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia and granted the Soviet Union special rights in Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian. The reason why we made such a major concession was that China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, and ensuring peace in East Asia after the war depended on close understanding between the two countries. But as things stand now, Dalian has still not been taken over; Chinese people cannot help but have doubts about the Soviet Union's sincerity. Some argue that the Soviet Union's coldness towards China is due to the overly close friendship between the United States and China and the unsatisfactory resolution of the Nationalist-Communist issue. The United States and the Soviet Union often have disputes over post-war issues, so they suspected the U.S. military presence in China and the mediation efforts, reflecting China's policy of being close to the United States and distant from the Soviet Union. In fact, China's pro-American stance is indeed a fact, but being pro-American does not necessarily mean distancing from the Soviet Union; on the contrary, we hope that both the United States and the Soviet Union are our friends, without any distinction. As for the participation of the Communist Party in the government, it is not something that the Nationalist Party can unilaterally demand; the relationship of friendship established by the Sino-Soviet Treaty has the obligation to maintain, regardless of which party is in power. Moreover, the previous estrangement of Sino-Soviet relations is too disappointing.

Both China and France suffered the painful experience of being ravaged by the enemies in the East and West during this war; they should have a common desire to help each other revive. After Vietnam was invaded, China did not avoid difficulties and sent troops to help, returning it to France after the war without making any extra demands. This friendship should be understood by the entire country. However, judging from past experiences in international conferences, France often remains silent on our reasonable proposals and rarely supports them, perhaps because they are concerned about their own position and find it difficult to take sides. However, the recent Paracel Islands incident surprised us. Many have discussed that the Paracel Islands originally belonged to our country; there is no need to elaborate. France actually disregarded the facts and claimed that they belonged to Vietnam; the dispute continues to this day, causing an unexpected blow to the traditional friendship between China and France, which is truly regrettable!

Analyzing the individual relations with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France from a general international perspective fully demonstrates the current distress of China's foreign relations. However, although we are distressed, we are not despondent. Our international status was earned through a long and bloody war, and it was not achieved by luck; nor will we allow anyone to squeeze or ridicule us at any moment because of temporary internal political disputes. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference is about to be held in Moscow, and we must warn the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France that since China is not participating in the conference, it should not discuss proposals directly or indirectly related to China. If there are any, China will definitely not be bound by them, and it will set a bad precedent for international relations, invisibly burying explosives that will destroy peace. We believe that the friendship between China and the United States is always sincere and unwavering. A strong China is a stabilizing force for peace in the Far East and even world peace. China is facing an economic crisis and undoubtedly hopes that the United States will lend money to help us revive. Britain and France have no fundamental conflict of interest with China, and we hope that they will all think from a long-term and broad perspective and strengthen the friendly relations that have always existed. China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and good-neighborly friendship should be a common hope. However, international friendship cannot be achieved unilaterally; we hope that everyone will take steps to implement the basic spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance.

Looking at history, the rise and fall of national power in various countries is wave-shaped, and it cycles in a circle of prosperity followed by decline, and decline followed by prosperity. China is currently experiencing many difficulties, but these difficulties can precisely invigorate the country; we can also test who are true friends from the difficult environment!

Finally, we must not forget the ancient saying that "a country must first be attacked by itself before others attack it." The current low tide of foreign relations is not due to the improper actions of the diplomatic authorities, but because our internal affairs are too disappointing. We hope that everyone will wake up and unite, remembering "brothers quarrel at home but unite against external threats," and rise up together to rescue our beloved motherland from the international low tide!

### Strict Prevention of Abuses in this Year's Conscription, Careful Preparation Underway, Commander Fu Zhengmo Speaks in Suzhou

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, along with staff members such as Chief of the Conscription Section Colonel Zhou Yuqun, arrived in Suzhou around 8:00 AM on the 12th. He first visited the Wu County Garrison District Headquarters for inspection. At 1:00 PM, he went to the Commissioner's Office to visit Commissioner Xu, where they discussed conscription issues. At 3:00 PM, he returned to the headquarters and summoned all officers for instruction. Around 6:00 PM, he met with our reporter and answered various inquiries. A brief account is as follows: The formal conscription for the 36th year (1947) is currently still in the preparation stage, which is divided into four stages: (1) background investigation, (2) exemption review, (3) physical examination, and (4) lottery distribution. This preparation work will be completed around May, and the exact date of conscription will be determined by the order of the Ministry of National Defense. During the past temporary conscription period, the phenomenon of unqualified men substituting for conscripts was not uncommon. The crux of the problem was the lack of preparation work. To fundamentally prevent this from happening, a plan is in place to affix a hard seal on the photos attached to the background investigation form to prevent abuses. If such abuses still occur, severe punishment will be imposed in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing Military Service. The implementation of this formal military service is not for conscripting soldiers for combat, but rather its purpose is to train them. Therefore, even if someone is the only son in a family, if there is no consistent proof from local political, military, or legal entities that they are responsible for supporting the family, they will not be exempted from conscription. The so-called exemption review only refers to disabled or studying citizens. However, if a family's sole heir who has completed their military service and been discharged is recalled for war, they will still be entitled to deferment. Regarding the conscription age, the legal age is 20, but if the quota is not met, young people aged 21 or 22 may be used to fill the quota. The selection method is as follows: if the number of people who pass the physical examination exceeds the quota, a lottery will be used to determine the order. The number of people conscripted is entirely based on the population of each area. The basic training of recruits is fully coordinated with the training of regular troops, and there will be no separate training. Regarding the term of service, it is two years for infantry and three years for special forces. The method of participation is based on the recruit's physical and knowledge level and their willingness to choose. Currently, in order to encourage conscripted youth, the central government has issued an order from the Ministry of Education that all discharged soldiers who wish to study in secondary schools or higher will be exempt from fees to show preferential treatment. Therefore, military service is an obligation to the country, but it is also an honor for oneself. The reporter then asked what the important points of the military service review meeting were. Fu said that because of time constraints, it was postponed to the 13th. The participants were the administrative commissioners, the county magistrates of Suzhou, Yushun, and Wu counties, the military section chiefs, public representatives, party members, etc. The focus of the review was on the shortcomings of the temporary conscription of the 35th year (1946), the central objectives of the conscription of the 36th year (1947), and any difficulties. It is learned that Fu will return to Shanghai via Songjiang on the 14th.

### Jiangsu Provincial Assembly Closes, Calls for Peace in Telegram

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly closed on the 12th and issued two telegrams calling for peace. The original text of the telegrams is as follows:

(1) To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government of Nanjing: During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, thanks to Your Excellency's persevering spirit, you led the national army and people in a united struggle, and finally won the final victory. We were looking forward to long-term peace and stability and moving towards the path of national reconstruction. Unfortunately, for more than a year, the domestic turmoil has not subsided, the people's livelihood has become increasingly dilapidated, the door to peace has been opened and closed from time to time, and the international status has been invisibly lowered. Until the CCP firmly refused to negotiate and the mediator quietly withdrew, the spreading flames of war became increasingly difficult to control. Looking forward to the future, our hearts are filled with worry. The members of this assembly, on behalf of the 36 million people of the province, request that Your Excellency continue to uphold the consistent sincerity in seeking peace and the initial intention of broad tolerance, and give the Communist Party another opportunity to reconsider. Appoint key personnel to quickly resume peace talks, cease fire on the spot, resolve political issues through political means, reorganize the government as soon as possible, and implement constitutional government, so as to save the country from peril and rescue the people from fire and water. The telegram expresses our urgent hope.

(2) To Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an: After the victory of the War of Resistance, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Unexpectedly, the internal conflict broke out again, the cause of national reconstruction was interrupted, and the war continued to spread, with the sound of killing shaking the sky and blood flowing in the fields. The countryside is bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, goods are blocked on the way, treasures are abandoned on the ground, people's livelihood is insecure, social order is chaotic, international status is declining, and the victorious reputation is gradually lost. The foundation of the country, which was shaken by the brutal Japanese, is about to be lost in internal strife. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but feel terrified! We, on behalf of the 36 million people of Jiangsu Province, implore you with tears: The most important thing for the country is unity, and the most urgent thing for national reconstruction is peace. Parties cannot be independent from the country, and doctrines cannot be pursued alone by force. If your party does not want to win the love of the people, then so be it. If you want to win the love of the people, now is the best opportunity! We believe that with your insight, you will be able to understand the people, pull back from the brink, return the army to the country, resolutely seek peace, move the battlefield to the negotiating table, and turn hostility into friendship, so that the country's lifeline will not be severed and constitutional government can be realized. The telegram is urgent, and we hope for a reply!

### Zhejiang Province Requests Allocation of Brick and Tile Making Machines

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 12th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) recently shipped eight brick and tile machines to China to revive China's construction. The number of units urgently requesting allocation from various provinces has reached more than thirty. It is heard that the Executive Yuan will allocate two units to the Communist-controlled areas. The Zhejiang sub-office has strongly protested this, because this type of machinery should be allocated based on the degree of housing destruction and application conditions in various places. The houses damaged in Zhejiang Province total more than 908,000 rooms, second only to Hunan in the country. In terms of application, Xiaoshan and Jiashan both have electricity, which is sufficient, and therefore should be allocated to Zhejiang, rather than to the Communist-controlled areas which have lighter losses and no power to operate the machines. Sun Zengzhang will go to Shanghai in the next few days to negotiate on this matter.

### Three Urgent Telegrams in One Day, Suzhou's Emergency Measures on Prices, Resuming Price Controls and Purchase Limits

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] The prices in this county have soared, and the rising trend has not yet been curbed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is extremely concerned and sent three urgent telegrams to the county government on the 12th, strictly ordering that prices be stabilized and lowered, especially for grain prices, admonishing them to use any means necessary to suppress prices and find ways to dredge the grain supply. In addition to deciding to convene relevant agencies on the 13th together with the city defense department to discuss concrete measures, the county social affairs department formulated three emergency measures: (1) immediately restore price controls and stipulate the amount of purchases allowed per person, (2) prevent incitement, and (3) labor-management disputes must not be used as an excuse to promote unrest. The General Labor Union here also urgently telegraphed the provincial social affairs department for instructions, while also advising workers to be patient and wait for relief in order to fight the labor unrest.

### A Lustful Monk Expelled, Suspected of Murder, Clues Seem to Point to a Killing

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] There is a temple called Jue'an on Junshan Mountain outside the north of Jiangyin, presided over by a monk named Jinghua. Because he did not abide by the monastic rules and was fond of women, the local gentry gathered last winter and decided that his disciple Daocheng would take over the temple. Jinghua suddenly disappeared, and his disciple suspected that he had gone to Shanghai. On the morning of the 10th, Jinghua's body was suddenly found in the pool in front of the temple. After someone reported it to the police station and the town office, they sent people to investigate. The monk's neck was tied with a lamp cord, his upper body was bound with hemp rope, and large stones were tied to his feet. It was determined that he had been murdered and sunk into the pool. When the monks in the temple were questioned, they all said that they did not know the cause of death. Later, the police station found clues and interrogated Chen Xiuying, who had an affair with the deceased, and Wang Jinlong, who ran a platform. Because Chen Xiuying had another lover who was the captain of the special service team of the naval training team and had gone to Guangzhou, Jinghua had a love rivalry with him, which was very related. The police station sent the suspects to the police station for judicial investigation and decided to conduct an inspection on the 11th.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Vigorously Promote Spring Plowing, County Magistrates Should Personally Go to Various Townships to Take Charge of Supervision

### Execution of Jaru Haruki

Families of Victims in Bensho Request Execution in Taicang

[Our Taicang Dispatch] Jaru Haruki, the main culprit in the Jiangnan Massacre, has been sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal. Ouyang Yunfang, the wife of Wang Xueliang, a local resident and a victim's family member, and fifteen others specifically submitted a petition to the county authorities, stating in brief: "The main culprit of the Jiangnan Massacre, Jaru Haruki, was sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal on January 6 and is awaiting execution. However, the whereabouts of the victims are still unknown and they cannot be returned to their bones, which is regrettable. The family members are heartbroken and can only petition Your Honor to unite with various associations and request the Shanghai Military Tribunal to escort him to Taicang for execution. On one hand, before the execution, we hope to induce him to confess the dates and locations of the victims so that their bones can be returned. On the other hand, executing him in Taicang can greatly satisfy the people."

Once the bureau formally approves it, it can be transferred.

### The Evil Habit of Forcibly Pushing Carts Across Bridges

Here, I, the writer, will point out something related to the general public that must be reformed: I am a woman, and whenever I sit alone in a rickshaw crossing the bridges over the Suzhou River, I initially get off and walk a few steps, then get back on in the middle of the bridge. However, every time I refuse the services of these small-time vagrants to push the cart, I am subjected to an unwarranted form of insult. Sometimes they even curse and yell: "Damn it, if you don't let us push, it's too much effort, unbearable..." After that, to avoid such insults, I had to let them push. But even when I give them one or two hundred yuan, they still grumble. If a man were sitting in the cart with me, then this trouble wouldn't happen. Once, I saw with my own eyes a foreign woman sitting alone in a rickshaw, with two pushers holding onto her cart, walking and laughing (though not actually pushing). When they reached the middle of the bridge, both of them demanded money from the foreign woman. She naturally refused to pay double, so the two pushers, one in front blocking the cart and one behind pulling it, stubbornly refused to let the cart go. The foreign woman was so anxious she was about to cry, while the rickshaw driver stood next to the cart without saying a word, and everyone else just went their own way. Because I am a woman myself, I couldn't help, so I had to leave. Yesterday, I encountered something even more intolerable. On the afternoon of February 4th, at 3:30 PM, I was riding in a rickshaw from south to north across Sichuan Road. One pusher insisted on pushing my cart, and I couldn't stop him. When we reached the middle of the bridge, I gave him two hundred yuan. He said, "What's the use of two hundred yuan? Others give fifteen hundred!" I said, "There's no such rule!" He immediately threw the two hundred yuan bill in my face, then ran to the back of the cart. As soon as he let go, the cart started rolling downhill. In that instant, the pusher suddenly yanked my hat and hair with force. Because my hat was double-knotted, it didn't come off completely but was just pulled down, hanging around my neck, but he tore out a handful of hair, causing extreme pain. At that moment, I intended to get out of the cart and grab him, but I didn't see any police officers. I knew that the traffic officers wouldn't leave their posts to catch him. If I chased after him myself, I was afraid I would suffer even more unbearable humiliation, so I endured the pain and went home. I think that this group of raggedly dressed people gathering in the major thoroughfares of the world metropolis—Shanghai—is not only an eyesore and obstructs traffic, but I urge the municipal authorities to resolutely ban them. If the authorities think that banning them is difficult, then extortion and even insults against women must be strictly prohibited. (Meng Xiuzhen)

### Wartime Art and Archaeological Discovery: The Tang and Song Stone Carvings in Dazu County are of Immeasurable Value; Government Orders Increased Protection

[Chengdu News] The Tang and Song stone carvings in the deep mountains of Dazu County, Sichuan Province, have been hidden for a thousand years, unknown to anyone. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, after Professor Yang Jialuo, the director of the Chinese Classics Library, discovered them, the library organized a national expedition to Dazu stone carvings. Those invited to participate included Ma Heng, He Sui, Gu Yun'gang, Zhuang Yan, Fu Zhenlun, Zhu Jinjiang, and fifteen others. They surveyed and created detailed maps, identified the ages, assigned grotto codes, counted the number of statues, and took rubbings and photographs. The carvings are divided into seven areas: Longgang, Baoxiang, Guanghua, Shucheng, Shimen, Miaogao, and Chengzhuan, containing approximately 20,000 statues. One area extends for about a mile, with continuous carvings. The artistry and scale are unparalleled except for Yungang and Longmen. This is truly a major discovery in art and archaeology during the war. After the discovery, scholars from Britain, the United States, and France visited to see them. The Ministry of Education's China Educational Film Studio also sent film technicians with the expedition to shoot a film called "Dazu Stone Carvings." Recently, Li Shizeng, the chairman of the Chinese Classics Library, sent Professor Yang Jialuo's report, containing over ten thousand words, to relevant authorities, requesting them to quickly seek ways to protect and promote the carvings. The Ministry of the Interior has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to handle the matter, and the Sichuan Provincial Government has ordered the county magistrate and the speaker of the county council of Dazu County to jointly establish a preservation association with the elders of the county to protect them.

### Gambling Ring Busted in Dangtu

[Our Correspondent in Dangtu] Since the Spring Festival, gambling has become increasingly rampant in this county. On the evening of the 7th of this month, many gamblers gathered in Tang's residence in Hejia Lane, engaging in large-scale gambling. There was one table each for "pai gow," "single and double points," and "dice stalls," with significant sums of money changing hands. Several gas lamps were hung, as bright as day. Upon receiving a report, the police station dispatched a large number of officers at around midnight on the same day to arrest the gamblers. Sixteen gamblers, including Yang Qing, were arrested on the spot and taken to the station. After interrogation, they were severely punished and fined according to the law for committing crimes against the police.

### Theft at Jiaxing Cinema Involving an Affair

[Our Correspondent in Pinghu] A projector and a film were stolen from the Guangming Cinema in Jiaxing. The main suspect has been apprehended in room number nine of the Ying'an Inn in this county. The thief, named Shi Liansheng, confessed that it was because a projectionist at the cinema had an affair with his wife and enticed her to run away, with no news of her whereabouts. Furthermore, the projectionist sowed discord, leading to Shi's dismissal. Therefore, he held a grudge and committed the theft by digging open the door of the projection room. The name of the film is "Ice Tree Silver Flower." On the 9th, the criminal and the stolen goods were escorted back to the county by the He Criminal Police Team and handed over to the police station to be sent to the court for trial.

The road surface was severely damaged along the way, making it rough and difficult to travel. When the car reached Majiagang Town, it could not proceed because the bridge was damaged. The group then walked to the Meijia Bridge before turning back. The bridge was particularly severely damaged and was originally a very large-scale construction project on the Mingguang-Dingyuan highway.

### Wounded Soldiers Attempted Rape, Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately

The owner of the Wu Palace Inn reported the incident, and the police station arrested the three wounded soldiers and sent them to the Tenth District Security Command for interrogation. They have been sentenced according to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. Zhou Baoshan was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Tan Shulin and Xu Xiaojin were each sentenced to six years of imprisonment.

### U.S. State Department and Military Advocate Universal Military Training to Strengthen National Defense; Marshall to Attend Foreign Relations Committee to Argue for It; Joint Committee of Both Houses Discussing New Budget

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th (Broadcast): U.S. Army leaders held a secret meeting today and decided to reduce the regular army to 875,000 men, but Congress must pass the universal military training bill. The current Army plan is to reach 1,070,000 men by July 1st.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently announced that Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to attend a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 14th of this month to discuss a topic that cannot be announced.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Marshall will attend a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow to report on the importance of soldier quality for national defense. Marshall and the Army and Navy Departments believe that the U.S. national defense is extremely weak, so universal military training is essential for the country, but Congress has resolutely opposed it and may even refuse to consider this year's military training plan at all.

President Truman strongly advocates the speedy implementation of the military training plan, believing that an army backed by well-trained citizens can be deployed to war on short notice, which is the least costly plan for national defense security. Marshall himself, while serving as Chief of Staff, repeatedly stated that the United States must be prepared in peacetime, including universal military training.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The U.S. Congressional Joint Budget Committee today reduced the $37.5 billion budget for the 1948 fiscal year proposed by Truman by $6 billion. The committee's proposal must still be submitted to the full committee of 102 members for a final decision. The committee reduced Truman's estimated $11.2 billion military budget by $1.75 billion, which was criticized by Congressman Gnaegi, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, who considered this to endanger national security.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman's proposed budget of approximately $37.5 billion for this year was voted down by $6 billion today by the budget committees of both houses. Whether such budget cuts would harm national defense caused fierce debate before the vote. The budget reduction prompted an urgent protest from Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, who opposed cutting military spending. It is said that Eisenhower believes that if military spending is reduced, it will greatly impact the national defense plan, such as closing some military camps and stopping large-scale activities of the Army Corps of Engineers.

### Discussion of German Peace Treaty Procedures: Soviet Representative Changes Position, Hints at Allowing Small Countries to State Opinions; U.S. and Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate on Austrian Issue

[Associated Press, London, 11th] Soviet Representative Gusev recently hinted that the Soviet Union will abandon its completely opposed strategy regarding the participation of small countries in the German peace talks and informed the representatives of the foreign ministers of various countries that he will propose a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers within days to conduct consultations. The committee, under the order of the foreign ministers of various countries, will maintain frequent contact with the governments of small allied countries and serve as a liaison organization for conveying the resolutions of the great powers and the treaty proposals of the allied countries. Since Gusev has always firmly rejected the right of small countries to speak, today's statement is likely the first move to allow small countries to express their opinions.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] At this morning's meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the draft peace treaty with Austria, chaired by British representative Hoot and attended by U.S. representative General Clark, the former commander of U.S. forces in Austria, and Soviet representative Gusev, a verbal dispute arose over the issue of eliminating German forces in Austria. First, General Clark opposed inserting a clause into the Austrian peace treaty stipulating that the Austrian government must provide a promise to prohibit all Pan-German propaganda in Austria. General Clark declared that we should impose certain obligations on the Austrian government to prevent it from merging with Germany economically or politically, and I deeply agree with this. However, I believe that the suggestion made by the Soviet Union may lead to interference in Austria's internal affairs. At this point, Soviet representative Gusev immediately stood up and strongly protested against this accusation. General Clark then compared the great freedom enjoyed by the American people with the small freedom allowed to their people by the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Gusev immediately stood up and stated that the four foreign ministers should maintain a faithful attitude towards each other's countries when discussing various issues. Chairman Hoot, seeing that the debate between the U.S. and Soviet representatives was quite heated, stood up and declared that the two representatives had gone too far and proposed that the Austrian issue be temporarily postponed for discussion in order to calm the situation. Finally, the meeting of the four foreign ministers decided to listen to the opinions of the representatives of Yugoslavia and Austria on the 14th of this month. At that time, the representatives of the two countries will clarify their opinions on Austria and answer questions from the British representative. The Austrian border issue is scheduled to be discussed on the 15th.

### Rumors of the Italian Fleet Being Intentionally Sunk

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 12th] Rome newspapers today published alarming news that a portion of the Italian fleet designated for transfer to the Allied countries will be sunk. The fleet is currently concentrated in Taranto. This rumor has not yet been confirmed.

### Palestine Conference Declared a Complete Failure

[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast): The British-Arab Palestine talks have completely failed.

[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast): British officials revealed that after spokespersons from both the Arab and Jewish sides rejected the latest British proposal to resolve the Palestine dispute, the British government may consider submitting the entire Palestine issue to the United Nations for handling.

### Five Countries Express Discontent After European Peace Treaty is Signed; Italian Foreign Minister Sends Letter to Allied Governments, Declaring Reservation of the Right to Amend the Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Five signatory countries to the peace treaty today submitted letters of complaint regarding the terms of the treaty to French Foreign Minister Bidault, requesting that they be conveyed to all signatory countries. Three of these countries are former Axis satellite states, namely Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and the other two are Allied countries, namely Greece and Yugoslavia. The protests of the three countries, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, are largely consistent, particularly objecting to the economic provisions of the treaty. Hungary is also advocating for the Hungarian minority in the Czech Republic. Bulgaria stated that Bulgaria's participation in the Allied side in September 1944 has not been recognized, which is regrettable. At the same time, Bulgaria has not obtained the right to access the Aegean Sea. Although Bulgaria's reparations have been reduced from $115 million to $70 million, it still feels overburdened because Bulgaria has fallen into extreme poverty under Nazi occupation. Romania insists that the country will comply with the terms of the treaty, but hopes to negotiate directly with various countries to improve these conditions in order to avoid being overwhelmed. Yugoslavia is dissatisfied with the solution to the Trieste issue, saying that Yugoslavia does not want to give up its claims to Venice Giulia and Gorizia. Greece said that although the Bulgarian border has been expanded, the Greek border has not been approved. The current Greek border cannot ensure security and feels threatened by the 55,000 standing army of Bulgaria allowed under the treaty. Observers here point out that the peace treaty has been met with a series of objections and discontent, not only from former enemy countries but also from Allied countries. It is clear that the Security Council will be filled with issues concerning the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean in the future.

[Reuters, Rome, 11th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza sent a letter to the Allied governments yesterday, stating that the Italian people acted under the oppression of a certain regime in the past. The Italian government did not participate in the discussions of this peace treaty. At the time of signing, we sincerely wish to prove the Italian government's willingness to boldly face the facts of tragedy and assistance to the establishment of the world's concrete peace. The first responsibility of the Italian government is to be absolutely loyal to the governments and peoples of all signatory countries because the treaty must rely on the moral support of the signatories to be implemented. The Italian people were the first nation to break away from the Axis and seek liberation on their own. Later, during the war, they provided direct or indirect benefits to the Allied countries, but reasonable consideration was not given to these merits. Although we acknowledge the various mistakes of the past, the Italian people have tried their best to atone for their actions until the time of signing. Today, as the Italian people and world citizens, we earnestly hope that there will be an opportunity to amend the shackles that are enough to poison the lives of 45 million people.

### Disarmament Issue Remains Deadlocked; U.S. and Soviet Representatives Engage in Verbal Battle with No Results

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th (Broadcast): In today's Security Council meeting, France and Britain fully supported the U.S. military reduction proposal, forming a united front to deal with the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] The issue of the disarmament procedure has been returned to the Security Council for handling. U.S. and Soviet representatives attacked each other again today, with neither side willing to budge. Austin and Gromyko both detailed their respective countries' positions to the Security Council, but neither made any suggestions on how to break the deadlock. The United States insists that all "weapons of mass destruction" should be handled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and all "conventional" weapons should be handled by the Disarmament Commission. The Soviet Union insists that the tasks of the two committees should not be separated. In a half-hour speech, Gromyko accused the United States of deliberately deviating from the main goal of disarmament and causing "procrastination" with its proposal. Austin said that the Soviet Union's rejection of the U.S. plan prevents the control of atomic energy from starting and strongly stated that the continued delay of the disarmament conference will "increase the risk of war." Gromyko concluded, "The United States wants to divide the tasks of the Atomic Energy Commission and the General Disarmament Commission, obviously wanting to shift our main goal to a purely organizational issue. Is this tactic useful?" The Security Council is scheduled to continue debating the conference procedure issue next Wednesday morning.

### Minimal Hope for a Successful Japanese Coalition Cabinet; Diet to Reconvene on the 14th

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 12th] Japan's political situation remains extremely chaotic today, with little prospect of clarification in the coming days. The main figures in the third coalition effort, Finance Minister Ishibashi, Welfare Minister Kawai, and Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio and Central Committee member Mizutani, will hold talks this evening to discuss the formation of a coalition cabinet. Prime Minister Yoshida, mindful of the previous two failures, is taking a cautious approach to the coalition issue. He will not announce the government's position until the conditions are ripe. Therefore, it has been decided that the Diet will reconvene on the scheduled 14th. He also intends to quickly decide on the Minister of Agriculture and the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Today, he asked State Minister Shidehara to nominate a Minister of Agriculture from the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party, which initially actively promoted the coalition cabinet, is now wavering between coalition efforts and a new party movement. The Liberal Party has consistently taken a negative attitude towards the coalition effort. The Socialist Party believes that if the government and the Liberal Party maintain a negative attitude, the coalition effort will have little hope of success. With the date of the Diet's reconvening fast approaching, if a coalition cabinet is not formed, the Yoshida cabinet will have no choice but to force its weak body into the Diet. Finance Minister Ishibashi stated after meeting with Yoshida and Shidehara today: "To obtain aid from the United Nations, domestic political struggles must cease. A coalition cabinet may be formed. The terms of the coalition have also been largely communicated to the Socialist Party, but the Finance Minister must remain in office."

From the second day onwards, storms may arise over issues such as the election of the chairman, the National Salvation Democratic League, and compulsory grain requisition.

### Churchill's Daughter's Wedding Highlights: A Wonderful Interlude Amidst Britain's Energy-Saving Measures

[Agence France-Presse London, 12th] The wedding of Miss Mary Churchill yesterday was a major event in London in recent years. The area outside St. Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, was packed with people, making it extremely difficult for the bride and Churchill to make their way through the crowd. Most of the wedding took place in darkness, as it coincided with a power outage in the afternoon, which was unavoidable. However, as a special consideration, the authorities restored the power as the wedding was coming to an end, so the organ played the "Wedding March" as the newlyweds emerged from the church. The groom is Captain Soames, the dashing military attaché at the British Embassy in France. The bride was her father's private secretary, and is both talented and beautiful. As the wedding took place, the bell of the London clock tower chimed three times. As the bride emerged from the church, her face was radiant, and Churchill looked even more energetic. Lady Churchill also looked pleased. Churchill is widely admired outside of the political arena, so the crowd cheered incessantly, and some even broke through the police cordon to catch a glimpse of the old man. After the wedding, a reception was held at the Dorchester Hotel, with guests filling the seats, which was contrary to what the bride had originally hoped for. Miss Churchill had previously expressed a desire to simply entertain guests in a country villa. The newlyweds had originally planned to travel to Switzerland for their honeymoon, but due to transportation difficulties, they changed their plans and will depart tomorrow.

### Micronesia: A Key Military Location in the Pacific (Part 1) - Our Newspaper's Research Department

In the vast and expansive Pacific Ocean, numerous islands, both large and small, are scattered throughout. Three groups of small islands within Micronesia—the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands—require a redefinition of their governance. This is a crucial issue in the peace treaty with Japan and is greatly related to the future security of the Pacific.

Underground Situation Overview

The three groups of small islands within the Micronesia area consist of over six hundred islands and one thousand four hundred reef islands, stretching thirteen hundred nautical miles from north to south and over two thousand seven hundred nautical miles from east to west, naturally forming a maritime Great Wall. The Mariana Islands are located in the far north, the Caroline Islands are in the southwest, and the Marshall Islands are slightly to the southeast, forming a tiered shape. Although they only have a total area of over two thousand square kilometers, their importance in the Pacific Ocean cannot be underestimated.

These three island groups are mostly composed of volcanic islands, coral islands, or coral reefs, and they are very small. The largest is Ponape Island in the Caroline Islands, covering three hundred and seventy-six square kilometers. Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands has the best economic conditions, with an area of one hundred and eighty-four square kilometers. The islands are all located in the tropics, with an average temperature of eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit and abundant rainfall. In terms of geographical environment, they are quite suitable for cultivation, but the area is too small, there is a lack of alluvial soil, and water sources are scarce, which greatly reduces their economic value. After the First World War, the Japanese gained control of them and devoted themselves to their development, exporting sugar, alcohol, phosphate, dried coconut, and dried fish in considerable quantities. The military value of the Micronesian Islands far exceeds their economic value. Taking Guam as the center (Guam can be said to be one of the Mariana Islands, but it is under American control, so it is not included in the scope of this article), Tokyo to the north, Wake Island to the east, and the Philippines to the west are all over one thousand five hundred nautical miles away, and Australia to the south is only over two thousand nautical miles away. They are located between the three continents of Asia, America, and Australia, along the major shipping routes of the world, serving as a bridge between the three continents. However, they can also cut off traffic between the three continents. In the past, when under Japanese rule, they were used as an outpost for invading Southeast Asia, allowing them to attack Australia and the Dutch East Indies, block the main route between America and the Philippines, and defend their homeland. As the focus of international conflict shifted to the Pacific, all countries recognized these three island groups as strategic strongholds. Whoever fails to gain control of them will be threatened.

### Mayor Convenes Emergency Meeting of All Industries to Work Together to Overcome Difficulties, Resist Mad Price Hikes, Orders Police Bureau to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Sale of Rice and Sugar to Suburbs; Overall Financial Policy to Be Resolved in Short Term

[Reported by Our Newspaper] With gold notes soaring in recent days, affecting soaring prices, Mayor Wu, concerned about the people's livelihood, specially convened an emergency meeting of the industry associations related to daily necessities yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss ways to curb the price hikes. Attending were the Mayor, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Li Jianhua, Director Gu Bingyuan, Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council Xu, Jin Qixian of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Gao Jieshen, Luo Qinghua, Li Rentzai of the Bankers Association, Wu Yunfu of the Industrial Association, Wan Molin of the Rice Merchants Association, Jiufeng of the Cotton Cloth Merchants Association, Zhang Chao of the Rapeseed Oil Association, and representatives from over a hundred units in the money exchange, pastry, hot water, pig, fresh meat, north-south goods, tofu, fresh fish, vegetable, rice trading, local goods, oil factory, machinery coal, sugar, and seafood industries.

Mayor Urges Not to Fuel the Flames

The Mayor stated first: "The main purpose of convening this meeting is to hope that daily necessities will not follow the soaring of gold notes and fuel the flames, creating an intolerable situation. This time, prices have risen along with gold, and gold has risen along with US dollars. The reason for the rise in US dollars is that money exchanges refuse to accept old US banknotes and demand new US banknotes. Recently, they have even restricted the acceptance of new US banknotes with serial numbers, causing the US dollar to skyrocket and affecting prices. Now, the first thing that needs to be demanded of money exchanges is to order them not to differentiate between old and new US banknotes when buying and selling US dollars, and to cancel the 'serial number' requirement. If similar situations occur again, the municipal government will arrest those responsible. The rampant black market for rice is especially unreasonable. The municipal government now distributes 10,000 piculs of Saigon rice every day, which is enough for the daily consumption of Shanghai citizens, but rice merchants are still refusing to sell and hoarding rice. Yesterday, the municipal government discovered a rice merchant hoarding 500 piculs of rice and had him arrested by the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command. In the future, we will strictly prohibit the transportation and sale of rice to the suburbs. We have now ordered the police bureau to pay close attention at all times. If any violations are found, in addition to confiscating the rice, severe penalties will be imposed without leniency. As for the slow delivery of rice distributed by the municipal government, I can improve on that. There are currently 200 rice boats in the Suzhou River that are refusing to sell, but I believe they will not be able to get away if they insist on not selling."

"In short, I hope that all industry associations will assist the government and work together to overcome the difficulties. The central authorities will have a solution for the overall financial policy in the shortest possible time." The Mayor said at this point, repeatedly saying: "Everyone, please help. Otherwise, if I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too uninteresting!" Finally, the Mayor also hoped that everyone would not have their minds full of gold. If everyone compares everything to gold, then nothing will be easy to handle.

Showing Conscience, Pork Prices Have Not Increased

Afterwards, the Mayor asked about the difficulties of each industry, such as flour, edible oil, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, sugar, and pork, and refuted the inappropriateness of their price increases, and called on the industry associations to show conscience. At yesterday's meeting, only the fresh meat industry was in the limelight. The representative of the Fresh Meat Industry Association said: "While others are raising prices, we are the only ones lowering prices. Yesterday, pork fell to 4,400 yuan!" The Mayor, upon hearing this, quickly clasped his hands and said: "Enthusiastic about public welfare, excellent! Excellent!" The entire room responded with enthusiastic applause.

If the Government Collapses, the World Will Be in Great Chaos

Xu Jiying then stated that in the current unprecedentedly chaotic and panic-stricken situation, the government must control daily necessities, implement rationing, and encourage citizens to report those who hoard goods for speculation and raise prices as much as possible.

Luo Qinghua then expressed extreme indignation at the current situation in Shanghai, saying that the current price hike has exceeded all possible rationality and can only be described as madness! He said: "Although gold and US dollars have risen sharply, the exchange rate has not changed, so there should never have been this bad result. All industry associations must not forget the tragic situation when they asked the government for relief last year. If you willingly allow yourselves to be swept into the price hike by gold, you will be heading for decline. Ask yourselves, in today's Shanghai, who still has purchasing power? With interest rates so high, which company still has the ability to hoard goods? If all industries do not wake up, and prices increase by two times in three days, then in two weeks, the economy will collapse, the government will collapse, and the world will be in great chaos? And where will we be?"

To Suppress Prices, We Must Control Materials

Luo also asked the Mayor to convey to the government and urge the government to quickly decide on emergency measures and establish a gold policy. Luo believed that the government only had two options: (1) Sell generously. No matter how much you want, I will ration it, and in three days, the price of gold will immediately be suppressed. If the government is really suffering from inflation, then it should immediately restore the situation before June 4, 1945, when gold was not allowed to be bought or sold at all. At that time, no one would have thought that even soybean sprouts would follow the price of gold. Therefore, if the government gradually nationalizes gold, everything can be put back on track. (2) Close the gold market, so that gold cannot circulate freely, and its price will undoubtedly fall.

Luo finally expressed great emotion about the current situation in China, saying that after the excessive emphasis on freedom and democracy, the economic situation is very pessimistic. In fact, in this turbulent situation, everything can be bought by the government and then rationed according to rules. There is no need to be afraid of wearing the fascist hat. He also said: "Meetings are useless for suppressing prices. Today, to suppress prices, we must control materials!"

### Wu Yunfu, Not Afraid of Criticism, Advocates No Price Increase Movement

Recently, prices have been rising in a straight line. Wu Yunfu of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory has initiated and advocated a "No Price Increase" movement, calling on the city's industrial and commercial sectors to respond, believing that with the nest overturned, no egg will be left intact, and demanding that they work together to save the current crisis. During the war, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate's production was low, and it was one of the targets of hoarders. Recently, it has been able to produce about 20 million yuan worth of products per day. Wu has decided to continue to supply city users at the usual production volume and price. The factory's starch products will also continue to be supplied to direct users as much as possible without increasing the price. However, although Wu is making painstaking efforts and sacrificing himself, whether there will be anyone to follow him, or whether there will still be scalpers snapping up goods at that time, will depend on whether Shanghai merchants still have a conscience.

### Meeting of the Council's Health Committee

Contagious Disease Hospital Should Not Be Moved Far

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Municipal Second Contagious Disease Hospital had previously petitioned the Council because the authorities were planning to move it to Baziqiao, which would be inconvenient due to the long distance and transportation. The Council's Health Committee held a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Zhao Junhao, Chen Cunren, Wu Zhenghuo, and others.

It was resolved to submit it to the Council for discussion.

### Full Account of Gold Sales to Be Thoroughly Investigated by H.H. Kung

After the surge in gold prices, there has been much discussion, and some have used this to attack H.H. Kung. Yesterday, at the standing council meeting of the Central Bank, Kung, in his capacity as a standing director, specially proposed that a thorough investigation be conducted into the accounts of the entire gold sales case and the names of the purchasing firms in order to clarify the situation. The original proposal stated: "The sale of gold by this bank was originally intended to regulate finance, control currency, stabilize prices, and stabilize the market. Over the years, it has been quite effective. Recently, rumors have spread, gold prices have fluctuated sharply, and people are panicking, which has had a significant impact on society. The cause is that traitors spread rumors to speculate. In recent days, small newspapers have been clamoring, becoming more and more intense. Discussions in the streets and alleys point to the fact that the gold previously sold by this bank was all purchased by speculators, implying that the heads of this bank colluded in the process and had ulterior motives, and even involving individuals, trying to disrupt the political situation. The impact extends to personal reputation, which is a minor matter, but the government's credibility is a major concern, and rising prices and social stability are even more concerning. It is requested that the Operations Department, together with the Audit and Accounting Departments, conduct a thorough investigation of the accounts of the entire gold sales case and the names of the purchasing firms, and submit them for publication in order to clarify the situation and maintain the credibility of the national bank. As for the part involving Kung personally, I am certain that I have never purchased any, and neither have the relevant departments. However, fearing that traitors may borrow my name, I request that this be thoroughly investigated to clarify the truth." It is reported that the case has been passed by the Central Bank's council.

### Industrial Association Submits Five Opinions, Requests Reduction and Exemption of Profit Tax

The Shanghai Industrial Association, in view of the many difficulties faced by the city's industry, which cannot bear the heavy tax burden, recently convened the ninth joint meeting of the first session of directors and supervisors and resolved to submit five opinions on the profit tax for the 35th year of the Republic. The content of the opinions is as follows: (1) Request the cancellation of the special excessive profit tax. (2) The amount of capital should be calculated according to the price index published by the authorities at the end of the tax year. (3) The starting point for taxation should be raised according to the price index. (4) Request the government to apply the measures for adjusting the value of fixed assets in the revaluation of industrial and mining enterprises to the production value of the 35th year of the Republic.

During the exemption period, shareholders and employees shall not distribute official dividends, so as to restore production capacity. These five opinions have been submitted to the government by the association yesterday, requesting their adoption in order to reduce the burden and revive the difficulties of industry.

### Renewed Hearing of the Grain Loan Case: Grain Merchants Claim Ignorance of Review and Payment Fees; Ren Xingyai Claims to Have Submitted Important Confidential Report

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in the Grain Loan Case, the Criminal Court of the District Court initially opened the trial on December 18th of last year. Yesterday morning at 9:30, the collegiate bench reopened the trial. The four defendants released on bail, Wan Molin, Yang Runyu, and Ren Xingyai, all reported on time. The defendants in custody, Wang Daren, Wu Rongsheng, Wang Xunzhi, and Zhuang Hanzhang, were also brought in. Twelve rice merchants who had received grain loans, Zhu Yongming, Gu Mengsheng, Feng Yongsheng, Wang Yuzhen, Yu Liangji, Zhang Chao, Lu Lin, Chuan Changyu, Zhu Shilu, Xu Qinyuan, Xing Songwen, and Shao Jigao, were summoned to court to testify, with the exception of Shao Jigao. The eleven defense lawyers for the defendants, including Wu Zhengzhang, Yu Ting, and Wang Shanxiang, also appeared in court in full. Although the courtroom was very crowded, the order was well maintained. After Judge Wu Xiangzu, along with associate judges Wu Ronglin and Huang Guangyu, and Prosecutor Wu Qihua took their seats, the eight defendants were summoned. After questioning their ages and native places, they stated: The first interrogation in this case has exceeded the legal time limit of fifteen days, and a renewed hearing should be conducted according to law. The prosecutor initiated the prosecution speech, stating briefly that the main points of the indictment have already been described and will not be repeated, but stated: If it is intended to change the prosecution bill, please the judge to handle it carefully. The judge then began to question each defendant individually in order.

The first defendant, Wang Xunzhi, testified: He was the Deputy General Manager of the Changjiang Company. The application for the grain loan was introduced by Wan Molin. The entire loan was received on April 15th and repaid on May 15th, totaling 60 million yuan with a 3% interest rate. No review fee was paid in advance, nor was any remuneration paid afterward. The second defendant, Zhuang Hanzhang, testified: He only held a position as an employee in the Changjiang Company, and everything had to be done according to orders. He had no authority to advise on the purchase of rice grains or how to sell them. He had no knowledge of whether any review fees were paid.

**Wang Daren Notified to Stop Selling Public Rice**

The third defendant, Wu Rongsheng, was the manager of San Tai Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Store. In addition to handling grain loans, he also sold public rice on behalf of the Grain Administration Office. Originally, it was planned to sell 30,000 shi (a unit of dry measure), and an agreement was made with the Grain Administration Office to sell 5,000 bags per period of ten days. However, after selling 4,530 bags in the period from May 15th to May 25th, Wang Daren ordered the sales to be stopped. However, he stated: This order to stop sales was not given in writing, but only verbally by Wang Daren. The fourth defendant, Wan Molin, 46 years old, a local resident, is currently the Chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association. He did not appear in court at the last hearing because he was attending the National Assembly in Beijing. It is said that Wan Changxin and Wan Changjun were both founded by him, and Yang Runyu is the manager of both places. A total of 415 shi of grain loan rice was handled, and for the sake of convenience, it was all sold to Wan Changhao by Wan Changxin for distribution. He had not heard of any corrupt practices in the grain loan. The fifth defendant, Xing Zhigang, is the manager of Shun Feng Company. He stated: When he applied for the loan, it was already at its limit. Later, Wan Molin agreed to transfer the loan under the name of Wan Changxin to him for handling. He knew nothing else. The sixth defendant, Yang Runhui, stated that he was the manager of Wan Changxin and that the grain loan funds were transferred from Wan Molin to Xing Zhigang. The reason for the transfer was unknown. He also stated that there are three institutions with the Wan brand: Wan Chang Factory specializes in rice milling, Wan Changxin specializes in wholesale, and Wan Changhao sells retail. The three places have their own separate accounts, and their economies are also independent.

**Only Official Interest of 3% Was Charged, No Other Fees Collected**

The seventh defendant, Wang Daren, stated: The grain loan was organized in response to local requests and approved by the government. Because the Grain Administration Office had not been established for long, it lacked reference materials on various grain companies and had difficulty reviewing them. Therefore, the initial trial implementation adopted a recommendation method. In addition to the official interest of 3%, no other fees were charged for the grain loan. The court asked about the fact that it was originally planned to sell 30,000 shi of public rice, but only 5,000 shi were sold before it was stopped. Wang replied that the then Minister of Grain, Xu, said that military grain was in short supply and could not be sold in its entirety. Later, because the rice sold was brown rice, which did not meet the needs of the city, the sales were stopped after receiving orders from Minister Xu. At this point, the court took out a letter from Minister Xu to the Garrison Headquarters for the defendant to read, which stated that the Ministry did not know about the stopping of sales after selling 5,000 shi, and the Grain Administration had not reported it either. Wang still pleaded that it was due to the need for military grain at the time.

The eighth defendant, Ren Xingyai, stated: None of the seventeen grain loan merchants were introduced by him, and he resigned on May 8th. At that time, the grain loan had not yet ended. He had no corruption whatsoever. If the court finds evidence of corruption, he can be shot immediately. He also stated that the reports at the time that he was Ren Yuandao's nephew and that he had fled in fear of punishment were all baseless rumors, and he was very angry about them. Therefore, he submitted a long confidential letter to Minister Xu in Beijing, in which the accusations were all true. At this point, the court nodded in agreement and ordered him to leave.

**Further Hearing Postponed Due to Unarrived Witnesses**

Subsequently, the people summoned, all claimed to be unaware of the "review fee" and had never paid it. Except for three families introduced by Li Chongnian, the rest were introduced by the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce. The judge immediately announced: Because witness Shao Jigao Zhu has not yet arrived, the case will be re-tried at a later date. The defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren are remanded in custody. The defendants Wan Molin, Yang Runyu, Xing Zhigang, and Ren Xingyai remain on their original bail. The applications for bail for the four defendants in custody were all rejected, and the rest were dismissed.

### Ministry of Communications Guarantees Aircraft Personnel; No Criminal Liability for Accidents Due to Sudden Changes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Wenkuan and Wu Shi, the heads of the flight divisions of Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation, submitted their resignations to their respective companies after receiving warnings from the District Prosecutor's Office that they would be held responsible for negligent homicide in the event of an aircraft accident. After being retained by the company authorities, they petitioned the Ministry of Communications for guarantees. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has sent a telegram back yesterday approving the record. After three passenger planes crashed in Shanghai airspace last Christmas, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated the results and issued a non-prosecution disposition to Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Director of the Flight Division of Central Air Transport Corporation, He Shourong, and Wu Shi, Director of the Flight Division of China National Aviation Corporation, and Deputy Director Chen Hongen Wang, stating: "Upon investigation, the flight division personnel of the two companies did not pay sufficient attention to safety in the command of the planes on December 25, 1946, when three passenger planes crashed in Shanghai in succession, and there was negligence. According to the Criminal Law, the most severe penalty for negligent homicide in the course of business is less than five years. Because it meets the requirements of the Amnesty Ordinance, it is not prosecuted."

**Resignations Submitted After Receiving Warning**

After receiving this warning, Chen and others believed that while the issue of responsibility was certainly the responsibility of the flight division supervisors, accidents were caused by sudden changes in weather or mechanical failures that could not be prevented by human effort, and they were also impossible to prevent. Therefore, the flight division could not salvage or prevent the occurrence of incidents. However, the local court indicted them on suspicion of negligent homicide in the course of business. Fortunately, they were granted amnesty, otherwise they would have been sentenced to several years of imprisonment, which would have been unjust. Therefore, the company authorities submitted their resignations.

**Guarantee Proposed and Approved for Record**

The two companies believed that Chen and others had served for many years and that talent was valuable at a time when civil aviation urgently needed to develop. Therefore, they tried to retain them and reported to the Ministry of Communications suggesting that if there were any aircraft accidents in the future, the true cause of the accident should be used to determine who was responsible, and the assessment should be fair and impartial, so as to ensure that no one was wrongly accused or let off. If it is due to a sudden change in the climate, in a situation where personnel have done their best and human effort is difficult to apply, the specialized responsible personnel should be guaranteed to remove their fear and be able to work with peace of mind." After this request was sent to the Ministry of Communications, the company authorities received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, which stated briefly: In the future, before any aircraft takes off, it should be subject to a detailed and thorough inspection by the flight division personnel to ensure safety, and the inspectors should sign and be responsible. As for the point that the responsible personnel should be guaranteed in the event of an accident due to other sudden changes in circumstances beyond human control, it is approved for record. The company has now forwarded this reply to the flight division, and the resignation intentions of Chen and others are expected to be rescinded.

### Thieves Dressed Like Rich Young Masters and Ladies; Six Criminals Escorted from Beijing to Shanghai; Fifty Boxes of Stolen Goods Recovered

The "Four Famous Mountains" pickpocketing gang had already seen three members, Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and Zhang Zhiqing, captured by the Railway Bureau Police Department. The remaining members, Wu Tiancai, Zhang Xianglin (also known as Yunpeng), Li Jingping, Zhang Xiaomei, Xiao Jinbao, and Wu Dongying, have been captured in Beijing. Yesterday, they were escorted from Beijing to Shanghai. It is reported that on the 8th, at about 10 pm, on the eleventh night express train from Beijing to Shanghai, a passenger named Qu Xinglin suddenly discovered that a box had been switched. He reported it to the railway police, who carried out an inspection. Finally, the thief Wu Tiancai was found in the same car, and the stolen goods were confiscated. When escorted to the police section for interrogation, he confessed to his accomplices Zhang Yungui, Zhu Shaoxiong, Zhang Xianglin, Li Jingping, Zhang Xiaomei, Xiao Jinbao, and Wu Dongying, who were hiding in the Anle Hotel in Xiaguan, Nanjing. They went to the address and arrested Zhang Xianglin, Li Jingping (Da Luo's wife), Zhang Xiaomei (Zhang Xianglin's wife), Xiao Jinbao (Zhang Ronggui's wife), and Wu Dongying (Zhu Shaorong, i.e., Xiao Luo's wife). Da Luo and Xiao Luo had already escaped after hearing the news in advance. Fifty boxes of stolen goods and dozens of pieces of gold jewelry were also confiscated on the spot.

According to Wu Tiancai, they arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on December 29th. Zhang Xianglin had just been released from prison after being pardoned. After arriving in Beijing, they committed more than a dozen cases, which are not easy to remember clearly. The largest case was on February 1st, when they stole 4 million yuan from a passenger on the train, and 2.8 million yuan on February 3rd. They have committed more than a hundred cases in Shanghai, and they have been arrested several times, but they have all been recently released after being pardoned. The criminals are well-dressed. The female criminals are all wearing brocade cheongsams, brand-new sea otter velvet coats, and high-top black leather shoes, looking like noble ladies. The male criminals are wearing suits and leather shoes, looking like young masters. It is absolutely impossible to tell from their appearance that they are thieves. It is also reported that these six male and female criminals will be transferred to the District Court by the Police Department this afternoon for handling.

In the end, he escaped without a trace. When the bullets cracked, the Zhabei Branch Bureau was close at hand. Upon hearing the gunfire, a large number of police officers were dispatched. After clarification, they returned to the bureau.

### Dispute Over Silver Shop Transaction; Indiscriminate Ringing of Police Bell Rebuked

[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Zhiliang, a martial arts actor from the Gong Wu Stage on Zhongzheng Central Road, had only two gold rings weighing three mace and six fen (a unit of weight) at his home at about 3:50 pm yesterday because he lacked cash for expenses. When he was about to go out to exchange them, two martial arts actor colleagues, Guo Qingpeng and Wang Yongchun, arrived, so they went together to Yongfeng Silver Shop at No. 507 Zhongzheng Central Road to exchange them. After the silver shop owner, Ma Wenming, weighed them, they weighed only three mace and four fen. According to the silver shop's listed purchase price of 700,000 yuan per tael, he should have received 238,000 yuan. However, Ma was only willing to pay 210,000 yuan. The three martial arts actors argued with reason, but Ma rang the police bell several times. The Taishan Police Bureau heard the alarm and immediately ordered a large number of people to rush to the scene, blocking all the intersections around. Part of the officers bravely rushed in and learned that it was not a robbery, but a business dispute. The police officers believed that the owner should not regard the police bell as a child's plaything, so they took him to the bureau for rebuke as a warning to others.

### Police Officer Shoots Colleague

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Yingcheng, a 24-year-old Chaozhou native and an employee of the Police Bureau's Firearms Section, residing at No. 1, Lane 58, Yunnan South Road, was passing through the Eight Immortals Bridge in plain clothes at 6 pm last night when he saw a pedicab driver being pulled over by police officer No. 3528. A dispute arose, so he stepped forward to inquire. He learned that the pedicab driver's truck did not have a license, but according to police regulations, he must be taken to the bureau for disposal. However, the police officer took the pedicab driver to the truck owner's place at No. 64, Jiuan Lane, Da Lai South Goods Store, Great World. Zhang believed that the police officer was suspected of dereliction of duty, so after the police officer came out of the store, he questioned him. The police officer was unwilling to show weakness and retorted, claiming that he went to the store at the pedicab driver's request because the pedicab driver wanted to report to the store owner in advance. Zhang still did not believe him, so a conflict arose. Unexpectedly, at the entrance of Hongyun Lane, Ninghai West Road, the police officer suddenly pulled out his official pistol and fired two shots at Zhang without asking the reason. The bullets hit his head and waist, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. After causing the incident, the police officer knew that it would be difficult to escape the law, so he immediately raised his gun and fired a shot at his own chest, attempting to commit suicide. However, because he was too nervous at the time, he missed. At that time, nearby residents heard the gunfire and fled in panic. The police officer took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, the Songshan Road Police Branch Bureau, which was in charge of the area, received the report and immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation, and sent the deceased to the autopsy institute. As of late at night, the police officer who committed the crime had not yet been arrested, but his wife had been detained. At the same time, Gao Aisheng (34 years old, from Pudong), the truck driver of Da Lai South Goods Store, was also summoned to testify.

### Embezzlement Case of Materials Worth 60 Billion; Sun Qinchi and Three Others Indicted for Suspicion of Corruption; Zhou Fushan and Four Others Suspected of Theft; Not Prosecuted Because They Meet the Amnesty Requirements

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the embezzlement case of materials worth 60 billion yuan from the Municipal Government's reception of Yanping Road materials, Shen Zhenjia, Sun Qinchi, and Shen Wenyuan, former senior officials of the Municipal Government, were investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Hong Biao of the District Prosecutor's Office, who believed that there was indeed a suspicion of corruption, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday. Although Zhou Fushan, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, and Chen Rongjian of the Fuki Construction Factory were also suspected of theft, their crimes were committed before December 31, 1946. Even if the crimes were true, they were also covered by the amnesty, so they were not prosecuted.

**Full Text of Indictment**

Shen Wenyuan, male, 30 years old, from Qingpu, currently works for an art company, residing at No. 1, Lane 59, Xujiahui Station Street. Shen Zhenjia, male, 37 years old, from Yuyao, currently works as a businessman, residing at No. 415, Changchun Road. Sun Qinchi, also known as Qinru, male, 50 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 1, 1st Floor, Changchun Apartment, North Sichuan Road.

The above-named defendants are suspected of corruption. The investigation has been concluded that a prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions are listed as follows: When Shen Wenyuan was assigned to the reception staff of the Municipal Government after the victory, he was appointed as a clerk in the Motor Vehicle Section of the General Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Shen Zhenjia was the director of the Motor Vehicle Section of the General Affairs Office. Sun Qinchi was the director of the General Affairs Office. Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy and the Japanese had just surrendered in Shanghai and all reception matters were not yet in order, the Municipal Government lacked cars and gasoline in September 1945. Mei Nisiping's chauffeur, Pan Zhongren, was ordered to be detained and interrogated. It was clear that the enemy and the Japanese were operating the Idemitsu Company (the abbreviation of Japanese-owned China Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd.). The defendant, Shen Wenyuan, was instructed to investigate, accompanied by Pan Zhongren. He dragged back many cars from the Jianghai Road warehouse. Shen Wenyuan learned that Idemitsu Company had a large amount of stored oil elsewhere, stored in various places in the city, and reported to the office. After receiving the report, the defendant Shen Zhenjia only consulted with the defendant Sun Qinchi once. He did not report it to the mayor for approval, nor did he care that there was another institution in Shanghai at the time, the Enemy and Puppet Private Industrial and Commercial Handling Committee. He took the reception into his own hands so that he could obtain illegal benefits. Therefore, he still sent Shen Wenyuan to contact Idemitsu Company. Yoshida, a Japanese employee of Idemitsu Company, copied a detailed list of the amount of stored oil in various places of the company and handed it to Shen Wenyuan to take back. The defendants concealed the list and did not report it. They went to the oil storage locations to carry out the reception. In addition to sending the defendant Shen Wenyuan, they also sent clerks Guo Dasheng, technician Chen Enfu, and Yang Guozhen to collect all the stored oil in the company's Kunming Road, Macau Road, Grantham Road, Tongjia Road, Yanping Road and other places. The amount of stored oil on Yanping Road was the largest. After the reception, they did not make a list. The defendant Shen Wenyuan added a blue paper sign with the official seal of the Municipal Government, "Shanghai Municipal Government Warehouse", in front of the original warehouse to cover up the goal, so that it could be taken and carried at will. After the stored oil in the Tongjia Road, Macau Road, and Grantham Road was received, they did not hesitate to spend engineering and transport costs to transport it to the Kunming Road oil depot for concentration, so that the numbers were confused and it would be difficult to investigate in the future. They also transferred police officers from the Yulin Road Branch to be stationed at the Kunming Road oil depot for guard. From September 21, 1945, the oil received at the place was gradually taken for use. In December 1945, Idemitsu Company sent four copies of the property directory to the place. In January 1946, the place sent clerk Ye Yaoqing to be stationed at the Kunming Road oil depot to be responsible for safekeeping to cover people's eyes and ears.

### Handling Ship Collisions; Port Affairs Association Sets Interim Measures; Ship Captains Who Are Indeed Criminally Responsible Can Be Detained by the Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] The 18th meeting of the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium yesterday morning. Mayor Wu submitted for discussion the petitions of the Chinese Merchant Ship Drivers Association, the Chinese Nautical Drivers Association, and the Chinese Sailors Association, requesting a guarantee that the water police would no longer overstep their authority and detain the parties involved in ship collisions. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to transfer to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to formulate procedures for handling maritime cases in accordance with the Maritime Law. Before these handling procedures are formulated: interim measures for handling ship collisions are tentatively agreed upon: (1) After a ship collision occurs, the port police or water police should assist both captains in handling emergency measures, and both captains should submit a report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. (2) After receiving the report, the Maritime Affairs Bureau should convene a ship collision dispute handling committee as soon as possible within 24 hours to determine the responsibility for the collision. (3) If the handling committee believes that the captain is indeed criminally responsible or the family of the victim files a lawsuit with the court and the prosecutor makes an accusation based on the responsibility listed in the handling document, the captain can be detained by the court. Otherwise, before the collision incident is completely handled, the shipping company to which he belongs should provide a guarantee to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. Regarding the re-determination of the passenger limit for ships, the Maritime Affairs Bureau convened the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Industry Association, and the aircraft to hold meetings for careful discussion. The proposal: (1) Long-distance ships will still be handled in accordance with the regulations. (2) Short-distance ships will be re-inspected by the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the number of ships will be increased or decreased according to the actual situation. (3) Equip sufficient life-saving equipment according to the number of passengers carried. (4) Passengers are not allowed on the top of the ship. (5) The Customs House originally had two motor lifeboats set up in Wusong, and it is proposed to restore the setting and equip them with wireless electricity and first aid kits. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau submitted the above proposal to the conference for discussion. Except for item (2), the conference resolved to pass it.

### Speaking Eloquently, Resembling a "Diplomat" – The Puppet Foreign Minister Wu Kaisheng's Trial Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment

[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kaisheng, the puppet foreign minister, was tried at the High Court yesterday. He hails from Yixing, Jiangsu Province, is forty-eight years old, holds a doctorate in law from the University of Paris, France, and enjoyed a reputation in legal and diplomatic circles before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he stayed in Shanghai and, after joining the puppet organization, successively served as a reserve member of the puppet Central Supervisory Committee, a member of the Examination Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan, the puppet ambassador to Italy (never went abroad), the puppet foreign minister, and a member and secretary-general of the puppet Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. When he was brought out of the Zhongjian Prison yesterday morning, he wore a light gray silk-faced silk-cotton robe, had a fresh haircut, and had a plump face, with a volume of defense statements and documents under his arm. During his defense, he spoke eloquently, seemingly retaining the true colors of "a lawyer and a diplomat." The key points of the defendant's response to the indictment were: (1) During the period of the occupation, the environment in Shanghai was harsh, and intellectuals were especially subjected to oppression by the enemy and puppets. His assumption of puppet positions was not a willing act of allegiance to the enemy but was a matter of being forced into it. Later, he established close ties with the Military Statistics Bureau, providing cover for underground workers, and for the sake of work, he had to endure everything. (2) His position as a member of the Examination Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan was nominal, with no actual work. (3) As the puppet ambassador to Italy, he never went abroad to take office. (4) He rescued underground comrades, protected foreign clergy and churches, helped secretly set up radio stations, and transmitted intelligence, which was not without minor contributions. He pleaded with the court for a lenient sentence. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, stood up to defend him. Judge Liu announced the conclusion of the trial and set the sentencing for the morning of the 19th.

[Another Report] Fu Guangyao, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, appealed to the Supreme Court due to dissatisfaction. After being remanded for retrial, the High Court concluded the retrial yesterday and also set the sentencing for the morning of the 19th.

### Prices of Everything Soar and Fluctuate Severely – Blue Cloth for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants, Eight Yards Per Person, Totaling 40,000 Yuan

Recently, commodity prices have fluctuated drastically. The eighth special allocation of first-class blue cloth for public school teachers and civil servants in this city will be distributed from the 13th to the 22nd of this month, with eight yards allocated per person. Each yard is priced at nearly 1,000 yuan, totaling 40,000 yuan. Five people will jointly receive one bolt. Compared to the market price of about 1,000 yuan per foot, those who wish to purchase it should still have their respective public school and civil service institutions compile and purchase it with famine-relief allocation tickets. It has also been learned that the deadline for the seventh-period allocation of canned meat is the 15th of this month, with the selling price remaining at 600 yuan per can, and eighteen cans per person, totaling 10,800 yuan. Purchases have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days.

### Hearing that Wen Lantin's Condition Has Not Improved After Surgery

[Report from this Newspaper] Wen Lantin, who is receiving medical treatment at the Red Cross Hospital, underwent his first surgery on the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve. It was originally planned that after a short rest, he would undergo a second surgery to remove the malignant tumor. However, it has been more than twenty days, and Wen's condition has not shown significant improvement. He is still only consuming a small amount of juice and drifts into a drowsy sleep every day. As a result, many old friends and acquaintances visit him daily, and the signature book has already accumulated three volumes.

### A Puppet Official with Unkempt Hair and a Dirty Face – Stuttering and Relying on Treacherous Fame

[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court tried the case of Li Fowen, a suspected traitor, yesterday. Li is from Rehe, but because he grew up in Japan from a young age, he can only speak Japanese. When he appeared in court yesterday, he had unkempt hair and a dirty face, wore a tattered padded robe, and was covered with a tattered coat. He was shivering from the cold and suffered from a stutter. He was very strange when he answered questions, stuttering every time he opened his mouth. According to his statement, he originally served as the commander of a cavalry regiment in Outer Mongolia. In 1942, he came to Shanghai and was introduced to be an intelligence officer for the Third War Area Headquarters. He was captured by the Japanese Kempeitai (military police) and was only released after the victory. However, the certificate issued by the Third War Area Headquarters had been burned by the Japanese Kempeitai. Later, through the introduction of a doctor surnamed Jian, he met Liu Zhenming, the commander of the Huainan District Column of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command. Liu appointed him as the colonel commander of the 4th Regiment of the column, with about 3,000 troops stationed in Bengbu, Anhui Province, and Gaoyou, Jiangsu Province. He was arrested before he could take office. He also claimed: "During the Anti-Japanese War, I was doing anti-Japanese work. After the victory, I was doing anti-communist work, not a traitor. As for the weapons manufacturing plan, it was drafted by a Japanese named Ikezaki. Because Liu Zhenming needed a weapons repair talent, I recommended Ikezaki. Liu Zhenming asked him to write a resume and plan, which Ikezaki wrote and put in my bag, and it was found during my arrest. The 300 million yuan in puppet currency for activities was borrowed from a wealthy tobacco merchant surnamed Xian, not provided by the Japanese." At this point, the court stated that the case still required investigation and ordered a postponement for retrial. When the defendant signed his name "Li Fowen," it was like a child learning to write, which was quite comical.

### Wang Youqing and Xiang Yushan Escorted to the High Court for Trial Yesterday

Yesterday, the two defendants were escorted to the High Court. After Judge Qiu questioned the defendants about their names, ages, hometowns, and addresses, he ordered them to be detained in the Shanghai Prison pending trial. Wang Youqing's attitude was quite stubborn, still not abandoning his rude nature.

### Xu Jiang Remained Silent Upon Hearing the Ten-Year Sentence

[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Jiang, who had served as the director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau and the director of the Special Sericulture Construction Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, had his trial concluded by the High Court on the 5th. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the sentence was pronounced at the High Court. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the verdict: "Xu Jiang, conspiring with foreign countries to plot against one's own country, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for ten years, and his property is confiscated, except for what is necessary to provide for his family's living expenses." After Judge Liu finished reading, he continued: "If you are not satisfied with the sentence, you may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." After hearing the sentence, the defendant remained silent and was returned to the Zhongjian Prison.

### The Abandoned Site of the Caohejing Prison – Approved for Conversion into a Farm

[Report from this Newspaper] The municipal government authorities, based on a resolution of the Municipal Council, requested the buildings of the former French barracks at 73-75 Avenue Road (old Fuli Road) as the site for the District Court.

The Assets Clearance Committee of the former concession is currently consulting with them on the transfer. It is said that after the District Court relocates, the buildings it originally used will be entirely used by the High Court.

### Administrative Penalties for the Great Fire Case – Decided to Handle According to the Report – Zhou Zhaoxiang Given a Demerit, Zhuo Houdao Dismissed, Zhu Qinglan and Li Xun Dismissed but Retained

[Report from this Newspaper] The investigation committee has completed its investigation on the administrative aspect of the great fire case on Seymour Road and Wuding Road, and the chairman of the committee, Ge Kexin, has submitted the report to the mayor. The mayor has decided to follow the recommendations regarding the penalties. He also believes that Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the Fire Department, should also be given a major demerit. The full text of the report is divided into eight key points: it discusses improving the treatment of police officers, supplementing fire-fighting equipment, increasing funding, recruiting volunteer firefighters, and rectifying bad practices. Finally, when discussing the responsibility and penalties for the entire case, it believes that the factors leading to the Seymour Road fire were complex, involving political, economic, social, historical, and even psychological relationships. However, firefighters should not use this as an excuse to shirk their responsibility. Zhuo Houdao, the squad leader of the Yichang Road District where the police officers who stole property belonged, was ineffective in supervision and training and is proposed to be dismissed. Zhu Qinglan, the commander who arrived at the fire scene first, and Li Xun, the squad leader of the district under his jurisdiction, were negligent in supervision and are proposed to be dismissed but retained. Xia Guoliang, the commander of the fire brigade, was negligent in supervision and is proposed to be given a major demerit. Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the Fire Department, although not directly responsible for the fire-fighting on site, failed to do his best in management, assessment, and planning and is proposed to be reprimanded by order. Those involved in criminal cases will be dealt with after the court concludes its trial. Lin Zhenqiang and Xiao Zuosheng, patrol officers of the Jiangning Branch of the Police Bureau, were negligent in guarding and are proposed to be given a demerit each. It is hoped that all police officers will encourage each other from now on, work hard to revitalize, and society will have its own public opinion. It will not be difficult to restore honor and regain the trust of the citizens in a short period of time.

### Zhang Naizuo Advocates – Fire-Fighting Organization – Government-Supervised and Privately-Run

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Naizuo, a member of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, stated in his capacity as the convener of the Municipal Council's Police Affairs Committee that after investigating the Seymour Road fire case, it was found that there were indeed inadequacies in fire-fighting. Although factors such as tight funding and rudimentary equipment were the main reasons, the imperfect fire-fighting management was an undeniable fact. When the investigation committee visited the Central District Fire Department, the department's 150-foot ladder truck could not be tested and deployed within twenty minutes, which showed its dereliction of duty. In addition, during the era of the former Municipal Council, the Fire Department could start the fire engine within 30 seconds of receiving an alarm. Now, according to the Fire Department itself, due to the incomplete equipment, it takes at least one minute at the fastest and up to five minutes at the slowest. And statistics show that there were 1,063 fires in this city last year, averaging three fires per day. If each delay is five minutes, how much property of the people must be lost? Therefore, I believe that the organization of fire-fighting must be improved. In addition to active measures such as widening road widths and demolishing irregular houses, which can be handled by the government's responsibility, other parts can adopt a government-supervised and privately-run approach. Simply restoring the volunteer firefighter police system of the former Municipal Council era is not enough to change the entire fire-fighting organization. As for the funding for the government-supervised and privately-run fire-fighting organization, I believe that the government should provide assistance, and the insurance industry association, which is directly related to fire-fighting, must also assume a part of it. In addition, the public can raise funds on their own. The detailed reorganization plan will be submitted for discussion when the next Municipal Council is convened.

### Brick Walls Obstruct Traffic – The Municipal Government Notified to Demolish Them

[Report from this Newspaper] The brick wall at the Youlong Wharf in Pudong was built by the Japanese invaders. It is ten inches thick, six feet high, and twenty-eight feet long, cutting across the road. It is now used as a surrounding wall by the Pudong Water Plant. This wall obstructs traffic and affects the business of boatmen. The boatmen jointly requested the Municipal Council to forward the request to the Municipal Government for demolition. According to the investigation by the Municipal Government, it is confirmed that it obstructs traffic, so the Bureau of Public Works has been ordered to be responsible for the demolition. In addition, the brick wall and iron gate at the Hengfeng Wharf on Huasheng Road in Hongkou belong to the Hengfeng Yarn Factory, but they are also obstacles to traffic. The Municipal Government has notified them to demolish them immediately.

### Indictment of the Embezzlement Case of Taking Over (Continued from Previous)

The former site of the Mitsuura Company at 360 Yanping Road was originally the factory building of the Zhou Fook Kee Construction Factory, and 29 Tongjia Road was also a branch of the Zhou Fook Kee Factory. During the occupation, the company was hired to repair work and owed wages. Before the victory, the Japanese were afraid of Allied bombing, so they dispersed various oil and material resources and occupied the factory. The factory owner, Zhou Fushan, also known as Zhou Zhengfu, was afraid of the enemy's increasingly declining power. He always avoided asking or hearing about daily transactions, as it would easily arouse suspicion. The employees hired to watch the factory, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, Chen Rongjian, etc., saw that the defendants Shen Wenyuan, etc., took such measures and took the opportunity to steal. However, the amount of materials they stole, and the names and actual quantities of materials embezzled by the defendants Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia, etc., were known from the detailed list of oil stored in various locations copied by the Japanese Yoshida Tatsuhiko, which was always hidden in the hands of Shen Wenyuan. It is actually difficult to accurately determine the exact number. Therefore, based on the catalog of Mitsuura's property received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau sent by the department, which was already in December 1945, more than three months had passed since the department took over without authorization. Although the catalog was created and sent by the Mitsuura Company, it omitted the oil stored at Yanping Road and added notes such as "leaking barrels," "empty barrels," and "empty boxes" in other received oil stores, indicating that this catalog was made by the defendants in collusion with the Japanese after the case occurred to cover up. Only the oil item was sealed by the Municipal Government, totaling 59,678 gallons. According to the amount published in the instructions of the investigation team of the processing bureau, there are a total of 67,390 gallons. Compared with the two, there are 7,712 gallons more of oil, equivalent to 154 large barrels and 12 gallons more. It can be determined that this amount of oil was concealed and underreported by the defendants. Moreover, after the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation on March 11, 1946, it was found that six large jars of diesel oil that had been poured out were found in the empty area of Yanping Road, which were stolen by Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, etc., and had not been taken away. The matter was first secretly reported to the Third Front Army by Zhang Zhenping, Chen Shaoting, Yu Xianglin, etc. On October 30, 1945, Lu Shishang, the leader of the Material Group of the former Military Supply Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army, sent team member Wang Zenglue to investigate with the reporters and copied out 624 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil (each barrel containing 50 gallons) and 200 bicycle inner and outer rubber tires, ceramic tiles, iron hooks, iron cables, and 30 cans of Monsanto saccharin from 30 Yanping Road, which were stored in a large room. Another room and the outside building stored 65 large steel windows and steel doors, 70 to 80 loads of bamboo steel bars, about 50,000 square feet of large pine boards, and 40 to 50 loads of water-flow iron sheets. The team member Wang Zenglue said that because the seal carried by Wang was not enough, he verbally instructed Zhou Yunshan and others to guard them. Except that Wang Zenglue did not seal the pine boards, steel windows, and steel doors because he could not determine that they were enemy assets, and the informer Chang Chang did not mention iron hooks, iron cables, bamboo steel bars, and water-flow iron plates, it was difficult to determine that they were enemy property. During the interrogation, Zhou Zhengfu, the owner of the Zhou Fook Kee Construction Factory, firmly stated that they were indeed materials used in the construction factory and were not enemy property, so Wang did not seal them. According to Wang Zenglue's original reply on November 1, 1945, 620 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil were seized at 360 Yanping Road, and the defendants had moved out four barrels from the number reported by the Mitsuura Company. On November 15, Wang reported that he and the informers had investigated 2,000 barrels of kerosene stored at 29 Tongjia Road, and the municipal government had sent personnel to escort them out of the factory, but no receipt was given. Chen Rongjian confessed that he had 2,498 small boxes of kerosene, 250 large iron barrels of kerosene, 95 large iron barrels of red car oil, and 129 large iron barrels of diesel oil, all of which were transported away by Shen Wenyuan using trucks numbered 25952 and 15206. The amount is very different, and it is undoubtedly a joint embezzlement by the defendants. After the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office investigated and found that the report was true, it was impeached and transferred for disciplinary action. The Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee believed that it involved criminal suspicion and issued it to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate for investigation. The Ministry of Justice also approved the Executive Yuan Secretariat's transfer of the original report based on the report by Zhang Zhenping and others, ordering the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate to investigate in succession on October 16, 1946. Based on the above process and facts, it is sufficient to determine the criminal evidence of the defendants Shen Wenyuan, Shen Zhenjia, Sun Qinchi, etc., as follows: The actions of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government in sending personnel to receive enemy assets, using enemy assets for transportation, and negotiating with Lu Shishang of the Receiving Group of the Third Front Army to stop the transportation of oil stored in Yanping Road, etc., are very important. Why did they not give the responsible personnel official documents in advance, and why did the responsible personnel not report in writing at any time afterwards? Even according to Shen Wenyuan's confession, the report on the name and quantity of received items had been handed over to Shen Zhenjia for transfer, but Sun Qinchi claimed to be busy and had no time to look at it carefully and sent it back for storage (the defendants Shen Zhenjia and Sun Qinchi did not deny this during the interrogation). It was not until the Supervisory Commissioner's Office thoroughly investigated that two or three written reports from the responsible personnel in this case were added to cover up. If Shen Zhenjia and Shen Wenyuan had not colluded together, how could Shen Wenyuan have arbitrarily stolen the sealed materials? At the time of receiving, he only hung an empty stamped paper at the door, considering it to be the fulfillment of his receiving duties. He did not report the details and always kept the detailed list made by the Japanese until he had been away from his job for a long time, still hiding it in his private hands. It is difficult to deny that he jointly stole public property. As the director of the General Affairs Department, Sun Qinchi was so careless in handling such important materials that had been received without authorization. Even if he cannot prove the exact amount of the distribution of benefits, he knew that his subordinates were corrupt and had evidence, but he protected them and did not report them. What else can he say to defend himself? Except that the other personnel who were sent to help with the receiving were all hired by Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia and should be dismissed, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, Zhou Fushan, also known as Zhou Zhengfu, and Chen Rongjian lack concrete evidence of stealing materials and only have the suspicion of passively jointly stealing. Their behavior of jointly stealing diesel oil with Zhou Yunshan and Zhang Jingyao should all be pardoned and dealt with separately. The defendants Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia are suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The defendant Sun Qinchi is suspected of violating Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption and should be treated as an accomplice to Article 3, Section 2 of the same regulations. In accordance with Article 1, Section 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecution is initiated, Prosecutor Gu Anbiao. February 12, 1947.

### Emergency Measures to be Implemented Soon; Speculative Atmosphere Gradually Dissipates

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, various newspapers carried reports from Nanjing stating that the central authorities in Nanjing were planning measures to stabilize finance and the economy, with the expectation that they would be implemented within days. The speculative markets in gold, banknotes, and stocks in this city initially showed a strong and steady trend in the early morning, continuing the bullish momentum from the previous day's close. However, they quickly faltered and declined. The general trend in other commodity markets was a shift from rising to weakening. According to observations from several authoritative figures in the city's financial circles, the government will not ignore the current chaotic state of finance. They firmly believe that measures to stabilize finance will be publicly announced and implemented within days. It is hoped that the public will prioritize stability above all else. They believe that the main driver of recent financial fluctuations is the speculative psychology of the general market. Public unrest is a trap for speculators, ultimately leading to significant market volatility. According to analysis, the main sources of the vast amounts of floating capital currently flooding the market are: firstly, over 40 billion yuan in production loans issued for the Lunar New Year season in agricultural communities and mills; secondly, a large amount of floating capital gathered in Shanghai from other regions, mainly through remittances from various banks and financial institutions, but recently also increasingly through physical cash transfers due to remittance limits; and thirdly, year-end bonuses paid to employees by various companies, factories, and businesses. They believe that the main task for finance in the future is to guide this floating capital into productive channels. Once the floating capital finds its proper place, it will no longer be able to engage in speculation and mischief in the market.

Market Operators Become Wary; Gold and Banknotes Decline Simultaneously

(Report from Our Newspaper) The buying interest in the gold market collapsed yesterday. The market opened with a sharp drop to 7.6 million yuan. From a buying price of 7.3 million yuan, it briefly rose to 8.4 million yuan before falling back to 7.5 million yuan, where it gradually stabilized. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 350 taels at a price of 7.7 million yuan, causing renewed unrest, and the price rebounded to over 8.4 million yuan. Thereafter, the multiple facets of public fear automatically disintegrated the buying interest, and supply exceeded demand, driving the price down to 6.7 million yuan near noon. At noon, it rebounded to around 7.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery market initially weakened to 6.8 million yuan, briefly advancing to 7.3 million yuan. Soon after, financial institutions sold off, and credit tightened. Rumors to halt the market spread, and after 3:00 PM, the market began to decline sharply to a low of 6.4 million yuan, before closing at 6.7 million yuan. Overall, it fell 1.75 million yuan compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments remained at 750,000 yuan. Silver dollars also fell significantly, with the interbank overnight lending rate gradually tightening from 15% to 18%.

Foreign Currencies Fell Yesterday; the unofficial market for US dollars opened between 15,000 and 16,000 yuan, rebounding to 17,700 yuan mid-session. Near noon, it fell along with the gold market to 13,500 yuan. Although it did not decline much further in the afternoon, it ultimately fell 4,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars initially started at 3,400 yuan in the morning, repeatedly declined slightly, and finally hovered between 2,700 and 2,800 yuan, also falling 800 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate experienced a chaotic market, and due to delayed reports from Shanghai, traders were unable to complete transactions, with supplies quoted at around 3,100 yuan. Indian Rupees were at 3,750 yuan. British pounds were at 49,500 yuan, all selling prices, with few transactions.

### Public Bonds Decline

Public bond prices fell significantly yesterday. Unified Series C opened at 3,400 yuan, followed by sell orders from the 360, 552 series, driving the price down to 2,900 yuan. The 604 series and others were slightly more accepting, and the price then rebounded to over 3,000 yuan. Ultimately, Series A and B fell 200 yuan compared to the previous close, Series C fell 400 yuan, Series D fell 50 yuan, and Series E fell 150 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 8 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Also Decline

Foreign stocks also saw declines yesterday. Ewo Cotton opened at 14,400 yuan, rose to 15,800 yuan, and then gradually declined. Smaller stocks rebounded after falling. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton, British-American Tobacco, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Ewo Brewery, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company each fell by more than 20%, while others fell by about 15%.

### Chamber of Commerce Meeting

Lo Ching-hua's Urgent Proposal

Advising the Business Community to Exercise Self-Discipline

The Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting today. Mr. Lo Ching-hua put forward an urgent proposal, advising businesses and industries to jointly suppress prices, utilize the good practice of "colleague agreement," revive industry regulations, restore business ethics, and suggested that the government take the following emergency measures: (1) re-establish the gold policy, (2) implement linked import and export policies, (3) purchase materials to control prices, and (4) increase production and conserve consumption.

### Governor Pei Returns to Shanghai

(Report from Our Newspaper) Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, Governor of the Central Bank, who went to Nanjing on official business on the evening of the 11th, is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening train yesterday, expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is widely believed that Mr. Pei's trip is related to stabilizing Shanghai's financial market.

### Gold Shops' Retail Business Has Been Relatively Quiet Yesterday

(Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday morning, the Central Bank allocated 375 taels of gold to gold shops at a price of 7.7 million yuan. Initially, the gold shops quoted a price of 7.9 million yuan, but as the market gradually declined, the closing price in the afternoon was 6.4 million to 6.8 million yuan, and the gold shops lowered their quoted price to 7.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, the retail departments of various gold shops were no longer as busy as before, and many customers were selling gold. According to a major figure in the gold shop industry, when market prices fluctuate and fall, the gold shops are forced to lower prices to meet retail demand for the high-priced gold they have purchased, often resulting in losses. However, it is noted that the purchase prices of various gold shops are based on the lowest market prices at the time, and they also need to deduct 14,000 yuan for wear and tear. When selling gold, in addition to the quoted price, they also charge a handling fee based on the complexity of the jewelry's workmanship. For a simple ring, the labor cost alone is 1,200 yuan.

### Social Affairs Bureau Stabilizing Rice Prices

Allows Shops and Individuals

To Purchase Siamese Rice at Negotiated Prices

To suppress rice prices, the Social Affairs Bureau, starting yesterday, allowed merchants and individuals to apply for purchasing rice at negotiated prices. Three bottles of rice samples were displayed in the fourth department. Although the rice was not of the highest quality, it was not too inferior and was suitable for consumption by merchants and factories. Yesterday, a steady stream of people visited the bureau to apply for purchases, priced at 70,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

### Black Market Prices for Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Rise; Edible Oil Price Hikes Slightly Reduced

Yesterday, only glutinous rice arrived at the source of rice. The South City Market had 79 stones of silver yuan rice, and the North City Market had 152 stones of white yuan rice and 29 stones of Xian yuan rice. Transactions were few, and prices rose again by 13,500 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau's No. 2 Saigon rice continued to sell well. Another 31,380 bags of No. 2 rice were allocated, with 21,200 bags in the South City Market and 10,180 bags in the North City Market, and the price remained unchanged. Rice prices have risen sharply in recent days. Most rice merchants in the market yesterday seemed to be fearful. In addition, there have been no deliveries of Japonica and Indica rice recently, so they are afraid of the risk of hoarding and dare not release their stocks, so they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and not doing business. The unofficial market price has risen by another 20,000 yuan. White Japonica rice is approaching 170,000 yuan, thin Indica rice has reached 160,000 yuan, and early-season Indica rice is around 150,000 yuan.

Flour

Riding on the strong momentum of the previous day, actual demand was quite robust, and market prices continued to reach new highs. Bingchuan flour reached the 60,000 yuan mark, and Lilang foreign flour (70 lbs) reached as high as 80,000 yuan. The prices of various brands of flour rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan faster than the previous day. Speculation in wheat bran remained hot, but due to a lack of actual sales, the situation was weak. Large bags were initially firm but then weakened, while small bags fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was still a shortage of wheat supply, and prices were around 72,000 to 73,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

The upward trend in prices has slightly abated, and the market is gradually turning bearish. Merchants are already thinking about selling at high prices, and the raw material peanut kernels have also fallen back, so digestion is also weakening. Barrel peanut oil has fallen by 15,000 yuan, and barrel peanut oil has also fallen by about 20,000 yuan. There is very little soybean oil available, and prices are mediocre. There have been no transactions in clear vegetable oil, etc., but sesame oil from small carts has actually risen again by 20,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Yellow soybeans were firm in the early morning, but afterwards the supply continued, and there were reports that several ships were about to arrive in port, so the market gradually became bearish. Large Ying soybeans fell from 85,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, and the price of selected green soybeans was similar to the previous day. Red beans rose slightly by more than 2,000 yuan. Both sides were still buying sesame seeds, and prices continued to rise by 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were in good shape, and corn was similar. There was strong demand for raw peanuts, and the holders were crowding to sell them, so the market was weak and prices fell back by more than 20,000 yuan. There were no buyers in the later market. Soybean cake traders were still trying to struggle in the early morning, and prices were shouted up by 1,000 yuan, but due to poor digestion, they immediately fell back. The process was initially firm but then weakened.

Northern Goods Begin to Decline

Northern goods have risen a lot recently due to the gold rush, but they have started to decline. Sunflower seeds opened at 155,000 yuan, Tianjin red dates were priced between 250,000 yuan, Chen Gaozhuang yuan dates were 220,000 to 230,000 yuan, new Tongshou dates were 260,000 to 280,000 yuan, and Changping peaches were 210,000 yuan.

### Gasoline Imports Are Sufficient to Meet the Needs of the City

$2.5 Million USD Per Quarter

Panic about gasoline has slightly improved since the price adjustment. According to relevant authorities, the rumors about the difficulty of importing gasoline are pure speculation. The authorities now stipulate that the import quota for gasoline is $2.5 million USD per quarter, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the city. Therefore, if car owners do not seize the opportunity to buy and hoard, the gasoline supply will not be disrupted.

### Chinese Stocks Change Color Overnight; Limit-Up Becomes Limit-Down; The Market Is Filled with Sell Orders

Chinese stocks plummeted with the general trend yesterday amid minor fluctuations. Some stocks even hit limit-down prices, opening sharply lower in the morning. Nos. 2, 3, 97, and 36 were sold, and Die Yong Cotton fell to 1,350 yuan. Nos. 198, 88, 12, 219, 145, and 154 were bought, but quickly rebounded to 1,440 yuan. Nos. 192, 27, 20, and 97 were briefly sold at 1,370 yuan. As the gold market rebounded, Nos. 145, 14, 156, 76, 154, and 12 were bought, and the price rose to 1,455 yuan. Nos. 198, 158, 20, 152, 70, 117, 224, 198, and 171 were sold off. As the price of gold gradually declined, Die Yong Cotton was briefly quoted as low as 1,260 yuan (because there were no transactions, the low price was 1,270 yuan). At this time, Mei Ah, King Fung, Match Company, and Qinxing all hit the limit down, and there were even discount transactions. New Asia also hit the limit down shortly after, which was the most timid. Nos. 36 and 207 were bought first and then sold, and Nos. 2, 156, and 100 were all replenished, and finally the price hovered around 1,300 yuan. As a result, Yong Cotton, Mei Ah, Xinyi, Xingguang, King Fung, and Dongxing all hit the limit down. China Flour dropped slightly. Only the first half of the day was traded on the delivery market. Yong Cotton and Xingguang both fell by more than 10%, Mei Ah and Xinyi hit the limit down, China Flour dropped slightly. Among the cold stocks, No. 95 of China Textile remained unchanged. The Match, Yong Gong, and New Asia stocks hit the limit down, and the rest were all weak. In the afternoon, Nos. 180, 14, 17, 156, and 152 were all sold. Now Die Yong Cotton has fallen from 1,300 yuan to 1,270 yuan. Nos. 232, 198, 219, 89, 224, and 84 were purchased and rebounded to 1,310 yuan. Nos. 156 and 145 were still being sold, and finally they could not hold on. After 3:00 PM, the price of gold was even weaker. The night report carried the news that the chairman had secretly ordered the monitoring of the financial market. Nos. 173, 17, 35, 85, 74, 158, and 94 were all sold, gradually declining. Xinyi, Mei Ah, Yong Gong, Xingguang, Qinxing, and Innerwear all decisively hit the limit down. Mei Ah, Xinyi, King Fung, and Qin Yu all had discount performances. Near the close, Die Yong Cotton was forced to the limit down, and Nos. 61, 156, 171, and 198 all came to maintain the price, and it finally stabilized at around 1,240 yuan. As a result, Yong Cotton, Mei Ah, Xinyi, Xingguang, King Fung, and Qinxing all hit the limit down. China Flour dropped slightly. The cold stocks Yong Gong and Innerwear hit the limit down. China Textile and the Match stock each fell by more than 10%. New Asia and other stocks hit the limit down in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Cement and An dropped less. There were transactions only in the first session on the delivery market. China Flour dropped slightly, and the rest were approaching the limit down. Outside the market, the Chinese-French stock and the World stock were average, and the rest were still rising.

### Rubber Raw Material Inventory Is Depleted; Requesting That the Transportation and Management Committee Relax Import Quotas

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Rubber Industry Association of this city recently stated that the inventory of raw materials in Shanghai is depleted. Out of the 800 tons of rubber recently approved for temporary import by the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, finished products and used tires accounted for half, and raw rubber accounted for only 400 tons, which is not enough for the use of various rubber factories in the city for one week. Most factories will be forced to stop production. Therefore, yesterday, more than ten representatives of the association, including Hong Nianzu, specially brought a written statement at 9:30 AM to the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, requesting that the import quota for rubber be relaxed. The director of the allocation office, Li Gan, happened to be in Nanjing on official business, and the deputy director, Shen, received them on his behalf and provided the following answers based on the presentation: (1) The processing of finished products and raw materials should be handled separately, which is often agreed upon. (2) The import quota for rubber in January will be announced after the 15th of this month. Whether the quota can be relaxed as requested is still under consideration. (3) Regarding the transportation of rubber stored in Hong Kong to Shanghai, the allocation office stated that the quota has already been allocated to various importers in this city, and the importers may not be related to the rubber stored in Hong Kong, so this point is also still under consideration.

### Difficulties in Importing Chemical Raw Materials

(Report from Our Newspaper) A person in charge of a chemical raw material business in Shanghai said that since the Transportation and Management Committee listed chemical raw materials in the second category, the import of chemical raw materials has been greatly affected. Most of the applications for import have not been approved, resulting in a general increase in the price of chemical raw materials due to supply falling short of demand. However, the general price is still not high enough compared to the black market for US dollars. Various businesses are deeply concerned that they will not be able to replenish their stocks after they are sold out, so most of the transactions are very quiet. At present, the price of caustic soda has risen two times compared to the past, and the price of sulfuric acid has also risen more than one time. Other materials such as potassium red salt vaseline, percarbonate, etc., have also risen by one or two times. Although China manufactures caustic soda, the amount is not large, and transportation is difficult. Except for the China Textile Company ordering one million tons, it is not enough to meet the needs of various manufacturers. China also makes its own alcohol, so the price is relatively stable. However, the manufacturing is not precise, and the quality is not pure, so it can hardly compare with foreign goods. In general, China relies on foreign countries for most of its chemical raw materials. If the import methods cannot be improved, the difficulties encountered by China's chemical industry will become more serious every day.

### Food Rationing Prices Remain Unchanged; Rationing Methods Remain the Same as Last Time

The 14th meeting of the Sugar Council was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 PM yesterday. The discussion of the rationing method remained the same as decided at the previous meeting, that is, the amount of refined sugar allocated this term is one-quarter of the total amount applied for by each household in the first to fourth terms. Households that did not apply for sugar rationing in the first to fourth terms will be allocated ten bags of sugar this term. The price issue was also decided not to be changed. The price of raw and red sugar is still 140,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

Sugar Prices Decline

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially firm but then weakened. When the news of the decline in gold prices came, the price of all sugars fell. The current price of raw sugar officially marked by the association was 270,000 yuan in the morning, 250,000 yuan later, and 245,000 yuan in the afternoon. The price of raw sugar and red sugar was 210,000 yuan. The prices of both second and fourth grade white sugar and Peruvian fine sugar were 245,000 yuan. The price of Nosun Takqing opened at 172,000 yuan in the morning, then fell to 165,000 yuan, the price of regular sugar was 160,000 yuan to 155,000 yuan, the price of Xinghua white sugar was 255,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan, and the price of Xing red sugar was 190,000 yuan. More than 500 pieces were transacted.

Also, the Taiwan Company's sugar prices will remain the same today, and the amount allocated will also be the same as in the previous period. However, each firm must have two guarantors to ensure that they do not engage in black market activities. If this is the case, the price of sugar may be stabilized in the future.

### Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Suddenly

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced three twists and turns. In the early morning, the market was very nervous due to the fall in gold prices. 20-count special double horse yarn opened at 5 million, a sharp drop of 1 million compared to the previous day. Ordinary 20-count yarn also fell by 500,000 to 600,000. For example, Shuiyue Lima was traded at around 3.8 million. Then, the factory increased its purchases because the textile construction listing price was 400,000 to 800,000 higher than the market price. Shuiyue Lanfeng therefore recovered to 4.2 million, which was the high point of the day. However, this was short-lived. Soon after, yarn number sellers offered their yarn in abundance, and the price entered the 4 million mark again. The final transaction price was 3.95 million. There was a range of 400,000 yuan that day, and the result was a drop of 500,000 to 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. People were quite uneasy.

### Textile Management Committee to Meet Today to Discuss Yarn Purchase Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Textile Management Committee started processing applications for the southward transport of yarn and cloth on Monday of this week, as of yesterday, the number of southward transport approvals has totaled 3,743 pieces of cotton yarn and 9,599 bolts of cloth. In addition, the notice issued by the committee to various factories to purchase cotton yarn has also been collected. The committee is also issuing purchase notices in succession. The committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting this afternoon. At that time, the new principles for discussing the negotiated purchase price of cotton yarn will be discussed.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, with a total of 995 pieces sold. Manufacturers accounted for 880 pieces, and yarn numbers accounted for 115 pieces. The number of applicants was 413 manufacturers and 54 yarn numbers.

Chinese Fir Drastically Drops

Regarding the timber market, the sharp rise in Chinese fir prices in recent days was due to the relationship with gold prices. Yesterday, affected by the fall in gold prices, Chinese fir prices fell drastically, while foreign fir prices fell only slightly.

### Earnest Money for Delivery

### Shipping Companies Purchasing Ships from Overseas Must Meet Three Standards

Since the victory, shipping companies in our country have been ordering merchant ships from overseas in a very considerable amount. The Ministry of Communications has stipulated that merchant ships ordered overseas by various shipping companies in the future must meet the following three standards: (1) The ship's age must be less than 30 years, (2) The draft must be less than 18 feet, and (3) The speed must be more than 10 miles per hour. It is said that this regulation of the Ministry of Communications is to facilitate foreign exchange settlement work, because the foreign exchange audit office of the Central Bank is very strict in auditing the foreign exchange settlement work for the purchase of ships. In the future, if the above standards can be met, the Central Bank will approve the foreign exchange settlement.

### Director of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Government, Fan Shou-kang, Goes to Beijing to Report on His Work; Yesterday He Passed Through Shanghai to Discuss the Educational Situation in Taiwan Province

Mr. Fan Shou-kang, Director of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office, recently passed through Shanghai from Taiwan and is about to go to Beijing to report on his work to the Ministry of Education and to request instructions. When a reporter visited him to inquire about the past and current educational situation in the province, Mr. Fan informed him:

Educational Facilities

The Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office was formally established on October 25, 1945, and is responsible for educational administration, academic culture, and other matters throughout the province. In the past year or so, the department's educational facilities can be divided into three important stages. The first is the takeover period, from November 1, 1945, to the end of March of last year. In addition to establishing educational administrative institutions and taking over educational institutions, it also followed Governor Chen's principle of uninterrupted administration, factories not stopping work, and schools not stopping classes, trying to ensure that schools continued to hold classes and establishing the province's educational policy. The second is the preparation period, from April 1 to the end of July of last year, during which the department engaged in reforms and preparations for promoting education in accordance with established policies. The third is the implementation period of reform and promotion of education, from August of last year until now. Through these three stages, a foundation has indeed been laid for the development of education in Taiwan Province. Currently, in order to thoroughly eliminate the colonial education policy implemented by the Japanese in the past, the department has formulated an educational policy to promote the Three Principles of the People, cultivate national culture, instill practical knowledge and skills, encourage academic research, and especially emphasize equal educational opportunities.

Overview of Schools

Regarding school units in Taiwan Province, in higher education, there was the Taipei Imperial University, Taipei Economics College, Taichung Agricultural and Forestry College, and Tainan Industrial College in the past. After the restoration, all of these units were taken over one by one. Currently, Taipei Imperial University has been renamed National Taiwan University and is managed by the Ministry of Education, with a large scale. In addition to the five colleges of Liberal Arts and Political Science, Science, Agriculture, Medicine, and Engineering, it also has an affiliated medical department and a university preparatory course. The other schools have also been renamed by the department as Taiwan Provincial Taipei Commercial College, Taiwan Provincial Taichung Agricultural College, and Taiwan Provincial Tainan Industrial College. However, in the past year, there have been many changes due to continuous adjustments. For example, the above-mentioned provincial colleges were changed to the Provincial College of Law and Commerce in January of last year, and Taichung Agricultural College and Tainan Industrial College were changed to established colleges by the department in August of last year. Secondary Education: During the Japanese occupation, there were 18 public middle schools, 20 girls' high schools, and 25 vocational schools. After the restoration, the department sent personnel to take them over separately, and the names of the schools were also changed, and classes continued. In terms of national education: According to the department's statistics in August of last year, there were 1,048 national schools in the province, with 13,524 classes, a total of 890,597 students (including 15,429 students over the school age), and a total of 14,859 teachers. The total number of school-age children in the province was 1,062,527, of whom 875,168 were enrolled, accounting for 82.37%, and 187,359 were not enrolled, accounting for 17.63%. The above figures are slightly better than the statistics before the restoration. As for the total national education expenditure in the province last year, it totaled NT$345,351,492, all of which was the responsibility of the counties (cities) to raise themselves.

### The Xinwen Bao Newspaper Office Recently Established a Journalism Education Scholarship

The journalism departments of the above three universities will each be allocated three places for the third and fourth grades, with each student receiving a subsidy of 1 million national currency per semester. All third and fourth grade students in the journalism departments of the three universities who are healthy, of good character, from impoverished families, and have excellent academic performance, with scores of 85 or above in Chinese, English, history, and geography, may apply to the journalism department of each university in accordance with the regulations, and this will begin in the current semester.

### More Than 300 Students from Private Schools Petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday, Demanding Protection for Impoverished Students to Prevent Them from Dropping Out of School

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Student Academic Protection Association, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, gathered more than 300 students from eighteen middle schools, including Nanmo, Huxin, Jiaotong, Zhaoguang, Jiancheng, Mulun, YMCA, China Women's Middle School, Zhirenyong, Zhengzhong, and East China, and marched to the Municipal Education Bureau to petition, holding paper flags, shouting slogans in front of the square, posting slogans everywhere, and distributing declarations, making four demands: (1) Demand that the authorities immediately issue 500 million yuan in subsidies for private schools to be used as scholarships. (2) Demand that the authorities thoroughly investigate all accounts of educational loans and issue the remaining educational loan funds, using all principal and interest as scholarships. (3) Demand that the authorities protect impoverished students, allowing them to attend classes first, to prevent them from dropping out of school. (4) Demand a substantial increase in educational funding to 35% as stipulated by the constitution, subsidizing private schools, improving teacher salaries, and reducing the burden on parents. Director Xie of the Secondary Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau replied: (1) The municipal government has not yet issued the 500 million yuan subsidy for private schools, and an application can be made to the municipal government for its issuance. (2) The educational loan matter is the responsibility of the Municipal Education Association, and the Education Bureau can send someone to investigate thoroughly. (3) The Education Bureau expresses deep sympathy for helping impoverished students and preventing them from dropping out of school, and has previously issued an order to all schools to set a quota of 20% for full exemptions and 10% for half-fee exemptions. If all schools in the city with 80,000 middle school students can earnestly comply with this regulation, then 16,000 students can be fully exempt and 8,000 students can be half exempt. The Education Bureau is currently thoroughly investigating whether the schools are complying. If the quota for free places is full and there are still impoverished students, then I can personally request the principals of the schools to allow them to be free or half fee. In short, the Education Bureau has tried every means to ensure that all impoverished students have books to read. Regarding the guarantee of allowing them to attend classes first, if an application for free or half fee has been submitted but not yet approved, they can attend classes first and complete the formalities later. (4) Raising educational funding must be submitted by the municipal government to the Municipal Council for a decision, and the Education Bureau also hopes to achieve this. Director Xie also said that individual problems can be resolved individually and there is no need for collective activities. Each school can fill out a form for its impoverished students and submit it to the Education Bureau for review. If they are indeed impoverished, a guarantee will be provided to ensure that they do not drop out of school. The petitioning students were satisfied and dispersed at 5:15 p.m.

### Soochow Physics Professor, Lu Hongyu, Returns to China

Dr. Lu Hongyu, Professor of the Physics Department of Soochow University, went to the United States in the summer of 1941 and entered the Virginia Polytechnic Institute to specialize in industrial physics. A year later, the school, recognizing Lu's excellent academic performance, hired him to stay at the school as a lecturer. In 1943, Lu went to Johns Hopkins University to study spectroscopy in order to further his studies, and at the same time, he accepted a commission from the U.S. War Production Board to research specialized problems. In 1945, Dr. Robertson, the director of the Physics Department of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, personally went to Johns Hopkins and urged Lu to return to the school to serve as an associate professor. Last fall, when the United Nations General Assembly was held in the United States, Lu and Dr. Wei Xueren represented China at the scientific and technical group of the Atomic Energy Commission, bringing together atomic energy experts from Britain, the United States, France, Canada, the Netherlands, and other countries to discuss the issue together. Recently, due to the repeated urging of Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University, in the United States, he resigned from his position at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and returned by ship. He arrived at the end of last month, just as the spring semester of Soochow University began. The faculty and students of the entire university were extremely pleased that Professor Lu, who has an international reputation, had returned to the school, making the faculty of the Soochow University School of Science even more complete. A few days ago, Lu went to Beijing to report to the relevant authorities on his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly. After completing his official duties, he will return to Suzhou to teach.

Dr. Yang Yongqing Will Return to China Soon

It is also learned that Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University and a renowned diplomat, engaged in international propaganda work in the United States during the Anti-Japanese War, and his contributions were very great. Since the victory, he intended to return to China immediately to preside over the work of restoring the school. However, Ambassador Gu Weijun strongly urged him to go to England to assist in the preparations for the United Nations. He then returned to the United States and was appointed as an advisor to the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Most of the important speeches given by Ambassador Gu, the chief representative of China, at the General Assembly were written by Yang. Yang also represented China on the Economic and Social Council, a mission of great importance, which delayed his departure. Now that the United Nations General Assembly closed in December of last year, and Yang's fundraising for the restoration of Soochow University among American churches is also coming to an end, he will be able to return to China with funds in the near future to meet the urgent needs of Soochow University.

Dr. Sheng Zhenwei Will Go Abroad for Study

As for Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, the acting president of Soochow University, is a famous legal scholar in China. In recent years, in addition to presiding over the affairs of the university's law school, he has also served as the acting president, enabling Soochow University to quickly restore its school in one and a half years. It is reported that Sheng will soon go to Europe and the United States with Wu Shangying, the secretary-general of the Legislative Yuan, to study law.

### Jiaotong University Basketball Team Loses to Chengyou Red

[Report from this newspaper] The Jiaotong University basketball team and Chengyou Red held a friendly match at the university's gymnasium at 7:30 p.m. last night. More than 1,000 Jiaotong University students watched the game. The match was not very exciting. Li Zhenzhong was not present, so the small cat could not catch the big mouse. Although they were able to force a 14-14 tie in the first half, they ultimately lost to Chengyou Red with a score of 28-39 due to bad luck. The match report is as follows:

After the referee Zhang Jianbing blew the whistle, Jiaotong University's Yang Xiehe made the first score with a layup under the basket. Chengyou Red's He Zheng sent a long shot and scored two consecutive goals. Li Miaocheng and Tao Rongshi added icing on the cake, and the first quarter ended. Chengyou Red took the lead with a score of 8-2. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Jiaotong University quickly chased after them, and Shen Beizhang scored first. Yang Xiehe came from all directions, tying the score at 10-10. The first half ended with a 14-14 tie.

After drinking Coca-Cola, they switched sides and fought again. Chengyou Red's offense started again, and He Zheng repeatedly surged forward. Wang Cunrui's long shot was a strange basket. Jiaotong University lacked luck and lacked a central commander. At the end of the third quarter, they fell behind with a score of 22-27. In the final quarter, Jiaotong University was distracted and made many mistakes. The defense was also empty. Yuan Peiyuan was unable to participate in the war due to a hand injury. As a result, Chengyou Red defeated Jiaotong University with a score of 39-28.

### Shanghai is Willing to Host This Year's National Games; Director Gu Invites Hao Gengsheng; Municipal Stadium Can be Repaired in Two Months

Hao Gengsheng, a physical education supervisor from the Ministry of Education, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Jiang Xiangqing, Director of the Municipal Stadium, and under the guidance of Lu Xiangqian, drove to Jiangwan at 12:00 noon yesterday to inspect the Municipal Stadium. They carefully inspected all the buildings, from the Municipal Sports Ground to the Municipal Gymnasium to the Municipal Swimming Pool, regardless of whether they were complete or damaged. They did not neglect even the smallest room. The time spent on the scene totaled two hours. After the inspection, Director Gu resolutely invited Supervisor Hao, saying, "Shanghai is willing to gladly host the 7th National Games, as well as the World Games selection event. The Municipal Stadium will be repaired for the event, and the Chinese World Games delegation is welcome to issue an invitation to the Olympic Committee in London next year, so that the 1952 or 1956 Games can be held in Shanghai." At 2:30 p.m., the four returned to a Western restaurant on Weihaiwei Road for lunch and discussed the matter until 4:30 p.m. Supervisor Hao is scheduled to return to Beijing by early train today. There may be new developments in the National Games in the short term. Furthermore, engineers estimated yesterday that the Municipal Stadium can be repaired within two and a half months.

### A New Artery for Developing the Economy of Fujian Province: Surveying the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway

— Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 3rd Day of the Month, Our Newspaper Correspondent Chen Zhengyu

As early as the 15th year of the Republic, Southern Fujian sought to facilitate the smooth flow of trade in local specialties and thus pooled funds to construct the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway. This route started in Fuzhou, heading south through Fuqing, Putian, Hui'an, Jinjiang (Quanzhou), Nan'an, Tong'an, and other counties, reaching Jiaowei, where it connected with the Zhang(zhou)-Song(yu) Highway. The entire length was 297 kilometers. At the time, it was built in sections, and it was not until the 18th year of the Republic that the entire line was opened to traffic. Although the road surface engineering did not reach standardization, it had become the only lifeline of communication in Southeast China and one of the most frequently used transportation routes in Fujian Province.

During the War of Resistance in the 27th year of the Republic, Xiamen Island fell successively. The road, built along the coast and located in a crucial area, was ordered to be thoroughly destroyed. The original 253 beams and 168 culverts and 504 water pipes along the entire line were almost completely damaged. Even the famous Luoyang Bridge in Hui'an, which was 530 meters long, was blown up. Most of the roadbed along the entire line was turned into fields. The thoroughness of the destruction is evident.

After the victory, the authorities of Fujian Province believed that the repair of the road was closely related to the economic development of Fujian Province and planned to start the repair work immediately. However, given the financial situation of the provincial authorities, they were absolutely unable to complete this vast project. Therefore, after further consultations with the central authorities in Beijing and Shanghai by Zhu Daijie, the head of the Provincial Construction Department, and Zhang Jiucheng, the head of the Provincial Highway Bureau, the Road Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Fujian Construction Department jointly undertook the road reconstruction project. It is scheduled to be completed in June this year, at which time the entire line should be open to traffic.

Principles of Supply from All Parties Confirmed

In addition to the earthwork for the entire line, which has been restored by utilizing the national compulsory labor service to conscript laborers from various counties along the line, the remainder is the construction of bridges, culverts, waterways, and road surface paving. Initially, the Provincial Construction Department sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey with UNRRA engineer Grace, and they all agreed that it was appropriate to build the road with machinery. UNRRA can allocate road-building machinery to Fujian, but more than 12,000 yuan is still required for technical expertise, transportation costs, wages, and raw materials. Since the provincial government has limited financial resources, it petitioned the central government for allocation. Later, due to severe price fluctuations, the budget had to be increased and revised. After Director Zhang repeatedly consulted with the central government, the Ministry of Communications agreed to subsidize 1.5 billion yuan for the project costs and allowed the allocation of more than 5,000 tons of cement needed for the entire road at a price of 1.55 billion yuan, including transportation costs. The provincial government is responsible for 2 billion yuan of the project costs. Therefore, the central and provincial governments are jointly responsible for approximately 5 billion yuan. UNRRA will supply road-building machinery and equipment such as steel bars, corrugated pipes, bulldozers, crushers, rock drills, road graders, concrete mixers, repair machines, material transport vehicles, and all the necessary fuel consumption for the machinery. CNRRA will be responsible for wages and transportation costs for the machinery (including temporary docks for loading and unloading machinery and the construction of simple access roads), totaling 7.2 billion yuan. Therefore, excluding machinery and fuel, the total cost of labor and materials for this road is approximately 12.2 billion yuan. The principles of supply from all four parties have been confirmed, and a contract has been signed. The Ministry of Communications has specially assigned the Third Mechanical Road Construction Brigade of the Road Bureau to Fujian to assist in technical work a month ago.

To facilitate the progress and management of the project, the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Reconstruction Project Office was established on October 12 last year, with Zhang, the head of the Highway Bureau, concurrently serving as the director. According to Director Zhang's statement to reporters, if the supply from all parties does not encounter problems and prices do not affect the budget, the road can be completed in six months.

The Entire Line is Divided into Six Sections for Construction

According to the project office's plan, the entire line is divided into six sections for construction. The road-building machinery supplied by UNRRA is expected to be shipped from Shanghai to Fujian around early February. Before the arrival of this machinery, the project office has completed most of the bridge and culvert projects in the first section, and the Third Mechanical Road Construction Brigade of the Road Bureau has set out to prepare for construction in the second to sixth sections.

Paving with Hard Work and Sweat

The road is 297 kilometers long and is located in the area with the best climate, densest population, and abundant products in Fujian Province. According to informal estimates, the population in the areas along the line and its branches reaches 7 million, accounting for approximately 60% of the total population of the province. Because the area along the line is in a subtropical zone and the climate is regulated by sea breezes, it is very suitable for fruit cultivation. After the road is repaired, it can stimulate overseas remittances from overseas Chinese and overseas investment, which is equivalent to opening a source of wealth for Fujian Province. At the same time, the prosperity of the rural areas in southeastern Fujian is sure to be just around the corner.

When the reporter set off to visit the starting point of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway, the workers told the reporter that the paving of this roadbed alone was done by hundreds of thousands of laborers along the line who braved the heat and resisted wind and snow, paving it with their hard work and sweat for a long time. For the smooth flow of traffic and the post-war reconstruction of the country, they shed blood and sweat without complaint. According to Director Zhang, the use of machinery to build roads in the country, except for the Yunnan-Burma Road under British technical support, is still a pioneering effort. The road is 6 meters wide and the road surface is 20 centimeters thick, which is considered a new highway with very high standards. Moreover, due to the use of machinery for construction, the roadbed is solid, and in places with excessive curves, rock drills can be used to widen the road surface to ensure driving safety.

People in Beijing and Shanghai Will Be Able to Eat Inexpensive Fujian Fruit in the Summer and Autumn This Year

The reporter frequently asked Director Zhang about the difficulties in the construction process of this road. Zhang quickly shook his head. He replied that there were no technical problems, but the price fluctuations in Fujian Province were too severe to control the budget. In extremely difficult circumstances, the aforementioned 12.2 billion yuan of project costs have been pooled together. Will it be enough for the second half of the construction? If the project costs have to be increased again due to price fluctuations, it will be a major problem, because the expenses borne by all parties for this road have reached saturation.

However, Zhang repeatedly told reporters that no matter what, we will continue to work on it. In short, the road must be repaired. Yes, the suffocation of Fujian's economy is due to the sluggish sales of Fujian's specialties. Facilitating the export trade of Fujian's specialties will not only help the people of Fujian, but also help international trade. Can't Fujian's tea and lacquerware earn foreign exchange? The completion of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road is undoubtedly the lifeline of Fujian's economic recovery. Director Zhang has been engaged in engineering for nearly 20 years and participated in the engineering design of the Yunnan-Burma Road during the War of Resistance, and he has a wealth of experience. The proposal to repair the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road this time was made by Director Zhang to the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, and he obtained the consent and support of the central authorities. Today, Fujian Province's finances are extremely tight, but Director Zhang and Zhu Daijie, the head of the Construction Department, both have firm confidence in the restoration of this road. The reporter believes that under the hard work of the two, the entire line can be opened to traffic in June this year, adding a splendid chapter to the history of Fujian's highways and benefiting the people of Fujian. Moreover, after the road is opened, the export of fruit from southeastern Fujian will be facilitated, and because of the reduction in transportation costs, prices will fall. People in Beijing and Shanghai will be able to eat inexpensive Fujian fruit in the summer and autumn this year.

### The Yellow River Wound is Not Yet Healed: Xue Dubi Arrives in Zhengzhou to Revise the Prescription

— Zhengzhou Dispatch, 4th Day of the Month, Lie Bing

The issue of closing the Huayuankou breach is being debated by the government and the CCP. At the same time, as the Yellow River's ice flood rises and ice floes have already rushed out to the breach, Xue Dubi, Chairman of the National Water Conservancy Committee, suddenly flew in from Beijing on the 28th of last month to inspect the breach closure project and held a meeting at Huayuankou the next day to discuss it for two consecutive days. The breach closure project has reached an urgent stage.

In early December last year, the breach closure bureau replenished the wooden stakes that were washed away during the Fupi period and actively threw stones to build a stone dam under the temporary bridge, raising the water level upstream of the breach by about two meters. The project was progressing very smoothly. On the night of the 27th, a gale did a good deed, urging the

Yellow River

to rush through the diversion channel breach and enter the old channel. The hope of closing the breach was about to become a reality. Unexpectedly, the CCP, like before the Fupi flood last year, came out to cause trouble again when the breach closure was about to be completed, raising issues other than technical ones on January 5th. While Xue Dubi was negotiating with UNRRA and the CCP in Shanghai, the water level of the Yellow River in Shanzhou was rising, and by the time of the second negotiation, the flow had exceeded the highest record of previous ice floods, increasing to over 2,320 cubic meters per second. Eight rows of wooden stakes in the middle section of the breach's temporary bridge followed the flow one after another within three days. Around the Lunar New Year's Eve, there was heavy snowfall in various parts of the Northwest for days, and the construction site was swept by biting winds, with snowflakes swirling and falling. A stone-throwing worker was blown off the temporary bridge into the river and almost became a frozen chicken. The diversion channel that had already been flooded froze over, and the water could only flow slowly from the bottom of the river, reducing the flow by two-tenths compared to the original flow. Such a drastic change is truly astounding, and it is no wonder that Director Zhu of the breach closure bureau shed tears and sighed long on the night of New Year's Eve.

On the morning that Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, the flood control project in the Zhoukou area of the Shaying River basin also faced great

danger

due to the impact of ice floes. Although there were two ice-breaking teams downstream of Tongguan using explosives to break the ice, the ice floes flowing into the Shaying River in Zhoukou were still one centimeter thick and the size of a tabletop. On that day, on the northwest corner of the Beizhai in Zhoukou, between the Ying Shui Temple and the Lao Gui Wo, the rough hemp ropes on the sweeper, which was more than a li long and made of bricks and willow branches, were cut off by the ice blades. Near the Beiguan in Shuizhai, sixty li downstream of Zhoukou, the water level rose to 3.2 meters, and the water surface was level with the fourth-level embankment. If it rose another two meters, the Yellow River would overflow the riverbed and flood the fields. The embankment project above Yuanzhai between Zhoukou and Shuizhai was also washed away by ice floes and rapid currents for eighty meters. In recent days, the weather has warmed, and the Shaying River has begun to thaw, but the river surface upstream of Huayuankou is still flowing with ice. Generally speaking, the ice flood will roughly end after the Lunar Lichun (February 4th), but the early spring wind melts the ice floes before the extreme flood, and the water level will also rise, and the water势 will inevitably become more turbulent, and the flood control project on the Shaying River may face extremely dangerous phenomena. As for whether there will be problems in Huaguokou, no one dares to make a judgment in advance, and even Director Zhu did not anticipate the recent changes on the breach.

So when will the breach closure project be completed? Two days before Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, the breach closure bureau had re-proposed a plan, deciding to change the original method of flat closure to

vertical closure

The so-called vertical closure is to first build side dams and crib dams on both sides of the temporary bridge, proceeding simultaneously from east and west, extending to the middle, and closing the intact part of the bridge. Then, sunken willow mattresses are thrown in the gap without wooden piles to completely close the breach. In addition, a diversion channel is dug downstream of the breach (old riverbed). The supplementary materials required are 24 million catties of willow branches and reeds, and a total of 80,000 of three types of wooden piles, which the bureau will price and ask the six counties near the construction site, Zheng County, Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Guangwu, Yuanwu, and Yangwu, to purchase on its behalf, with a deadline for complete delivery by the end of February. The purchase price of the materials, totaling 1.17 billion yuan, has been distributed to the counties by the bureau. After Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, he made a final decision to increase the originally planned one diversion channel to three in order to allow half of the river's flow to enter, and the impact force on the breach would also be reduced by half.

The work of building side dams and crib dams has now begun, and the materials purchased by the counties are being transported urgently in recent days.

At the gap in the Yellow River levee at Huayuankou, a difficult-to-treat sore, it has been ten full months from the beginning of the operation to today, and after two "deadlines," the wound has not yet healed and healed. The main reason is that problems outside of the technique are interfering, and at the same time, the water of the Yellow River is more difficult to grasp than a woman's heart, and often when you touch the edge of her heart, her heart changes again. It is said that Xue Dubi came to Zheng to revise the original diagnosis and hope that problems other than technical ones will no longer occur, and even more hope that the water of the Yellow River will no longer be coquettish. Then, before the Meiyu flood in April, let us all celebrate the completion of this great project.

### Like Kuling, Also Like Rome! The Magnificent Golden Gate Bay

— San Francisco Dispatch, 4th Day of the Month, Our Newspaper Correspondent Mao Shuqing

Here, I need to introduce the geographical situation of San Francisco. San Francisco is a name that can be large or small, just like the difference between New York and "Greater New York." When people usually say New York City or New York, they are referring to the city center of "Manhattan." The so-called eight million people of New York usually include areas outside of Manhattan such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. San Francisco is the same. Greater San Francisco is an entire bay area, which Americans call the Bay Area. The Bay Area is like a reversed "C" shape, and ships stop inside the C-shaped bay. The gate to the bay is called the "Golden Gate," and the Golden Gate Bridge (the world's most famous bridge) spans the gate. At the two ends of the Golden Gate Bridge are two small peninsulas, and the one in the south is what is known as San Francisco, which is also commonly referred to as Gold Mountain.

Gold Mountain is the commercial center of the Bay Area. The entire peninsula is composed of seven uneven hills, somewhat similar to the "City of Seven Hills" of ancient Rome. "Rome wasn't built in a day," and Gold Mountain has been developing for nearly a hundred years. Even today, Gold Mountain is not a first-class metropolis in the United States. Many Chinese friends, at least myself, had an overestimation of San Francisco before coming to Gold Mountain. That view is wrong. San Francisco still has only 800,000 people, and its business and municipal administration are far behind first-class cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Detroit. Even taking the entire Gold Mountain peninsula as a whole, the bustling streets and commercial areas occupy only one-ninth of the peninsula.

"All roads in the world lead to Rome," and San Francisco is the same. Gold Mountain is now the starting point and end point of Pacific routes, a necessary stop for airplanes, and the starting point and end point of transcontinental railways and highways in North America. If we put aside these big topics, just look at the Bay Area itself, how many ships are docked across the bay, as well as the famous Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which is actually longer than the Golden Gate Bridge.

The Golden Gate Bridge runs from the southern part of the San Francisco Peninsula to the northern peninsula, which is called Richmond and is also a residential area. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spans the interior of the bay, from the San Francisco Peninsula to Oakland and Berkeley.

### University of California: Affiliated "Chinese College"

Oakland has some factories, newspapers, and large-scale department stores. Berkeley is the location of the University of California and also the most ideal residential area. Oakland and Berkeley were originally connected pieces of land, but they were divided into two areas for ease of distinction and administrative management. For example, California is the province in the United States that produces the most fruit and also the province that produces the most wine. To prevent the students of the University of California from indulging in "cup things," alcohol is prohibited in Berkeley, but in Oakland, you can drink freely. Alcohol and opium are different after all. It feels a bit uneconomical for young American teenagers to run several miles to drink alcohol, and over time, they quit it invisibly.

The University of California includes eight different units. The main campus and school administration center are in Berkeley. The entire school has 40,800 students, including affiliated colleges, making it the largest school in the United States today. The courses in the undergraduate and graduate schools are known for their strictness. The teaching methods are generally similar to those of the University of Chicago, except for the difference between the semester system and the quarter system. President Sproul is famous for his lectures. Americans call him one of the two great orators of modern times. (The other is the late President Roosevelt).

Among the 30,000 students at the main campus, 500 are Chinese students, most of whom are children of overseas Chinese, and less than 100 come from mainland China. There is a "Chinese College" on campus, which specializes in teaching Chinese reading and conversation. There are many American students, but the teaching progress is very slow. Other departments also have many courses on China and the East. A Chinese Dr. Ma teaches Chinese political philosophy and political thought. He has been teaching at the University of California for 15 years, starting as a teaching assistant and gradually progressing. Recently, he was promoted to professor. The University of California's library has a collection of one million volumes, making it one of the five largest libraries in the United States today. The architecture is similar to that of the Columbia University Library. The students' diligence in studying seems to be above that of Columbia University. Behind the library is a bell tower, each floor is named "Sather" in memory of the chief engineer Sather during the construction of the school building. On Sundays, the bell tower is open, and you can take an elevator to the top of the tower to overlook the entire bay.

The University of California's school buildings are built on the mountains, very similar to Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain in Wuchang and Zhijiang University on the Qiantang River in Hangzhou. However, the architecture is more exquisite than Wuhan University, and the scale is larger than Zhijiang University. The University of California's men's and women's gyms and swimming pools are built separately. On the high slopes, there is a secret research house for atomic bombs, and idle people are prohibited from entering.

When domestic students marched to protest against the Soviet Union's stationing of troops in the Northeast provinces, the Chinese Students Association of the University of California also held a response once. The school authorities strictly prohibit students from engaging in political activities, which is different from many other universities in the United States, especially from the various universities in New York.

### Poor Traffic Control: A Tragic Car Accident Occurs

There is a tram every 20 minutes from Berkeley to San Francisco. The traffic in the entire San Francisco Bay Area is convenient. However, in the city, due to poor traffic control, tragic accidents of car crashes and pedestrian accidents often occur. There are still very few traffic lights in San Francisco, and the city is built on seven hills, which are so uneven. Many places are like Chongqing's "Qixinggang." When crossing the road, you have to be nervous.

The second day I arrived in San Francisco, a tragic tram crash occurred, killing one person and injuring fifteen others, including Chinese expatriates. Local newspapers published large photos and news, and there were also news of prosecutors "filing public suits" against the mayor, director of the transportation bureau, and the head of the automobile company.

This is not only a problem in San Francisco, but also a problem in the entire state of California. California is very lovable in every way, except for "racial discrimination" and unlovable traffic control. Last Christmas Eve, there were more than 90 car crashes and accidents across the United States, and California accounted for half of them.

However, the maritime traffic in San Francisco is safe. Between China and the United States, one ship comes and one ship goes, all using San Francisco as a hub. Recently, a ship called the "General MacArthur" came from China, carrying General Jiang Dingwen, Mr. Zou Bingwen, and many other inspectors and students. Customs inspections upon landing are very strict. Many acquaintances were only allowed to land after two days of inspection upon arrival.

### "China Expert" Montgomery

Business relations are gradually becoming active due to the smooth flow of ships. San Francisco has undoubtedly become the center of Sino-American business. The person in charge of this key task is Mr. Montgomery, the head of the Sino-American Business Association, who is a "China expert" with goodwill towards China.

Because I was passing by in a hurry, I did not have time to talk with Mr. Montgomery in depth. However, listening to him talking to other friends, he has recently felt very pessimistic about trade with China. The reason for his pessimism is not the commonly used reasons such as "unstable currency value" and "inconvenient transportation," because these are expected phenomena during the transition period. What Mr. Montgomery feels most pained and indignant about is the mischief of some powerful bureaucratic capital in China. He said: "If this continues, legitimate merchants in both China and the United States will be tied hand and foot to await their doom. The powerful Chinese bureaucratic capital will strangle all economic ties!" I can understand: the inner indignation of the land. However, in any case, San Francisco is always moving in the direction of prosperity and development. Consul General Zhang Zichang said: San Francisco is China's granary. When China becomes strong, San Francisco will inevitably have its future! I miss my motherland, and I like San Francisco even more. Every dusk and night of lights, I often climb alone to the flower garden on the roof of the Hopkins Hotel to overlook this "comet" on the Pacific coast. On Sunday afternoon, Consul Wu Qianghua drove me to tour the entire peninsula. We galloped in Golden Gate Park and wandered along the cliffs of the coast. The waves of the Pacific Ocean alarmed the flocks of seabirds, which flew far, far away, to the other side of the earth that the eye cannot see! (The attached picture to the fifth article of the five-day, ten-thousand-mile journey across North America yesterday was "San Francisco Bay Bridge". This is hereby noted as a correction.)

### The Anatomy of Peace

— Sun Hang

The Anatomy of Peace, by Emery Reves

"A Must-Read Book for Every American" -- The New York Times Review

Humanity has been crying out for peace for perhaps not a short period in history. After every tragic war, with many deaths, bloodshed, and sacrifices of property, humanity always says something to this effect: "Let's not fight again next time!"

But despite humanity's cries, wars have broken out one after another. After hundreds of battles, hundreds of lessons learned, and hundreds of cries, war still follows, so what is the reason for this?

Everyone knows that war is cruel and harmful, but when war breaks out, everyone goes all out. Every nation knows that war is a tragedy, a pain, yet everyone is constantly preparing for war. Why is this?

Many people with concern for the world have already thought about these questions, but their conclusions and methods have not produced the expected results. Take Wilson, for example, with his bodhisattva heart. He poured his heart and soul into creating a League of Nations, hoping to grow lasting peace from it, but unfortunately, the League of Nations died after contracting scarlet fever several times. Many peace advocates before him never had such insight, perseverance, and methods as Wilson, but Wilson also failed, which is such a chilling thing!

But the cruelty and sacrifices of the Second World War seem to have had an impact on the kind hearts of good people that is even greater than before. Some have forgotten Wilson and are now starting to remember him, some who turned their backs on Wilson are now turning back to face his direction, and some concerned people have carefully studied Wilson's path and opened up a different path that leads to the same destination as his. In short, more and more people are thinking about peace like Wilson.

Therefore, humanity may now be able to create a miracle and realize the peace they have been crying out for for many years. But for humanity to realize it, it must have a deep understanding of peace, must find out the reasons for the lack of peace, and then find ways to solve it. If humanity misperceives peace and misunderstands the reasons for the lack of peace, even with sincerity and perseverance, peace cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, before we strive for peace, it is really necessary to study peace.

Recently, I read "The Anatomy of Peace" by Emery Reves, and I feel that he has indeed found the crux of humanity's lack of peace. His descriptions and judgments fill me with admiration and respect. This thin book of less than three hundred pages may really be where our humanity's lasting peace lies!

Problem's Core: Narrow Nationalism

This book is divided into three volumes. Before the three volumes, there is also a preface entitled "The Copernican World". In this preface, the author cites historical facts from the past twenty-five years to explain the errors in modern national concepts.

There are no less than seventy or eighty countries standing in the world today, but they all have a common prejudice, believing that their own country is the center of the world. They observe the things of the world from the perspective of their own country, and they engage in various international activities based on the interests of their own country. Therefore, the same fact looks like this from one country's perspective and like that from another country's perspective. In this way, each country only thinks of itself, and true mutual understanding and tolerance become absolutely impossible.

This situation is very similar to the Ptolemaic theory in natural science. Ptolemy published his theory that the Earth is the center of the universe in the second century. According to his view, the Earth is a stationary center, and the sun, moon, and stars revolve around it. This theory was overturned by Copernicus only in the sixteenth century, but it had dominated for more than fourteen hundred years.

Our current view of the world and of the place of countries in the world is completely similar to Ptolemy's theory. Ptolemy's theory has been overturned, but our theory of the nation as the center of the world remains unshakable, which is such a mistake!

In the following three volumes, the author elaborates on this view as much as possible and uses various facts to prove his arguments.

In the first volume, the author criticizes capitalism, socialism, and religion. He believes that capitalism has completely failed, because the most central idea of capitalism is free enterprise and free trade. But in fact, in order to enhance their economic power, most countries have subjected free enterprise to the control of national authorities, and free trade has become a tool of the state due to the high tariff barriers and the worsening trade competition between countries. The experiment of socialism in the Soviet Union has also proved its failure. As the author says, "The Soviet Union is not developing towards democracy, but towards state control." Communism is no longer an end, it is merely a means, a means of moving towards nationalism. Religion is the same, it has lost its doctrine of universal brotherhood. Religious people pray for the glory of their motherland, and the concept of the nation has transcended their religious beliefs.

In this situation, many countries have moved towards fascism. Capitalism and socialism no longer have significant differences, they are both moving in the same direction, towards national supremacy.

War and Sovereignty: Need a Thorough Understanding

In the second volume, the author goes on to explain the meaning of war and sovereignty. He believes that war is inevitable when two groups each with absolute sovereignty exist in the same world without an organization above them that can limit them. For example, many wars in history were conflicts between tribes, or conflicts between dynasties, until these tribes or dynasties merged into a unified state, their disputes could be eliminated. Modern countries each have absolute sovereignty and can never be slightly restricted or abandoned, so war is of course inevitable. But as long as we have a government above the nation that can restrict national sovereignty and a common law to abide by, national disputes can be reduced like tribal or dynastic disputes.

But what should be the form of this government and this law? Is it like the League of Nations, or the United Nations organization?

In order to answer this question, the author criticizes the beliefs of the League of Nations and the United Nations—internationalism, national self-determination, and collective security—in the third volume.

The author believes that internationalism is incompetent and cowardly. Countries are on an equal footing, and even if they are bound by treaties, their competition remains the same. National self-determination has divided the world into more units. Moreover, true national self-determination is impossible to achieve in the current situation. For example, if the United States wants to determine its own fate, and Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, can it still determine its own fate? Can you say that all its decisions and policies are self-determined? Poland wants to determine its own fate, but when Germany threatens it and breaks down its door, can it still determine its own fate? Without a fair and powerful organization above the nation, national self-determination is impossible.

Collective security is the same. The author says, "Without collective sovereignty, collective security is meaningless." Any alliance, League of Nations, United Nations, or other organization is merely dividing the world into several sovereign units; desperately trying to maintain the existing state, it can never progress with the progress of the world.

In short, in this world, nationalism has dominated all democracy, socialism, liberalism, Christianity, capitalism, fascism, politics, religion, and economics. "Nationalism is soda water," the author says, "and when it is added to any beverage, it will make it fizz."

World Government: The Conclusion of Concerned People

Therefore, only by establishing a world government and formulating a world law to restrict the arbitrary and expansive actions of nations can world peace be hoped for.

Mr. Reves is a concerned person, he has found the cause of war for us and has opened up a plan for peace. People all over the world should read his book and study his views for the sake of peace.

After the book was published, twenty celebrities from the American academic community published an open letter for him, saying: "We hope that all Americans will read this book...." The New York Times review also said: "If ten or twenty million people read or discuss this anatomy of peace, it will definitely benefit the world." I also hope that not only Americans, but people all over the world can read this book; not only should they read it, but they should also be able to put his ideals into practice, then world peace can be expected in the near future.

### Review of "China's Wartime Politics"

— Zhao Shichuan

Original title: China's Wartime Politics (1937-1944)

By Lawrence K. Rosinger, Princeton University Press, 1945

It is a very regrettable thing that Chinese people are generally not interested in Chinese politics. This can be proved by the fact that we have very few books on our own politics. Books like this are naturally not easy to write, especially in our environment, but our neglect of this aspect is undeniable.

This book is a book written by a foreigner about the political situation in China during the war, with a total of only one hundred and thirty-three pages. Unfortunately, more than half of it is occupied by relevant documents (such as the Prime Minister's will, the May Fifth Constitution Draft, and the important declarations of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party). It is of course impossible to write about China's eight-year War of Resistance in less than sixty pages. Therefore, as stated in the preface, this book only mentions a few important developments in the politics of free China.

The book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is "Political Background", with a total of twenty-two pages, which is considered the longest. In addition to describing the different classes that make up Chinese society, this section also provides a concise description of the Kuomintang's revolutionary history and its relationship with the Communist Party. The second chapter is "Unification and Resistance", with a total of nineteen pages. This chapter mentions: the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the long-term war of resistance, Wang Jingwei's peace movement, and the Anhui Incident of the New Fourth Army in 1941 and its impact. The third chapter, "Chongqing and its Political Changes," is considered more important, but it is only seventeen pages long. The author discusses here: the personnel and organization of the wartime government, President Chiang, the Kuomintang, the Political Participation Council, the central government and the provinces, the constitutional movement, etc. Due to space limitations, these important topics are described very briefly, but they are not without pertinent points.

From the above outline, we can know that this book was not originally intended for Chinese readers. Its purpose is to give Westerners who are unfamiliar with Chinese politics a concept. It may occasionally allow readers to better understand the origins of the current complex political situation in China. If this book has any value, its value lies here.

### Introduction to a Soviet Children's Book "Stories of Lenin"

— Xin Jun

[Originally written by M. Zoshchenko, translated by Cao Jinghua, first edition in Shanghai, January 1947]

Young people need to know about the life and achievements of a great man. In particular, middle school students will benefit more from reading this type of story book than from the popular myths and legends, and they can also gain a lot of knowledge.

This "Stories of Lenin" is very suitable for general middle school students to read. It simply depicts Lenin's life, and these stories are based on factual materials. The whole book includes twenty stories about Lenin, and each story expresses a characteristic of Lenin. The original author, Zoshchenko (M. Zoshchenko), is a famous Soviet writer who is very good at writing excellent children's stories. Because of his excellent creations, he was awarded a medal by the Presidium of the Soviet Union in January 1939. From this, it can be seen that his writing skills are very skilled.

The translator has a very good comment on this work: "Stories of Lenin can be said to be a new discovery in children's literature. It is not easy to narrate Lenin's life in simple language, in a relaxed and pleasant form of children's literature, in a simple and natural way." Indeed, the author's expression is very simple, but the content is very rich. The translator also said: "The portrayal of Lenin's character is exceptionally profound. Lenin's great image does not feel overwhelmed in these short stories." In this book, the two stories "The Bee" and "Stories of Lenin" are the most profoundly depicted. The remaining stories, such as: The Glass Bottle, How Lenin Learned, How Lenin Quit Smoking, Lenin's Clever Plan to Escape the Police, Buying Toys for a Little Child, In the Barber Shop, Lenin and the Stovemaker, Hunting, etc., are all described very concisely and clearly. The form of the text is very relaxed and beautiful. There are also five illustrations to help readers' interest.

As the translator said in the conclusion: "Not only do children find this work infinitely interesting, but adults are also very moved by it. Because there is not only the image of Lenin that children imagine in their hearts, but also the image that adults imagine in their hearts." Indeed, this book has this condition.

### Publication News

The Cultural Life Publishing House issued a series of "Juvenile Readings", the first issue of its fourth volume commemorates the special issue of Mr. Lu, the founder of the journal, and also includes Ma Zongrong's "What to Study, How to Study?", Gu Junzheng's "Light and Color", Liu Beifan's "Winter", and Yi Wen's "New Year's Sentiments". Long serializations include: Biography of the French Geographer Shao Kezong (translated by Bi Xiu Shao), and the Relationship between Modern Mathematics and Humanity (translated by Huang Shang) are all worthy of being called beneficial "Juvenile Readings".

### Two or Three Things About Wen Tianxiang

— Tan Zhengbi

Liu Yi, Liu Zhu, and Liu Mu

When Tianxiang was in exile, he changed his name to avoid the attention of the enemy. The records in various books are different. According to "Notes on Miscellaneous Poems of the Southern Clan":

Wen Tianxiang arrived in Zhenjiang and fled with his guests Du Hu and others at night. Tianxiang then changed his name to Liu Yi of Qingjiang and entered the seaside to the east.

But "Dongshan Tan Yuan" says: Wenshan traveled by sea from Huai to the border of Taizhou, and changed his name to Liu Zhu of Qingjiang, writing a poem for Zhang Zhezai of Huangyan County for the Green Ripple Hall. The two books are written as Liu Yi and Liu Zhu, respectively, and there are discrepancies. Therefore, "Compilation of Anecdotes of Song People" added an editor's note after citing these two notes: According to these two notes, one is written as Liu Yi and the other is written as Liu Zhu. It is suspected that the one written as "Yi" is just a slip of the pen. In fact, there is no need to suspect it. We can decide it by checking "Zhinan Lu". In "Zhinan Lu", there is indeed a poem for "Green Ripple Hall", and its preface says; I went to the shore of Taiwan by sea boat, to the Zhang family at the city gate, who were descendants of the famous general Yongde in the early days of the country. The host called himself Zhezai, and built a hall to teach his son, with the plaque "Green Ripple", and composed eight lines.

It does not mention the changing of the name here, but in the preface to the following poem "Passing Huangyan", it says: I went to Huai and changed my name, and when I reached the border of Tiantai, Zhang Zhezai (?), For me to find (?) Green Ripple poem. After I composed it, I wrote: Written by Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. This passes Huangyan, sending twenty characters.

It is known that "Jianshan Tan Yuan" was written according to this, but Zhang Zhezai was clearly a native of Taizhou, but he was referred to as Huangyan County, which was a temporary mistake by the author.

After reading the above textual research, it can be confirmed that Tianxiang changed his name to Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. But I don't know if Liu Zhu really existed, and was also a contemporary of Tianxiang, or even a fellow villager. Later, his whole family was martyred for the country. This is not a coincidence, but Tianxiang deliberately used the names of enthusiastic people as his own names. However, "Song History" does not record his name, only Liu Yueshen's "Biography of Chancellor Wen" mentions the name. If it were not for Deng Guangjian's "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office", then such a patriotic man of lofty ideals who associated with Tianxiang would be buried and no one would know about him. The biography says:

Liu Zhu, whose name was Yuanbo, was a neighbor of the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister was good at elephant chess, Zhu, although not his opponent,

However, he pondered and forgot the day and night, his words were vulgar and low

, and he liked it because of this. Following the King's Service,

He was called Liu Military Supervisor, leading a single army, as

Supervising the Prime Minister's Guards. He was flexible and responsive,

Answering tirelessly. When he suddenly fell ill, the defeat of the empty

Pit, he was arrested and taken to Longxing, and was harmed on the same day as his eldest

Son. The second son died in the chaos,

The youngest son died in Guang.

If the soldiers of a country were all like this, how could the country be destroyed? But like this kind of patriotic man of lofty ideals, after sacrificing their lives for the country, their names are buried and not known to the public. From ancient times to the present, I don't know how many there have been. Even in this national crisis, there are many who were once reported in newspapers at the time, but are now forgotten by everyone. There are even more that are unknown to people. Therefore, the recognition of loyalty and righteousness should be considered a major event by the country, otherwise, it will not only fail to honor the dead in the past, but it will also be difficult to encourage the living in the future.

But this Liu Mu, in the "Wenshan Collection", is written as Liu Zhu. The preface to "Collection of Du Poems" "Liu Mu One Hundred and Twentieth" in Volume 16 of the "Wenshan Collection" says:

Propagating Lang, Secretary of the Governor's Office, Acting Secretary of the Great Government

Temple, Liu Mu, whose name is Yuanbo, is my friend and neighbor. I followed

The King's Service to become an official. I

Was captured, and Boyuan led the armies back. When I

Returned to the country, Yuanbo gathered his troops and went to the governor's office,

Meeting in Ting, he was in charge of a single army, as

Supervising the Prime Minister's Guards. He was serious and resourceful,

Flexible and responsive. All the loyal and righteous people of Jiangxi, Boyuan

Was the one who summoned them, responding day and night, tireless in energy.……

Is it Liu Mu or Liu Zhu? This may be due to different versions of each book. But if it is certified that the "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office" is Liu Zhu, which is a temporary error by the author, then why is Liu Yueshen's "Biography of Wen Tianxiang" also written as Liu Zhu? Therefore, the only way to solve this problem is to not solve it.

Here, I must also mention Zhang Zhezai, for whom Tianxiang wrote a poem, to see what kind of person he was. His deeds can also be found in the "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office". The biography says:

Zhang Zhezai was a hero on the sea in Taizhou,

He lived in Chengguan Town, and was a descendant of the famous general Yongde in the early days of the country.

When the Prime Minister traveled by sea from Tongzhou and passed Chengguan, Zhezai extended his welcome

And made an agreement to start an uprising. Zhang happily gathered sea

Ships and sent a message to the sea, and the heroes obeyed.

When the Prime Minister arrived at Fuan, he asked to take

Mingzhou himself, but was stopped by Chen Yizhong and Zhang Shijie.

Zhang also stopped due to loss of news. After

Two years, Zhang Hongfan marched south and saw the notice

On the walls, he told the boatmen that he had a

Gap with him, and reported the arrest to the front of the army. Zhezai knew

That he could not avoid it, and said to Hongfan: I was born as

A Song minister, and I will die as a Song ghost, why are you surprised that

I am doing this! Hongfan killed his father and son and destroyed his

Home.

It turned out that he was also a respectable and admirable hero with unyielding integrity, no wonder Tianxiang never forgot him.

Fun Facts about Writers

### Wordsworth

— Shen Si

The great English poet Wordsworth (Willam Wordsworth 1770-1850) was an extremely optimistic person. He also liked to exaggerate and praise himself. Once, the American poet and critic Emerson visited him, and the great poet desperately praised his own poems, and he looked down on others at all. Once, he wrote a letter to the Scottish poet Macky (Charles Macky 1814-1889) saying that he had never read his poems and did not want to read them once.

### Shakespeare in the Soviet Union

— Zhao Jingshen

In the sixties of the previous century, all of Shakespeare's works had been translated into Russian, and several had even been retranslated several times. At the beginning of the new century, Russia's interest in Shakespeare declined slightly, but it gradually prospered again during the Soviet era. At that time, there were Marshak's magical sonnet translations, as well as dramatic translations by Pasternak, Levik, and Tatyana Shchepkina-Kupernik.

Now there are many Russian translations of Shakespeare, for example, Hamlet has at least thirty-six translations.

The best translation in Soviet Russia is that of Ameyani. The first Shakespeare translation was a hundred years ago, and Masyyan's translation has become an important classic of Armenia.

To judge the quality of a translation, it is impossible to criticize it if you do not understand the translation. But the excellence of Masyan's translation has been almost unanimously praised by authoritative Armenian scholars, actors, writers, and poets, and this is indeed a fact.

New Armenian translations continue to be published. Now "Hamlet" has seven translations, "Othello" and "Julius Caesar" have six each, "Macbeth" and "The Merchant of Venice" have five each, and "King Lear" and "Romeo and Juliet" have three each. In addition, there are many translations of dramas.

The most famous old Georgian translation is that of Machabeli. The famous Georgian actor Khorava played Othello using Machabeli's translation. Now many new Georgian translations have also been published.

The earliest Azerbaijani translation was that of Djafar Djabarly, and he also translated it best. He was a famous national writer who passed away ten years ago, and the Baku Theater Museum uses his name to commemorate him. He wrote the script "Bride of the Flames", which is extremely popular in Azerbaijan. He translated Othello in Everan, where Othello was played by a young Azerbaijani actor Ali Zeinand. Macbeth has also been translated into Azerbaijani. Recently, Mirza Ibashlmov translated "Twelfth Night".

The Caucasus has also translated a lot of Shakespeare. For example, some have been translated into Oesetian. Not long ago, Othello was also performed in Kuumyk, the capital of Daghestan. But such translations are rarely printed into books, because they are specifically for the stage.

Before the Russian Revolution, Uzbekistan had almost no theaters, but now there are famous actors who perform Othello and Hamlet. Shakespeare is extremely popular among Uzbeks. Uzbeks have a tradition of wit and often talk and laugh in teahouses, so they are very receptive to Shakespeare's wit. Each language often uses different methods to express the wit of Shakespeare's language. Not long ago, the Uzbek version of Romeo and Juliet was staged. The most interesting thing is that these Shakespeare translations were the first to introduce free verse to the Uzbek poetry world.

The first Cirghiz theater was newly built during the war. This theater opened with "King Lear". The translator translated from the English original and then compared it with the Russian version. This method was widely adopted.

The Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko., the Kiev theater is named after him, and he also praised Shakespeare, and has eleven articles discussing Shakespeare. The most popular Shakespeare play in Ukraine today is Mnch Ado About Nothing, and the actress is the famous actress of the film "Rainbow" Natalia Uzhvy.

In addition, there are many other Soviet countries that translate Shakespeare, with a total of twenty-seven languages.

### Lamp

— Huai Zong

It is a bleak winter night. The north wind outside the door is blowing fiercely. Occasionally, the slight footsteps of one or two pedestrians, from far to near, then from near to far, gradually disappear into the cold wind like a wisp of light smoke. It is a deathly silent winter night!

Every night, I sit alone in front of the kerosene lamp, doing my work. In this desolate suburban room, only this lonely lamp keeps me company. Every night, it stretches out its clear, red tongue of fire, emitting endless, pure light, and I am deeply immersed in this light of a yellow tint. This light has a unique softness and beauty, like milky white light gauze, or like the mist at dawn. I often fall leisurely into the abyss of fantasy.

Don't underestimate this tiny lamp! Although it does not have an outstanding posture or colorful decorations, it brings me lovely light and a pleasant feeling. It drives away the terrifying darkness for me, and it warms my lonely traveler's heart. It makes me feel warm all over, and it makes my blood flow like waves. Moreover, in its light, many masterpieces and great works have leaped into my eyes. It indirectly replenishes my spiritual food and provides sustenance for my spirit. Ah! Great lamp!

The lamp is indeed great. It can conquer the stubborn darkness, making all demons and monsters unable to hide. It ruthlessly reveals the true face of all things. Moreover, it is also kind and loving. It generously gives lovely light to everyone, unless that person is unwilling to accept its sincere gift.

The north wind comes in through the crack in the door, and the lamp goes out. Darkness sneaks in again. I feel like I've fallen into a cellar, and fear strikes my heartstrings. I hurriedly use a match to save its life. It is filled with vitality again, flashing dazzling light, smiling as if to thank me. The life of a lamp is eternal, isn't it? No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, and on nights of wind, frost, rain, or snow, can't traces of lamps be found everywhere?

Under the clear lamplight every night, I have gained great enlightenment. In the lamplight, I understand the true meaning of life.

Therefore, with a lamp, my life is full of vitality. With a lamp, I don't feel empty or lonely. I don't want to listen to jarring music, and I don't want to watch intoxicating singing and dancing, but I want to be forever intoxicated in this quiet and peaceful lamplight.

### Commemorating the Pig Year and Expressing Sentiments Through Objects

— Lu Qingying

In the year of the pig, I try writing in red ink, borrowing you to express my feelings. A dark-faced official comes from overseas (Note 1), a white-haired shepherd boasts in Liaodong (Note 2). One should teach children to be trustworthy, like Mencius (Note 3), cutting grass and calling oneself king is merely self-aggrandizement (Note 4). I fear hearing Wujin disturb the black market (Note 5), the taste of chaff is endlessly delightful (Note 6).

[Note 1] During the peaceful era, people in Guilin were known to enjoy eating frogs. Some who came to the central court as officials were mocked for eating frogs. They replied, "Isn't sitting with worms better than being a dark-faced official?" The dark-faced official refers to a pig. [Note 2] In the Later Han Dynasty, there was a white-haired pig in Liaodong. The shepherd found it unusual and offered it as a tribute. When he reached Hedong and saw that all the pigs were white, he was ashamed and retreated.

[Note 3] In Han Shi Wai Zhuan, when Mencius was young, he asked his neighbor why they were slaughtering a pig. His mother lied to him, saying it was to feed him. Later, she regretted her words and bought meat from the market to feed him to show her trustworthiness.

[Note 4] In the History of the Southern Dynasties, Emperor Ming of the Song Dynasty was obese and was nicknamed "Pig King."

[Note 5] In Chaoye Qianzai, a man in Hongzhou became rich by raising pigs, and pigs were referred to as "Wujin" (black gold).

[Note 6] In Qing Yi Lu, Chen Qiao of the Tang Dynasty ate steamed dumplings and said, "The flavor of chaff is not shallow."

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 167

— Ye Jingfeng

"If we can present the problem, we can all find a reasonable solution, unite as one, and do what needs to be done. Personally, I have no problem; as long as it doesn't hinder the grand plan, I will definitely take the lead." The "grand plan" that Tsurumi speaks of, of course, refers to his own scheme.

Yaoqun, Little Tiger, and I did not speak.

"Very good," Mr. M admired Tsurumi's frankness, "The grand plan absolutely cannot be hindered. This is the only hope we share, and we certainly cannot sacrifice it. ... What exactly is going on?" Mr. M asked himself, as an opening for the question.

"Our organization," Mr. M continued, "has always been very secret. The concealment has been very clever. But since 9 o'clock last night until now, the situation seems to be a little bad."...

"Nine o'clock?" Tsurumi asked, "That was an hour after I arrived here?"

"That's right." Mr. M nodded, "According to the report from the headquarters, in the past twenty-plus hours, someone has been walking past this door every three or four hours. Of course, they can distinguish between ordinary people and secret agents."

"No trailing?" I interjected. At the same time, Yaoqun seemed to have the same question. Little Tiger, however, sneered at it.

"Yes, there was." Mr. M answered affirmatively, "Around 11 o'clock last night, there was a very obvious incident. One of our comrades followed him. He traced him all the way to an apartment in Dongjiaomin Lane. This apartment is diagonally opposite us here, and it also has four floors..."

"Miss Yao, what is your opinion?" Tsurumi specifically asked Yaoqun.

"It's a pity that Little Tiger and I discovered it a little too late, and it slipped away! It only happened an hour ago, and there wasn't enough time to report it."

"Oh? ... What kind of person? One person or several?" Tsurumi asked Little Tiger again.

"Of course, there was only one person." Little Tiger replied, "It's a pity it was a woman, otherwise..."

"What? A woman?" Tsurumi was alarmed.

"No, it should be said, Tiger," Yaoqun lectured Tiger Chen again, "It should be said that the suspicious person we encountered was only one, and she was a very beautiful woman."

"That's right," Mr. M agreed with Tsurumi's question, "There was only one person, and it was indeed a woman. The lookout post on the roof reported that she was also constantly using binoculars on the roof of that apartment. She has good energy; she hasn't rested much in a day and a night."

"Miss Yao, please describe her appearance, maybe I can..."

Yaoqun interrupted Tsurumi before he could finish speaking; "It was just a fleeting glance, I didn't see clearly; about five feet two inches tall: very slender waist, seems to have martial arts skills, and moves very lightly."

"Does she have the characteristics of a Japanese woman?" Tsurumi frowned.

"No, I have seen many Japanese women in Northeast China wearing Chinese clothes, and I can point them out at a glance; because their feet must be short and flat, and when they walk, their toes are turned inward. Even if they are burned to ashes, I can still recognize them..."

"That's not necessarily true," Mr. M also interjected. "Miss Ji, women over twenty years old can be identified in this way, but those under twenty cannot be confirmed."

"That's right," Yaoqun smiled, "It's precisely because she is over twenty."

### Three Short Poems

Ancient Ferry

The river here
Is like the river in my hometown
Wrapped in a slanting sunset
Appearing a bit desolate

Tonight
The autumn wind blows reeds on the shore
The heart longing for home flies with the white clouds
Far, far away

Across the river comes a drunk
Person returning home

Dawn

Walking toward the wilderness
The night is hazy
I put on a body of dew
Searching, searching for that lost star
In my dream

Has it bloomed on the earth
In the hazy night

In the east
The sun gives me a brilliant
Smile

Friend,
Are you still proud?
Look, the white clouds have swallowed your head

Relying on your people
All are living confused lives

### Europe is Also Suffering Tens of Millions are Enduring Hunger and Cold

— Zuo

The situation in England today is worse than during the war. Not only England, but the entire Europe is in the same situation.

Tens of millions of people are enduring the suffering of hunger and cold after the war and are now entering their third week. The resources available to ordinary people today are scarcer than during the war. Only unnatural and sudden deaths are reduced—but sometimes people fear a miserable life even more.

Terrible Storms

Terrible storms have struck throughout England, hindering the transport of coal, the lifeline of industrial economy. Most factories are cut off from electricity, and electricity use in most homes is also restricted.

The British Labor government is facing a brewing first-class political crisis. The war has deprived Britain of its ability to materially overcome this frigid climate, because Britain has been living "hand to mouth" for seven years.

Cold Homes

Two million unemployed workers will return to their cold homes, huddled around stoves burning the last few pieces of rationed coal, eating their limited rationed food.

From 9:00 a.m. to noon, and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., the electricity in London homes is completely cut off. Countless mothers and their babies living in apartments using electric stoves and ovens will fall into a tragic situation.

At the same time, throughout Europe, where cultural standards and material enjoyment are higher than elsewhere, we see such a bleak scene:

Italy has been without electricity for a long time due to the coal shortage. Torrential rains and melting snow have caused disasters, displacing people and forcing the government to take emergency relief measures.

The World's Paradise is Completely Different

Switzerland, a small country, is situated in a continent filled with devastation, like a flourishing paradise, but it cannot avoid the same suffering. Shop windows are not allowed to light electric lights, and restaurants and bars reduce electricity by one-third. Due to the reduction of water in the reservoirs of power stations, the electricity used by various industries is reduced.

Forty-eight people froze to death in Hamburg, Germany, in a recent day. Due to the severe coal shortage, all electricity may soon be cut off.

In Austria, electricity is cut off for six hours a day in households.

The situation in Belgium seems to be about the same as before the war, but Italian workers have moved in to work in the mines. The supply of gas and electricity in the Netherlands has recently been reduced significantly.

In France, in the past few days, the lights in shop windows and other advertising lights have been prohibited, and the amount of electricity used nationwide is decreasing day by day.

### Blessed Land?

— Fang Wen

Some say: "The hearts of Shanghai people are too bad. The rich live in extravagance and waste on weekdays, and their sins are heavy. Therefore, Shanghai will suffer a great calamity."

Some say: "Most Shanghai people respect gods and believe in Buddha. On the first and fifteenth of each month, every family burns long ingots. The Ullambana Festival and Vajra Dharma Assemblies are endless. Their merits are immeasurable, so Shanghai is truly a place to eliminate disasters and receive blessings."

We all still remember that as soon as the Sino-Japanese War began, Zhabei was reduced to ashes, and the Qijiang Road Huishan Wharf staged several earth-shattering and god-weeping street battles. When the national army withdrew westward, the city became scorched earth. Finally, all of Shanghai fell into enemy hands. It cannot be said that Shanghai did not suffer a great calamity. A few days before the victory, the bombing and landing were so intense that there was no time to breathe. Fortunately, two atomic bombs quickly frightened the Japanese invaders into surrendering. Shanghai was able to turn danger into safety at a critical moment. After all, Shanghai is a blessed land!

But, please see what the current situation is like.

### Thoughts Inspired by Filming the "Stealing the Treasury" On Location

— Jian Hua

This newspaper reported that Columbia Pictures is filming "Stealing the Treasury" on location, and will be taking footage of the Bund, Nanjing Road, Nanshi, Longhua Airport, and the City God Temple, and the Bao'an Sidu Temple in this city. "Stealing the Treasury" is a detective film starring Dick Powell, using Washington, San Francisco, Shanghai, Cairo and other places as backgrounds. In order to make the facts convincing, the company traveled all the way across the ocean to Shanghai to film on location. Their serious production and abundant funds are admirable. It is said that the film began shooting in Hollywood on December 8 last year, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. It will be shipped to Shanghai for release in the second half of this year. I think at that time, the men and women of Shanghai will definitely rush to see the local scenery in the foreign film.

However, the City God Temple and Bao'an Sidu Temple in this city have too strong of a superstitious atmosphere. There are old ladies with small feet, and old men with pigtails. There are unsightly fortune-telling and god-seeking activities, and all kinds of beggars in extremely poor conditions. If these are captured on camera, it is not promoting our historical sites, but exposing our ugliness. I hope that the people on our side who are assisting in the filming will pay attention to this.

I personally saw three foreigners in Minhang Town, west of Shanghai, taking pictures of beggars catching lice in the sun and naked, crazy doctors (selling plaster leaves). Their filming seems to always choose such bad subjects. I don't know what the purpose is. In the future, with the bright spring and the roads open to various towns, foreigners' footsteps will inevitably increase. We only hope that in addition to observing customs, they will make sincere suggestions and not joke around and take pictures of a dark and ugly side.

I've said too much and I’m digressing too much, which will cause misunderstandings. Of course, Columbia Pictures' filming on location in this city is different from photography that is specifically looking for jokes, and "Stealing the Treasury" is based on the theme of international cooperation in drug prohibition. The film may be of great help to our country's anti-drug future. We are optimistic about its success and wait and see when the film is released.

The newspaper is full of "rise." Last night, in the typesetting room, several typesetters shouted: "The 'rise' characters are all used up!" It was difficult for the type-casting room to desperately cast "rise."

### Yangjingbang Excerpts

One day, at a movie theater, after the last show had started, a foreigner came to buy a ticket. The ticket seller didn't know whether he was buying for the current show or for the next day, because he didn't understand English, but the foreigner didn't know Chinese either, so someone next to them acted as a translator. He asked the foreigner: "Want seep Not seep Want see inside seei not see, to-morrow see, to-,prrpw see.sa,e see"

What he meant was:

"Do you want to see it? If you want to see it, please go in; if you don't want to see it, come back tomorrow, tomorrow will be the same (no change of film)."

But as a result, the foreigner was confused. (Di Sheng) Writer

### Spring Morning Window (3)

The Beginning of Worry

"The beginning of worry is when one learns to read," it is better not to learn to read.

It seems to be a novel by Gide, writing about a girl who was blind from birth, loved to listen to pastoral symphonies, and imagined the world as very beautiful in her dark world. Later, she suddenly saw the light, opened her eyes and saw that the world was completely different from what she had imagined, and she was greatly disappointed and extremely painful.

This is the beginning of worry when life opens its eyes, it is better to remain blind.

Also Looking

A teenager named Wang Dawei from the Hongqiao School for the Blind lost his sight at the age of three, and has been blind for fifteen years. An Austrian doctor, Professor Fuchs, cured him.

I don't know how Mr. Wang imagined the world in fifteen years. I also don't know what comparisons he has made now.

But, in any case, now he is also watching this world with us. True Algorithm

A person who earns 500,000 yuan a month could originally buy one tael of gold and have some left over. In recent days, the price of gold has been rising, and the salary has been greatly reduced. They can only buy a little more than five qian, which is exactly half.

I don't know how many people have been harmed by this wrong algorithm.

The correct algorithm should be like this: Originally, your salary could only buy five qian of gold, and a few days ago you earned a tael (everyone has this luck), and now it belongs to you, you have not lost anything. Use Deduction

Understanding a little bit of deduction will make you understand the application of this algorithm.

If the price of gold continues to rise, and you still apply the wrong algorithm, of course you will find that your salary has become a discount of 10% or 20%, leaving only one or two qian of gold.

It should be like this: Your salary was originally only one or two qian of gold, but think about the one tael you earned a few days ago, aren't you happy?

Yellow Not Calamity

"Yellow Peril", how to explore? Is gold causing trouble? That's right, people are really dying these days.

But I have never seen a rifle thrown in the corner of a wall suddenly float in the air and kill someone.

Many people die on the battlefield, which is also considered a disaster, right? But have you ever heard of: This is a gun disaster, a cannon disaster, a bomb disaster, and a bayonet disaster?

"Yellow Peril." - No reason.

Earning Extra Money

In the United States, a 71-year-old great-grandmother went to school to learn how to fly a plane. Just in time.

This is quite worthy of promotion in China. I think a law should also be signed: No one under the age of seventy may ride an airplane.

"It is rare to live to seventy since ancient times," the age after seventy is originally extra money. Journalism

Tycoons who have always trusted the government still eat a lot of gold; needless to say, the Communist troops who have never trusted the government.

The Communist army buying gold is not news. Tycoons eating gold is news.

Just like: A dog biting a person is not news, a person biting a dog is news.

Calculating Profit and Loss

When the US dollar fell from 20,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, a friend bought 500 yuan. He earned 1.5 million legal currency.

When the US dollar fell from 17,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan, he sold it again. He lost 1 million.

He earned more and lost less. - My algorithm.
