### Chairman Chiang's Speech at the Assembly Stating Determination to Seek Peace: The Government Still Willing to Resolve National Affairs Politically

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The fourth session, third meeting of the National Political Council (參政會), opened at 10:15 AM on the 20th at the National Assembly Hall. Chairman Chiang and Chairman Zhang Boling of the National Political Council Presidium entered the assembly platform simultaneously amidst the resounding military music. Two hundred and thirty-six Council members were present. Over forty heads of government agencies were invited to attend, including Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhang Ji, Zhou Zhongyue, Zhang Jia, Weng Wenhao, Yu Jiaju, Wu Dingchang, Chen Burei, and Wu Tiecheng. After Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the ceremony with due formality, he delivered the opening address. This was followed by an address from Chairman Chiang of the National Government, who first expressed his gratitude to the Council for its significant contributions to the government during the war and the recovery period. He then stated that the government, in order to achieve social peace and national construction, had sought peace with the utmost patience, but it had been repeatedly undermined by the Communist Party. However, the government's determination to achieve political democratization and nationalization of the military would not be interrupted by the Communist Party's obstruction. If the Communist Party were to abandon its attempt to seize power by force and implement all previously reached agreements, the government would still resolve national affairs through political means. After the speech, Yu Bin delivered a response on behalf of the Council members, and the ceremony concluded.

[Another dispatch] The first meeting of the National Political Council was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 20th, with a political report to be given by Premier Zhang Qun.

### Zhang Boling's Opening Address

[China News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The third session of the fourth National Political Council opened on the 20th. Chairman Zhang Boling delivered the following opening address: "Today is the day of the third session of the fourth National Political Council. It is with immense pleasure that I, Boling, reunite with my colleagues. Recalling that since the establishment of this Council, nine years have passed and over twelve meetings have been held. Except for the last time when I was unable to attend due to illness, I have participated in all of them. I am fortunate to have recovered and have the opportunity to participate again, and I would like to briefly share my personal thoughts with all of you for your consideration. The reason for the establishment of this Council was that the government decided on the national policy of resisting Japan, which required national unity, sincerity, and solidarity, to concentrate strength and will in order to achieve ultimate victory. During the war of resistance, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, soldiers sacrificed their lives and shed blood for the country, and the people of the whole country endured hardship and suffering. Finally, we were able to overcome the powerful enemy and restore our land. The colleagues of this Council, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, spoke freely and exhaustively on the government's major policies and matters that should be promoted or reformed. I believe that within the scope of our authority, we have made our utmost efforts. The National Political Council is indeed a glorious page in the history of the war of resistance. For the first sixty years of my life, Boling spent almost entirely in national humiliation and disaster. I personally experienced these national humiliations and disasters, and I feel deeply pained. I believe that colleagues who are slightly older than me feel the same way. Boling grew up in Tianjin. The old concessions of Tianjin were the concrete manifestation of unequal treaties and the source of all evil. Chinese people living in the concessions could gradually forget that they were Chinese. As long as there were concessions, China could not stand up. But now, the invading enemy has been defeated, the concessions have been recovered, and the unequal treaties have been abolished. From now on, China can be as good as it wants to be, without any restrictions or obstacles. China has gained freedom.

Furthermore, Boling recently returned from abroad and observed the international situation. Although there are still many unresolved disputes, avoiding war and seeking peace is the unanimous wish of the great powers. China's position in the international arena, some say, is declining again, and its responsibility lies in the world's problems. China's opinions are still valued. Regarding China's own problems, we oppose international intervention, and the international community cannot interfere. This is incomparable to the past when foreigners in China could take whatever they wanted and arbitrarily divide spheres of influence. China's position is much higher than it was ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago. China's current position in the international arena is at a peak that has not been seen in the past fifty years. China has gained equality.

Therefore, looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, from a broad perspective and a long-term perspective, China's future is truly bright. The current difficulties are inevitable, but the brightness of the future is beyond doubt!

The reason why the current difficulties cause people to be depressed or even disappointed is that our hopes are too extravagant. Victory came too quickly. We were not prepared, and victory came. Our efforts were not enough, and we won victory. We did not drive the enemy out of the country, and the enemy surrendered. This victory was too cheap. Cheap victory has given us many wrong perceptions and delusions. We thought that because we won, our efforts must have been enough, and our efforts were enough to exchange for victory. This is a mistake in perception. We thought that after victory, everything would be solved easily without any effort, and the fruits of victory would come naturally. We thought that peace and prosperity after victory could be obtained easily. We thought that since the war of resistance had been won, the work of recovery would not be troublesome, and the work of national construction would naturally begin. We thought that since we could resist foreign aggression, we could definitely maintain domestic stability. These are all our delusions. At the beginning of the victory, Boling was also one of the delusional ones. Now I realize my mistake. The cheap victory led to delusions and extravagant hopes, and extravagant hopes led to disappointment, because victory came cheaply, and we felt that the current difficulties were unexpected.

The current difficulties are indeed serious. The most serious is the economic difficulty, and the main reason for the economic difficulty is that everyone thinks it is due to the domestic war. The country needs unification, but there is armed conflict within the country. The people need stability, but what exists is only disturbance and chaos. It is the duty of the state to seek the welfare of the people. If the domestic war continues, the people will not be able to survive. This is the reality. Therefore, domestic peace has become the most urgent issue. The responsibility of the National Political Council is to express public opinion and advise the government. Boling believes that we can take domestic peace as the theme of this meeting, discuss the issue of peace extensively and thoroughly, speak out as much as possible about the facts related to peace, put forward concrete methods to promote and achieve peace, and make suggestions to the government and announce them to the people based on the results of the discussion. If the efforts of the people of this Council can bring a glimmer of peace to the whole country, then the mission of this Council can be accomplished, and the people of this Council will also have great glory."

### Mo Dehui Returns to Taipei Discussing Zhang Xueliang's Recent Situation: Mo Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow En Route to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Mo Dehui returned to Taipei from Hsinchu yesterday. He is scheduled to take the Zhongxing Wheel back to Shanghai on the 22nd and then transfer to Nanjing to attend the National Political Council. He went to visit Zhang Xueliang on the 12th and spent seven days with him. According to Mo, Qingquan, where Zhang lives, formerly known as Inoue Hot Spring, is much more secluded than his old residence in Guizhou. His physical and mental condition is also better than in Guizhou. He now gets up at 7:00 AM every morning, spends the entire morning reading, and plays tennis and takes a hot spring bath in the afternoon. Because there are no electric lights in the area, he sleeps very early at night. Mo said that Zhang studies the History of the Ming Dynasty every day, making notes and compiling a table of the emperors of the Ming Dynasty, which he places on his desk. He also said that today's Zhang Xueliang is completely different from the young Marshal Zhang of the past. He now has no interest in military affairs and is very indifferent to politics. He once mentioned casually that he would like to emulate Wang Yangming and Zhu Xi in building academies and giving lectures. This may be a momentary thought, but he solemnly stated that he would like to enter the Academia Sinica as a researcher and devote himself to academic research for the rest of his life. Zhang wrote a poem a few days ago, which reads: "Ten years without much illness, old friends have not yet returned, after the flames of war in my remaining years, my only wish is to read." As the saying goes, "There are gold houses in books." Today's Zhang Xueliang has clearly decided to spend the rest of his life with books. Mo also said that Miss Zhao Si's name is Zhao Yidi. Her father once served as the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. The rumor that she is the daughter of Zhao Erxun is incorrect. She is now Zhang's assistant and a good friend of Zhang. She helps Zhang copy notes every morning and plays ball with Zhang in the afternoon. There were also many letters entrusted to Mo to bring to Nanjing, including a letter to Chairman Chiang and letters to Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi, as well as family letters to Zhang's mother and his wife Yu Fengzhi.

### Xiong Shihui Arrives in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Appeasement Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 2:00 PM on the 20th. It is reported that Xiong's trip is to consult with the central government on countermeasures regarding the situation in the Northeast. He will return to Shenyang within the week.

### Communist Army in the Area East of Mengyin Retreats North in Three Routes

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] Wang Yaowu's troops along the Jiaoji Railway, after recovering Mingshui and Zhangqiu on the 19th, continued to mop up eastward, and by the evening of the 20th, they had advanced to the vicinity of Puj. A portion of the Communist army that had been operating in the area of Yishui, Ju County, Mengyin, and Tangquan crossed Lucun, 30 kilometers east of Laiwu, on the morning of the 20th and continued to retreat north.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The decisive battle in the area east of Mengyin has now come to an end. The Communist army has suffered another disastrous defeat and is retreating north in three routes. The headquarters of the East China Field Army of the Communist army has moved to Yue Village, northwest of Yishui, southwest of Linyi. The National Army, taking advantage of its victory, is also pursuing fiercely in three routes. The central route has crossed the line of Sunzu and is advancing north. The eastern route Communist army is no longer able to hold Ju County and is heading straight for Zhucheng. Ju County will be captured soon. The western route has advanced to Beishidian, 28 kilometers northeast of Xintai, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the remnants of the Communist army in the area of Mashan and the front and rear Gushan.

### Changli County Recovered Communist Army Retreats on Separate Routes

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The National Army on the Beining Railway rushed to Changli yesterday from the east and west along the line. The Communist army resisted for a day. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, the National Army captured Haber Town and the station north of the city. By noon, the county seat was completely recovered. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties and retreated in separate routes to Funing and Leting. The National Army is now taking advantage of the situation to pursue the remaining Communists in the suburbs. The Beining Railway will be restored within days.

### Shenyang Chamber of Commerce Suggests to the National Political Council That the Peace Conference with Japan Should Be Held in Shenyang

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] The Shenyang Chamber of Commerce believes that the Second World War originated from the September 18th Incident when the Japanese invaders occupied Shenyang. It recently suggested that the government take the initiative in diplomacy and notify all countries that the peace conference with Japan should be held in Shenyang starting on September 18th of this year, so that the world can be warned of the tragic disaster, learn from the past, and seek to revive the Northeast and build a new China. This case has been entrusted to Northeast Council member Wang Huiyi to take to Nanjing. It is requested that Mo Dehui take the lead in submitting it to the National Political Council for a public decision.

### Snippets from the National Political Council

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming

The magnificent National Assembly Hall shines in the morning glow of May, and it makes a sound. Its doors open wide, and today, on this day, it swallows and spews out more than three hundred Council members from all over the country, carrying the will of tens of millions of compatriots. The National Assembly Hall is responsible for expressing public opinion after the National Assembly.

This National Political Council is the twelfth meeting since the General Assembly, the second meeting after the victory, the first meeting after returning to the capital, and the first meeting held in Nanjing. The total number of Council members is 362, and 237 people came today.

The first member of the Presidium to arrive was Wang Shijie, and the second was Wang Yunwu. Before the meeting, Presidium members Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, and others went from the stage to the back. Two minutes later, they came down one by one, leaving only Elder Zhang, because he is the chairman of today's meeting. Elder Zhang has a pair of black eyes, a tall figure, standing there, despite his old age, he still exudes strong strength, like an immovable appearance.

Bishop Yu Bin, the representative of the Council members who delivered the speech, was wearing a long robe today, with graceful demeanor and very clear speech.

The first government head to arrive was Wu Dingchang, the chief of the Office of the President, and the second was Minister Zhang Lisheng. Chen Burei, a member of the National Government, dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, quietly went to the registration desk, left his signature, and went to the assembly hall. Chen Lifu came in with a smiling face, his face was red, his hair was white, it really was a combination of red face and white hair.

Zhu Jiaju, wearing a summer suit, very quietly shook hands with the Council members at the meeting.

Female Council member Luo Heng's Zhongshan suit was very straight, a pair of white leather shoes, shaking hands and nodding, quite gentlemanly. Since Chen Yiyun returned from the Pan-Asian Conference, her demeanor has become more elegant, with a large bun, very chic. Poet and Council member Lu Qian, weighing over two hundred pounds, usually wears a Chinese-style silk shirt, but today he is wearing a white suit, black tie, and yellow leather shoes.

On today's meeting order, "bowing three times to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father" was still listed, and when the ceremony was held, the reporter paid special attention, and everyone saluted. The reason is that the tea party yesterday decided to salute the national flag only, without the "portrait of the founding father" in it. At that time, someone objected, thinking that the founding father was listed alongside the national flag, wouldn't the portrait of the founding father have to be avoided when saluting? Moreover, the national flag represents the country, and the founding father founded the Republic of China, there is no difference, so today people from all parties still saluted the founding father.

The entire staff of the National Political Council walked into the National Assembly Hall, but there was still a feeling of emptiness. So the reporters who used to be crowded in the corner when the meeting was held in the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, and who could not be accommodated in the National Assembly Hall, sat in the middle today and comfortably enjoyed the right of the Council members to "attend to politics."

The layout of the meeting place is different from that of the National Assembly Hall. There are fewer national flags, and all places where national flags were placed are decorated with national flower patterns. Simple and solemn, the flowers in front of the podium are also reduced. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, has repeatedly said "to save," and this time, the decoration of many red tape has been reduced.

### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the National Political Council

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The following is the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the fourth session, third meeting of the National Political Council on the morning of the 20th:

Fellow Council Members:

Today we are holding the third meeting of the fourth National Political Council. It has been more than a year since the last meeting. Since the government returned to the capital last year, it was initially busy with recovery work. Then, due to the convening of the National Assembly, the supplementary elections of council members from the Northeast and Taiwan provinces and cities, and then the reorganization of the government, it was delayed until today that the General Assembly could be convened. Whether you are long-serving members or newly elected representatives of the people, you have traveled far and wide to gather in the capital and contribute your plans. On behalf of the government, I extend my sincere greetings and welcome to you.

During the War of Resistance, the National Political Council supported national policies, led the people, and assisted the government, making great contributions to the country. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the National Political Council, in the central government and in local areas, assisted in the progress of recovery work, investigated the reception and disposal of enemy and puppet materials in various places, especially the resident council members, who spared no effort to fulfill their responsibilities and made many contributions to the government. I and my government colleagues express our deep gratitude. The number of council members in this meeting has increased from 290 to 362, and the large number of participants will have a greater effect in pooling ideas. I believe that you will be able to maintain the spirit of the past nine years, do your best to plan for the long-term interests of the country and make honest and frank recommendations to the government, promote the great achievements of the victory of the War of Resistance, and promote the completion of the revival and construction of the country.

After the closing of your last meeting, the difficulties the country has encountered and the suffering the people have endured during this year are well known to you and need not be repeated. During this period, we have always sought the realization of peaceful unification with an unyielding determination. In order to relieve the suffering of the people of the whole country, to eliminate the obstacles to recovery and construction, and to seek the stability of the country and society, we have made continuous efforts with the greatest patience to achieve the requirements of "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics". However, the result we got was the Communist Party's firm refusal. The Communist Party refused the consultations of the Five-Person Group and the Three-Person Group, refused to stop the conflict and restore traffic, refused to implement the plan for reorganization and integration of the army, refused to attend the National Assembly and participate in the reorganization of the government, and finally refused the government's suggestion to send personnel to Yan'an to negotiate peace. Our painstaking concessions and the goal of complete reconciliation became a bubble. But our consistent efforts to democratize politics cannot be delayed by the Communist Party's obstruction. The National Assembly was convened in November last year, formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and determined the date of implementation of the Constitution. Then, the National Government was reorganized, ending the one-party tutelage. This point can be said to have been realized. The wish of our National Political Council to implement constitutional government for many years can be considered a comfort to the colleagues of your council. After the reorganization of the National Government, we still adhere to the basic policy of resolving the Communist Party issue politically, but whether peaceful unification can be realized depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party. We only hope that the Communist Party will abandon its attempt to seize power by force, stop military actions, and restore national traffic. We only hope that they will show their sincerity with facts. The government is always seeking peace and can use political methods to seek a solution to relieve the people from their suffering. This policy, I believe, meets the requirements of the public opinion of the whole country and will certainly be supported by the colleagues of your council. This is what I want to explain first.

Because peaceful unification has not been realized, the country cannot get a peaceful construction environment, and recovery and relief are severely hindered everywhere. Our compatriots are suffering from the threat and pain of the destruction of peace and order, economic life cannot be stabilized, and social order and national morality have been seriously affected. This is really the main reason why our country cannot enter the right track after the war. It is the government's responsibility to overcome all difficulties and take responsibility, cure the symptoms and the root causes, and do everything possible. The colleagues of your council, concerned about national affairs, must have good plans and suggestions to contribute to the government. The relevant authorities have other reports on the administrative facilities of various departments. What I hope for from you, council members, mainly includes the following points:

First, since the promulgation of the Constitution, the rules and regulations for implementing the Constitution have been formulated one after another. This implementation of constitutional government is the key to the success or failure of democratic politics in our Republic of China. Now, there are only seven months left before the implementation of the Constitution. With our vast area in China and such a weak foundation of autonomy and education, the preparatory work for carrying out various elections and establishing the scale of constitutional government is complicated. I hope that all council members will do their best to assist at any time, whether in the central government or in local areas.

Second, the current economic, financial, monetary and price issues affect the general life of the people and are related to the progress of national construction. The government is anxiously seeking a proper solution to this problem. The emergency economic measures promulgated in February of this year must of course be implemented thoroughly, but in terms of the technology of implementation, as well as the urgency of the steps, and how to adapt to the special circumstances of various places, and how to prevent malpractices, you, gentlemen, have always been concerned about this issue, and I hope you will contribute your opinions as much as possible so that more satisfactory and effective results can be achieved. In addition, if there are any areas that should be supplemented, I hope you will provide opinions, and the government will carefully consider them and implement them.

Third, the improvement of administrative efficiency has a significant impact on the promotion of public affairs and the welfare of the people. The **integrity** mentioned in the last meeting of your council is actually another aspect of administrative efficiency. The government is determined to **eliminate** corruption, but the fundamental plan is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of local politics and the actual implementation situation. We want to create a **clean** government and also create a rapid, reliable, capable, and efficient government. You know the suffering of the people and hope to convey the feelings of the people, point out the gains and losses, so that the central government and local areas can communicate and the country and the people can benefit.

Finally, I want to raise a fundamental issue to you, gentlemen, which is the issue of national morality and general atmosphere. Recalling the time of the War of Resistance, we Chinese people, with a weak foundation, carried out a difficult war and finally overcame many difficulties and won a glorious victory. I believe that it was the result of the country's unanimous adherence to two common principles. These two principles are "nation above all" and "will concentrated, strength concentrated". Since the end of the War of Resistance, the general public, after eight years of intense hardship, relaxed the psychology of caution and fear, and lost the spirit of selflessness, resulting in a gradual decline in the concept of the country and the concept of national responsibility. This must be said to be the biggest obstacle to revival and construction. Now the national affairs are still extremely difficult, and construction is about to begin. It all depends on the concentration of will and strength of our compatriots across the country, enduring labor and hardship, and working together to overcome difficulties to create a new atmosphere for national construction. You, gentlemen, are the forerunners of society and the teachers of the people. I deeply hope that this meeting will have a practical and energetic discussion on changing the social atmosphere, promoting the spirit of caring for the country, improving the concept of responsibility, and establishing the foundation of the rule of law, so as to call on the whole people to move towards the great goal of realizing democracy and achieving national construction. I personally hope that you will not hesitate to make criticisms and correct me so that I can be worthy of the heavy responsibility. I wish you all good health and the success of the conference!

### Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Changchun: Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun Captured One After Another; Du Yuming Holds an Emergency Meeting in Shenyang

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shengan, by Telegraph] The battle for the suburbs of Changchun has already begun. The majority of the Communist forces have moved to the outskirts of Changchun. Yesterday afternoon, the Communist forces attacked the suburbs from the south, north, and west. In the south, they pressed forward from Mengjiatun Railway Station; in the north, they attacked Kuanchengzi District. The defending troops fiercely repelled them, and they were all unsuccessful. In the west, the Communist infantry and cavalry jointly launched a fierce attack on Dafangshen Airfield. After an hour of intense fighting, the defending troops safely withdrew at 9:00 PM, and the airfield personnel also safely evacuated. The Communist forces once attacked from the northwest towards Sunjia Zi and charged from the southwest corner to the Courthouse Square, but were repelled. The defending troops are strong and their morale is high. Changchun is as solid as a rock.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Changchun, 20th] Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun Railway Stations on the China Chang Railway have both been captured by the Communist forces. The Communist forces are now moving towards Changchun in two directions and have approached nearby. The National Army seems to be preserving its mobile force in Fushun and Mouden, waiting for an opportunity to inflict a major blow on the Communist forces.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] After the fall of Gongzhuling, most of the National Army retreated to Guojiadian to defend Siping. The Communist forces are advancing from Gongzhuling towards Changchun. The person in charge of affairs in Gongzhuling said that Changchun has plenty of troops and food and can be defended resolutely.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 19th] Gongzhuling fell at 1:51 PM on the 19th. The situation in Fanjiatun at 3:30 PM is unclear. The majority of the Communist main forces are passing through Huaide along the China Chang Railway, pressing towards Changchun. Furthermore, Liufangzi Railway Station, north of Gongzhuling, caught fire at 4:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] According to aerial reconnaissance, large units of the Communist forces are gathering outside Changchun and on the north bank of the Dongliao River.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Changchun, 20th] Changchun is busy preparing for war. Military vehicles shuttle through the streets, and prices have soared several times. There is also a lack of markets.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] Du Yuming is suffering from a leg ailment and was unable to go to the front lines in person. He held an emergency meeting at his official residence on the morning of the 20th. Dozens of senior generals, including Zheng Dongguo and Zhao Jiajun, participated.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] The situation in the Northeast is serious. The success or failure of both sides hinges on this one action.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] A certain military official stated: This Communist offensive is a full-scale launch, with a force of approximately 50 regiments, about 8 regiments and 1 division west of Changchun, about 3 divisions in the Jilin area, about 6 brigades in Meihekou, and the rest being mostly local organizations.

### Student Actions Go Overboard: Ping Municipality Organizations Issue a Circular Appeal, Hoping that the Government Will Rectify the Academic Atmosphere in the Future

[Central News Agency, Beiping, Daily] Eleven organizations in Ping Municipality, including industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, and women's groups, recently issued a circular to the whole country regarding the student movement issue. The original text is recorded as follows: "The Chinese Communists initiate chaos, blocking the door to peace talks. The government's use of force is truly a last resort. Compatriots across the country all understand this, so they are able to contribute money and effort, with one heart and one mind, to assist the government in carrying out the war against the rebellion. After the victory of the War of Resistance, internal strife continued to erupt. For a decade, war has not ceased. The country's finances are strained, and the people are utterly exhausted. This is all expected. In order to strive for lasting happiness, we temporarily endure hardship and support the government, so we are able to bear it with pleasure. Now, the suppression of the rebellion is winning victories one after another, and the Communist forces are being driven to the end of their road, with their destruction foreseeable. In order to stubbornly reverse the declining trend, they are employing their habitual tricks, obstructing the reception of Lushun and Dalian, sabotaging international loans, inciting student strikes in various places, taking the opportunity to coerce, agitating people's hearts, and disrupting society. Qinghua and other schools in Ping Municipality are even openly taking to the streets under the guise of opposing internal war and opposing starvation, shouting and scolding, gathering crowds to fight, and destroying laws and discipline. Nothing is more extreme than this. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, people from all walks of life have been calling for military affairs to come first, but they have never neglected education. Even if it means robbing Peter to pay Paul, they must strive to maintain it. Among the universities, there is even a public funding system to aid students whose families are in enemy-occupied areas. Even during times of tense situations, the authorities are still able to continue education without interruption. The wise measures of the authorities have long been praised by the people. Unexpectedly, some students at present do not understand right from wrong, do not distinguish between benefits and harms, are incited by villains, and engage in excessive actions. Good young people are being used as political tools, and dignified academic institutions are actually becoming places for creating chaos. At a time when people's lives are extremely difficult, they are actually able to study for free. It can be said that the government has done its utmost in benevolence and righteousness towards them. Who would have thought that they would still be dissatisfied, shouting to oppose starvation and demanding an increase in public funding? This is directly creating difficulties for the government and indirectly plundering the people's food and clothing. If young students do not consider themselves to be a special class, how can they be so arbitrary? Moreover, the responsibility for the internal war is very clear and cannot be disguised. If the Chinese Communists can return the army to the country and abandon their underground network, peace can be achieved immediately. However, a small number of students are not seeking this and are actually shouting against the internal war within the government's area. What are their intentions? It is self-evident. For ten years, the suffering endured by people from all walks of life has been a hundred times greater than that of the students, and the preferential treatment they receive is less than one-tenth of that of the students. Compatriots directly bear the huge educational expenses. Although they are justified in remaining silent in the face of the current decline in the academic atmosphere, we earnestly hope that the government will strictly rectify it in the future, without the slightest leniency. If schools become places for creating chaos, they should be resolutely disbanded. If students are willing to act as accomplices of tigers, they should be severely punished. Only then can the stubborn and unruly trend be stopped, and the great plan for a century can be maintained. Furthermore, we hope that compatriots across the country will supervise and urge the government to stabilize social order and encourage the soldiers at the front to achieve complete success in suppressing the rebellion, so that peace can arrive soon. Our organization is willing to work together with compatriots across the country to plan and encourage each other. We send this urgent telegram and hope that you will all consider it." Furthermore, the eleven organizations also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the content of which was largely the same as the previous telegram.

### Students in Nanjing Parade and Petition: Only 3,000 Students from Sixteen Schools Participate; Clash with Military Police, Several Injured

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Student Self-Government Association of Central University held a meeting on the evening of the 20th, and it is reported that they will continue to strike on the 20th. Furthermore, student representatives from Jinling University and other schools also held a joint meeting, and they may continue to take action in the future.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] The parade and petition in Nanjing by student representatives from sixteen specialized schools in the Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou areas, despite the persuasion of the schools and the authorities, did not achieve complete success and was still realized on the 20th. However, the number of participating schools and people was less than planned. The Oriental Language School, the Pharmacy School, and the Conservatory of Music did not participate. Those who were sent out by the Drama School were blocked. Only some students from Central University and Jinling University participated. Added to the representatives from schools in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, the total number was only 3,000 people. The large group departed at 10:00 AM and did not return until evening, a total of eight hours. The order along the way was relatively good. Only around 11:00 AM, when the group passed the Zhujiang Road intersection, there was a minor dispute with the police, resulting in injuries and arrests. A section of the procession waited near the National Assembly Hall for about six hours. After student representatives contacted Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Hall, they finally marched past the gate of the National Assembly Hall at about 6:00 PM, and then returned to their respective schools via Chengxian Street and other places.

The marching students departed from Central University at 9:00 AM. The large group arrived at Zhujiang Road at about 10:50 AM. More than 300 unarmed military police were already blocking the road, and all the nearby shops were closed. Negotiations lasted for ten minutes. The military police stated that they were carrying out orders and could not let them pass. The students demanded to pass. Amidst the confusion, some students shouted to advance, but were quickly stopped by their classmates. With no result from the negotiations, the large group advanced amidst slogans. At about 11:05 AM, the military police at the scene, except for the military police and the police on the west side of the road who remained in their original positions, used two water cannons to spray the large group at the center of the road. At the same time, the students also resisted with flagpoles and iron buckets filled with paint. During the three blockades, both sides suffered injuries. At this time, about six-tenths of the students had broken through the blockade line. The police maintaining order also clashed with the students in the Zhujiang Road and Xinjiekou areas. Shops along the way closed one after another. The students retreated at about 12:00 PM, and traffic in the area did not return to normal until noon. According to Chen Shanzhou, the director of the Eastern District Police Bureau, a supervisor surnamed Li was injured in the chaos and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. When the large group of students arrived at Guofu Road at about 12:00 PM, the National Assembly Hall was in sight. Military police, mounted patrol teams, police, and the protection corps advised the students not to advance, and the situation was quite tense. The students could not advance, so they sent representatives to the National Assembly Hall to petition. At this time, the classmates who were blocked at the Zhujiang Road intersection and other places also rushed over via detours and waited in the rain in the middle of the road. At about 4:00 PM, the student representatives held an impromptu reception in the middle of the road, sitting on the ground. At 5:00 PM, seven representatives returned accompanied by Wang Tongrong, director of general affairs of the National Assembly Hall, and reported on the negotiation process. The incident was temporarily resolved. The mounted patrol team retreated to the east side of the Beiting Alley intersection at about 5:50 PM. The large group of students advanced in formation at about 6:00 PM, shouting slogans along the way. At 6:00 PM, heavy rain fell again. This was the third rain shower in the afternoon and the heaviest one. More than 2,000 students filed past the National Assembly Hall in the rain, taking a total of one quarter of an hour. When the large group returned to Central University and disbanded, it was already dusk.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to investigations, most specialized schools and universities in Nanjing, such as Ginling College, National Central University, Pharmacy School, Language School, Music School, and Drama School, did not participate in the student parade in Nanjing on the 20th. The actual participants were only 1,062 students from Central University, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of the total, and 130 students from Jinling University, accounting for slightly more than one-ninth of the total. Only about 100 students from Yingshi University participated, which was also an absolute minority.

### Shao Lizi Receives Student Representatives, Persuades Them Earnestly, Saying That There Is No Precedent in the World for Gathering Crowds to Coerce

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Hall, received seven student representatives from the parade at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. At that time, the marching students had advanced to Linsen Road and were blocked. The student representatives first explained the purpose of the students' petition, which was only to save the education crisis, and submitted written opinions to the National Assembly Hall, requesting that the Assembly pay attention to increasing education funding. Unfortunately, they were blocked at the Zhujiang Road intersection. They now intend to request that the written opinions be forwarded and to find a way to allow the blocked classmates to pass. They repeatedly stated that the purpose of the petition was simple. Shao Lizi said calmly that the issue of the students returning to school could be discussed and decided. If you are willing to return to school, there is no problem, but the military police are only enforcing the law to prevent the marching队伍 from reaching the Assembly Hall, which is actually hindering the affairs of the Assembly while it is in session. As for the measures passed by the State Council to prevent and control the number of petitioners and the methods of handling them, they actually exist in Britain and the United States. If necessary, they can also adopt the decision to disband. Moreover, in demonstrations in Britain and the United States, they only shout slogans during the demonstration to publicly express their hopes. There is no precedent for gathering crowds to coerce. In the past few days, students went to the Executive Yuan to petition and ate all the dinner of the staff. In addition, there were other undesirable phenomena, so the drafting of handling measures began. The government and the students are one. If the government does something unreasonable, you can certainly refuse to obey, but you must never gather crowds to coerce. Then, Shao Lizi explained the point in the written opinions submitted by the students that all students should be changed to publicly funded students, saying: "I was in the Soviet Union 20 years ago, and later I was also an ambassador to the Soviet Union. The Soviet education I saw 20 years ago was only partially publicly funded, and the rest was self-funded. During the war, only the technical vocational school of one railway was publicly funded, and the rest were all self-funded. Currently, all are self-funded. Your proposal for all public funding is not supported by the government's financial resources and is also unfair. You should consider it." However, Shao Lizi immediately stated that the written opinions could be accepted and would be delivered to the presidium and all members of the National Assembly Hall. Then, the students raised several hopes, and Shao Lizi replied: "I am only a person who forwards things, but from my point of view, the government must be responsible for the investigation of medical expenses and responsibilities." Then, there was a slight discussion about studying the route for the students to return to school, and a phone call was made to the garrison headquarters to make a decision. The student representatives left at about 4:00 PM.

### Some Jinling University Students Take the School Flag Without Permission and Are Stopped

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] About 130 students from Jinling University gathered on the side of the school's auditorium at 8:30 AM this morning to petition the National Assembly Hall. Because most of the students had already resumed their studies, they protested on the spot against the unauthorized taking of the school flag by these hundred or so people and took back the red and yellow flags of Jinling University's honor and handed them over to the school for safekeeping.

### Hailstorm in Wuxi

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Wuxi, 20th] At 7:20 PM this evening, the sky suddenly darkened and dark clouds spread. Then, in the sound of thunder and rain, hail suddenly fell, as large as soybeans. It stopped after only a few minutes.

### The Rumor That Zhang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Capital Garrison, Died of Injuries Is Groundless

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Capital Garrison Command held a press conference at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. Acting Commander Zhang Zhen made a written statement, reporting on the parade and demonstration of Central University, Jinling University, and other schools today, stating briefly: "When the unarmed military police sent by the Command to Jinling University this morning were preventing the students of the school from going out, armed military police patrolling the area happened to pass by (these patrolling military police were responsible for maintaining order on a regular basis and were not responsible for preventing the students from going out). Seeing the disorderly situation, they fired warning shots into the air, but the students still went out. In order to avoid accidents, the Command immediately withdrew all the patrolling armed military police it usually sent out. Therefore, those who were preventing the student parade from advancing at the Zhujiang Road intersection were entirely unarmed military police and police. At that time, the students rolled up their sleeves and prepared to break through the ranks of the unarmed military police several times. After hesitating for about half an hour, the students linked arms and, with a shout, broke through the unarmed military police frontally, and then the subsequent troops also linked arms and shoulders and swarmed up, and order was therefore disrupted. The police at the scene initially planned to disperse the crowd by releasing water from water cannons, but unexpectedly the water pipes had been seized by organized student pickets, who instead used the water pipes to spray the sides and the ground. At this time, the actions of the student pickets and propaganda teams became increasingly violent. They used iron ink cans and flagpoles for writing slogans, and seized wooden sticks from nearby shops to attack the unarmed military police. The situation at that time was extremely chaotic and fell into a state of mutual fighting and tearing. Dozens of military police were injured. At that time, the ground was slippery due to accumulated water, causing the students who were shoulder to shoulder and the military police at the scene to fall frequently. More than a dozen students were also injured. As of 4:00 PM this afternoon, it has been ascertained that 28 policemen and military police were injured, and more than a dozen students were also injured. However, since the students were holding iron cans, flagpoles, and other objects as weapons, the number of injured military police was actually greater than that of the students. When the student parade advanced to both ends of Linsen Road, unarmed military police once again came out to block them. At this time, in order to avoid another clash between the students and the military police, it was necessary to line up with mounted patrols and rifle teams to stop them. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the marching students sent representatives to the National Assembly Hall to request a meeting with Secretary Shao and made a request to the Command to release the arrested people and provide compensation for the dead and injured. The Command sent its acting chief of staff to meet with them, who told them that death was absolutely not a fact. The four students who were arrested were those who had beaten the military police on the spot and would be handed over to the court for handling in accordance with the law. As for the rumors published in one or two evening newspapers in the city that students had died of injuries, the military police organs sent people to investigate and found that only 11 injured students from the affiliated hospital of Central University had gone for treatment. Among them, 9 had skin abrasions and were discharged after medication. The remaining Sun Aocang had a broken left kneecap, and Fan Jiyan had an injury to his left upper eyelid. They are currently hospitalized for treatment, and the situation is not serious."

[Another Telegraph] A total of thirteen students were arrested. Four have been released on bail, and nine have been transferred to the Capital District Court for handling.

### No Accidents Occurred During the Student Parade in Beiping

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Beiping, 20th] The authorities here explicitly prohibited this student parade last night. This morning, the students sent a letter to Hu Shi, asking him to forward it to the Beiping Pacification Headquarters for filing, and still proceeded with the planned action. Hu Shi, Mei Yi-qi, and others repeatedly stated to the Pacification Headquarters that they hoped that the student movement would be guided rather than interfered with. The authorities tacitly accepted this, and no accidents occurred today. If the authorities handle the unfortunate incidents that have occurred properly, the strike wave in Beiping may gradually resume classes on the 22nd after three days. Furthermore, some students in the schools that have gone on strike are brewing an anti-strike movement.

[Another Telegraph] Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Beiyang (Beiping), Chaoyang, Sino-French University, Railway College, Art College, Normal College, Fu Jen University, and the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, Baiman Middle School, and Ouwen Middle School paraded today. Tsinghua was the only school to have all of its students participate. A large part of Peking University and Yenching University participated, and the rest had more than half or part of their students participate. The number of middle school students was relatively small. The procession was about three li long, totaling less than 10,000 people. They gathered at Peking University at noon and set off at one o'clock, with Tsinghua in front and Peking University in the back. Propaganda teams gave speeches and posted slogans along the way, and pickets maintained order. The retired youth army of Tsinghua and Peking University led the way wearing military uniforms and steel helmets. They departed from Shatan and passed through Qianliang Hutong, Dongsi Wangfujing, East and West Chang'an Street, to Xidan Archway. Deng Xiao, a fourth-year student of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Beiyang University, was beaten and injured by several unidentified people at Xidan before the large group arrived. He was sent to Peking University Hospital by the military police. Another Peking University student, Hu Jiezong, was also slightly injured. When the large group passed in front of Zhongnanhai, a petition group went to the Pacification Headquarters to petition. After half an hour, they marched to Xidan. There were disturbances three times because someone threw stones, but fortunately nothing happened. The police and military police maintained order. After passing Xidan, they returned to Peking University without incident via the Fourth Archway.

When the students paraded today, in addition to distributing various propaganda materials, they also issued declarations and letters to soldiers, letters to elders, and letters to middle school students.

### Two Factions of Students in Tianjin Resort to Violence and Mutual Assault

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] After the school authorities' dissuasion was ineffective, some students from Nankai University and Beiyang University still separately went out to parade on the 20th. About 300 students from Beiyang University went out, and more than 100 students from Hebei Institute of Technology joined them along the way. At the Jingang Nandukou, where they entered the downtown area, the unarmed police were ordered to dissuade them from stopping. However, the student group did not accept it, and passed through the traffic intersection guarded by the police and advanced to the city center, posting slogans along the way and shouting slogans such as "Immediately stop conscripting and collecting grain, oppose internal war." When they walked to the entrance of the Roxy Theater on Roosevelt Road, they met some students from the Tianjin Student Patriotic Association, an organization opposed to the strike. The students from the Student Patriotic Association also shouted slogans, saying that strikes cannot save the country and that parades disrupt social order. Because of disagreements, the two sides resorted to violence, and order was disrupted for a while. The police took the students who caused the incident to the police station. Afterwards, more than 100 students from Beiyang University went to the municipal government to petition, insisting that the mayor meet with them. The mayor met with six representatives selected by the students. They demanded that the municipal government punish the person in charge of the police station and release the arrested students. The mayor told them that he would investigate separately, and that the students arrested by the police station to prevent accidents would be returned to their respective schools after investigation. As for Nankai University, more than 400 students from the school had a conflict with the students of the Student Patriotic Association not far from the school. When the police went to maintain order, two inspectors from the Police Bureau were forcibly taken into the school by the students. There was still no news of their whereabouts as of the afternoon. The authorities are investigating.

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Tianjin, 20th] After the conflict occurred during the student parade in Tianjin on the morning of the 20th, crowds continued to clash in the afternoon due to tearing down street slogans. The Finance Bureau was affected, and 17 employees were injured in the chaos. The doors and window glass of the bureau's office were also mostly destroyed.

### The Philippine Senate Passes Three Bills to Boycott Overseas Chinese, All Recommended by Satoru, Chairman of the Anti-Chinese Alliance

[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] The Philippine Senate passed three bills to boycott overseas Chinese on their third reading last night and have now been sent to the House of Representatives for a vote. All three bills were recommended by Satoru, Chairman of the Anti-Chinese Alliance: (1) Stipulating that foreigners who violate immigration laws be fined up to 500 US dollars and sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, and then deported. (2) Stipulating that the timber produced by the Philippine Republic can only be sold by Filipino merchants or retailers. (3) Stipulating that the retail of medical products and pharmaceuticals is entirely operated by Filipinos.

[United Press, Manila, 20th] Presidential Secretary Abelo announced today after discussing with officials from the Immigration Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "The matter of Chinese immigration to the Philippines, which was suspended since last November pending the ratification of the Treaty of Friendship between the two countries, will now be resumed. One hundred Chinese will be allowed to enter the country each month, half of whom will be selected from those who reside or own property in the Philippine Islands, and the other half will be determined by lottery. Immigration laws stipulate a limit of 500 Chinese immigrants per year. Immigration was suspended in November and December."

### All Japanese Liquid Assets Are Prioritized for Occupation Costs: The Far Eastern Commission Announced Its Decision Yesterday

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission today announced a policy decision regarding the distribution of Japanese reparations, effectively recognizing the priority of the United States. It is reported that Japanese liquid assets will be used as collateral to repay occupation costs and aid. The decision stipulates that any allocation cannot disregard the repayment of occupation costs. According to well-informed sources, this clause was formulated under the direction of the United States, indicating that the United States, due to its actual bearing of all occupation costs, the supply of food to the Japanese, and the costs of other new materials, should have priority in claiming Japanese gold and other liquid assets.

The Far Eastern Commission's directive also stipulates that the removal of reparations shall not hinder the minimum standard of living of the Japanese people, based on 1934, as previously stipulated by the Commission. The Far Eastern Commission also generally ruled that reparations should be allocated on a broad political basis, giving due consideration to the extent of material and personal life destruction and loss suffered by each claimant state, thereby resulting in compensation and punishment for the results of Japanese aggression. At the same time, due consideration should also be given to the contribution of each country to defeating Japan, including the size and duration of its resistance to Japanese aggression. The Far Eastern Commission specifically excluded overseas funds from the scope of this policy decision. This decision is consistent with the Far Eastern Commission's general view that the Commission will not intervene in these funds and will focus its main work on the issue of the allocation of funds within Japan. At the same time, the Far Eastern Commission announced that the Commission has also made two decisions to relax the restrictions on Japan's foreign trade, one regarding the source of Japan's imports and the other regarding the destination of Japan's exports. The Commission stipulates that the main purpose of Japan's export plan is to make Japan's exports to areas that can obtain the maximum cash, as a commercial export, as opposed to the movement of goods for reparations. In other words, Japanese goods can only be supplied to recipients who are willing to pay for them with imports that Japan lacks or with cash that can be immediately used to purchase these exports. As for Japan's exports, the Far Eastern Commission decided that they should be obtained in the most convenient and cheapest way, but it also stipulates that only the interests of the United Nations can be considered when trading goods that are of significant interest to any of them.

### Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Xu Shiying, Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Says Mongolian and Tibetan Policy Should First Focus on Stabilizing the Border Regions

[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Shiying, the newly appointed Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. Fang Zhi, Yang Xiaotian, Wang Zhengting, and others personally went to the pier to welcome him. Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Wu Zhongxin, Luo Liangjian, Wu Guozhen and others from the Executive Yuan also sent representatives to welcome him. Xu is scheduled to take the night train to the capital on the 21st to assume his new post.

When interviewed by reporters about his policy towards Mongolia and Tibet, he said: The government should have a set policy towards Mongolia and Tibet, and I cannot make any statements until I have met with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang. In principle, however, the current Mongolian and Tibetan policy should focus on connecting with their emotions, helping their economy, improving their lives, and increasing their happiness. The most important thing is to stabilize the border regions first, and then formulate a plan and proceed step by step. As Mr. Xu has been stationed in Japan for many years, he was asked about his observations on the situation in Japan. Mr. Xu said: China should pay attention to Japan. The general population of Japan does not want to build up their military and invade other countries, but rather wants to develop their economy and increase their wealth. Today's control policies of the Allied forces are in line with their wishes. Japan's light industry can recover within the next year. China will not be threatened by Japan militarily in the future, but it will still become a target of economic aggression in the short term, which deserves the vigilance of the Chinese people.

Mr. Xu is 75 years old and in good spirits. He spoke with reporters for half an hour without showing any signs of fatigue. This is also his first time in Shanghai since the War of Resistance. Xu Shiying (right) and Wang Zhengting posing for a photo.

Editorial

### Resuming Classes is "Rescuing Education"!

The recent surge of student movements in various places has inevitably caused general social unrest. In order to stabilize social order, the government promulgated six temporary measures to maintain social order yesterday. This newspaper has repeatedly commented on the promulgation of these temporary measures, hoping that the general public will share the burden and provide sincere assistance in their respective positions. Unexpectedly, the aforementioned emergency measures have just been promulgated, and a small number of students in various places are still engaging in so-called "hunger marches" and even claiming "eat-all movements," touting "rescuing education," which is bizarre and eccentric. In the end, the real intention is revealed, and it is transformed into a political mass movement of so-called "anti-civil war." Yesterday, students in the capital clashed with the military police during a march, and injuries were inevitable. This is truly unfortunate for the young students, and also unfortunate for society and the country. However, there is some good news amidst the misfortune, namely that in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other areas, some students have already launched a movement to resume classes in the past few days. This is closer to "rescuing education."

Objectively speaking, it is truly incomprehensible that students are striking, petitioning, and marching to rescue education during their precious youth. These actions themselves are not without contradiction to the purpose of "rescuing education." Strikes, petitions, and marches themselves are sufficient to neglect studies. If it is necessary to do this in order to "rescue education," then it is the most ridiculous thing! As for the so-called "eat-all movement," regardless of where the unfolding of this movement will place the youth's personality, in fact, it is not entirely reasonable. Today, there are state-funded students in national universities, subsidized by the state for their food and lodging. But it must be known that at the same time, there are many non-state-funded students, and even more private university students and primary and secondary school students who do not receive state funding. It is even more important to know that those who support the state-funded students in higher education are the majority of people whose own lives are very difficult. If university students do not indulge their emotions and trust their rationality, then there will definitely be a day to rein in at the precipice. As expected, when some students are changing in nature and striking, there are some students who want to resume classes. In some places, the number of signatures participating in the class resumption movement is even greater than those advocating for strikes. The resumption of classes at Fudan University in Shanghai is a clear example. We are glad that students in general, in addition to their enthusiasm, have begun to have a rational recovery, and the proper use of reason is precisely the primary purpose of education. We hope that students in various places can have this trend, so that social order can be stabilized. Therefore, we believe that striking is definitely not rescuing education, but resuming classes is the minimum requirement for rescuing education.

We believe that those who call for strikes in an attempt to achieve their political goals are only a few students. Even some of these students have recently made inciting disturbances their "profession," while the majority of purely good students, fearing the threat of the masses, are forced to submit to their coercion. In their hearts, they originally wanted to attend classes and study, but they suffer from being scattered and alone, as if there is nothing they can do. As a result, accumulating wrongs become right, and "eating all" can actually become a movement, and "striking" can actually be deceptively called "rescuing education." In the world, there is originally only a struggle between right and wrong, a struggle between good and evil. Only those who stand on the side of "right" and the side of "good" should unite together, abide by the law, resume classes, and seek knowledge. Who can stop them? Those who excel at clamoring and causing disturbances, when they ask themselves in the quiet of the night, have they not realized their "wrongdoing" and have they not regretted their "evil"? We hope that the teachers who are responsible for education will bear in mind the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the country, society, and students' parents. They should guide them according to the situation, patiently and kindly, and support the group of good young people who are "right" and "good," so that they can issue voices of justice and lead bright actions. At the same time, they should influence those students who have strayed into the wrong path of "wrongdoing" and "evil," so that they can correct their mistakes, return to school, and resume their studies. Then there will be hope for the future of education!

### Liberal Party Refuses to Cooperate; New Twists in the Formation of the Japanese Cabinet; Yoshida Cabinet Resigns En Masse Yesterday as Usual

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Yoshida met with the Emperor at the Imperial Palace at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th and submitted his resignation. At the same time, the Cabinet notified the Secretariats of both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. With this, the Yoshida Cabinet has resigned en masse.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Regarding the issue of a four-party coalition cabinet, the Socialist Party has formally refused Yoshida's request. In that case, the Liberal Party will be relegated to the position of an opposition party. The center of gravity in the current political situation has shifted to the work of forming a coalition cabinet by the Democratic, Socialist, and National Cooperative parties.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Although the Japanese political situation has been negotiated under the clash of words for several days, many complications have arisen. Until the day of the convening of the Diet, not only has a solution not been reached, but a major twist has occurred.

In the talks between Katayama and Yoshida this morning, Yoshida suddenly demanded a solution to the issue of the left wing of the Socialist Party. Katayama expressed difficulty with this. After Yoshida reiterated his willingness for Katayama to serve as Prime Minister, he expressed his willingness to assist the Katayama Cabinet as an opposition party. Subsequently, after Katayama reported the process to the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, the entire body unanimously decided: Katayama would have full authority to handle the political situation. They also believed that if the four-party coalition cabinet failed, they would proceed with the three-party coalition work. If that was unsuccessful, they could even form a two-party coalition cabinet with the National Cooperative Party.

However, at present, other issues such as the positions of Deputy Speakers have not yet been discussed, except for the fact that Katayama's assumption of the premiership is no longer an issue. After this twist occurred today, all cabinet formation work must be started anew. Therefore, although the Diet was still convened as scheduled, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speakers could not proceed, and the meeting was hastily adjourned after the opening.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Democratic Party President Ashida issued a statement today on the current political situation and the issue of the Speaker, saying: "Regardless of whether the Liberal Party joins the cabinet, the Democratic Party still supports and participates in the coalition cabinet. The Democratic Party has no opinion on the Liberal Party's opposition to the inclusion of the left wing of the Socialist Party in the cabinet. If a four-party coalition cabinet cannot be formed, it may be possible to form a three-party cabinet. If the Liberal Party voluntarily retreats to the position of an opposition party, then the position of Speaker seems more suitable for the Democratic Party."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] In order to compete with the Liberal Party for the position of the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party is currently working to win over independents and other parties. After obtaining the position of the second-largest party, it can compete for the issue of the Speaker.

### Indian Situation Approaching a Decision Stage; Mountbatten Suggests Partition; British Cabinet Begins Discussing the Viceroy's Plan

[United Press, London, 19th] After arriving here today, Viceroy Mountbatten immediately held meetings with Prime Minister Attlee and other members of the British Cabinet's India Affairs Subcommittee. It is reported that the Viceroy brought a promise from Indian Muslims to agree to a plan for the process of handing over power to India. Responsible persons said that according to Mountbatten's plan, Britain should transfer power in India to "at least two constituent assemblies," one belonging to Muslims and the other to Hindus. The main points of the plan are nothing more than: (1) Dissolving the existing Constituent Assembly in New Delhi. Currently, this assembly is largely controlled by the Indian National Congress and is rejected by the Muslim League. (2) Replacing it with separate assemblies for Hindus and Muslims to draft constitutions for the partition of India. (3) Partition should be implemented internally in the two major provinces of Bengal and Punjab. (4) A referendum will be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to decide whether to be autonomous or to be incorporated into the Hindu or Muslim areas. (5) The powers of the existing coalition temporary government may be transferred to a comprehensive new temporary government, with representatives designated by each constituent assembly to participate.

Other issues discussed included public health, epidemic prevention, transportation, food shortages, irrigation, and forestry. Defense Minister Alexander and British Army Commander-in-Chief in India, Marshal Auchinleck, also participated in the meeting. Some people believe that the participation of the two is of great significance, indicating the possible crisis of the partition of India. The main reason for the Viceroy's sudden return to the country is that Muslims are demanding that the current mixed Hindu-Muslim composition of the Indian army be changed to separate Hindu and Muslim units.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] According to executives, British Cabinet's opinion is gradually leaning towards the partition of India. The partition plan will create two separate states in India, one being Hindu Hindustan and the other being Muslim Pakistan. Pakistan will be composed of two non-contiguous pieces of land (Punjab and Bengal), located at the two ends of the "V" shape of India, so it will likely encounter many difficulties. It is expected that military figures will oppose the partition plan.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The "Daily Mail" reported today that Patton has submitted a suggestion to Attlee, advocating for convening a meeting of Indian leaders in London to replace the meeting scheduled to be held in Simla on June 25th.

### Harriman Advocates Restoring Industry and Commerce in Germany and Japan

[United Press, Los Angeles, 19th] Secretary of Commerce Harriman delivered a speech at Los Angeles City Hall today, advocating for the restoration of peacetime economies in Germany and Japan. It is said that the world today is a scene of misery, with difficulties everywhere. Restoring peacetime industry and commerce in Germany, so that it can no longer attack neighboring countries, but can conduct peacetime trade, is extremely important for the revival of the European economy, just as the Japanese economy is necessary for the general revival and economic construction of the Far East. Japan must never again be allowed to attack countries of world peace, but it must not be allowed to become a dead object in terms of economic production and exchange. Japan's poverty, like Germany's poverty, is not only a source of resentment and suffering, but will also hinder all efforts to rebuild other countries in the region.

### Gromyko Elaborates on the Control of Atomic Energy

[United Press, New York, 20th] Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, Gromyko, delivered a speech at the American-Soviet Friendship Society today, saying that the United States' desire to monopolize the production of atomic energy is a misconception. Unless the United Nations takes swift action to ban atomic weapons, the United States will be in an unfavorable position. If one country seeks a patent, it will inevitably cause competition from other countries. If one country uses atomic energy for military purposes, other countries can take the same action. Therefore, mutual suspicion will inevitably hinder relations between countries, and there will be no trust between them. In the current environment, it is undeniable that the United States will sacrifice more than other countries by banning atomic weapons. However, there is no doubt that one country's attempt to monopolize can only be limited to the temporary. Gromyko reiterated three points: (1) The United Nations must immediately ban nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. (2) After the ban on nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union will agree to international control and supervision measures. (3) The supervision measures must be limited to ensuring the peaceful use of atomic energy and must not hinder the internal economy of the Soviet Union.

### Egyptian Prime Minister Receives Soviet Envoy

Inquiring About Attitude Towards British Dispute

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 19th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy received Soviet Ambassador to the city, Shebirin, today and spoke with him for an hour. Afterwards, Prime Minister Nokrashy declared that this meeting had no political significance. Ambassador Shebirin also refused to issue a statement to the press. However, executives in political circles generally believe that this conversation concerns the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Anglo-Egyptian dispute.

### U.S. Delegation Departs for Turkey

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] A delegation jointly formed by the U.S. State Department, Army, and Navy recently departed by plane for Turkey. The mission is to assist Ambassador Wilson in investigating the country's needs in order to determine the content of assistance to be provided within the scope of U.S. aid legislation. The delegation will transfer to Turkey via Frankfurt, Germany, tomorrow. The delegation includes twelve Army representatives, led by Major General Oliver, and seven Navy representatives, led by Rear Admiral Herrmann. The State Department representatives are Cummins from the Foreign Liaison Department and McGill from the Bureau of Financial Development Policy.

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 19th] The Turkish Army General Staff has organized a committee responsible for determining the supplies needed by the Turkish Army in order to obtain them from the United States. According to unofficial sources, Turkey will receive several warships from the United States.

Turkish President Inonu Condemns Communism

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 19th] Today is Turkish Youth Day. President Inonu gave a speech, openly condemning communism and racism. He said, "During the war, the Turanian nationalist movement, incited by the enemy, attempted to move in all directions, but Turkish youth were not fools and would not be fooled. Later, that faction used the slogans of progress, democracy, and anti-fascism, and almost formed a dangerous movement, but it was also unsuccessful. All of these ideologies are wrong. All political developments in Turkey must be carried out within the legal scope. Although democratic politics sometimes encounters difficulties, it will gradually progress. In short, I believe that democratic politics will be able to achieve stability."

### Soviet Delegation Arrives in Seoul; Negotiations Expected to Begin Today

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 20th] The Soviet delegation of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for negotiations on the Korean issue arrived here today, and negotiations are expected to begin on the 21st.

[Reuters, Seoul, 20th] Korean Civil Administrator Hong An-gil (transliteration) issued an order today prohibiting mass rallies and demonstrations such as parades during the meeting of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission. It is also learned that Dr. Kim Gu has resigned from his position in the Joint Committee of the Provisional Legislative Assembly for unknown reasons, but it is learned that Kim Gu is in an American hospital for treatment due to poor health.

### Total Eclipse - Scientists Gather in Mashi to Observe

[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 19th] A total solar eclipse will be visible tomorrow in Araxá and Poxoréu, Brazil. It is estimated that in Araxá, the eclipse will begin at 11:19 AM standard time. The total eclipse will begin at 12:28 PM, and the eclipse will completely disappear by 1:52 PM. Twenty-four hours before the start of the eclipse, the skies over Araxá and Poxoréu are clear. Gambling Brazilians have placed bets at odds of four to one that the sky will remain clear during the four minutes of the total solar eclipse tomorrow. Scientists from thirteen countries have now gathered in these two locations, with total observation costs estimated at 200,000 yuan. If clouds are discovered in the sky at that time, only American scientists with aircraft equipment will be able to observe from above the clouds to a limited extent. The rest of the scientists will have to sigh and look at the sky. At the same time, the indigenous people of central Brazil are deeply disturbed by the approaching solar eclipse. At that time, there will inevitably be superstitious actions such as group prayers, chanting, and shooting arrows into the sky.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 19th] There will be a total solar eclipse on the 20th. According to the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the time of the first contact will be 11:10:48 AM on the 20th. The maximum eclipse will be at 1:35:06 PM, and the end of the eclipse will be at 4:23:54 PM (Greenwich time). The path of the total eclipse will make landfall on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, pass through central Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, then enter South America and exit into the Pacific Ocean. However, all parts of China (including Taiwan) will not be able to see even a partial eclipse.

### Britain and America Accuse Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia and Other Countries of Supporting Greek Guerrillas; Conflicts Continue to Arise in the Balkan Peninsula

[United Press, Geneva, 20th] According to well-informed sources: the forthcoming joint report by the United Nations Balkan Investigative Committee will accuse Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of supporting Greek guerrillas. It is said that the report also contains evidence to determine that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are attempting to incite discontent among the Greeks in Macedonia. Conversely, the Soviet report will certainly deny the interference of Greece's three neighboring countries, and accuse some of the witnesses as "criminals."

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 20th] Conflicts continue to arise in the Balkan Peninsula. The United Nations has dispatched a temporary border commission to monitor the situation. Greece is now preparing to guarantee full cooperation with the commission today. Its neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, intend to oppose the duties of the commission's investigators. The Security Council will meet today. All three countries will be able to express their opinions. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the resolution proposed by the Soviet Union, which advocates that the investigators of the commission should be limited to handling the tasks specifically assigned by the Security Council. Their offices should be moved away from Thessaloniki, near the Greek border, and the lives of the investigators should be strictly restricted. The United States and Britain will oppose this Soviet proposal. The temporary border commission is ordered to go to the Greek border area to monitor the situation, pending the completion of the report on the Greek border incidents being drafted by the formal committee in Geneva, and to submit it to the Security Council for a decision on action.

### Enthusiastic Celebrations for Ho Chi Minh's Birthday; Viet Minh Forces Launch General Offensive; Saigon Declares State of Emergency

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 19th] Viet Minh troops launched a full-scale offensive in the areas around Saigon last night, and Saigon authorities have declared a state of emergency as a result. According to some sources, yesterday was the birthday of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic. Therefore, the Viet Minh troops came out to act, launching a general offensive against all guard posts east and southwest of Saigon, which lasted for several hours, but finally retreated.

[Reuters, Saigon, 19th] Today is the 57th birthday of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic. Several French military outposts outside Saigon were attacked by the Viet Minh underground army last night, seemingly as a decoration for Ho Chi Minh's birthday. The Vietnamese side claims that the French suffered far greater losses than the Vietnamese in this attack, while French military officials say they have not yet received a detailed report. The Vietnamese newspapers here today published photos of "freedom fighters," with portraits of Ho Chi Minh alongside those of Nehru of India, President Sukarno of Indonesia, and President Roxas of the Philippines. According to a leader of the Viet Minh underground movement, thousands of Viet Minh men and women held underground gatherings here today, reiterating their determination to be loyal to Ho Chi Minh until death. Wherever the French army cannot reach, the Vietnamese people are openly celebrating enthusiastically.

Preconditions for Peace Talks

[Reuters Saigon 20th] A Viet Minh underground newspaper published in a suburb of Saigon stated that Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh said that negotiations between the Viet Minh and the French government could only begin if the French side recognized the Viet Minh as an independent state within the French Union. If negotiations cannot begin or unfortunately fail, the Viet Minh people can continue to fight for freedom for five or ten years if necessary.

### Italy Formally Applies to Join the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 19th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie today announced in a letter from the Italian government applying to join the United Nations organization: "Italy is prepared to accept the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Italy has suffered heavy sacrifices during the war, especially in the final stages of the war, fighting alongside the Allies against Germany. Its great contribution to the United Nations proves its willingness to cooperate for common causes." The application will be submitted to the Membership Committee of the Security Council and can be discussed after the Italian Peace Treaty is ratified.

### The Four-Power Committee Discussed Procedural Matters but Failed to Reach an Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 19th] The Four-Power Committee met today to discuss several procedural issues. The opinions of the countries are still very divided, and each insists on its own view, refusing to concede slightly, so that today's meeting still failed to reach an agreement. The main issue discussed today was whether to authorize the Expert Committee to begin discussing certain issues related to German assets, or to immediately begin studying the Zistersdorf oil issue, as the Soviet representative intended. The four representatives had different views and failed to reach a consensus.

### The Extermination of Sparrows Affects the Harvest

This is the biggest reason for food shortages

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th] Australian renowned biologist Professor Morrison said here today after a month of observation that the reason why the Japanese do not have enough rice is because they ate too many sparrows in the past. After the sparrows were killed, pests in the fields were rampant, eating all the grains.

### Conserve Cigarette Consumption

The US Secretary of the Treasury Calls on the People to

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Since the passage of the new budget, British cabinet ministers have no longer smoked in cabinet meetings. Treasury Secretary Dalton, when appealing to the people to reduce cigarette consumption by 25% to save US loan funds, announced this frugal matter.

### The Struggle for Middle East Oil is Now in Full Swing; Pravda Publishes an Article Attacking American Ambitions

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet leader economist Varga wrote in today's Pravda that the struggle for oil rights in the Middle East is now in full swing. In order to increase the transport volume of the Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline, Britain plans to build another oil pipeline from Iran to the Mediterranean coast, which is expected to be completed in 1949. The recent American activities in Palestine and Egypt prove that America intends to obtain outlets for Saudi Arabian oil in these two places for strategic purposes. America is apparently taking advantage of Britain's economic difficulties to force Britain to make solutions favorable to America on various issues related to Middle East oil policy.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 19th] Soviet economist Varga wrote in Pravda that the United States is seeking to become a hegemony in the Mediterranean, resorting to all kinds of monopolies, attempting to divide up most of the oil sources of other countries. The United States has 6% of the world's population and 35% of the world's developed oil sources, and should be content with that, and should not covet the oil sources of other countries. Now in the Near East and Middle East, the United States needs to obtain strongholds on all the coasts reached by oil pipelines. After Palestine and Egypt are separated from British influence, they will become such strongholds, and the oil pipeline connecting Saudi Arabia can be connected to these places. This is one of the reasons for the large-scale activities of the United States in these regions.

### United Nations News Committee - Dutch Representative Elected Chairman

Our country will be represented by Zhang Pingqun at the meeting

[Reuters, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Commission on Freedom of the Press met today, and Dutch representative Van Heuven Goedhart was elected chairman, Czech representative Šikl was elected vice-chairman, and Canadian representative Ferguson was elected secretary.

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The Commission on Freedom of the Press, composed of twelve member states of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, held its opening ceremony today. Our country was represented by Zhang Pingqun, Consul General in New York, at the opening ceremony, which was presided over by the Assistant Secretary-General for Social Affairs of the United Nations, Laugier, who addressed the twelve news experts of the Commission. They were selected by the Social Council to serve as experts rather than as representatives of governments. Laugier emphasized that although the principle of freedom of the press has been recognized by all member states of the United Nations, the tasks facing the Commission are still difficult. He said: "The application of this principle varies greatly from country to country, often changing its fundamental concepts due to tradition and current customs." The first task of the Commission is to draft the agenda and files for the International Conference on Freedom of the Press to be convened at the next regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Accounting Committee - First Meeting

Another subordinate body of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Accounting Committee composed of fifteen countries, also held its first meeting today and elected its officers. The Accounting Committee is the last of the nine committees established under the Council. Its current work will focus on organizational matters, and then it will deal with the main task of international currency.

### Britain Approves Treaty with Finland

[Reuters, London, 19th] The British ratification of the Finnish Treaty is now in the possession of British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson. The British government is now in contact with the Soviet government to determine the date for the formal exchange of ratification. The Finnish Treaty only requires the ratification of Britain and the Soviet Union, so the treaty will take effect from the date of the exchange of ratification. The Soviet government informed the British government three months ago, stating that the Soviet Union was prepared to ratify the Finnish Treaty in mid-month, but so far it is not known what action the Soviet Union has taken on this matter.

### Want to Purchase Japanese Goods - Must be Repaid with Foreign Exchange

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Regarding Japan's export trade, it has recently been decided by the Far Eastern Commission that anyone who wants to obtain Japanese export goods must be able to supply Japan with the import goods it needs, or repay Japan's export goods with foreign exchange.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in England to Give Lectures

### Guerilla Activities in Northern Iran; Iran Orders Closure of Soviet Border

[Reuters, Tehran, 19th] Iranian Minister of Labor and Propaganda Alam Eshteh confirmed that there are underground activities of guerrillas in the Azerbaijan province of northern Iran, but he also said that the Army Department has been able to fully control the situation there. The Iranian King is scheduled to tour Azerbaijan Province on the 24th of this month, which proves that the situation there is normal. According to travelers from northern Iran, the organization of the armed guerrillas in Azerbaijan Province is similar to that of the guerrillas in Greece. Recently, people have been entering Azerbaijan Province from north of the Iranian border every day to join the guerrilla front. Foreign observers estimate that the strength of the guerrillas has reached 15,000. Minister of Propaganda Alam Eshteh also said that the Army Department has ordered the complete closure of the Iranian-Soviet border.

### Third Session of the Senate Approaching; 44 Proposals Received; Telephone Abuses Are Rampant, A Thorough Rectification is Planned; Central Government Recommended to Effectively Protect the Newspaper Industry; Requesting That Each Elementary School Extend Dismissal by One Hour

[Our Reporter] The first session of the third meeting of the Municipal Senate is scheduled to be held from the 26th of this month, with a session of about one week. The opening ceremony will be held on the morning of the first day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. From the second day, the meeting time will be from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM every afternoon.

As of yesterday, the council had received a total of forty-four proposals from senators. Among them, Zhou Xiangsheng proposed: There are rampant abuses with the phone system in the city. He requests the Municipal Utilities Bureau to thoroughly rectify the problems. Zhao Junhao, Feng Youzhen, Zhang Zhihan and others proposed: It is recommended that the Central Government issue a notice to all levels of government and military and constitutional agencies throughout the country to effectively protect the local newspaper industry and practitioners, in order to promote the spirit of news freedom. Hou Jiyuan proposed: He requests the Municipal Government to set a deadline for prohibiting the use of single-seat tricycles, in order to facilitate passenger safety. He also proposed to telegraph the Central Government to abolish price controls, abolish regulations that violate negotiated prices and price limits, and open model department stores in Shanghai to benefit people's livelihood. Shi Zongde proposed: It is proposed that the government sample the quality of products produced by domestic manufacturers and determine reward and punishment measures to reorganize business ethics. Qu Yue proposed: The Land Tax Survey of the Finance Bureau is still not accurate, and it is urgently necessary to accurately levy taxes based on the underlying accounts. If there are errors, grain households should be allowed to correct them as much as possible, and no punishment should be imposed. Ju Chengxiang proposed: It is requested that the Education Authority issue a notice to elementary schools to extend dismissal by one hour.

[Another Report] Senators Zhao Yangxiong, Ye Fenghu, and Yao Baozhen held a reception for the district heads of the fourth district and the chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies at the Youth Hall yesterday to exchange views on district administration.

Speaker Pan Inspects Students at the National School in Dachang District Who Welcome Him by Waving Flags (Photo by Our Newspaper)

### Speaker Visits Dachang and Zhenru; No Compensation Given for Requisitioned Land; Lack of Water and Electricity Supply Felt

[Our Reporter] Municipal Senate Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang visited the Dachang and Zhenru districts yesterday morning, accompanied by the district chiefs and chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies. As a result of the speaker's inspection, he learned a lot about the areas that each district hopes to build or improve. The main points are as follows: (1) During the period of the occupation, the enemy forcibly occupied more than 5,000 mu of civilian land in the Dachang district to build an airport, without paying any compensation. Now that it has been taken over by the Central Government, the government should quickly pay for the land. (2) Before the War of Resistance, the Dachang district was under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. After the victory, the Shanghai Municipal Government, referring to the original plan of the Republic of China, has been promoting district administration in the Dachang district since 1927. Since then, various facilities have been very effective, and the relationship between officials and civilians has been harmonious. However, the boundaries between the county and the city have not yet been clearly defined by the highest authorities, resulting in disputes over governance from time to time. It is requested that the government follow the actual situation and follow the wishes of the people, and quickly and clearly assign it to the municipal government in order to prevent disputes.

Narrow Roads in Disrepair for Many Years

(3) The streets in Pengpu and Dachang towns are extremely narrow. After the war, many houses were destroyed, and citizens often rebuild them. However, the area of the streets is limited, and the newly built houses are uneven and without standards. It is requested that the Public Works Bureau quickly measure them so that they can be uniform. In addition, the streets have been in disrepair for many years, and the sewers are also blocked, preventing the flow of sewage. It is also requested that the Public Works Bureau repair them as soon as possible.

Requisitioned Civilian Land Should be Returned Quickly

(4) In the Zhenru district, near the Zhenru Transmitting Station of Shanghai International Radio Station, there are more than 30 mu of civilian land that were occupied by the enemy during the war. After the victory, the station took it over. Not only did it not return the land to the owners, but it has recently expanded the scope, erecting a large number of iron towers and wooden poles, and the occupied civilian land is more than 100 mu, which has a great impact on agricultural production. It is requested that the government quickly stop this and return it to the original owners to benefit farmers and protect property rights.

Lack of Sanitary Facilities Also Felt

(5) There is a severe shortage of water and electricity supply in the Dachang and Zhenru districts. The residents of the district generally believe that since the existing water and electricity companies in the districts cannot fully supply water and electricity, they are requested to give up their exclusive rights, and let the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company take over the matter.

(6) There is a lack of sanitary facilities in the Dachang and Zhenru districts. According to the Health Bureau, if the districts have suitable houses, they can consider setting up clinics. Now the Zhenru district plans to raise tens of millions of yuan to accomplish this.

This morning, the speaker will continue to inspect the Yangsi and Yangjing districts.

### Seven More UNRRA Fishing Boats Arrive

[Our Reporter] According to the UNRRA authorities, seven more deep-sea fishing boats of the agency arrived in Fuxing Island from Seattle, USA, last weekend.

### One of the Main Culprits of the Nanjing Massacre, Tanaka Will Be Sent to Nanjing for Trial; A Gruesome Photo of Him Personally Beheading Victims Is Obtained; Izawa's Hospital Stay Extended, Postponing His Transfer

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tanaka Gunji, a major war criminal who was escorted to Shanghai from Japan the day before yesterday, holds the military rank of Major. He is temporarily detained in the detention center of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He will be sent to the Nanjing Military Tribunal for trial soon, as Tanaka Gunji is one of the main culprits in the Nanjing Massacre. He is from Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, and is currently 43 years old. He graduated from the 37th class of the Japanese Military Academy, specializing in artillery. He and Hashimoto Kingoro are both well-known radical right-wing elements. Before the War of Resistance, he served as a captain in the Kanda Division, stationed in Beiping, Baoding, Zhengding, and other places in our country. In 1937, when Nanjing fell, the Japanese army wantonly burned and killed civilians after entering the city. Tanaka was a company commander under Tani Hisao at the time and was the first to break into the city of Nanjing. He personally used a military sword to kill more than 200 of our soldiers and civilians. Among the documents investigated by the resident delegation in Japan, there is a gruesome photo of Tanaka personally beheading our captured soldiers in Nanjing with his sword. In addition, there are documents from the Japanese side praising Tanaka's courage in killing. As for Major General Izawa Sadaki, the reason why he was not escorted in the same plane this time is that the criminal is currently bedridden in the hospital, so he has been temporarily granted an extension for his transfer.

Our country has requested the extradition of many Japanese war criminals, and many documents have been sent recently because the UK, the US, and France attach great importance to the evidence of crimes. As for the handling of the returned items, it is proceeding actively, and four or five ships can be recovered next month.

### Revealing Information From a Factory Manager's Smoking Worker; Port Affairs Group Personnel's Extortion of 50 Million Exposed; Wang Zhaoren and Chen Bohua Detained and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhaoren (45 years old, Ningbo native), an honorary supervisor of the port affairs patrol team of the port police station, and Chen Bohua (28 years old, residing at No. 1 Longmen Road) recently colluded with Zheng Zhongwen and Lian Qingxiang, who impersonated military personnel and another accomplice who is still at large. They went to the home of Chen Xiuzhang, the manager of the Xinhua Hat Factory at No. 61 Gaofu Lane, Changle Road, on the pretext of searching for opium. They extorted 50 million yuan by finding a can of ashes. The next day, they divided the money in the dormitory of the wharf outside the No. 1 pier of the group. Afterwards, someone secretly reported to the police station. Director Xuan ordered detectives Ma Feimu and Ding Wenyang to investigate and verify the facts. At 0:45 on the 17th of this month, Chen Bohua was arrested at the entrance of the Carlton Theater. A Mauser pistol and four bullets were found on him. After interrogation at the station, he confessed the details. He said that this time it was initiated by Wang Zhaoren and Li Zhongwen. At that time, they received a report from Zhang Acai, a worker at the Xinhua Hat Factory, saying that the factory manager Chen Xiuzhang smoked opium and could be extorted for money. After discussion, they hired a car on the 10th of this month to Chen's residence. Chen was out at the time, so Wang Zhaoren searched out the ashes on the spot. Then his concubine intervened and arranged a negotiation with his wife at No. 17 Liuyuan Road, Weile Road. As a result, Chen was willing to pay 50 million yuan in cash as a reward, packed in three hat cages, and hired a car to send them to the intersection of Zhongzheng Road and Beile Road. Then the suspect hired a Haida Taxi to the Tongqing Money Exchange on Sijing Road to deposit it into the suspect's current account first, and then distribute it the next day. In addition to Wang, Li, Lian, and the suspect, there were six informants. Each person received an average of 3 million yuan, and the remaining 20 million yuan was swallowed by Li alone. After the police station received the confession, they sent a letter to the port affairs group and detained Wang on the morning of the 19th, and sent him to the detective team for investigation. The confession was the same as Chen's. However, the accomplices Zhongwen and Lian Qingxiang had fled after hearing the news. The case was completed yesterday, and it was decided to transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation today.

### Car Detention Dispute; Jiang Biao Is Accused and the Trial Begins; Both Sides Confront Each Other, Causing Several Conflicts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, and Tan Zhaolin, Deputy Director of the Transportation Group of the Bureau, were sued by Liu Qintang, Chairman of the Jianguo Industrial Company, for abuse of power and obstruction of freedom. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted them for the crime stipulated in Article 304, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The trial began in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. After Judge Ye Guiling took the bench, he first summoned the plaintiff, Liu Qintang, for questioning. Liu stated: "On December 24 last year, Jianguo Industrial Company purchased 22 five-ton Dodge trucks from Xinsui Company through a transfer to the Materials Supply Bureau. By December 30, the payment and the trucks had been delivered clearly by both parties. On January 30 of this year, the Materials Supply Bureau issued four vehicle ownership certificates to Jianguo Company. However, on February 18 and 19, the defendants suddenly claimed that Xinsui Company had failed to fulfill the contract and had the 22 trucks that had been delivered to Jianguo Company all taken back by the defendant Tan Zhaolin and his men. The plaintiff then filed a lawsuit in court for seizing materials." Liu also presented vehicle ownership certificates and other documents. Subsequently, the defendant Jiang Biao was summoned, who said, "I have no dealings with Jianguo Company. The contract was signed with Xinsui Company. I didn't know Liu Qintang at all in the past. The detention of the 22 trucks on February 18 and 19 was done by me sending Tan Zhaolin. The reason for the detention was that Xinsui Company violated three items stipulated in the contract: (1) It should not be sold in Shanghai; (2) The February deadline had passed; (3) The full cost of the vehicles had not been paid, and the vehicle ownership still belongs to this bureau. As for the vehicle ownership certificate, it was issued by Chief Wang of the distribution office of this bureau and was not approved by the bureau chief, so it cannot be considered valid." The other defendant, Tan Zhaolin, said, "The detention of the vehicles was carried out on the orders of the bureau chief and no violence was used." Finally, the plaintiff and the defendant confronted each other repeatedly. Both sides presented their arguments and almost clashed. After Judge Ye stopped them, he instructed both parties to submit favorable evidence to the court by the 29th of this month. The oral argument will be held at 9:30 am on the 3rd of next month, and no further summons will be issued.

At the same time, he put on the new clothes. The shop owner, Xu Daxiang, suspected nothing and sent the apprentice Tang Suoshan along. Unexpectedly, after leaving the store, Wang took the No. 16 trolleybus. He tried to get off several times on the way, but the apprentice followed closely and failed. When they reached the end of Jiangxi Road, he claimed to have reached his destination. After the two got off the bus, they turned from Wudui Road into the Bund.

### Reader Consultation; Legal Explanation

(1) Extortionate Rent Increase

Chen Dexin asks: A rented several new houses from B last year to open a shop, and agreed to a rent of two shi of rice, but no contract was signed. Unexpectedly, this spring, B actually asked A to increase the rent, otherwise he would demand relocation for renovation. I would like to ask: (1) Is B's request legal? (2) Can A refuse to relocate? (3) If A is forced to, can he sell his business inventory to the landlord at a price? Or claim compensation for loss of the shop?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) It is illegal, because the current laws and regulations, Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Law stipulates, "If the lease has no fixed term, each party may terminate the lease at any time, but if there is a custom that favors the lessee, follow the custom." (2) Can legally refuse. (3) (A) Cannot force the landlord to buy the business inventory. (B) Except with mutual agreement, compensation can only be claimed if the lessee actually suffers damage due to the landlord's illegal behavior.

(2) Ancestral Inheritance

Huang Qinghua asks: I have six brothers. My third brother was adopted by my paternal uncle. He joined the army during the War of Resistance and died in the army in Hankou in July 1946. Now there are several legal questions, please answer. (1) Can the son of his biological brother be adopted to inherit the estate? (2) The paternal uncle and aunt have passed away early (and have no brothers). Can the adoption procedure be legally established if the parents and uncles of the third brother make the decision and sign the contract?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] The current law no longer has ancestral inheritance. Except for inheritances that began before the implementation of this code (May 5, 1931), which are still subject to the laws at that time, no other ancestral inheritance claims can be made, that is, no adoption issues arise.

### This City's University Students Organize the School Protection Grand Alliance; Fudan and Jinan Universities Resume Classes

[Report from our newspaper] University students in this city have recently organized the School Protection Grand Alliance and issued a declaration stating: "This student movement occurred strangely and has spread to various schools. For a time, as many as eight schools were on strike. To people in society, it may seem like a unanimous decision and action of all the students, but who knows that this is entirely the scheme of a very small number of conspirators in each school who want to use the name and power of students to create social chaos, increase the government's difficulties, and achieve their goal of overthrowing the government. For the survival of our motherland, for our own future, and more importantly, to be worthy of our conscience and the 450 million compatriots, we have no choice but to organize this School Protection Grand Alliance with a heavy heart. At the same time, we must write down the painful things, one by one:

Appeal to the Government to Rescue the Youth

(1) They launched the "eat it all," "all eat" movement. Is this what our conscience is willing to do? Our public expenses have already increased to more than 70,000 yuan (including rice money and food expenses). We have a "tooth sacrifice" every three days. After the 16th of each month, we have fish and meat at every meal. Do we still want to extract from the heads of the poor people to satisfy our extravagant desires? How can we bear to take away the lifeblood of the common people and increase our enjoyment? (2) They oppose the qualification examination and the final examination. Now the Ministry of Education has allowed the qualification examination and the final examination not to be held. Do we still have an excuse to make trouble? We really can't figure out where the reason for the trouble lies? (3) They oppose "civil war." In fact, how can it be a civil war? It is purely a communist rebellion. Why don't we think about the fact that "the government has issued ceasefire orders several times, but the Communist Party has desperately wanted to fight, and the government has repeatedly begged for peace talks, but the Communist Party has simply ignored them"? We need peace, and we oppose internal strife, but the responsibility for internal strife should not be borne by the government. On the contrary, it should be borne by the Communist Party. (4) They want to rescue education. Does rescuing education mean allowing thousands of young people to enjoy public funding, sitting in school and going on strike every day, neglecting their studies? Does rescuing education mean turning schools upside down and making them restless? Their slogans sound very loud, but their schemes are very poisonous. Therefore, we hope that the Communist Party will show conscience and stop using the beautiful name of rescuing education to destroy education. At the same time, we appeal to the government to rescue the youth.

Continuing Strikes Is Suicide

In short, they have shouted enough nice-sounding terms. Their conscience has been bought with money. For our "future," for the sake of being worthy of our ancestors above, and being worthy of our descendants below, and being worthy of ourselves in the middle, for the sake of preserving a lifeline for our 450 million compatriots, we are here with our conscience, with tears in our eyes, and with a miserable voice, shouting the following slogans in front of our elders, brothers, sisters: (1) Demand that the government come up with a way to stop the Communist Party from operating in schools! (2) We request the government to sanction students who violate the law! (3) We request the government to protect the youth who are truly protecting the school! (4) Opposing internal strife is the demand of the common people. Opposing civil war is the slogan of the Communist Party. (5) Internal strife is caused by the Communist Party, and peace is destroyed by the Communist Party. (6) To oppose internal strife, the Communist Party must be eliminated first. To seek peace, the Communist Party must be eliminated first. (7) Patriotic students should not be deceived by the Communist Party and its followers. (8) Eating it all, making trouble completely, and destroying everything are the three major policies of the Communist Party to destroy the country. (9) The strike movement is a youth suicide movement. (10) We students want to stabilize the school. (11) We students want to eat and study. (12) All the demands of our students have been met. Continuing the strike is suicide. (13) We oppose being used as a tool for other people's political struggles. (14) We want to maintain the personality of pure, patriotic youth. (15) We are all for the country. (16) Everyone wants peace, only the Communist Party does not want peace. (17) Oppose turning the pure youth movement into a tool for political struggle.

### Maintenance of Studies Movement: Ten Propositions

[Another report] University and specialized school students in this city feel uneasy about the student movements caused by the recent issues of the relocation of Great Britain University, the reform of Jiaotong University, and the public expenses of Zhongshan University, which have stirred up schools throughout the city, causing disturbances and preventing students from concentrating on their studies. Therefore, at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, a meeting was held at Datong University, attended by more than 40 representatives from 16 universities and specialized schools in the city. It was decided to organize and establish the Shanghai University and Specialized School Students' Joint Association for the Maintenance of Studies Movement, uniting students throughout the city to protect schools and resume classes in order to maintain their studies. A declaration was also issued, putting forward the following ten propositions: (1) We advocate strengthening student activities to implement our reasonable demands, but we believe that strikes are only a means, not an end, and not equivalent to a student movement. (2) We advocate that protecting schools and resuming classes is the right and obligation of every student, and it is also a specific goal to be striven for in the student movement. Resuming classes is to enrich the strength of our actions, and protecting schools is to preserve our base for work. (3) We advocate that the protection of freedom and the self-awareness of a sense of responsibility are relative. To demand freedom, one must first understand the meaning of freedom; to advocate the rule of law, one must first learn the habit of the rule of law. (4) We advocate that political reform and the improvement of people's livelihoods are not as easy as playing magic tricks, and they cannot be changed overnight. This requires time, manpower, and especially stability. (5) We advocate that students today must face reality, unite, and strengthen themselves, and strive to be the most progressive and greatest stabilizing force in society. (6) We advocate that always opposing internal strife is the only prerequisite for guaranteeing educational work and increasing educational funding, but we must go further and more concretely thoroughly examine the responsibility for internal strife and attack the culprits. (7) We advocate that the truly eternal sinners are only those who stir up trouble, incite hatred, and rely on violence. Mankind cannot prevent the permanent tragedy of division except through tolerance and understanding. (8) We advocate that young people who truly love the country and love mankind must first understand that the key to social happiness and national victory lies in the work of laboratories and libraries, and not in the dazzling of slogans. (9) We advocate that the power of the masses is greater than that of leaders. The most successful movement is the one that can best transmit social sympathy, and the expectations of teachers and parents are a most concerned form of sympathy. (10) We advocate that only reason can make us free. To learn to recognize the truth, we must first restore reason. This will make personal emotional impulses even more meaningless, and the significance of education will be even more important.

[Report from our newspaper] Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, University of Shanghai, Soochow University, Datong University, Tongji University, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical College in this city successively experienced student strikes last week. As of yesterday, they have not yet subsided. However, among them, in addition to Fudan University and the fourth-year students of Jiaotong University, who resumed classes yesterday, Jinan University also resumed classes today.

Fudan Resumed Classes Yesterday

Fudan University resumed normal operations yesterday. Most students went to school for classes. Only more than 300 people who participated in the parade the day before yesterday asked the school for a day off. They will also attend classes as usual from today onwards. It is heard that the school authorities have accepted the request of the majority of students and will formally announce the dissolution of the overdue department and subject representative assembly within a few days. In the future, student activities in the school will be based on the existing student union as the legitimate student representative organization. According to reports, the "Department and Subject Representative Assembly" was a temporary organization established by the school to prepare for the May 5th Alumni Festival.

Jinan Resumes Classes Today

Since the strike at Jinan University last week, the university's president, Li Shouyong, telegraphed the Ministry of Education to firmly resign. School affairs are temporarily presided over by the Temporary School Affairs Maintenance Committee. Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education, specially sent Inspector Tong Dahong to Shanghai the day before yesterday to represent Minister Zhu and sincerely persuade him to stay. It is heard that Li may dispel his intention to resign and go to the school to work within a few days. The committee believes that students have wasted their studies during the strike period, and fourth-year students who are about to graduate are particularly affected. A meeting was held yesterday morning to decide to advise students to resume classes today.

University of Shanghai Students Return Home

The authorities of the University of Shanghai announced a few days ago that students would be divided into groups based on their final grades, with 70 points as the passing score. The Student Self-Government Association of the school believed that it was a disguised grade point system and still maintained a striking attitude to show opposition. Moreover, there were frequent disputes with some students who opposed the strike. In order to avoid unfortunate incidents among students, the school officially announced a temporary suspension of classes yesterday morning, and students could leave the school and return home, waiting for the school to notify them to attend classes. Lin, the acting president of the school, and Li Ming'an, a student of the Self-Government Association, and five others went to see Mayor Wu separately yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss and report on the matter. The students of the school still maintained close contact with the professors yesterday, exchanging opinions on the matter. Moreover, the "Committee Against Arbitrary Strikes" of the school changed its name to "University of Shanghai School Protection Student Union" and issued a declaration yesterday, explaining its special attitude and the school's painstaking efforts to care for the students, hoping that classes would resume as soon as possible.

Conflicting News from Datong

The Student Self-Government Association of Datong University has been on strike for several days to demand that the school authorities reform school administration, and their attitude has become increasingly firm. Yesterday afternoon, the association convened a general meeting of all representatives, and it was resolved to persist in the strike and to send representatives to Beijing for a petition tomorrow. According to another source, since the establishment of the School Administration Innovation Committee, most students have approved of resuming classes. The current graduating students have also begun to lead the class resumption movement, publishing a call to all students, calling on teachers and students to cooperate and resume classes as soon as possible.

Partial Resumption of Classes at Jiaotong University

Fourth-year students of Jiaotong University decided to resume classes from today because they are about to graduate. Students in other grades still go to school for self-study. Tongji University, Soochow University, Shanghai Medical College, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical College are still on strike. It is heard that they are discussing the issue of resuming classes separately.

### The Zheng Lun Team Won Four Consecutive Victories; Crushed St. John's Last Night; Champion Team Lost 65 to 25

[Report from our newspaper] The Luoyang Zheng Lun basketball team defeated this year's university basketball champion St. John's team again at the city gymnasium at 7:00 p.m. last night, resulting in a score of 65 to 25, and the first half was 31 to 9, creating a great record of four consecutive victories. The Zheng Lun team has always been at a disadvantage, because the Zheng Lun defense is tight, and it is difficult to get close to the basket. In the second half, the visiting team's new forces Chen Baoshu, Cheng Fei, and Ji Dexiang came on the field, and the new talents were extraordinary. St. John's star Bao Lei was not present, which was a great loss. Since arriving in Shanghai, the visiting team has won all four games, which is quite difficult. There were more than 800 spectators, and the shouts were incessant, and the situation was quite enthusiastic.

Absolute Advantage

Zheng Lun team leader Cai Zhongqiang presented a flag, which was accepted by St. John's team leader Zhu Mingxing. The players on the home team were Wu Xinyun, Wang Nianci, Tao Yingshi, Zhu Mingxing, and Zhuang Yikai. The players of the Zheng Lun team were Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan. After the referees Chen Baolin and Wang Yiqiao announced the start of the game, Zheng Lun's Cai Zhongqiang broke through on the right wing, and Yu Ruizhang made three free throws in the middle. Cai added one point, and the score was suspended at seven points. St. John's called a timeout, and Hu Huizhao replaced Wang Nianci. Cai increased the score to nine points. Zhu Mingxing scored three points with one free throw and one shot. St. John's cheerleaders began to cheer. When the score was 13 to 3, Zhuang Yikai was replaced by Wu Xinyun. Although St. John's scored two goals by Tao Yingshi and Zhu Mingxing, Tu Wenlong, the opponent, made a single-arm shot and scored points continuously. Soon the score became 15 to 7. St. John's called another timeout, and Yu Erjia replaced Zhuang Yikai. The first half ended with 31 to 9, and Zheng Lun had an absolute advantage.

Four Consecutive Victories

During the break, St. John's concentrated its cheerleaders to shout wildly. In the second half, Chen Baoshu, Cheng Fei, and Ji Dezang of the Zheng Lun team replaced Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan, and Cai Zhongqiang. St. John's also adjusted its lineup. At the beginning, Wu Xinyun scored two consecutive goals, and Yu Ruizhang of Zheng Lun added two points. Zhang Yikai and Wu Xinyun of St. John's scored again, making the score 35 to 17. When the score was 41 to 19, Wu Xinyun committed a foul and was "graduated." Hu Huizhao took his place. The performance of the new forces of the visiting team was not bad, and Ji Dezang was particularly lively. St. John's relied on Zhu Mingxing and Zhuang Yikai to make some decorations. In the last four minutes, the record had reached 61 to 25. St. John's lost good opportunities under the basket several times, which was regrettable. At the last moment, St. John's made its sixth timeout. The result was 65 to 25, and Zheng Lun won over St. John's.

### The Zheng Lun Schedule Is Rearranged

The Zheng Lun basketball team has three remaining games in Shanghai, against the Giant Enkas and the League Champion Hua Lian. However, because the Giant requested a postponement, the schedule had to be rearranged. Moreover, the original game against Hua Lian on the 24th was cancelled because the team was invited to Xiamen and Hong Kong for matches and had already purchased plane tickets to leave Shanghai on the 23rd. Now, in order to have the opportunity to compete with the Zheng Lun team, the team has abandoned its original plan to go to Hong Kong and decided to rush back on the 28th and play against the Zheng Lun team on the 30th. The visiting team will also stay in Shanghai for two more days to prepare for the game. The rearranged schedule is as follows:

22nd: Zheng Lun vs. Enkas

### Rapid Advance of Cantonese and Cotton Mill Factions in Shanghai Stock Market; Chinese Shares See Another Surge Yesterday; Many Rumors of Wing On Textile's Capital Increase; Major Investors Spare No Effort to Plunge In

Chinese shares saw stronger buying interest from the Cantonese and cotton mill factions yesterday. Wing On Textile, amid highly favorable rumors of capital increase, led the market, hitting its daily limit, followed by Sincere Co. However, general miscellaneous and small-to-medium-sized stocks lagged far behind. This was due to major investors focusing their full strength on Wing On Textile, leading to this situation.

Morning Opening

The market opened with various stocks showing fatigue. Lai On and Wing Foong first hit their daily limits, then Wing On Textile entered the scene. Numbers 89, and others vigorously bought, driving the opening price to a high of 6500 yuan. Rumors circulated regarding Wing On Textile's capital increase with varying figures (from 29 to 84 shares). After the opening, numbers 89, 162, 185, 4, and 97 all entered the market, repeatedly reaching their daily limit. Numbers 94, 105, 106, 82, 157, 219, 65, and 152 sold, pushing the price down below 6400 yuan. Numbers 186, 14, and 231 took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, showing some struggle. Numbers 154, 8, 100, 91, 30, 218, and 196 continuously sold off, and Wing On Textile fell to the 6000 yuan mark. Numbers 4, 8, 162, 76, and 89 bought up to 6380 yuan. Numbers 94, 155, 197, 36, 65, and 223 sold again. Match, China Silk, and King Lun all hit their daily limit declines, and prices retreated into the 6100 yuan range. Numbers 61, 105, 106, 235, 143, 162, and 17 bought in, and Cantonese investors vigorously purchased, pushing the price back up to 6500 yuan after 11:00 AM. Numbers 213, 226, 75, and 65 sold off, retreating to 6380 yuan. Later, the rumor of a million-yuan parallel line of cost price resurfaced. Numbers 155, 143, 152, 142, 183, 35, and 85 jointly purchased, and Wing On Textile and Lai On also hit their daily limit increases. The midday close rose again to around 6530 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile hit its daily limit increase, Sincere Co., Meiya, and New Kwong slightly rose, New China fell by half, Keen Hing was flat, Wing On Public Utility fell by half a percentage point, and King Fook slightly declined. In terms of spot transactions, Wing On Textile rose by slightly less than 10%, Sincere Co. and Meiya rose by half a percentage point, Wing On Public Utility and Keen Hing each fell by half a percentage point, and New Kwong and King Fook slightly increased. In terms of less active stocks, Lai On hit its daily limit increase, Wing Foong rose to its daily limit before slightly retreating, Match, China Silk, and King Lun hit their daily limit declines before recovering somewhat, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank slightly rose, and the rest fell by half a percentage point.

Afternoon

The market outside had already been calling for higher prices. Wing On Textile immediately hit its limit upon entering the market. Numbers 117, 153, 112, and 185 all bought in, and Lai On, Wing Foong, and Wing On Public Utility successively hit their daily limits. Wing On Textile also reached its limit for spot transactions, and subsequent trading had to be conducted in the gray market. Numbers 91, 185, 47, 82, and 183 all bought in. Meiya and Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank also reached their daily limits. Sincere Co. was bid up to its daily limit by numbers 126, 4, and 69, but later, due to the return of lower prices in the off-exchange market, it was sold off by numbers 24, 186, and 144, and the bid price fell to 6800 yuan. After 3:15 PM, numbers 224, 152, and 213 came in to buy, and the price rose again to above 7000 yuan. However, trading was limited due to the 1.8 billion yuan withdrawn by the four banks and two bureaus. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile, Sincere Co., and Wing On Public Utility hit their daily limit increases. Meiya hit its daily limit increase before retreating somewhat, rising by slightly less than 10%. New China and Keen Hing slightly rose, and New Kwong rose by slightly less than 10%, King Fook rose by slightly more than half a percentage point. In terms of spot transactions, Wing On Textile and Sincere Co. hit their daily limit increases. Meiya hit its daily limit increase before retreating, rising by slightly less than 10%. The same was true for Wing On Public Utility, which rose by about 10%. Keen Hing and King Fook slightly rose, and New Kwong rose by slightly more than half a percentage point. In terms of less active stocks, Wing Foong, Lai On, and Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank hit their daily limits. Da Tung, Match, China Silk, and King Lun hit their daily limit declines before recovering somewhat. The former rose by half a percentage point, while the latter three slightly declined or fell by half a percentage point. New Asia had no transactions in the aftermarket and still fell by half a percentage point. In the off-exchange market, all old stocks were flat or weak except for Chapei, which slightly rose.

### Continued Decline in Consolidated Bonds

Yesterday, the supply of government bonds exceeded demand, and retail investors liquidated their holdings. Consolidated C bonds opened at 14000 yuan, with a high of 14300 yuan, a low of 12900 yuan, and finally struggled at 13700 yuan. Room 550 bought in, while room 360 sold. Transactions amounted to approximately 5 million yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and D bonds each fell by 1500 yuan, Consolidated C bonds fell by 1000 yuan, and Consolidated E bonds also fell by 1400 yuan.

### Mixed Performance of Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, foreign stocks stabilized in the morning due to the reduction in Shanghai Electric shares. Ewo Cotton Mill opened at 73000 yuan and struggled above 72000 yuan at midday close, starting from 71000 yuan. Money exchangers sold slightly, while securities firms and Cantonese investors bought in. The afternoon's activity in Chinese shares was still driven by securities firms absorbing shares. Ewo Cotton Mill then rose independently to around 75000 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton Mill and Ewo Property each rose by half a percentage point, and the performance of the remaining stocks was mixed.

### Rice Market Continues to Rise; Top-Grade White Rice Reaches New High; Top-Quality Goods Priced at 330,000 Yuan per Stone

[Report from this newspaper] The rice market continued to rise due to reported price increases in the production areas.

Top-grade Early rice was priced at 300,000 yuan, medium-grade rice at 295,000 yuan, and lower-grade rice at 290,000 yuan. Top-grade Yang Hsien rice was priced at 305,000 yuan to 310,000 yuan, medium-grade rice at 300,000 yuan, and lower-grade rice at 290,000 yuan. Top-grade White Yuan rice was priced at 325,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan, medium-grade rice at 310,000 yuan, and lower-grade rice at 280,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan. Top-grade Yin Yuan rice was priced at 310,000 yuan, medium-grade rice at 305,000 yuan, and lower-grade rice at 295,000 yuan.

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the distribution of rice to impoverished households would be implemented within this month after the designated rice shops are finalized and the survey of impoverished residents is completed.

[Further Report] Flour rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan yesterday, while wheat bran, due to oversupply, retreated by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake first rose and then retreated, lacking the strength to rise further, and finally slightly increased by 300 to 1,000 yuan. In the oil market, raw oil from Cantonese suppliers was sluggish and weak, and the market was flat and tired. The supply of soybean oil was still acceptable, and there were no temporary changes. Vegetable oil and sesame oil had little fluctuation, but refined oil rebounded by 10,000 yuan. Due to 30,000 to 40,000 bags of soybeans arriving in Shanghai from the Northeast, sentiment softened, and prices steadily declined, decreasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Soybeans remained dull and sluggish, hovering in a tired state. Corn fell by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and red sorghum also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was some activity in the retail trade of red beans, and prices were similar. Raw peanuts remained flat, and sesame seeds were firm for high-quality goods but sluggish for lower-quality goods.

[Further Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Deng Geng ship returned to Shanghai from Yingkou yesterday, carrying 600 tons of soybean cake and 1,000 tons of scrap iron. Another report stated that large quantities of rice and flour could arrive in Shanghai within days.

### Joint Tea Association Revises Tea Loan Conditions

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] For the 36th year tea loan, the original requirement was that tea factories could apply for loans only when the quantity of raw tea purchased reached 300 dan for green tea and 100 dan for black tea. It has now been learned that the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks has revised this provision to allow applications when the quantity of raw tea purchased reaches 100 dan for either green or black tea.

### Demand for Dried Green Tea is Strong

Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, export firms in Shanghai tried to suppress prices due to tight prices from abroad, while sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to rising costs. As a result, both sides returned to a stalemate, with very few transactions and a superficial process. Sales of domestic tea were still continuous, and prices remained in a state of buyer-seller negotiation. However, last year's Anhui-produced dried green tea, of which there was little stock, was highly sought after, and the market was active.

### Production Loan Statistics: Two-Thirds Have Been Recovered

[Report from this newspaper] According to statistics released by the Production Loan Inspection Team of the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, a total of 330 applications were received from factories for production loans, with a total loan amount of 65,718,000,000 yuan. Among them, the cotton dyeing and weaving industry accounted for the largest share, with 128 applications and a loan amount of 31.002 billion yuan. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry was next, with 50 applications and a loan amount of 8.437 billion yuan. The machinery and hardware industry was third, with 36 applications and a loan amount of 4.575 billion yuan. As for the loan amount range, the most common was 100 million to 180 million yuan, with 98 companies. This was followed by 500 billion to 950 billion yuan, with 79 companies. There was one high-value loan of 1.6 billion yuan and another of 1.5 billion yuan. Two-thirds of the total loan amount has now been recovered, and the remaining one-third has been approved for extension.

### Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Requests Removal of Controls on Yarn and Cloth Shipments to Hankou

[Report from this newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, in order to appeal for the removal of controls on shipments of yarn and cloth to Hankou, sent a letter to the Cotton Control Committee yesterday, stating that the difficulties faced by manufacturers in transporting yarn and cloth had been repeatedly raised and requested for the lifting of the restrictions. Currently, the sales of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai are sluggish, with signs of saturation, while there is strong demand and a sense of shortage in South China and North China. The imbalance between supply and demand has had a significant impact. All factories in the industry are facing the threat of suffocation and closure. However, it has been reported that simplified procedures for applying for the shipment of yarn and cloth to Hankou have recently been promulgated, without prior discussion at the general meeting, which is deeply alarming. The 20th board meeting of the association discussed this and concluded that Hankou is the center of transit in Central China, and inland ports such as Yichang, Chongqing, and Chengdu all rely on Hankou as a centralized distribution station. Further restrictions would be tantamount to strangling the throat of Shanghai and other ports. The application procedures are unacceptable and should be immediately revoked. At the same time, it is hoped that the prohibitions on shipments of yarn and cloth to South China, Hebei, and the Northeast will be lifted as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.

### Yarn Prices Decline

Yesterday, yarn prices declined because money supply was tight, cloth prices were stable, dyeing and weaving factories stopped buying yarn after making a few purchases, and buying interest from customers was weak. The market also had an abundant supply of goods, leading to a fall in bid prices. The last price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.35 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 7.05 million yuan, down 250,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 6.8 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan. The prices of other brands of 16-count yarn also fell across the board.

### Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

In the cotton cloth market, the price of dark-colored 190 Tulin cloth increased because the price of grey cloth rose, and the cost of cloth produced by private factories increased due to the continuous rise in grain prices. As a result, the Tulin cloth market was very active at the opening. The last price of 190 Zhijiang Tulin cloth reached 550,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Brands such as Chick, Longevity, and Unity also rose by around 20,000 yuan. Yuanfu silk was in short supply, and 42-count Longevity silk was priced as high as 365,000 yuan, an increase of 35,000 yuan. The new shipment of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth sold quickly at a price of 301,600 yuan, down 2,000 yuan. The prices of Five Blessings, Blue Chick, and Color Ball brands also fell by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan. The prices of other fine twills, drills, and Yuan cloth all declined by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.

The China Textile Construction Company sold over 30 types of cloth yesterday. One type, Five Blessings fine cloth, was priced at 260,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. The Blue Chick and Special Silver Moon Flower and Bird fine cloth, 60-yard Valencia, were limited to dye factories only.

### Mixed Performance of Cigarettes

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with brisk purchases from industry players, and prices continued to rise. Among them, cigarettes from the Yizhong Company saw a larger price increase, and Chinese cigarettes also showed slight firmness. In the market, British American Tobacco (BAT) cigarettes opened at 7.55 million yuan. Due to limited selling and active buying, the price hovered high at 650,000 yuan at midday. In the afternoon, the market momentum weakened due to the China Tobacco Company processing shipments and tightening credit. In addition, long positions were unwound, causing prices to fall back. As a result, the price of 10-pack BAT cigarettes was 7.25 million yuan at the close, down 280,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes were 6.9 million yuan, with several boxes traded. Changhou cigarettes also fell back by 60,000 yuan to 6.8 million yuan. The prices of other Chinese cigarettes showed mixed performance.

[Further Report] The China Tobacco Company began processing shipments yesterday, with two boxes each of Armor and Axe brands priced at 15 million yuan for Full Armor cards. Half as much was allocated for B cards, and half each of Double Axe and Jinlu cigarettes were allocated for C cards, priced at 3.75 million yuan.

Furthermore, the Yuanli Tobacco Store on Guangdong Road purchased a box of Keleek cigarettes, totaling 200 cans, priced at 56,500 yuan per can.

### Actual Sales Clients Absorb; Rayon Starts Weak, Ends Strong; Factory Silk Prices Drop, Very Few Transactions

Yesterday, the rayon market started weak but ended strong. 120-count Kaoshan Glossy rayon opened at 16.5 million yuan. Due to absorption by actual sales clients, it rose again, quickly reaching 800,000 yuan. At the midday close, it reached 7 million yuan. In the afternoon, the bid price fell back by 100,000 yuan, finally closing at the same price as the previous day. New shipments of 120-count Peacock Globe rayon were priced at 6.6 million yuan. 75-count Semi-Gloss rayon prices remained stable without change.

There were virtually no transactions in factory silk. Although the bid prices showed some weakness yesterday, there were very few deals. C-grade silk was still traded in the market yesterday, with prices the same as the previous day. 5-day forward tickets were 20.09 million yuan. There were no transactions for other grades.

Because the raw materials for silk fabrics were stable and actual sales were sluggish, the factory quotations remained mostly unchanged. In the market yesterday, the bid price for silk quilt covers was slightly lower by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dasheng plaid crepe opened at 31,200 yuan in the morning, with a minimum of 1,000 yuan. Later, due to demand exceeding supply, it rose again to 1,500 yuan and was sold.

[Further Report] The Silk Weaving Industry Association of the Fourth District is preparing to set up a market at its new location on Taiwan Road in order to improve the technology of its member factories and plan for the production and sale of products. The 7th meeting of directors and supervisors appointed 25 people, including Cai Xintao, Tong Xinbo, Song Baolin, and Shen Boming, as preparation members and scheduled the first preparation meeting for 3 PM today to discuss the progress.

### Daily Necessities Prices Stable

Yesterday, the initial trading of daily necessities and soaps was smooth, but the willingness to supply at high prices was unabated, and prices were stable with a slightly soft tone. 120-piece Huang Xiangmao soap rose from 263,000-264,000 yuan to 267,000-268,000 yuan. At midday close, there were many transactions at 266,000-267,000 yuan. In the afternoon, supply and demand were flat, and prices fell slightly. The initial price was 265,000 yuan, and the final price was 260,000 yuan. There were few increases or decreases in matches and candles. It was heard that the supply of kerosene was plentiful, and the inventory was not small, so the market was stable. High-quality barrel-packed needles were priced at 630,000-640,000 yuan, canned needles at 87,000-88,000 yuan, and Asia at 83,000-84,000 yuan.

[Further Report] Yesterday, Wanli Store in the South City sold 50 boxes of new Huang Xiangmao soap from South China Commercial Company for a price of 261,000 yuan.

### Bituminous Coal Slightly Active

The bituminous coal market saw slightly active trading as actual sales clients absorbed at lower prices. The market for white coal remained firm, but demand was slightly weaker. Due to the large number of buyers in the production areas, coke prices were reported to have increased, but the purchased coke could not be transported to Shanghai temporarily due to transportation difficulties. As a result, Shanghai owners used the excuse of higher production area prices to raise prices.

### Hardware Market Conditions

The prices and sales of various hardware products this week are all on a safe path. Only the selling price of wire nails remains unchanged, while the price of iron wire is still doubled, due to increased labor costs.

### China National Tea Corporation Actively Promotes Tea in Taiwan

[Report from this newspaper] Yan Jingwei, General Manager of the China National Tea Corporation, told reporters yesterday that the company's business is mainly to concentrate the strength of Chinese tea merchants to promote tea abroad in a unified manner. The business center is currently focused on Taiwan. Branch companies in Zhejiang and Anhui will be established in Hangzhou and Tunxi, respectively. The Taiwan branch and crude and refined tea factories have been opened for three months, and business is being actively promoted. He said that in order to handle the remaining tea from the 35th year, the government has now established a quality assessment committee composed of the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the China National Tea Corporation, and the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association. The committee has hired three Chinese tea masters and two foreign tea masters. The work steps are to first assess the prices of various grades of tea and then purchase them. The estimated purchase amount for the remaining tea from the previous year is US$5 million, but after evaluation, it is estimated that US$1.6 million can be purchased. The government will now negotiate a purchase price to give tea merchants a reasonable profit so that the remaining tea can be exported. As for the purchase plan for the 36th year, it was originally set at US$25 million. However, as the Qihong tea purchase period has passed, it is estimated that only about US$15 million worth of Tunlv and Pinglv tea can be purchased. The tea loan program for this year was discussed by the relevant agencies today (20th). Representatives said that although the China Farmers Bank is planning to provide tea loans, no tea merchants have applied for the loans, so the loan methods need to be improved. Generally, the loan-for-production method will be adopted. It is planned that tea loans will account for approximately 100 billion yuan in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and approximately 100 billion yuan in Hubei and Hunan and Fujian. It is heard that the guarantee methods for tea merchants will be guaranteed by the Fuzhou Tea Export Association in Fujian, the Hankou Tea Export Association in Hubei and Hunan, and the Shanghai Tea Export Association in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. He said that the tea loan plan will continue to be discussed today.

### News of US Dollar Bond Subscription and Sale

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that of the US$10 million in US dollar bonds subscribed to by the Bank of China, in addition to the US$7.5 million that has already been paid, the remaining US$2.5 million will be transferred in Shanghai today, with Tianjin paying US$1.27 million, Chongqing paying US$980,000, and Xiamen paying US$220,000.

### Sixth District Paper Industry Requests Relaxation of Wood Pulp Import Quota; Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Plans to Discuss Supply Issues

[Report from this newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office plans to invite representatives from paper mills and newspapers this week to convene a meeting on the supply of newspapers and other related issues. On the 17th of this month, the Sixth District Paper Industry Association sent a letter to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, putting forward five minimum requirements for the quota of wood pulp in the US$4.5 million allocated for the second phase of paper and wood pulp imports:

(1) In the first phase quota of US$3.45 million, wood pulp accounted for US$450,000, only one-tenth of the actual demand. The excess US$1.05 million from this quota should be fully allocated to wood pulp.

(2) All paper mills are willing to sacrifice their capital to produce 600 tons of newsprint per month in exchange for the foreign exchange quota that newspapers should receive. It is found that the first phase import quota for newspapers is US$850,000. Based on the current international price, 3,080 English tons of newsprint can be ordered. Therefore, producing 600 tons of newsprint can earn US$165,600 in foreign exchange. In addition, the import duties and freight should be paid by the newspapers to the settlement bank of the wood pulp set by the factories.

(3) In the first phase wood pulp allocation, the National Resources Commission (NRC)-affiliated paper mills took away a total of US$100,000, resulting in limited gains for the factories in the Sixth District. If the NRC-affiliated factories and other paper mills in other regions cannot undertake the production, the second phase cannot obtain it as usual.

(4) Some factories in the Sixth District are outside the power supply range of the Shanghai Power Company and need to have power outages for four hours a day and one or two days a week, resulting in significant losses. It is proposed that the Guidance Office negotiate with the Shanghai Power Company to provide more electricity to other power plants during power outage times so that the factories can shorten the downtime caused by power outages and increase production.

(5) In order to maintain a monthly production of 600 tons, it is necessary to allocate US$1.5 million in foreign exchange for wood pulp and US$486,800 in foreign exchange for newspaper exchange for three months so that each factory can order more than 7,000 tons of wood pulp in the months of May, June, and July. If the above foreign exchange cannot be obtained, the amount of newspapers supplied each month will be subject to further negotiation.

### Mo Te-hui Visits Zhang Xueliang: Post-Visit Conversation at Grass Mountain Guesthouse

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taipei, 19th (Airmail)

The news of Zhang Xueliang's arrival in Taiwan was first revealed by this newspaper in Shanghai last November 2nd. However, reporters have repeatedly inquired about his life in Taiwan, but only received fragmented information; even that fragmented information was not allowed to be disclosed.

In the past six months, only Chen Yi, Yang Sen, and Mo Te-hui have been able to visit him. Mr. Mo made a special trip to Taiwan to see Mr. Zhang and stayed in Hsinchu for a week before returning to the provincial capital yesterday. After being hosted at a banquet by Chairman Wei, he temporarily resided at the Grass Mountain Guesthouse. The reporter braved the rain and drove there for a lengthy conversation lasting an hour and a half. His travel-worn mood had clearly replaced the joy of meeting. Zhang Xueliang (center), enjoying himself playing tennis, with Mo Te-hui (right), Miss Zhao Si, and Commissioner Liu. The lower corner features Zhang's inscription, signed Yi'an, May 16th, of the 6th year.

"Hanqing (another alias is Yi'an) is staying at Inoue Hot Spring, which is still a three-hour car ride from Hsinchu," said Commissioner Mo. "Inoue Hot Spring is now called Qingquan Township. The car route is winding and rugged, perhaps nearly a thousand feet above sea level. It's just like Grass Mountain, nestled in the mountains, with a view of the Pacific Ocean. The sea is quite windy, and the climate is similar to Taipei." In his conversation, the reporter gained a better understanding of the environment of Inoue Hot Spring. It was originally an area inhabited by aborigines (referred to by the Japanese as mountain tribes). There is an aboriginal elementary school with fifty or sixty students, taught by an aboriginal youth and a Hakka youth teacher. The students can already speak Mandarin and sing party songs. In this mountain village, there is only a police sanatorium, a Japanese-style wooden bungalow with tatami mats and glass windows, very clean, but without luxurious amenities like velvet carpets. That is where Hanqing resides. It is a remote and isolated village without any venues or shops. The closest places are Shangping, ten miles away, or Zhudong, twenty miles away, which is an industrial area and an export point for timber from the Lucang Mountains. Along the way, one can see wooden horses carrying timber, transported out of the mountains by human labor.

Regulated Life: Reading, Playing Ball, Bathing

The reporter was most concerned about Mr. Zhang's life. Commissioner Mo said, "It's very regular, and he's not lonely!" He gets up at seven every morning, reads and writes in the morning, plays tennis in the afternoon, and takes a hot spring bath. The regulated life has clearly improved his health. "Who does he play ball with?"

"There's Miss Zhao, as well as Commissioner Liu, and the guards!" Regarding Miss Zhao Si, he added, "Miss Zhao Si's name is Yidi. She has beautiful handwriting, and she copies all of his reading notes. Her father was the director of the Jinpu Railway around the eleventh or twelfth year of the Republic, named Zhao something, I can't recall." The reporter recalled that on Mr. Zhang's first day in Taiwan last year, a director of the Governor-General's Office hosted a reception and inquired about railway matters, mentioning the third Miss he was pursuing, which made Mr. Zhang somewhat embarrassed at the time. It is not known exactly how old Miss Zhao Si is, but her child is already seventeen years old!

Yu Fengzhi, she should still be in the United States now. It is said that they have not corresponded for half a year. In addition to thanking Madam Chiang, Mr. Kong, and Mr. Song, the letters Mr. Zhang asked Commissioner Mo to carry also included Mr. Zhang's family letters. His elderly mother is still in Tianjin!

Studying the History of the Ming Dynasty, Eager to Teach

Mr. Zhang is currently studying the history of the Ming Dynasty, continuing his research from Guizhou. He has excerpted the historical records of the twelve emperors of the Ming Dynasty, and has gained many insights. He very much wants to have an opportunity to learn from the historians he admires. He firmly believes that scholars are the most enduring figures in history, and that scholarship can control people! He gave Commissioner Mo a book list to purchase, and these three are undoubtedly those he admires: Wang Chongwu's "Supplementary Evidence of the Deeds of Emperor Renzong and Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty," Rong Zhaozu's "History of Thought in the Ming Dynasty,"

Jian Bozan's "On the Development of Overseas Trade in the Ming Dynasty; On the Struggle of the Chinese People Against the Tartars; On the Struggle of the Second Government of the Southern Ming Dynasty; The History of the Ming Dynasty After the Fall of Liaoning; On the Eunuchs and Eunuch Politics of the Ming Dynasty."

At the same time, he is very interested in teaching in the mountain village. He hopes to enter the Academia Sinica. He is tired of military and political affairs, and has become indifferent to them. During this stage of moving from Guiyang to Taiwan, perhaps influenced by the Yangming School of thought, he has undergone an extreme ideological transformation. This transformation has shifted his beliefs and inclinations towards pure academic research. He hopes to appear as a scholar, abandoning his previous way of life.

Rumors Abound, Mr. Mo Hesitates to Answer

Speaking of Wang Yangming, Commissioner Mo recalled a couplet: "Three enemies reside in Siam, the ancient caves and deep mountains contain the ultimate joy;

Once awakened, literary arts and military strategies are complete." This is a couplet inside the Yangming Temple, without a signature. People say it was written by Mr. Zhang and is a portrayal of him, but he denies it.

Since 1936, after Mr. Zhang was court-martialed, he went from Xikou to Huangshan, Xiangxi, Jiangxi, Xiuwen in Guizhou, Xifeng in 1944, and then to Taiwan in 1946. During this time, Mo Te-hui was his only visitor. Old friends reminisced, and although there were no electric lights in the mountain village in Hsinchu, heartfelt conversations by candlelight relieved Mr. Zhang of much sorrow!

In the mountain village, life is not Japanese-style; they still sleep on beds. Mr. Zhang likes to wear velvet shirts and khaki trousers. There is not always chicken meat every day, but there is always chicken soup. Fortunately, he is not particular about food!

Because there are many rumors in Shanghai that Mr. Zhang will take up an important position in the Northeast, when the reporter inquired about this, Mr. Mo hesitated for a long time. He said, "How can I answer this? Freedom, or lack thereof, this question poses a difficult problem for an old man."

Taipei Incident: Bitterly Enduring Five Days with Sweet Potatoes

The Taipei February 28th Incident shook the entire province, but there was no disturbance in this corner. Three days later, they received confirmation of the unrest, the telephone was out of order, but the details were unclear. Later, the aboriginal police advised them not to go down the mountain, so they bitterly endured five days with sweet potatoes.

At that time, they feared an attack by rioters, using the cliffs as a stronghold. The police sanatorium was unable to resist. But they still had strength, and more importantly, the mountain compatriots who got along very well with them, so they had nothing to fear!

Commissioner Mo expressed his views on the February 28th Incident, but when the reporter wanted to ask about Mr. Zhang's views, he remained silent, saying, "His views are different!"

Commissioner Mo was immersed in memories, and his spirits were still very high. He believes he has gained something this time. He instructed the reporter to tell his friends in Beijing and Shanghai that he would take the Zhongxing wheel on the 23rd to return to Shanghai, because he had to attend the Senate! Before parting, he gave us very precious recent photos taken with Mr. Zhang, specially printed for the readers of this newspaper.

One part of the Fudian Iron Works Machine Shop (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu)

### Impression of the Fudian Iron Works: The Largest Factory in Fujian Province

— Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu, Fuzhou, 21st (Airmail)

Entering Fujian Province, it is not easy to see rows of chimneys or hear the roar of motors. This piece of land of 120,000 square kilometers is entirely a quiet agricultural society. If there is any industry, it is only decorated with handicraft workshops that boast "omnipotent hands." Machine factories, the so-called mother of industry, are as rare as phoenix feathers. Before and during the war, some factories in Fuzhou and Xiamen that met the factory regulations, such as the Mawei Shipyard, the Fuzhou Enterprise Company Iron Works, and the Xiamen Iron Works, have now all closed down. The remaining Fudian Iron Works can be considered the only one. Now, this fragile, only large factory has fallen into a situation where it can hardly be maintained. This should be something that deserves our attention!

In terms of scale, the Fudian Iron Works is indeed the largest factory in Fujian Province. All kinds of power machinery, engines, and agricultural processing machinery needed in Fujian Province are manufactured by the factory, so the factory has almost become the source of all mechanical power in Fujian Province. In order to understand its current situation, the reporter went to the factory site in Xinhang, Fuzhou, for a few hours of inspection.

The Minbei Jian'ou Bridge, built by the Fudian Iron Works, is 600 feet long.

The Golden Age Is Longed For

More than thirty years ago, the factory was originally a mechanical repair shop affiliated to the Fuzhou Electric Company. Later, it gradually purchased a large number of machine tools and many precision instruments from Germany and the United States, forming a rudimentary scale. It was not until 1934 that a factory was formally established, undertaking the production of various machinery ordered by various parties. In the spring of 1939, it moved inland to Nanping. During these years, due to the suspension of maritime transport and the inability to import foreign goods, and because many factories in the coastal provinces were destroyed by artillery fire, the factory became the largest iron factory with the most significant scale in the southeast, and was entrusted by agencies in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to manufacture steam engines, hydraulic machines, diesel engines, charcoal machines, machine tools, agricultural machinery, and bridge towers to meet wartime needs. The power machines and machine tools such as planers, drilling machines, and lathes needed by the Southeast Regional Ordnance Factories of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Administration were also supplied by the factory. At that time, its business was extremely prosperous and its reputation spread far and wide. People in the factory still enjoy recalling it today.

Hard Struggle, Unity of Upper and Lower Levels

According to factory director Liu Dongye, the historical process of the Fudian Factory is as arduous as the growth of the entire Chinese industry. After the factory was moved back to Fuzhou after the victory, its business conditions were far from what they used to be. Repairs were more common than manufacturing, reflecting the phenomenon of economic depression in the society. Coupled with the impact of soaring prices, working capital gradually decreased due to currency depreciation. Therefore, it was even more impossible to pre-produce various finished products for sale, and only relied on the income from sporadic repairs of machine parts to barely maintain it. According to factory director Liu, one of the most valuable assets of the factory is the technical staff with more than ten or even twenty or thirty years of experience. Because the workers' technology is skilled, their products can all meet the standards, which is praised by all parties. Because of the factory's shortage of funds, there have been cases of arrears of wages, but there has never been a strike or slowdown. Labor and management cooperate well, and the upper and lower levels are united. Everyone yearns for the day when "chimneys are like forests and whistles are like thunder." This spirit is truly commendable.

Plans to Manufacture Agricultural Tools in the Future

In today's increasingly severe economic crisis, industrialization still seems to be a long way off. Promoting rural mechanization and improving agricultural productivity are the most important tasks at present. Moreover, Fujian is a mountainous province. The streams in northern Fujian converge into the Minjiang River and flow down. The streams in the central and western regions converge into the Jiulong River and enter the sea. Every spring and summer, during the rainy season, the vast areas downstream suffer from floods. In the autumn, there is drought and water shortage, and agricultural products suffer greatly. In order to adapt to the needs of this situation, the factory plans to manufacture a large number of small power machines, mobile irrigation, pumping machines, Japanese-style deep plows, and all agricultural processing machinery such as rice mills, flour mills, oil presses, and tea makers starting this year to supply farmland irrigation and drainage and local product processing. The factory has requested the assistance of the Fujian Provincial Government to allocate funds from agricultural loans to be used by the factory to manufacture a large number of mobile irrigation machines and lend them to farmers through the Agricultural Production and Marketing Cooperatives in order to increase agricultural production and improve the current situation of Fujian's huge food imports.

In addition, the factory's engineers have recently boldly tried to manufacture an automatic power machine that does not require fuel based on advanced physical principles. If successful, it will be enough to shock the global scientific community.

The Fate of the Factory Depends on the 500 Million Loan

Since the factory has determined that its manufacturing business will focus on agricultural tools, the first major problem it faces is the source of production funds. In March of this year, it prepared a plan and requested a production loan of 500 million yuan from the Siliang Finance and Business Office through the Provincial Department of Construction as a condition for realizing the above plan. Whether or not it is approved is related to the future of the factory. The factory is purely a commercial joint-stock company and has no huge capital reserves. It only relies on business income to maintain itself, and the profit from manufacturing machinery is usually meager. Factory director Liu told the reporter very sadly: If the government cannot provide timely assistance in loans and sales, the factory will easily be destroyed in the storm. Once it closes down, not only will there be no decent factory in Fujian Province in the future, but also a large number of skilled technical staff will be scattered. It will not be easy to gather them again at that time, and it will be too late to provide relief. He painstakingly explained the factory's difficulties and future plans to the reporter. Mr. Liu taught at Peking University for many years, has the demeanor of a scholar, and is also a person with a strong sense of career. He relies on him to run around and maintain the current situation. On the way back, the reporter silently thought: The country is in great trouble, and many factories are no longer smoking. This fragile industrial cluster already feels that it cannot be maintained, but no matter how poor the country is, it should fully support an industry that can improve people's lives. Factories are our hope, our dawn!

### Silkworm Experiment Guarantee: Promotion and Development in Wuhu

— Xingxinghu Shi, Wuxing, 10th (Express News)

More than ten years ago, whenever someone came to the countryside of Wuxing in the spring, they would be surprised: everywhere was green, an endless expanse of green, and everywhere they could smell a vigorous and thriving atmosphere. This was the mulberry forest, the most important lifeline for the farmers in the water town.

During the war, the enemy and puppets and guerrilla remnants destroyed the lifeline of the farmers. In order to prevent the mulberry forest from sheltering our guerrillas, to use mulberry trees as firewood, and to destroy our rural resources, they constantly cut down mulberry trees, turning the dense mulberry forests into barren land. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, according to the results of a detailed survey, the number of mulberry trees in the rural areas of Wuxing decreased by more than 70%. Taking Linghu District alone, the loss of mulberry trees was no less than five million.

The Construction Association Improves Sericulture

Among the approximately 120,000 residents in the Linghu District of Wuxing, more than 85% rely on silk production to make a living. In the past, the development of the silk industry created the prosperity of Linghu. The local silk of the Golden Unicorn and Jade Unicorn brands made a glorious page in the history of export trade. However, now, the sharp decline in the silk industry has formed a widespread and profound poverty among the people of Linghu District. After the victory, the farmers knew that there was hope for the export of silk, and everyone wanted to raise more silkworms, but there was not enough mulberry leaves, silkworm eggs, silkworm-raising tools, or funds... They were still unable to increase production. At the same time, the backward methods of raising silkworms and the poor quality of local silk were two major obstacles.

The rural work of the Linghu Construction Association started with improving sericulture. In the past year or so, they have sent silkworm eggs, sent mulberry seedlings, set up communal breeding rooms, sent experts to the countryside to guide, bought up pests on mulberry trees, trained sericulture personnel, and provided loans, seeds, and firewood. This spring, more than 25,000 silkworm egg sheets were loaned out, dozens of communal breeding rooms were established, and more than 100 instructors were dispatched. However, due to the large area and large population of the entire district, the strength of the association was ultimately limited. Therefore, although the number of farmers who benefited was very large, the help they received was often not very great. This was because the strength was too dispersed.

Do Not Make Local Silk, Do Not Raise Summer Silkworms

After repeated discussions and research, the association decided on a method, which was to focus on the actual needs of the local area, select the key points of work, aim high and start small, start with demonstrations, and then gradually expand until it is popularized throughout the area. Initially, they planned to establish a "Sericulture Experiment Township" in Linghu District to promote sericulture improvement work. Later, they considered that the population of a township was quite large and it was difficult to reach a consensus, so they decided to change it to "Experiment Guarantee." In the first phase, they selected five townships from the fourteen townships in the entire district, and selected five guarantees from the five townships. As long as the silkworm farmers in these five guarantees can earnestly achieve the two conditions of "Do Not Make Local Silk, Do Not Raise Summer Silkworms," they can enjoy many benefits, such as priority replanting of mulberry seedlings, setting up demonstration mulberry fields, providing mulberry land fertilizer loans, ordering excellent silkworms on their behalf, donating autumn silkworm breeds, and sending personnel to guide them. All the silkworm farmers in the guarantee will jointly promote spring silkworms and raise them together, baking cocoons on their behalf without compensation, introducing them to practice at the breeding farm, participating in sericulture personnel training classes, and giving priority to introducing them to practice at the silk factory. At the same time, in order to encourage farmers not to make local silk, thereby developing the silk reeling industry and striving for export trade, it is further stipulated that when silkworm farmers sell cocoons, in addition to giving all the compensation, a "Cocoon Sale Reward Certificate" will also be issued, stating the quantity and quality of cocoons sold, and it is scheduled to be presented to the association on the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month of last year to receive the bonus. This method is also applicable to silkworm farmers outside the experimental guarantee. In addition, in order to facilitate farmers to store dry cocoons, a warehouse was opened in the Green Tree Dangli of Linghu to store them on their behalf for mortgage.

In addition to enjoying the above-mentioned benefits in terms of spring mulberry, the association will also provide farmers in the experimental guarantee with free elementary schools, one school per guarantee, thoroughly repair all the bad embankments, send mobile medical teams to diagnose diseases and provide health care, and repair bridges, pave roads, and provide relief to orphans, the elderly, and the poor.

Mr. Zhang Goes to the Countryside to Inspect and Lecture

After the principle was decided, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, Vice Chairman of the Association, took time out of his busy schedule to bring this abundant gift to Linghu and personally went to the countryside to visit and inspect. From May 4th to 8th, in the five days in between, braving the heavy rain, he walked through the muddy fields and went deep into every corner of the countryside. He visited the fourteen townships in the Linghu District. His companions included Wang Xi, Director of the Association Office, Wu Huaiqing, Director, Tan Yunlai, Ni Baiyan, representative of the Green Tree Foundation, Zhang Yuexian, Director of Silkworm Guidance, and more than a dozen other association staff. Mr. Zhang convened meetings of Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs in each township, distributed small booklets to silkworm farmers, and held meetings sometimes in temples, sometimes in township offices, and sometimes in squares. The number of people attending the meeting often reached two or three thousand, and almost every family sent someone to participate. The elderly came with canes, and babies hid in their mothers' arms, all to participate in this unprecedented grand meeting. Mr. Zhang used his earnest local dialect to give popular and practical lectures, and the farmers benefited a lot.

Silkworm Eggs Develop Well

According to the silkworm guide, the silkworm eggs issued by the association this time are developing very well. Among them, the results of the Sun and Moon brand have achieved 100% success. Judging from the current situation, as long as there are no accidents during the large silkworm period, the silkworm farmers in the entire district may increase their income by more than 10 billion yuan.

Under the spiritual inspiration of Mr. Zhang, the number of guarantees applying to the association for registration to join the experimental guarantee reached as many as 64, exceeding the predetermined number by more than twelve times. In order to avoid disappointing those who registered and affecting their enthusiasm, and in order to accelerate the completion of the silkworm reform work, Mr. Zhang wanted to accept all comers and list all these 60 or so guarantees as experimental guarantees. Although this method is good, in fact, even if the financial and human resources can be arranged, there are still many difficult problems in terms of material resources alone, especially the difficulty of baking cocoons on their behalf is even more difficult to overcome. Therefore, after repeated discussions, it was decided to adopt the principle of "one guarantee per township." The number of experimental guarantees in the first phase increased from five to eleven, and another twenty reserve guarantees were established. After the first experimental guarantee representative conference was held on the 11th of this month, various tasks began immediately.

The Experimental Plan Will Be Completed in Three Years

This is a brand-new experiment, and also an unprecedented creation. The future work will inevitably be very prosperous and arduous.

According to experts' estimates, this experimental guarantee plan may be completed within three years. After the completion of this plan, 17 silk reeling factories may be opened in the entire Linghu District, requiring more than 20,000 male and female workers, with an annual output of 15,000 to 20,000 bales of factory silk, which may be exchanged for more than 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange. In this way, not only can the goal of agricultural industrialization in the Linghu District be fully achieved, but also the contribution of this silk production to the entire national economy is immeasurable.

### Yellow River Dyke Repair Will Be a Miracle

— Zhengzhou, 10th (Dispatch from Air) — Our Correspondent Fan Shidong

There are two major tasks that must be done after the blocking of the breach at Huayuankou on the Yellow River is completed: one is the reconstruction of the Yellow River flooded area, and the other is the restoration of the dikes downstream. This article discusses the downstream dike restoration, so the first point will not be addressed. Originally, the downstream dike restoration should have been coordinated with the breach blocking, but the breach blocking could not wait, so it was completed first. Fortunately, it is not the Yellow River's flood season, so the delay in dike restoration has not been a major issue; however, this can only be delayed once, and not again, otherwise, there will be a risk of a new Huayuankou and a new Yellow River flooded area when the flood season arrives.

The Yellow River is eight thousand li long in total. The upstream banks are surrounded by continuous mountains, which serve as natural river defenses. The downstream southern bank starts from the side of the Yellow River Iron Bridge, and the northern bank starts from Meng County. Except for a very small number of areas with mountains to rely on, the river depends on a 1,200-kilometer-long dike to contain the Yellow River water until it reaches the sea. From the fifth year of Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing Dynasty onwards, there have been over a hundred breaches, all within this downstream dike area. These facts, based on the history of the past ninety-two years, should not be false.

The river dikes near Jinan, spanning over a hundred kilometers, are already seventy to eighty percent completed. The southern dike from east of Heze to north of Jining, about one hundred kilometers, and the embankment south of the dike, about eighty-five kilometers, have been recovered by the National Army and can also be started for repair. The restoration of the other southern bank areas within Shandong province, which are under the control of the National Army, is even less of a problem. The Shandong Repair and Defense Office has decided to repair the three hundred-plus kilometers of the southern bank dike from May 5th to June 15th, and at the same time, correct the dike surface and slope protection. Then, from June 15th to July 15th, the dangerous sections will be completely reinforced. This project will mobilize one million laborers and complete two million cubic meters of earthwork.

Speaking of the northern bank, most of it is in the hands of the Communist Army. Over six hundred kilometers within Shandong province are within the Communist Army's sphere of influence. Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources Xue Dubi came to participate in the Huayuankou closure ceremony. When the reporter asked him about the dike repair situation by the Communist Army on the northern bank, he replied: Joint Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) consultants Todd and Van Meighem recently visited there once, and the Communist Army said that they mobilized 300,000 laborers and repaired the northern bank dike in three weeks.

If that is the case, this is truly a miracle: The government is repairing the southern dike, and the Communist Army is repairing the northern bank. Then the Yellow River will definitely behave itself and never dare to cause trouble again. If this miracle expands and grows, what can the country fear about weakness? What can the people fear about poverty?

If it is like what the Director of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office, Kong Lingrong, said: "Within the eighty kilometers from Juye to Dongping, it is still a chaotic area, and the Communist Army frequently appears, disrupting construction; even in some areas, because the river surface is only a hundred meters wide, the Communist Army's bullets often fly onto the heads of the laborers on the southern bank dike." Also, as the Director of the Henan Repair and Defense Office, Su Guanjun, and the Director of the Hebei Repair and Defense Office, Qi Shouan, said, the sixty to seventy kilometers of river dikes on the northern banks of those two provinces are having problems with even connecting pipes due to the war, not to mention repairs. Then, regarding the restoration of the river dikes, what miracle can we hope for, other than the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) deceiving the government for a sum of repair funds? (The government has allocated 4 billion to the CCP for dike repairs.) The matter cannot be viewed solely from a pessimistic perspective. The Communist Army may be doing something to repair the dikes on the northern bank, because this is also beneficial to the Communist Army. A miracle may appear in this gap. However, under today's military actions, the Communist Army, instead of restoring the dikes with the mindset of "benefiting me, benefiting the enemy," may have the mindset of "harming me, harming the enemy" and dig the dikes. This will produce another kind of miracle. Let's hold off on this conclusion and let the upcoming Yellow River flood season draw the conclusion!

### Authors of Qing Dynasty Humorous Prose Collections

— Zizhen

During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty, many humorous prose collections were produced, such as "Articles as Games," "What Absurdity," and "Everyone's Happy." A certain Mr. X's "Gua Dou Ji," published before the war, once introduced the article "As the Saying Goes." Regarding the author of "What Absurdity," he cited the fourth volume of "Everyone's Happy," "Yunhe Xuan Notes" (part 2), which said:

"Zhou Zhujun wrote 'A Debate between Man and Turtle'." And the second volume, "Yunhe Xuan Miscellaneous Works" (part 2), said:

" 'What Absurdity' was written by my friend, Mr. Zhou." Comparing these two quotes with the original book of "What Absurdity," he believed it was written by Zhou Zhujun. He said:

"It can be known that the author of this book is Zhou Zhujun. Although there is nothing else to investigate, most of this type of book has very humorous pseudonyms. Now that we can know his name, it is already rare." What he believed was "nothing to investigate" was just that he didn't investigate, not that there was nothing to investigate. As far as I know, regarding the author's deeds of "What Absurdity," in addition to the above, there is also a little more that can be investigated.

In "Ji Wo Can Gao" (sixteen volumes, preface by Kui Yu Daoren Wang Kun of Suzhou during the Tongzhi period. Dated Renchen Year of Tongzhi) written by Wang Kun of Suzhou during the Tongzhi period, the "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays" section of the first volume said:

"Zhou Zongtai of Suzhou compiled a novel using local dialects and colloquialisms, but the printing blocks have long been destroyed. I still remember his article 'Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays,' and I feel that the events of that year are vividly before my eyes." Upon checking "Even More What Absurdity," there is an article "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays," which is what Wang Kun was referring to. Also, the "local dialects and colloquialisms" he mentioned refers to the "Colloquial Couplets" and other articles in the third volume of "Even More What Absurdity." From this, it can be known that the author of "Even More What Absurdity" is Mr. Zhou. According to the original book's preface:

"My son made mistake after mistake, wasting ink and repeatedly continuing and publishing, even more meaningless... I wasted ink and repeatedly continued this compilation... then continue your 'Even More What Absurdity'." This further proves that "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity" came from the same person, and the author is Zhou. Then, Zhou Zongtai is also Zhou Zhujun. However, Wang Kun only said Zhou Zongtai, and "Yunhe Xuan Notes" only said Zhou Zhujun. Although based on the titles of the cited articles and comparison with the original book, Zongtai and Zhujun must be the same person, the evidence is not solid. There must be other evidence to convince people.

In the twelve-volume "Qing Jia Lu," written by Gu Lu during the Daoguang period, describing the customs and traditions of Suzhou, he often quoted poems praising Wu customs and local conditions, most commonly the two types: Cai Yun's "One Hundred Exquisites of Wu Yu" and Zhou Zongtai's "Gusu Bamboo Branch Songs." The book quoted six "Gusu Bamboo Branch Songs":

"Ancestor Worship" (see volume 1, "Visiting Graves"), "Amitabha Rice" (see volume 4), "Jumping Stove God," "Jumping Zhong Kui," "Hanging Ingots," "New Year's Eve Dinner" (all see volume 12). According to the fourth volume of "What Absurdity," there are forty poems entitled "Gusu Four Seasons Bamboo Branch Songs." These six are among them, but the wording is slightly different. This further proves that "What Absurdity" was written by Zhou Zongtai. "Qing Jia Lu" clearly states Zhou Zongtai. Zongtai should be Zhou's given name, and Zhujun is his courtesy name or alias. Based on the dates recorded in the first and second collections of "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity" and his own narratives, Zhou's life can also be roughly known. The earliest date recorded in the book is the fourteenth or fifteenth year of Qianlong (1749-50). The "Jiang Xue Qi Chronicle" in the first collection said:

"In the second month of the year of Ji Si [1749], my father repaired its abandoned place... In the spring of the year of Geng Wu [1750], he discussed it with the stonemasons." It also said:

These are all memories of childhood. There are also the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of the fifty-fourth year of Qianlong (1789, see "Exam"), the fifty-fifth year (1790, see "A Trip to the Upper Fang Mountain"), and the third year of Jiaqing (1798, see "Yin Yang Scholar"), but there is nothing that can be used to investigate his life. The latest is February of the fourth year of Jiaqing (1799) ("West Mountain Plum Blossom Viewing"), which is a few months before writing the preface.

Among them, only the "Exam" in the first collection involves his life. He said:

"In the second month of the year of Ji You, I went with my brother to take the children's exam."

Checking the year of Ji You, it is the fifty-fourth year of Qianlong (1789). This time taking the children's exam was probably an unsuccessful attempt. According to Qian Guoxiang's "Register of Scholars from the Three Counties" (nine volumes, published during the Guangxu period), in the fifty-sixth year of Qianlong, Xin Hai (1791), Supervising Instructor Hu ranked thirteenth in the county test of Wu County, and this was Zhou Zongtai. It can be known that he did indeed enter school. Also, judging from the tone of the two articles, "List of Successful Candidates in the Provincial Examination" in the first collection and "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays" in the second collection, he also took the provincial examination. However, checking Lu Maoxiu's "Register of Successful Candidates from Changyuan, Wu, and San Counties" (four volumes, published during the Guangxu period) and the lists of successful candidates in the Wu County Gazetteer by Mang Yunyuan, there is no name of Zhou, so he probably tried but was not successful, and died as a scholar. In the third volume of "Everyone's Happy," published in the first year of Daoguang, there is a record: "Mr. Zhou has passed away. His family, fearing that his verbal excesses would lead to punishment in the underworld, destroyed the printing blocks." Then Zhou's death must have been during the Jiaqing period. After his death, the printing blocks were also destroyed. His experiences can be said to be unfortunate! However, this kind of impoverished scholar, whose name is usually unknown outside his village, is instead passed down after his death through the "idle books" of humorous writing. This can also be said to be a great fortune within misfortune.

In the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang (1844), Zhejiang gentry Zhang Jian presented a request to destroy obscene books and published a "Record of Exhorting to Destroy Obscene Books," listing 120 book titles to be destroyed, including "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity." In the seventh year of Tongzhi (1868), Jiangsu Governor Ding Richang banned a list of obscene lyrics and novels (see "Jiangsu Provincial Regulations" of Tongzhi), with these two books also included in the first batch of 120. However, the books listed for destruction were mostly determined based on the book titles, regardless of the content. The inclusion of these two was probably due to the humorous and strange book titles. Judging from the content, although there are a few impure words in the first and second collections of this book, it is by no means in the same league as obscene novels. Moreover, there are a few articles that are quite literary in style. Treating humorous prose collections as novels is already unreasonable. Considering them obscene books is even more baffling!

In the second collection, there is a "Preface to the Continued Pipa Record," which says: "My friend Mr. Gao Boyang... showed me his 'Continued Pipa Record'." According to Yao Xie's "Textual Research on Contemporary Music," Gao Zongyuan's "Continued Pipa Record," "Newly Added Western Chamber," and "Revised Wang Zan" are recorded as three kinds of operas. It also says: "Zongyuan's courtesy name is Boyang, a native of Shanyin, also known as Qiu Lun Jushi." "Continued Pipa Record" is also seen in Liang Tingnan's "Teng Hua Qu Hua," volume 4, which says: "Wu Gu Ren (Xi Qi) wrote a preface for it." Only the Peking University Library possessed a copy of this legend before the war. No other copies were seen. It is also quite pleasing that the original preface is preserved in this book.

As for the "Bathhouse Record" praised in "Yunhe Xuan Miscellaneous Works," it can be found in the first volume of "What Absurdity." The article reads:

"A large stone is made into a pool, and a dome is made of bricks. A large cauldron is dug, connected to the pool. A winch draws water, and it is stored in a hole in the wall. Firewood is burned, and it soon becomes boiling water. Men who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, [and those with...] pay money to the owner and can all enter to bathe. From dawn to dusk, they come in droves, in countless numbers. If you kick it, you can scoop up mud and grime. The stench and filth are unbearable to be near. Scholars occasionally step into it as well. Do they not know it is dirty? Are they misled by its name? Are they accustomed to the custom and do not find it strange? Or are those who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, [and those with...] not harming each other? Or are their eyes unable to see, their noses unable to smell, and their hearts accustomed to confusion and do not know the smell? If the firewood is removed and the cauldron filled with the water from the ditches, how would it be different? Who would flock to it—flocking to its heat. Alas! What they call a 'bathhouse,' I see that it is only a mixture."

The article is indeed vivid and delightful, but it is not Zhou Zongtai's work, but rather a collection of writings from the Ming Dynasty. According to Lang Ying's "Seven Repairs and Classifications," volume 16, "Meaningful Categories," "Bathhouse":

"Bathhouses exist everywhere in the world, but Hangzhou's are the worst. Some well-meaning people have used it as a metaphor for a record, which quite captures the meaning of [moral instruction]. It is recorded to inform those who do not know shame. The record says:

"The custom of Wu: a large stone is made into a pool. A dome is made of bricks. Behind it is a giant cauldron, connected to the pool. A winch draws water and is stored in a hole in the wall. One person specializes in holding a [stirring instrument]. The pool water swallows each other, and it soon becomes boiling water. It is called a bathhouse, and the sign at the door says 'Fragrant Water.' Men who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, pay one coin to the owner, and they can all enter to bathe. From dawn to dusk, those who are naked and without clothes come in countless numbers. If you kick it, you can scoop up mud and grime. The stench of the body is unbearable. Scholars also bathe in it. Do they not know it is dirty? Are they misled by its name? Are they accustomed to the custom and do not find it strange? Or are those who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with old sores, those with skin diseases, not harming each other? Or are the eyes of those who bathe in it unable to see, and their noses unable to smell? Alas! They flock to its heat. If the firewood is removed and the cauldron filled, how is it different from the water in the ditches? Who would flock to it?" (There are quite a few differences between the text and Zhou's article.)

Comparing the two, the traces of recording are obvious. There are not many places that have been changed. It can be known that the two collections of "What Absurdity" are not entirely the work of Zhou Min, but also include some old articles.

### Celebrating Fifty Years with Classmates at a Public Banquet - Third Month of Hai Year

— Geng Danru

Only at fifty do I realize the errors of forty-nine, The affairs of a hundred years seem like a fleeting dream; Having lived in seclusion for so long, I feel leisurely, Idly gazing at the clouds, too lazy to strive. Year after year, I plant my tongue in the inkstone field, Green trees grow into shade, flowers fill the branches; Don't say that old farmers have no joy, Smiling, I watch the various plants compete in beauty. The taste of sugarcane is just beginning to be enjoyed, The vicissitudes of life are constantly changing; I only hope that the clouds and sky will show clear colors, Don't mention that the sun is already near the horizon. The good time with wine already makes faces light up, Moreover, old friends come in flocks; Tonight, let us all be intoxicated with joy, Wishing you longevity and passing the cup to each other.

### Madonna

— Li Bi

Fra Filippo Lippi (1406-1469) was a great painter of 15th-century Italy. In his childhood, he was sent to the Carmelite monastery in Florence by his father because of poverty.

When Masaccio painted the frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel, he was working beside him doing sketches, and from then on he devoted himself to art and soon achieved great success. His style is very similar to Masaccio's and is generally called the soul of Masaccio. The cornerstone of Renaissance painting was also laid from this point on. Botticelli was one of his disciples, and Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were greatly influenced by him. (...)

### Spring Grass of Jiangnan

— Shi Bi

Spring in Jiangnan comes early and leaves late; in this late spring, the spring grass is even greener. "White clouds rest on tranquil shores, fragrant grass closes idle doors," here, the spring grass is just like that, leisurely and freely embellishing the vibrant spring of Jiangnan, and decorating people's tranquil spring dreams.

However, "once the prosperity scatters like fragrant dust, the flowing water is heartless, and the grass naturally springs," the affairs of the world and the spring scenery ultimately have a distance; dreams are ultimately illusions, and our spurs to human relationships and worldly affairs ultimately cannot be escaped. This morning, pushing open the window to see the lush green countryside, the grass is already growing and submerging the path, which gave rise to a strange feeling in my heart; seeing the spring about to leave, although I am not to the extent of "fragrant heart turns to spring's end, all that's gained is tear-soaked clothes," the wisp of inexplicable lament that gradually rises from the bottom of my heart still cannot be suppressed.

Over the years, I have spent the spring in different places every year; my footsteps have been erratic, and I have been poor and destitute, and I have hardly felt peace for a moment. The spring grass, which puts on new clothes every year, has already been covered with a dismal gray-white color in what I have seen. When I was a child, my expectations for spring were joy and an emotional with a leaping forward spirit. However, the feeling that spring now gives me has changed from a lively and leaping mood to a heavy oppression!

Last spring, by the Jialing River, I saw the spring grass growing on the fertile coffee-red soil of Sichuan, the luster of the verdant covering that showed the fullness and richness of spring. At that time, it was early spring, and I was calculating to rush to Jiangnan to see the alluring spring scenery of Jiangnan; I was full of expectations that leaving Bashan would allow me to come to Jiangnan very quietly. However, on the long road to repatriation, I relived the wandering suffering of fleeing from the southwest to Sichuan in the spring of 1945. Just as I arrived in Jiangnan in a dreamlike daze, the hardships of reality and the many more difficulties added to my life had already made me lose the leisure to appreciate the spring grass of Jiangnan.

Indeed, the spring grass of Jiangnan is originally particularly slender and soft, set against the azure and clear sky; the gentle breeze slowly comes, stirring up green waves with the wind, lightly and gracefully, containing endless elegance. However, it is a pity that they grow on such a difficult land; in the past, in the cruel war and the enemy's washing and robbing, I don't know how many times they have been stained with the bloody killings of the people; and now, even in the regions of rice and fish, there is desolation and famine everywhere, although the spring grass comes new and green every year, lush as ever, these spring grasses have long been abandoned by the people!

History is playing out in tragedy: famine, terror, and death are expanding. The goddess of spring is about to gather her tired wings, and in the lonely wilderness, the spring grass must be sobbing there, right?

I thought of Bai Juyi's famous line: "Luxuriant grass on the original, withered and flourishing every year, wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again." This explains the vitality of life that still exists in a chaotic world. There are many hardships in life, and what we seek is this tiny bit of stubbornness!

Music is the art of painting sounds; it is an art of time. They both contain sufficient emotional effects and can give the appreciator more aesthetic pleasure.

### Ozymandias of Egypt

— By Percy Bysshe Shelley, Translated by Zhen Qin

I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal, these words appear: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

(This sonnet is one of Shelley's masterpieces, first published in 1818. Ozymandias is said to have been the first warlike monarch of Egypt around 2100 BC, who invaded Asia. Fowler points out that the words carved on the pedestal in the poem are Egyptian hieroglyphs, the meaning of which was not understood by people in Shelley's time, and it was not until 1822 that Champollion discovered the mysteries of this writing. – Translator)

### A Record of the Cloud Retreat Studio

— Sun Fuxi

The name of Wang Yachen is known to women and children, and Wang Yachen's paintings are recognized by women and children. Why is Mr. Wang's painting so famous? Why is it so popular? This is the reason I want to introduce.

His paintings are the most popular among contemporary writers. All the subjects, all the methods, and all the forms and spirits are just right for the temperament and needs of the vast majority of Chinese people, and even the Japanese and Indians in the East, and the British and French and Americans in the West, are also fond of them at first sight. Although this result is not a very high achievement in art, it is a very valuable achievement. Especially in China today, when education is not widespread and politics is trying to focus on the masses, the popularization of art is even more valuable.

Speaking of the origin of this popularized art, I have to talk about the "Cloud Retreat Tower" where he lives.

The Cloud Retreat Studio is a lane house in the French Concession. Although the location is quite quiet, it is still a lane. There is a tall palm tree at the entrance, but the courtyard is too small to have any other flowers and plants. The interior walls are mostly bookshelves, and otherwise filled with ancient and modern calligraphy. Yachen studied in Japan, and also traveled with his wife to France and Italy. He loves ancient calligraphy and paintings, and also studies new methods. He values both the old and new and has no prejudice. He treats friends of all ages, high and low, from all walks of life, equally, without favoritism or attacking differences. This is the reason why he has become universal and popularized, and it is also the merit of his wife's assistance. Therefore, people in the literary and art circles regard the Cloud Retreat Studio as a meeting center.

There is a large painting table by the window. The paper, pens, inkstone, water pot, and pigments on the table are all neatly prepared. The water in the water pot is always clear, and a good inkstone produces a lot of ink after three turns. The pigment cups are never dry, and they are watered at any time, like watering flowers. He paints at the table every day. Anyone who can paint is persuaded to spread out the paper and wield the brush. Therefore, he is influenced by many people, and he also influences many others. Therefore, he paints everything, from flowers, birds, grass, and insects to landscapes and even figures of beautiful women. There is a bronze sculpture of a carp on the stove rack, and behind the table is a four-sided glass fish cage with goldfish, so he has more experience in painting fish. Other potted flowers and caged birds are also sometimes used as objects for sketching. Contemporary painters have all been to this Cloud Retreat Studio, and they have all wielded their brushes at the Cloud Retreat Studio, feeling inspired after drinking. This is a location worth commemorating - there is also one more thing: it was at the Cloud Retreat Studio that he purchased and collected about 200 valuable works by modern writers such as Baishi, Beihong, and Daqian.

In the Yachen Exhibition, after you have enjoyed it, read this article again. If you have not been to the Cloud Retreat Studio, it is even better to visit it. This record can greatly increase your appreciation.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 514

— Ye Jingfeng

That eccentric Miss, although she didn't understand Japanese, saw Tsurumi's somewhat distraught look after receiving the phone call, knew the content of the call wasn't good. She stopped asking him, "Are you Chinese or Japanese after all?" and raised another question:

"Excuse me, Mr. Gu, my brother said you are a hero who risks triple danger to serve the country, but I'm a little curious, how exactly do you exist in these triple dangers? I mean, what methods do you use to get people to let you operate?"

"Oh," Tsurumi's mind was in a mess from the news from the phone call, unable to grasp a single thread to sort it out. If the person who came was Li Ming, Shouyi, Zhengyan, or that Korean young patriot, he would be a suitable object to discuss these bad news with, perhaps he wouldn't be so helpless, but instead came this devil-like Miss, and she kept asking such strange questions one after another, impossible to answer clearly in a moment. Moreover, so far, Tsurumi still didn't know her surname or given name, whether her brother was indeed Shouyi of the Hundredfold Patience Manor, so even if he wanted to answer, he couldn't help but be a little wary.

"I'm afraid you don't understand my two questions?" This Miss was clearly a little unhappy, "But there's one more question, you must enlighten me, otherwise, I would have come for nothing...!"

"Miss," Tsurumi furrowed his brow, "I am willing to answer any questions you have, only I regret that you came at a bad time, and I happen to be encountering serious difficulties. Now I have received the most unfavorable news, and my mind is very confused. And the two questions you raised can't be explained clearly in a few words. Miss, if you are the younger sister of Brother Shouyi, he will surely be able to answer for me in the future, and it will be more powerful than my own answer..."

"That doesn't matter"; this "matter" must be part of this Miss's speech. "What I want to ask now, I'm afraid only you, sir, can answer—I want to ask you to describe—that Japanese Miss who came with you, what's her name, Pingzi, right? I want to know what she looks like, does she have any special marks on her face... Freckles? Scars? Ringworm around her eyes? Crooked mouth? Sunken nasal bridge?... For example, special marks that you can recognize and distinguish at first glance?"

"Oh: This... I can't explain it clearly either... Probably she looks very pretty, is a... oval face, phoenix eyes... cherry lips, right?... There's a small dimple on her left cheek when she smiles, right?... Straight nose, somewhat like a Westerner, but not so high and prominent..."

Tsurumi used almost all the Pekingese words he had learned over the years to describe facial features, and was running out of steam; he wanted to explain it more clearly, more definitively, but his vocabulary was insufficient, and he really couldn't describe what Pingzi looked like. He thought for a while, then suddenly remembered a characteristic: "When she starts speaking, she has a bit of a smile first; once touched, she will immediately be sad and tearful..."

This eccentric Miss came so abruptly and left so hastily. She listened to Tsurumi's last sentence, and didn't pursue it any further, suddenly got up from her seat, nodded slightly; before the words "Goodbye" were finished, she had already opened the door and left, and closed the door behind her.

Tsurumi just wanted to rush out the door to see her off, to play the gentleman to the end, but unfortunately another phone call came just then.

### Casual Talks While Alone

— Wang Cong

I have always loved the poems of the English Robert Burns. The year before last in Chongqing, I read a translated collection of poems by Mr. Yuan Shuipai, "My Heart is in the Highlands," in which more than half were Burns's small poems. The translation was excellent, especially the foreword.

He began by mentioning Chaplin. He said:

Chaplin especially likes to depict a tramp and a policeman who is two or three times bigger than him, and who has to bend over to talk to him. This small tramp, although he has been struggling in a world full of coldness and hostility for decades, still has not lost his innocent childlike heart. In one film, Chaplin wanted to reconcile with a man who hated him. He went up full of good intentions, wanting to strike up a conversation with this stern man, with a bouquet of flowers in his right hand, hidden behind his back, smiling and about to give it to the man, but immediately a big fist came over, and Chaplin fell to the ground, the bouquet of flowers not even seen, was crushed on the ground.

In this philistine Shanghai, there are many of this same type of deliberate act. If you have flowers to give, never hide them behind your back. This "progressive" society is like a marketplace, like a stock exchange, and there is no "human touch" or even "humor" to speak of. If you have no flowers to give, you might as well pretend to be giving flowers. Because in this day and age, the respect between people is mostly "deception".

Free Talk

### Premature Maturity of Children

— Xu Zhou

Besides the eye-catching news of human-demon cases, incest cases, and sodomy cases, there may naturally be such news:

"(×× News) The son of a resident of this city, Chen, 14 years old, took 120,000 yuan with him a month ago, and left home with several classmates to seek immortality. Fortunately, his father found out earlier and retrieved him. Unexpectedly, he ran away again yesterday, leaving a letter saying: 'Dissatisfied with the real world, so I leave home to become a disciple and seek immortality'..."

In a strange and changing society, children are also maturing early. A thirteen-year-old girl is already qualified to be raped, then a fourteen-year-old boy, unable to save the world and barely able to save himself, after seeing too many things like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple", will naturally have strange ideas about leaving home to seek immortality. Before and after the war, we have seen a lot of news about children seeking immortality, which is not surprising, but this time, "Chen's son" is explicitly leaving because he is "dissatisfied with reality", so it can't help but make people a little surprised.

There are many people who are dissatisfied with reality, some are silent, some pretend to be crazy, some say "Live for today, drink for today", some say "If I don't go to hell, who will?", and some think that the theater is a small world, the world is a big theater, put on a mask, why not run rampant? I rarely see an adult who is so serious about abandoning his family and running away, saying that he wants to seek immortality, to save the world. With more experience in the world, the idea of "seeking immortality" inevitably seems too naive, but at the same time, it also loses that bit of childlike heart. Being dissatisfied with reality is one thing, drifting with the tide of the world in reality is another. Mr. Lu Xun said: "The results of experience, whether good or bad, require a great sacrifice. Even small things inevitably cost a lot." (Collection of Southern and Northern Tones) Yes, the more experience humans have, the more courage they often lose. Those who are old but still brave in combat are rare among people, so these brave people are often the elite and flowers of humanity.

At present, what we see and hear is rarely good news. Children are usually "uncompetitive with the world", and should mostly enjoy their childhood life without worry, but that is not the case. Wasn't Shanghai Pushan Cemetery burying hundreds of children's corpses around Children's Day? Wasn't there a play of "Splitting Open the Coffin" performed there? Wasn't a large number of child bandits discovered around Guangzhou, traveling back and forth on sailboats to rob? Isn't the large number of child thieves in Hangzhou already a special feature in various newspapers? In addition, such as thirteen-year-old girls being raped, fifteen-year-old students running away to "save the nation", etc., all illustrate the abnormality of this society. Recently, the Fourth Division of the Shanghai District Court tried the sixteen-year-old thief Xu Guoliang, and the judge was embarrassed by the thief, which is even more legendary. The matter is like this: after Judge Wu finished questioning, he intended to sentence him to 30 days of detention, but after the child heard the sentence, he asked the judge with a surprised expression: "Sir, I have already been detained for forty days." If calculated correctly, the court owes him ten days of detention.

In this chaotic world, children are mostly precocious, so since there are one or two child prodigies in society, there are also more child bandits and child prostitutes, and the contrast between the two also reflects a corner of reality.

### Thinking of People When Seeing Things

— Hua

Girl A: I was thinking about you all day yesterday.

Boy B: Really? How interesting! Where were you yesterday?

Girl A: At the zoo.

### Love for the Homeland

— Keren

Since the Yellow River restoration project, which has been under construction for more than a year, was completed at Huayuankou in March, the Henan refugees who have been displaced in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Hubei for nine years have been returning to their hometowns in droves; according to statistics from relevant authorities, the total number of people entering the flooded area every day is more than 2,000. Among these people, the majority are old men and women; there are disabled people who support themselves with bamboo poles and walk two or three months on foot; there are those who fled with their whole family, young and old, and now return alone as survivors of the disaster; and there are tenacious mothers who carry baskets in one hand and fatherless orphans in the other. These people's teams are advancing slowly, bearing the grievances and pains suffered during their long exile, enduring the wind and rain and hunger of the journey, with the pious state of mind of Muslims making a pilgrimage to Mecca, step by step towards their hometown.

Nine years! Nine years is not a short time, and the turbulence of the past nine years is truly astonishing! The town shops that were once densely packed are now flat and empty; the ox carts that were used day and night, the tile houses and thatched sheds that several generations lived in, and the persimmon forests that were painstakingly planted, have all disappeared into the boundless sand. Where is the hometown after all? However, the soil of the hometown is dear, and thousands upon thousands of returnees have already found the old site of their own fields and houses, where they have re-compacted the foundations and built thatched sheds; they have sown the seeds of grain and planted yesterday's, and also tomorrow's, hopes together.

In the summer of the 1943, I secretly crossed the Yellow River south of Kaifeng and entered Shaanxi by an indirect route. On the way, I crossed a thirty-mile flooded area of the Yellow River. Looking around, reeds and artemisia grew densely, more than ten feet high and boundless. The strong wind swept through, like ghosts crying, like gods howling. The road was opened by weaving through reeds and artemisia, thorns pricked the knees, and sand and gravel submerged the ankles; and the tops of the village trees, houses, and arches of the past, only their peaks, ridges, and the words "chastity arch" emerged from the ground. Looking down at the yellow sand and weeds, I really don't know how many lives and properties are buried in it. However, after nine years of vicissitudes, the children born from this land have returned today.

Besides sincere blessings, what else can I say?

### How to Teach Your Children - Tell You a Few Good Examples

— Translated by Meng Lin

(1) The Red Vase

A pair of brothers, Jeon and Edward, often and fiercely argued, each insisting that the other was completely wrong. One day, their heated argument was accidentally overheard by their father, who called them into his study and made them sit face to face at the table. He took down a red glass vase from the mantelpiece, one side of which had a white rose decoration. He placed the vase in the center of the table, then said to Jeon, "Tell me what you see?"

"I see a red vase," Jeon replied.

"Jeon, tell me what you see?" He turned to Edward.

"I see a red vase with a white rose on it," Ai replied.

"Very good, children, that's right!" the father said.

The children understood their father's meaning. In the future, whenever they disagreed with others to the point of almost turning into a fruitless argument, they remembered the red vase's teaching, and realized that it was just a difference in perspective.

(2) The Open Palm

When I was ten years old, I found my first true "companion" among the girls at school. The friendship between the two of us became my most important thing. Because of possessiveness, whenever she had fun without me, I felt very jealous of her. I didn't hide this attitude from her, and the result was of course that she disliked me.

Mom understood everything that was happening. One day, we were admiring some chicks, and I picked one up and held it tightly, almost suffocating it. It struggled to escape! And immediately escaped. Mom casually said, "If you hold a chick too tightly, it will only want to escape. Try holding it more loosely."

The second chick indeed quietly squatted on my open palm. Mom said kindly, "You have to understand, honey, humans are like chicks. If we control the people we love too closely, they will fight for their freedom. Open our palms to protect them, and they won't feel suffocated."

This lesson was beneficial. Although I still felt jealous sometimes, as long as I imagined the scene of a chick contentedly squatting on my palm, I wouldn't show it on my face.

### General Discussion on Music Culture

— Sheng He

Musical art is a part of culture, and in terms of its effectiveness in cultivating the spirit and beautifying life, it is a rather important department of culture. My country's music is backward. Although there has been some progress in the past 20 years, if we compare it with the music of various countries in the world, the gap is far away, and the greatest efforts are still needed.

There are many reasons for the backwardness, such as the lack of talents, the decline of music education, the neglect of psychology, the dependence on imported musical instruments... The author believes that the biggest reason is that music culture has not been promoted and carried forward. Music culture is of great importance to the progress of music art and cannot be ignored.

Music culture includes at least the following three main items:

(1) Musical Creation

(2) Musical Criticism

(3) Music Publishing Industry

The above three items are extremely important departments of music culture, and should be developed evenly and carried out in a complementary manner in order to achieve great results. Today, China's musical talents are increasing day by day, and among them, the number of composers is not very scarce. Although there are creations, there are not many. How to encourage the vigorous creation of Chinese musical works (including vocal and instrumental) and widely recommend and introduce them is the primary urgent task for developing Chinese music culture. Secondly, establishing music criticism is also essential. We often see film reviews and drama reviews in newspapers and magazines, but rarely see music reviews (excuse me for coining this term); even if there are one or two articles criticizing music concerts, they are not criticisms at all, but just some feelings. Music critics do not necessarily have to be musicians, but at least they must have considerable cultivation in terms of appreciation ability, musical knowledge, and understanding of music in order to be competent and happy. Speaking of China's music publishing industry, it is even more pitiful! As far as I know, at present, the publication of books on music theory and sheet music is almost non-existent; and the number of high-quality periodic music publications in the country is no more than ten, but they all die young or are delayed due to funding, printing, and various difficulties.

If we want to develop Chinese music culture, we must work hard towards the above three goals. Relying solely on the strength of the music industry and people who care about and love music is not enough. It really depends on the government authorities to enthusiastically subsidize and advocate it with a long-term vision and determination.

### Listening to Music

— Shi

Yesterday, by the radio, I listened to Yu Pai's old-man actor Chen Dahuo singing three segments of "Great Bao Guo", which was very interesting. According to the second half of this play is the "Second Entry to the Palace". Famous artists such as Tan Yu and others only performed the "Entry to the Palace" but not the "Protect the Country", so the reason for this is not that they were unable to read and sing, but that in addition to the character Li Liang, the writing of this play is not very different from the "Second Entry to the Palace". In addition, the old version of the lyrics are vulgar, far from the identity of the characters in the play, and the actors were not good at writing, so they did not dare to change and delete them without authorization, so they gave up performing it. Later, Yan Jupeng came to Shanghai and performed this play, starting from "Great Bao Guo" and ending with "Second Entry to the Palace", with a "Sighing at the Imperial Mausoleum" inserted in the middle; his intention was nothing more than to turn a small play into a big play and add more appeal. Unexpectedly, this play became popular as soon as it was performed, and famous actors such as Tan Gongying, Yang Shisen, and Li Zongyi then sang it together, but all performed according to the old version. Although the singing sentences of famous artists had differences, they were roughly the same. Yesterday, listening to Dahuo sing this was very different from the other actors. Not only were the words elegant and smooth, but they could also express the identity and tone of the minister. The tunes were also novel and unique, without a single sentence being the same. Each singing tune could fully express the emotions of the lyrics. It is difficult to achieve this without hard work.

### The Mystery of Grass

— Yang Shi

It is reported that an antelope man was found in North Africa, who can run fifty miles per hour, which will make the long-distance runners in the World Games pale in comparison. It is also said that his main food is grass, which is a credible reason.

Scientists discovered a few years ago that one pound of dry grass contains 23 times more "vitamin A" than carrots, 9 times more "vitamin B1" than vegetables, 22 times more "vitamin B2" than lettuce, and 14 times more "vitamin C" than tomatoes. In addition, alfalfa powder contains sufficient hemostatic "vitamin K" and protein, but ordinary people have to look for "vitamin K" in liver and vegetables. Because "vitamin K" can prevent retinal hemorrhage and blindness, and can also remedy menstrual disorders and stomach ulcers in women.

At the American Chemical Society annual meeting, a famous scientist declared that if people use powder made from barley and oat leaves, they will not suffer from colds in winter after eating it. He also suggested that each person only needs twelve pounds of grass powder per year to get enough nutrients. Now there are factories in the United States that specialize in making grass powder for home use.

There is no doubt that this antelope man has such a running speed because he gets nutrition from grass. In fact, before the 5th century AD, the Babylonian king Cainisha had no military food for three months after breaking through Jerusalem and lived entirely on grass. However, now that mankind has progressed, they have forgotten that grass in nature also contains such valuable nutrients.

### Art and Literary Scene

The Shanghai Experimental Theater Troupe will perform "Chang'e," a new mythological drama in three acts, six scenes, and seven acts by Wu Zuguang, directed by Yuan Jun. They have been rehearsing day and night and are already prepared to be staged at the Lyceum Theatre on the night of the 20th. The play is a new type of dance stage play with a unique style. It is reported that the ticket prices are only 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000.

The "Culture Pioneer Bi-Monthly," Volume 6, Issue 23, a purely academic magazine published by the Culture Pioneer Society of Nanjing Xiangpu Camp, has been published. The content is very exciting.

### Su Dongpo is Afraid of Back Rubbing

— Ning Yuan

Su Dongpo was tricked! The lay Buddhist originally had nothing, probably not when he was young and at Huangzhou, "There is dirt!" The implication is probably countless! Although someone has written a back-rubbing song. Not only is it profound, wanting to rub their backs, the song says: "Dirt on the skin, but they are always used to it and do not accept it at all? Su Lao's borrowing the topic to make a point lightly, probably has another perspective, accustomed to it, I see that the dirt on the back and the person are both insignificant. It has a lot of meaning." Compared to the cowardly Su Dongpo, trying to clean us Try looking at today's wielder of back-rubbing people, to the extreme the elbow, soft hand! Indeed, one must be stronger than them. There are those who hide dirt for the whole day!

### Chronicle of a Precarious City

— Qin Shouou

"Mrs. Zhou, come down and talk! Come down and talk!" That skinny driver also gradually felt the seriousness of the matter, so he went up to persuade the fat woman himself; but he still wanted to retain some dignity for himself, so his tone wasn't too soft.

These two sentences were like pouring a big bucket of gasoline onto a fire. The fat woman lightning-like pulled out a pair of shiny scissors from who knows which clothing bag.

"You're planning to bully a woman, aren't you?" She blocked the entire car door with her half-short, thick body, tightly gripping the scissors in her right hand and grabbing the back of the seat with her left hand, glaring at all the people standing on the ground with angry eyes. "No way! No way! I'm not getting off the bus!" She gave the driver a special stare. "Do you still have a conscience? My three taels of gold didn't fall from the sky! Whoever wants me to get off the bus, I'll fight them to the death!"

She shouted like she was slaughtering a pig, almost alarming everyone in this open space.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!" Zhang Chang, with the mentality of watching a fire from the other side of the river, couldn't help but cheer, and even taught the hooligan to imitate him, clapping his hands continuously.

Director Xiong, who was in a dilemma, glared at him fiercely, but he pretended not to see it.

"Deng Guozhong, damn it! What are you still standing there for?" Now, Company Commander Liu also felt that this matter was getting out of hand, and slapped the driver on the face with one hand. "Why don't you hurry over there? Discuss it with Wang Shixiong and the others, whichever one of your drivers agrees! Give her a seat, we have to leave at nine o'clock!"

Zheng Guozhong, with a mournful face, scurried out of the crowd like a dog.

The young Director Xiong still had to pretend to be calm and try his best to perfunctorily deal with the middle-aged man holding the walking stick; he felt that he had really lost face today because of this damned driver.

Unexpectedly, Company Commander Liu's painstaking efforts still couldn't gain the understanding of the short, fat Hunan woman. She stomped on the driver's seat with her two big feet wearing square-toed black leather shoes, and shouted all the way:

"No way! No way! I must sit on this car! My luggage is all on this car, you want to get rid of me! Don't dream! I..."

The onlookers immediately burst into laughter.
