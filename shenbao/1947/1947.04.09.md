CCP's Indiscriminate Issuance of Border Currency Causes Alarming Prices in the Communist Area

[Central News Agency, Yan'an Dispatch, 8th] The pseudo "border currency" was already worthless when the CCP controlled northern Shaanxi. Ordinary people regarded it as waste paper. Its exchange rate with the legal tender was twenty to one, that is, twenty yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. Seeing that its currency price was falling day by day, the CCP knew that it was difficult to gain the trust of the people, so it issued another kind of "commercial circulation voucher." Initially, it was determined that twenty yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of "circulation voucher." In January of this year, because it launched the spring offensive, the military needs were huge, and it forcibly increased the ratio, stipulating that seven yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. One yuan of "circulation voucher" could be exchanged for three yuan of legal tender. However, all kinds of pseudo-currencies were only issued but not collected. The people were not allowed to store gold and silver, nor were they allowed to use legal tender. They had to exchange "border currency" or "circulation voucher" from the "Border Region Bank" before they were allowed to circulate in the market. The prices in Yan'an under the rule of the CCP were higher than anywhere else in the country. Yellow rice sold for 1.4 million "border currency" per dan, wheat for 1.2 million yuan per dan, millet for more than 800,000 yuan, sorghum for 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, white cloth for 18,000 yuan per foot, colored cloth for 31,000 yuan per foot, a sesame cake for 4,000 yuan, oily pastry for 1,000 yuan, a fried dough stick for 4,000 yuan, and a small box of matches for 4,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Yan'an Dispatch, 7th] The reporter recently read Communication No. 14, issued by Chen Haihan, chief of staff of He Long's unit, on March 16, instructing the communist army: (1) Defend Yan'an at any cost. (2) All civilians must be taken away. Those who do not obey will be dealt with. (3) All civilian food and utensils can be taken without compensation. This communication has eight articles and was found by the National Army near Yan'an.

### Receiving Dalian and Lushun Has Many Twists and Turns; Our Notification to the Soviets Has Not Yet Been Replied; Soviets Admit to Stationing Troops in the Changshan Islands

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] Regarding the issue of taking over Dalian, Foreign Minister Wang sent a notification to Soviet Ambassador Petrov at the end of last month, but as of today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a reply.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 8th] The Soviet army agreed to let us take over Wuzidian first, but our side, wanting a complete solution to the Dalian and Lushun problem, may not go to take over immediately. It is reported that the area is currently garrisoned by Soviet troops to protect this water source for Dalian and Lushun. It is located southeast of Puguan Town and southwest of Piziwo, outside the boundary line of the Lushun naval base in the Sino-Soviet Treaty.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 8th] Reliable source: Major General Galitsky has admitted to the stationing of Soviet troops on the Changshan Islands. He said that there is currently a defense headquarters there, commanding a small number of Soviet troops to maintain order. As for illegal armed forces within their defense zone, he categorically denied it, only saying that there were armed police of the local government. However, when we asked whether the local government was the legitimate government of the Republic of China, he said that he was a soldier and was not interested in this, so he had not studied it and could not answer. Regarding the handover of defense of Dalian, Lushun, and Jinzhou, he believes that a Sino-Soviet Joint Military Commission should be established first in accordance with the treaty to survey the area boundary line of the Lushun naval base and determine the locations of both sides' garrisons before this issue can be discussed.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 8th] Zhan Shizhi, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, returned to Shenyang on the night of the 7th and said: During the meeting between frontline commanders of China and the Soviet Union, the six points presented by our side to the Soviet side will urge Soviet Major General Galitsky to reply as soon as possible. Galitsky said that he would do his best. Our side stated that, apart from frontline military issues, everything still needs to be handled by the diplomatic authorities in Nanjing and await orders from the Central Government. Zhan also said that regarding the six points presented to the Soviet army, namely, the issue of normal and abnormal methods of receiving the areas, based on the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, our side has administrative power, and General Galitsky has also frequently cited Article 5 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty on non-interference in China's internal affairs, which clearly shows that he is quite sincere in this consultation.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 8th] During the meeting between frontline commanders of China and the Soviet Union in Pulandian on the afternoon of the 6th, the Soviets asked us why some of our officers liked American attire. We countered by asking them why they came in American jeeps. The Soviet general dismissed the question with a laugh.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] External sources confirmed today the news reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent a note to Foreign Minister Wang on August 14 last year, stating that the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, agreed to assist the National Government in both material and spiritual aspects. However, he refused to comment on the fact that the Soviet Union has not yet fulfilled this promise.

### Paratrooper Unit Holds Review and Performs Parachute Jumps in Three Batches to Commemorate Its Second Anniversary

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] Today, the Paratrooper Headquarters held a review to commemorate its second anniversary. Starting at 8:00 a.m., at the Chalu Kou training base outside Zhonghua Gate, each item was carried out according to the scheduled program. First, Commander Ma Shigong, Deputy Commander Zhang Xuzi, and Chief of Staff Xu Yanhuan accompanied Deputy Minister of National Defense Liu Shiyi to review the troops, followed by reviews of various subjects, from basic training to parachute jumps, all of which were extremely skilled. The soldiers of the Headquarters are of good quality, all under the age of 25, and all over 1.651 meters tall. Today, six people jumped, divided into three batches. The wind was very strong, and the area was small, but they were all able to jump out of the plane at an altitude of 1,200 meters and complete their tasks, which was very commendable. It is reported that each paratrooper, fully armed, carries a rifle, pistol, bullets, binoculars, etc., with a load of up to 90 pounds. As for heavy weapons, such as mortars, bazookas, and light and heavy machine guns, they are dropped separately in equipment canisters for use. Well-trained paratroopers can jump twelve people consecutively in six seconds. The reporter witnessed their exercise of moving under enemy fire, as if they were on a real battlefield. The training of other weapons, basic bayonet drills, and rifle exercises were also excellent. At the tea party at 11:30 a.m., Liu Juezhang praised the Paratrooper Headquarters for achieving such excellent results in a short period of time, and encouraged them to continue their efforts, saying that progress would be limitless. He also said that in order to achieve the task of building the army, the construction of paratroopers must be prioritized, because modern armies must be paratrooperized and must have strong physiques, scientific minds, and technology. The Ministry of National Defense will fully assist in the construction of paratroopers and move towards this goal. Starting at 1:00 p.m., there was a Hengbing duty exercise, and various exhibitions were held in the auditorium of the headquarters to welcome nearby residents to visit. In addition, before the review, simple ceremonies were held for the opening ceremonies of the second class of the officers' team and the fifth class of the sergeants' team of the Headquarters.

### Land Administration Department Explains Questions Regarding Registration of Grave Ownership

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] The Land Administration Department's explanation regarding the transfer of grave ownership and pledge rights is as follows: If the transferee of a grave has applied to the court for real estate ownership registration and obtained a certificate of real estate ownership registration from the court before the land general registration has been legally carried out, and has paid the sales deed tax and attached the official deed, the ownership registration may be approved during the land general registration. As for the transfer of land without obtaining a certificate of real estate ownership from the court, if the transfer deed contains words that permanently prohibit redemption, it should be regarded as an outright sale. During the legal land general registration, the ownership registration should be carried out. If the transfer deed does not contain such words, then the pledge registration should be carried out.

### Director of the Executive Yuan's Henan Branch Reports: Disaster Relief Work in the Yellow River Flood Area; Dyke Restoration Will Take Time; Reconstruction of the Disaster Area Is Urgent

[Our Report] The disaster relief work of the Executive Yuan in Henan Province has now entered the stage of restoring the Yellow River flood area from the task of closing the breach and restoring the dikes. Ma Jie, Director of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan, together with Deputy Director Pan Chenghou, UNRRA Henan Branch Representative Hart, and Reconstruction Appeal Group Representative Shang Shaoheng, held a press conference at the Capital Hotel at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the disaster situation in Henan Province and the past and future disaster relief work of closing the Yellow River breach and restoring the dikes. During the meeting, Director Ma repeatedly stated: "Reviving agriculture in Henan, Henan can become China's granary." The work of closing the breach was completed as scheduled on the 15th of last month, but the restoration of the dikes will take time. Due to the severity of the disaster in the Yellow River flood area and the large number of refugees, and due to the civil war, relief and reconstruction work is extremely difficult.

Work of the Executive Yuan's Branch

The work of the Henan Branch is to carry out welfare and relief undertakings on the one hand and to carry out construction on the other. In terms of agriculture, it is doing its best to provide agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, etc. In terms of water conservancy, it has used work-for-relief to build the three most economically valuable canals in Henan Province, namely, the Tuanhui, Zhonghe, and Gongxing canals, which can irrigate a total of 152,000 mu of land. Other projects include digging 2,000 wells, dredging 1,000 ponds, building 700 kilometers of highways, and other small-scale work-for-relief projects. In terms of welfare undertakings, such as subsidizing orphanages and relief organizations, providing free nutritional products, setting up porridge factories, setting up affordable canteens, building new villages for refugees, and setting up handicraft training classes. In addition, various welfare institutions are specially set up in the Yellow River flood area.

Disaster Situation in the Yellow River Flood Area

Deputy Director Pan then reported on the disaster situation in the Yellow River flood area, saying that there are 20 counties in Henan Province that have been flooded, of which 10 counties are less severely affected, but the general disaster situation is extremely tragic. Selling children and selling daughters, pulling clothes and crying, and even grass roots and tree bark have been completely dug up. Since the Yellow River was diverted back to its old course, refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another, but it is still difficult to make a living.

The Countryside Must Be Sound

Mr. Hart expressed his great admiration for some young people who abandoned their studies and university degrees to participate in the disaster relief work in the Yellow River flood area. At the same time, he was deeply moved by the service spirit of Director Ma and the disaster relief workers. He also said: 80% of the people in China are farmers. To build a new China and establish a sound rural economy is a major task, and to complete this task, we must rely on the farmers who live in hardship. We should do our best to provide relief and assistance, and it is time for the Chinese people to work hard for the country.

Hopes of the Appeal Group

Some representatives of the Appeal Group are currently petitioning in Beijing, while Shang Shaoheng, representing the group here, expressed gratitude for the work of the Executive Yuan, but said that closing the breach is a passive task, and rebuilding the flood area is an active task. Therefore, he hopes for three things: (1) In terms of time, he hopes that the reconstruction work will be done as soon as possible, otherwise the arable land will become barren in two years. (2) In terms of organization, he hopes that it can be unified and sound, and not become a situation where one plan is one organization. (3) To request more financial and material assistance from China and other countries.

During the meeting, some reporters from this city requested to go to the flood area to inspect the disaster situation in person. Director Ma and others agreed to contact the authorities for a reply. Mr. Ma is scheduled to return to Henan today.

Editorial

### Review of Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management

Following the announcement of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan," the government immediately prepared to transfer state-operated enterprises to private management and exchanged opinions with Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. The "Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management" has now been approved by the National Government and was promulgated on the 7th; the full text was published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. These methods are based on item D of the first article of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan." Its purpose is to attract idle capital to balance the budget. The transfer of state-operated enterprises to private management is the most popular item among the people in the entire measures plan. Because the implementation methods have been under discussion for a long time without a decision, it has caused considerable doubts among the people. Now that the methods have been promulgated, the transfer of state-operated enterprises to private management will surely be realized in the near future. This major event in the economic world, its development and its results, are naturally valued by the industrial community and society!

Overall, the "Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management" consists of eight articles, which make general provisions regarding the departments and methods for selling state-operated enterprises. In terms of the scope of the enterprises to be sold, they include: (1) The China Textile Construction Corporation, initially selling 70%, with the remaining 30% to be continued to be operated by the company; (2) The China Aquatic Products Company, China Tobacco Company, and eight other units, to be sold entirely to private management; the original 40% government shares of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company will also be sold entirely to private management; (3) For originally established state-operated companies, such as the China Silk Company and the China Salt Industry Company, 50% of the shares will first be issued to the people through public sale of stocks. In terms of sales methods, the partial or complete sale of enterprises such as China Textile and China Tobacco will generally be handled by a special committee organized by the competent authority. The selling price will be estimated based on market prices and operating conditions, and will be valid for six months. The sale of each enterprise will be through public bidding; larger ones will be organized into a joint-stock company by the acquirer, and a certain number of shares will be publicly offered and may be listed on the exchange. The method for issuing shares for the original state-operated companies is for the company to issue shares to the people and their business organizations; state-owned banks and bureaus are not allowed to purchase them. Government shares and private shares will be treated equally. In the future, they will be reorganized in accordance with the Company Law, with no special privileges. If the government deems it necessary to sell the remaining 50% of the government shares to the people, they will still be sold to private management. Regarding this method, the importance of the departments of the enterprises to be sold is not discussed for the moment. However, from the simple content of the sales method, it is possible to see that there are many technical problems, and it is necessary to study them.

First, let's talk about the sales method. According to regulations, China Textile is selling 70% and not the entire company. China Textile is a large organic organization with a total of 71 factories, including 26 in Shanghai, 12 in Qingdao, 13 in Tianjin, and 10 in the Northeast. Its nature includes cotton spinning, printing and dyeing, wool spinning, hemp, silk, machinery, and affiliated units. If the sales method cannot match the sale, or only the printing and dyeing is sold without the textile, or the spinning and dyeing are sold but the machinery is retained, then private operation will inevitably be fraught with difficulties. Especially in terms of price, after the victory, the value of all China Textile factories has exceeded two trillion, and other raw materials are worth more than one trillion to one and a half trillion, for a total value of three and a half trillion. This time, the allotment is based on "market prices" and "operating conditions." At a time when prices are rising and raw materials are expensive, it remains to be seen whether it will meet the needs of the people and stimulate the interest of idle capital. As for China Silk and China Salt, they do not adopt a full allotment method, but rather the company issues 50% of its shares, which serves to attract business shares and is not private management. The methods are still state-operated. Thus, the so-called allotment of state-operated enterprises to private management is a mixture of "state-operated" and "private management," which is still a distance from a thorough transfer policy. Therefore, it is said that the competent authority still needs to make reasonable decisions on the sales method in terms of policy and technology.

The sale of state-operated enterprises to private management is something that the government is bound to do, and the people have been waiting for it for a long time. We hope that for this measure, which is most favored by the people, the government must conduct more technical reviews and solicit public opinion; the policy may as well be relaxed, and do not hold the attitude of "waiting for a good price to sell"; even if it is cheap for the people, it will not harm the national treasury, and it can also have the effect of supporting national capital. We believe that this issue is important, and we offer the following opinions for the reference of the competent authority.

1. The government should promptly announce the prices of the enterprises to be allotted. The committee's estimation of prices and the placement of factory machinery should incorporate the opinions of the industrial community and the people to make it reasonable, so as to achieve the effect of attracting idle capital and supporting private management policies. If they act arbitrarily, the people will inevitably wait and see.

2. Bidding is beneficial to the seller, because the seller must sell to the highest bidder. The China Tobacco Company and other most profitable enterprises can use bidding methods. For other departments or larger institutions, the acquirer should organize a company as soon as possible and issue its own shares. At the same time, it seems that the location for issuing shares should not be limited to Shanghai; it can be issued widely throughout the country at the same time. On the one hand, it avoids large households manipulating stocks, and on the other hand, it can limit the exchange of China Textile's shares, and match them with other state-operated enterprises.

3. It is necessary to prevent the manipulation of capital by powerful families. The control of China's economy by powerful families is an undeniable fact. The allotment of state-operated enterprises must allow private industries to truly establish themselves. If they are acquired by powerful families, the harm to the country and the people in the future is worrying. The examples of Mitsubishi and Mitsui in Japan are not far away and must be observed!

4. It is necessary to pay attention to whether various state-operated enterprises can enjoy the various conveniences of the state-operated period after they are transferred to private management. If the future private industries are still in the same situation as in the past, suffering from high taxes and monopolized raw materials, production will inevitably shrink, and private industries will still not be able to establish themselves soundly. In order to seek the future prosperity of private industrial units after the increase, the government must have a reasonable industrial policy at present, giving the transferred private industries various conveniences for development in their careers.

In short, the sale of state-operated enterprises to private management is a measure supported by the people and hoped for by the industrial community. Now that the methods have been announced and the scope of the enterprises to be sold has been determined, there are many technical problems and the relationship is very important. It is hoped that the government will make a decision quickly and solicit public opinion. For this measure, do not focus solely on financial considerations, but should focus on the country's industrial policy, then the significance of the sale of state-operated enterprises to private management will surely be supported by the people, and its success will surely have brilliant results in economic history!

### Gromyko Vigorously Criticizes the US Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey, Saying It Is Equivalent to Interfering in the Internal Affairs of Greece and Turkey; British Representative Cadogan Fully Supports the US Position

[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 7th] Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech in the Security Council today, accusing the United States of its policy of aiding Greece and Turkey, saying that it is overstepping its bounds as far as the United Nations is concerned. He said: "The United States argues that its actions to aid Greece and Turkey will help strengthen the strength of the United Nations organization and are in line with the principles and goals of the United Nations organization. This argument is difficult to agree with. The actions of the United States not only fail to enhance the status of the United Nations organization, but also weaken its status, damage its authority, and are enough to make people doubt the true goals of the United Nations organization and hinder the development of friendly relations between countries."

Regarding the US plan to send coaches to Greece, Gromyko said: No one can deny that this move constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Greece and a serious blow to the country's independence. The Greek people should receive more respectful treatment than the United States treats Greece. Aid to Greece should be based on the interests of the Greek people and should never become a tool for foreign forces in Greece. As for Turkey, in terms of its position in the last war, it should not have the right to obtain external aid, because Turkey did not suffer any damage during the war.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] After Gromyko criticized the US plan to aid Greece and Turkey in the Security Council, British Representative Cadogan replied, saying: The United Nations cannot provide Greece with the aid it needs, so Britain approves of the US plan. This move is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations. Cadogan also agreed with the US representative's proposal to establish a standing committee in the Balkans to be responsible for guarding the borders of the Balkan countries. Australian Representative Hodge also expressed approval of the US motion. Syrian Representative El-Khoury requested that the Security Council put aside the Greek issue and argued that it should be submitted for discussion after receiving the report of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to postpone the discussion of the Greek issue until Thursday. Prior to that, no vote was taken on Soviet Representative Gromyko's suggestion to transfer the aid to Greece issue to the United Nations for handling, and US Representative Austin's suggestion that the Balkan Investigation Team continue to stay in Greece pending the Security Council's decision on how to handle it.

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] Soviet Representative Gromyko vehemently criticized the United States' "unilateral actions" in the Security Council on the night of the 7th, calling President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey an interference in the internal affairs of the two countries. Gromyko proposed that aid to Greece should be handled by a special committee established by the Security Council, which would give the United Nations organization the power to supervise it. This was unexpected, and representatives of various countries have urgently telegraphed their governments to indicate this. The first reaction caused by the Soviet proposal is to make people feel that the proposed supervision will definitely stipulate that aid funds must not be used for any military purposes, but this is one of the main purposes of the US plan, so its proposal is difficult for the US to accept.

### The US Senate Completes Preparations to Discuss the Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey; Vandenberg May Reply to Soviet Accusations

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The Senate today completed the procedures to prepare for a discussion of the aid plan to Greece and Turkey on Tuesday, regardless of Soviet Representative Gromyko's claim that this plan undermines the United Nations organization. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that he might reply to Gromyko's accusations in the United Nations Security Council yesterday. Other senators have different views. Democratic Senator George said, "It seems unreasonable for Gromyko to portray himself as a defender of the United Nations. We have tried every means to show that we are not abandoning the United Nations organization, but rather want to strengthen it." Democratic Senator Pepper agreed with Gromyko's proposal, believing that the Soviet Union is willing to jointly aid Greece. Pepper also proposed that the United States hand over the funds for relief to Greece to the United Nations organization, and that the issue of military aid to Greece and Turkey be handled by the Security Council. Republican Senator Smith said that he believed Gromyko's reaction was natural, but he did not admit that the United States had abandoned the United Nations. It is said that "I believe that Austin's statement, coupled with Vandenberg's amendment, makes it very proper to introduce the United Nations organization into it." Democratic Senator McClellan proposed in the Senate Review Committee that the United States cut off all financial aid to the Soviet Union and its seven vassal states. McClellan requested an amendment to the $350 million foreign relief bill to prohibit the use of cash to aid the Soviet Union, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, because this bill is difficult to coexist with President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism bill, and is contradictory.

### Wallace Arrives in England to Discuss His Mission to Europe

[This newspaper news] London, 8th Broadcast: Wallace arrived here today, completing the first stage of his European tour. According to his statement to reporters at the airport, the current world crisis is extremely serious. He also said that if there is no true mutual understanding between countries, there will be no union. Wallace will stay until the 17th before leaving England.

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 7th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said before boarding the plane to England today that he is taking the goodwill and friendship of millions of progressive people in the United States to the powerful progressive and democratic people in Europe. All progressive people must unite, because world peace and the welfare of the people are based on this unity. He mentioned the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey, saying that when he was Secretary of Commerce, he approved of the aid plan to Greece. There were many opponents at the time, but he still tried his best to advocate it, but he never advocated military aid to Greece, and this position remains unchanged to this day. When he resigned, he stated his opposition to all forms of imperialism, whether it is British or American imperialism. Wallace also believes that Senator Vandenberg's proposed amendment, which allows the United Nations organization to intervene in US aid to Greece and Turkey under certain conditions, is a good gesture. He believes that any event related to world peace should be handled by the United Nations organization. Wallace's trip to Europe is intended to obtain the reaction of ordinary people to US foreign policy, and he plans to meet with leaders of various European governments to enhance the mission of the United Nations organization and promote the international recovery plan.

### British Labor Party Groups Criticize Bevin's Policies

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who is currently attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow, was once again criticized today by powerful groups within the Labor Party for his "harmful" foreign policy. During the Easter holiday, many representatives attending the Cooperative Party annual meeting and the smaller-scale Trades Union Congress meeting have passed resolutions calling for a change in Bevin's foreign policy. The Cooperative Party is an important part of the Labor Party, and almost half of the Cooperative Party opposes Bevin's foreign policy.

### The Soviet Union Adopts a Delaying Policy; The Foreign Ministers Conference Achieves Nothing; Discussions on the German Political System Are Fruitless

[This newspaper news] Moscow, 8th Broadcast: In the past four weeks, the United Kingdom and the United States have avoided making direct criticisms of the Soviet Union in the Foreign Ministers Conference, but in last night's meeting, they openly accused the Soviet Union of its attempt to communize Germany. Marshall attempted to actively discuss the second half of the agenda, but in the past ten days, he has been repeatedly hindered by Molotov. Marshall expressed great dissatisfaction with this, and in the next day or two, he will make a more severe statement, stating that the US cannot make any more concessions. If the Soviet Union does not stop its obstructive policy, the conference will end without success.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 8th] Marshall and Bevin indirectly accused the Soviet Union last night of attempting to use the German people as tools to ensure that the Communist Party can occupy a majority position in the German government. Yesterday, the Soviet Union insisted on holding a referendum of the German people to decide whether there should be a strong central government or a federal government. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France condemned it as a threat to world peace. Marshall said, "The United States does not want Germany to have a central government that may turn into a dictatorial government, which would be a threat to world peace. The United States only wants Germany to have a central government based in various states."

He also said, "It is impossible for the German people to express their true will today or in the near future. Drafting a constitution is a very complicated procedure, and holding a referendum during the transition period would be extremely dangerous for peace."

Bevin also reminded Molotov that a strong German government has twice caused world wars, and Hitler used referendums as a tool to seize power under this kind of political system. "I will never agree to the suggestion that British security should be decided by the German people." Marshall also criticized the referendum for possibly creating "the impression that the member states of the Foreign Ministers Conference are using the German people as tools and playing political tricks." Bevin said, "Mr. Molotov's suggestion may have a basis in theory, but for the sake of security, I will definitely oppose it. I don't care whether the German government is communist, socialist, or dictatorial, what I care about is peace." Molotov also retorted that Bevin's position could truly create the impression that the four powers want to divide Germany. Bevin replied that he had agreed to the unification of Germany, but the power of the central government must be limited. He simply did not want to discuss the idea that such an important issue could be handed over to the German people for a decision. Marshall said that a referendum could be held after the German permanent constitution is drafted and approved by the Allied countries. After three and a half hours of heated debate, the issue was shelved and the agenda for tomorrow was discussed. Marshall suggested discussing the German border, the Ruhr, the Rhineland, and the US proposal for German disarmament. Molotov opposed it, saying that he wanted to resolve the outstanding issues first. Marshall then agreed. Bevin expressed fatigue and impatience with the lack of agreement in the past week and the fact that there are still fourteen agenda items that have not been discussed at all.

[United Press, Moscow, 8th] US sources said today: Unless the Soviet side stops its obstructive tactics at the Foreign Ministers Conference, the entire conference is about to end. A showdown between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the foreign ministers of the Western countries is in the making. The basic question is whether the four countries should continue to deliberate on the German issue at length, or whether they can turn to discuss borders and other matters, and whether there is a possibility of reaching an agreement on Austria. Regarding Germany, the issue has been discussed in detail, and the opinions of various countries have now been explained. There is no way to discuss it further. If the Soviet side is unwilling to discuss other matters, the conference will end. According to Western diplomats, the Soviet suggestion to allow the German people to vote to choose the form of their future government is intended to offset the reaction of the German people to the Soviet demand for 10 billion US dollars in reparations.

### The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Complete the Report on the Austrian Peace Treaty

[This newspaper news] Moscow, 8th Broadcast: The Four Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty announced today the end of drafting the Austrian Peace Treaty, and passed the British and American suggestions to extend the conference from today. The four Deputy Foreign Ministers have completed their report to the foreign ministers, and unless the four Deputy Foreign Ministers issue further orders, they will no longer discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty.

### Fourteen Items on the Agenda Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon

[Reuters News Agency, Moscow, 7th] The Foreign Ministers Conference has entered its fourth week today, and mutual accusations among representatives have made progress very difficult. Today's meeting started an hour late due to the late submission of the report by the Adjustment Committee. After a discussion on the issue of establishing a temporary German government, no compromise was reached and it had to be returned to the Adjustment Committee for review. There are still fourteen points that need to be discussed by the Foreign Ministers Conference, including: (1) Economic unification, including industrial standards and reparations; (2) Another report from the Adjustment Committee; (3) A report from the special committee discussing the remaining matters in the report of the Allied Control Council; (4) Population issues, including refugees and prisoners of war; (5) The disarmament of German military power; (6) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the procedures for concluding the German Peace Treaty; (7) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the Allied Reparations Committee; (8) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the opinions of the smaller Allied countries; (9) Land issues, including the future of the Ruhr and the Rhineland; (10) The Four Power Pact proposed by the United States; (11) The report of the coal experts; (12) The Austrian Peace Treaty (the foreign ministers have not yet started to discuss it); (13) The report of the Trieste Special Finance Committee, (14) The issue of restricting the stationed German occupation forces.

### The Automotive King Ford Passes Away at the Age of Eighty, Wealthy Beyond Royal Princes

[Associated Press, Detroit, Michigan, 8th] A Ford Motor Company spokesman issued a brief statement today stating: "Henry Ford passed away at his Edsel Ford residence at 11:40 pm on the 7th." Ford was the Automotive King of England, born on July 30, 1863, and lived to be 83 years old. He devoted his life to the automotive industry, and founded the world-renowned Ford Motor Company, serving as chairman of the company for 18 years (1901 to 1919). Ford had one only son, who passed away in May 1943. He is now survived by his wife and two grandsons, one named Benson Ford and the other named Henry Ford II, the latter being the successor to the chairmanship of the Ford Motor Company.

[United Press, Detroit, 8th] The cause of Ford's death is still unknown. Ford followed the usual practice of going to Ford's winter estate in Georgia. When he returned home a week ago, it was said that he was in extremely good spirits. Throughout his life, he was unknown in the fields in his early years. Later, with the help of relatives and friends, he invested 28,000 yuan in the automotive industry, and was able to accumulate as much as 1 billion, becoming one of the world's richest people.

[Associated Press, Detroit, 8th] When Ford passed away, it was raining heavily, causing the power to be cut off, so the room was only lit with candles and kerosene lamps, and wood was burned for warmth. Four hours before his death, Ford still went to the factory on the banks of the Rouge River to inspect the damage caused by the windstorm. Those who saw Ford off in front of his bed were his wife and a servant. At that time, the telephone was also cut off, so his driver drove to urgently summon the doctor, who only arrived half an hour after his death. According to his successor, Ford II, Ford died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

### Gromyko on Disarmament Advocates for the Early Establishment of a Disarmament Agency; Opposes the Disarmament Measures Proposed by the United Kingdom and the United States

[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 7th] The Soviet Union stated today that it opposes the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States that a system of security guarantees should be established before the United Nations organization can reduce armaments. Soviet Representative Gromyko told the United Nations Disarmament Committee that the disarmament resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly last December did not indicate that disarmament must be preceded by the establishment of a security system as a prerequisite, nor did it stipulate that security guarantees such as those required by the British and American representatives must be established. The resolution did not directly or indirectly mention that guarantees must be established before disarmament. On the contrary, the resolution pointed out the necessity of establishing a disarmament agency as soon as possible. After armaments are reduced, international security and trust will naturally be promoted. Gromyko then reiterated the position of the Soviet government, saying that the most urgent step is to conclude a convention to prevent atomic energy from being used for combat purposes. Without such a convention, it is difficult or even impossible to smoothly resolve the issue of international control of atomic energy. International control of atomic energy is absolutely necessary, but it is a separate matter from disarmament. Gromyko also opposed the British proposal to establish a United Nations army to maintain security before the United Nations organization begins disarmament. From the perspective of implementing the disarmament plan, this proposal is not good and is enough to hinder the progress of disarmament.

### America Does Not Wish to See Korea Divided: Hodge Discusses Establishing a Government in South Korea

[Asia East News Agency, Seoul, 8th] General Hodge, recently returned to Korea from the United States, held a press conference at the Military Government Office at 10:00 AM today. Regarding the establishment of a Korean government, he stated: "While in the United States, I had numerous meetings with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and other government officials to discuss the Korean issue. Although my time in the US was short, I made every effort to ensure that American officials and the public understood the situation in Korea. The current US policy towards Korea is definitely against establishing a separate government in South Korea that would divide the Korean peninsula. On the contrary, the United States desires to see a democratic and unified government established in Korea. Regarding the government to be formed after the upcoming general election in South Korea, it will allow Koreans to exercise administrative and judicial power themselves, but it does not transfer all sovereignty to this government." Regarding the unification of Korea, General Hodge stated that as long as the Soviet Union accepts the US proposal and fulfills the resolutions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the US-Soviet Joint Commission can be reconvened at any time to discuss the organization of a democratic and unified provisional government for Korea.

### Japanese Prime Minister Advocates Forming a Coalition Cabinet

[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Prime Minister Yoshida, who recently returned to Tokyo from the countryside, issued a statement on the current political situation on the 7th, stating that political stability can only be achieved under a national coalition. Yoshida stated that democratic politics requires all parties to maintain considerable strength, cooperate with each other, and move politics towards democratization. Therefore, he believes that it is necessary to avoid unnecessary political disputes at this time, to rebuild Japan economically, and that before Japan's economic reconstruction, all parties must work together politically. Yoshida said his idea of forming a coalition cabinet is based on this belief.

### The Land of Buddha Turns into Hell: Mahatma Gandhi Helpless and Confused

[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Gandhi stated today that the religious conflict in the Noakhali district of Bengal seems to be forcing Hindus to choose between life and death in a frenzy. Gandhi released a telegram from Congress Party members in Noakhali, stating that Muslims in the district intend to burn Hindus alive. Gandhi has telegraphed party members to decide whether Hindus should withdraw from the district and telegraphed Suhrawardy, the leader of the Muslim League government in Bengal, urging him to quickly restore order.

### British Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, Auchinleck, Will Remain in His Post

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] Field Marshal Auchinleck, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, recently stated at a gathering of senior military officers that a certain reform plan is about to be implemented, which may greatly reduce the number of the Indian Army, reducing the total to 200,000 men, and the fleet will be supplemented by army units. It is heard that Auchinleck is highly regarded in India, and since it is easy to cause new struggles between the Indian and Muslim factions if an Indian is appointed as commander-in-chief, it is expected that Auchinleck will remain in his original position in India at the request of the Indian government.

### Burma Begins to Organize a 100,000-Strong Revolutionary Army

[Reuters, Rangoon, 7th] Ba Swe, former member of the Burmese Provisional Government and leader of the recently established "Burma for Burmese" movement, stated here today that he has begun to organize a revolutionary army of 100,000 men to fight against British imperialism and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.

### American Bituminous Coal Mines Almost Entirely Shut Down

Lewis's Position is Gradually Strengthening

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] All bituminous coal in the United States has been shut down. Officials also acknowledge that the position of Lewis, president of the Miners' Union, is even stronger than when he called for a miners' strike last November. Lewis is now ordering miners to strike on the grounds that coal mines are unsafe, and the government is unlikely to be able to ask the court to issue an injunction to prohibit the miners' strike.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The US government announced today that 54,000 of the 400,000 bituminous coal miners under the leadership of Lewis, president of the Miners' Union, have disobeyed Lewis's orders and resumed work, but most miners still firmly support Lewis, and the government has in fact no way to deal with the "safety strike."

### Don Juan Issues a Declaration

Not Intending to Give Up the Right of Succession to the Throne

[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 7th] Don Juan, the heir to the Spanish throne, issued a declaration to the people of the country tonight, formally stating that he does not intend to give up his undeniable right to inherit the throne. It stated: "Franco's law of succession to the throne does not take into account the need to establish a firm system in Spain, nor does it take into account the fact that the main reason the world hates Spain is that Franco is the head of Spain. Franco's proposal is only enough to allow him to continue his dictatorship for life under the guise of a monarchy."

### US Telephone Labor Dispute Deadlocked: Union Says it is Prepared for a Long-Term Strike

[United Press, Washington, 8th] After a 45-minute talk between Beirne, president of the National Federation of Telephone Workers, which has already gone on strike, and Warren, director of federal mediation, he told reporters last night that the union is prepared to hold a long-term strike. "There are no new developments in the negotiations to end the strike of 325,000 telephone workers across the country. We have not received any suggestions from the government to resolve the strike."

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The first national telephone strike in American history has cut off 80% of long-distance calls, and many local calls have also been suspended. However, officials said that the mediation of the labor dispute is proceeding smoothly, and the striking workers in Jamestown, New York, have repeatedly received a 91% pay increase and ended the strike first.

### Paraguay's Capital is in a State of Emergency: The Revolutionary Government Issues a Declaration

[Agence France-Presse, Capital of Argentina, 7th] Although the domestic situation in Paraguay is extremely chaotic, according to various sources, the Paraguayan capital is threatened on three sides, and the navy has also rebelled in the port of Alberdi, causing the Paraguayan capital to lose contact with the outside world on the river. Therefore, the government has to fight on two fronts.

[Agence France-Presse, Capital of Argentina, 7th] The Paraguayan Revolutionary Army's radio station recently released a declaration issued by the three-person military government, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The revolutionary government recognizes the United Nations Charter and all agreements signed between Paraguay and other countries; (2) The revolutionary government recognizes international law in wartime, but requires the reactionary government to recognize it as well; (3) The revolutionary government respects all basic laws of Paraguay and respects the freedom and human rights of all political parties; (4) The revolutionary government will hold free elections in the shortest possible time.

### Czech Consul in Paris Committed Suicide by Jumping from a Building

### A Look at the General Election in Japan

...This election is just a contest between parties for political institutions. The Japanese still need long-term re-education before they can implement thorough autonomy according to the wishes of the Allied countries.

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Serious Japanese are holding four major elections this month, and they realize that MacArthur's recent proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible has aroused worldwide attention to the Japanese political situation. Japanese newspapers are calling this Japan's current "major trial." The purpose of this election is to eliminate the old constitution and implement the new constitution that renounces war, which will take effect on May 3. According to Allied observers, this election is largely faithful and without disturbances, proving that this still semi-feudal country is continuing to progress towards democratic politics. But fundamentally, it is just a contest between parties for political institutions. The Japanese still need long-term re-education before they can implement thorough autonomy according to the wishes of the Allied countries.

Four Major Elections This Month

Voting began on April 5, the first being the election of county governors, mayors, and village chiefs, which is an innovation in Japanese history, as local officials were previously appointed. The second is the election of 300 members of the House of Councilors on April 20, which will replace the former House of Peers. Five days later, voters will elect 466 members of the House of Representatives. On April 30, there will also be elections for members of the county, city, and village councils.

The Left and Right Wings Confront Each Other

In various elections, thousands of candidates, including more than 100 women, have applied to have their resumes reviewed. Before they are allowed to participate in the election, they must prove that they did not engage in warmongering during the war. The fundamental issue in all elections is the opposition between the left and right wings, in other words, the opposition between the status quo and socialism or more radical programs. The Social Democratic Party proposes that major industries be immediately nationalized in order to complete socialism. The Communist Party is shouting "the rights of the common people." The major conservative parties do not have clear political programs. Only the Liberal Party (nominally Liberal, but in fact conservative) led by Yoshida, can be expected to win more than 30 seats in the House of Representatives, adding to its existing number of seats, making it 170 seats, which is indeed a majority party, but still far from being an absolute majority party. The Liberal Party's hopes are pinned on the many legacies of the old bureaucratic political institutions and the recent public aversion to labor tactics, which are largely consistent with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The Progressive Party, the second largest conservative party, is expected to lose about the same number of seats as the Liberal Party wins, but it can maintain considerable strength to form a coalition with the Liberal Party and become a majority in the House of Representatives. The Progressive Party has 97 seats. It is said that the Progressive Party has decided to reorganize and change its name in response to the demands of young and active members of the party. Prime Minister Yoshida is a candidate for the House of Representatives for the Liberal Party. The election may give him the opportunity to be re-elected, no matter how the left wing opposes him.

The new constitution specifically stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of parliament. The Socialist Party is expected to win a great victory and jump to become the second largest party. The Communist Party has six existing members of the House of Representatives, and may increase to fifteen. There are also a considerable number of non-partisan people who may be elected, because the general Japanese voters are still looking for the middle ground that the parties have not revealed. Some small parties may lose the election.

The Cost of Campaigning is Considerable

Experts at MacArthur Headquarters frankly admit that local elections will be a major problem, as the old bureaucrats are trying to use voting to maintain their power. There are very few opposition candidates. At the same time, the style of old politics is visible everywhere. The conservative parties are spending hundreds of millions of yen on campaign expenses, and even the Communist Party has spent 10 million yen. Some Japanese speculate that the price of one member of the House of Representatives being elected is 500,000 yen (10,000 yen is equivalent to one US dollar). They also predict that 40 million citizens will vote enthusiastically, but they do not explain the extent of the enthusiasm.

### Strange Fire at Maochang Warehouse This Morning: Doors and Windows Locked, Suspicions of Arson: Evidence of Arson Found in a Fire on Jianguo West Road

[Reported by this newspaper] At 0:20 AM this morning, thick smoke suddenly emerged from the second floor of the Maochang Company's warehouse at 60 Nanxun Road. When passers-by discovered it and sounded the alarm, flames were already rising and black smoke covered the sky. The fire department was contacted and sent vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. As of the time this newspaper went to press, the fire had not yet abated.

The site is the Hongkou office of Maochang Company, which has many warehouses, covering a very wide area. The main entrance is at 229 Huangpu Road, and the fire broke out at the Nanxun Road warehouse, where warehouses are connected to each other. The Nanxun Road warehouse where the fire broke out is a three-story steel-concrete building. The ground floor, part of the second floor, and the entire third floor are used by the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau to store a large number of telecommunications materials. According to employees of the company, the remaining space on the second floor is rented by a Russian, who has stored dried fruits such as raisins and black dates. The day before yesterday, about 100 bags of cotton were also stored. After the storage was properly secured, the doors and windows were locked and closed. There were no employees stationed in the warehouse. After the fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the warehouse, although firefighters arrived at the scene in time, they were unable to enter and extinguish the source of the fire for a while. They only relied on ladders and powerful water seedlings to break through the windows on the second floor and spray them remotely. At about 1:00 AM, the thick black smoke rising from the roof reached a height of tens of feet. The reporter could faintly see the flames rolling east and west inside from the windows. From time to time, there were one or two explosions. It is reported that it was caused by the explosion of the Telecommunications Bureau's foot-long giant vacuum tubes. The amount of loss this time must be huge, and the details are not yet known, but it is known that they are all insured.

The cause of the Maochang Company's fire is very strange. Inquiries have shown that there have been many consecutive major fires in the city recently, and this is another strange fire. The night before last, at about 9:00 PM, a fire also broke out in the alley near 627 Jianguo West Road. Afterwards, a burned-out straw bag filled with the smell of fuel oil was found, indicating that it must have been arson by criminals. The authorities are paying close attention to this. When firefighters were putting out the fire this morning, the police station also dispatched a large number of police officers with light machine guns to impose a strict curfew, and the situation was extremely tense.

### New Legal Tender Shipped from Abroad: One Box Missing During Delivery: Valued at 24 Million Yuan in 1,000 Yuan Denominations

[Reported by this newspaper] The American liner Raphael Semmes, which arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, was represented by Hua Lun Yangxing and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. In addition to thousands of tons of goods shipped from the United States, there were 390 boxes of legal tender. Whenever the National Bank has new banknotes shipped in, it entrusts the Yuanhe Public Customs Brokerage on Sichuan Road to handle customs declaration and delivery procedures. After the above-mentioned banknotes arrived in Shanghai, the brokerage proceeded with customs declaration procedures. The customs declaration was completed on Saturday afternoon, and it was planned to submit them to the National Bank on the ship immediately. However, because the National Bank was closed on Saturday afternoon, no one accepted them, so they were not picked up. When they went to pick them up on Monday, they found that one box was missing, valued at 24 million yuan in 1,000 yuan denominations. It is reported that two overnight workers and several coolies have been detained and are currently under investigation.

### Sewage Treatment Plan: Tea Party Held for Review

In order to comply with the resolution of the 69th Municipal Conference, the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Health Bureau invited the Health Group Committee of the Municipal Council and all councilors who are willing to participate in the discussion on this case to review the matter of the city's sewage disposal being contracted by merchants. Yesterday afternoon, a tea party was held at the Municipal Government Conference Room to conduct an accurate review of the preliminary design of the first phase of the Shanghai sewage treatment plan outline. The contractors for the sewage were instructed that in addition to contracting for the city's daily output of 9,000 boxes of sewage at a fixed price, they must also use 5% of their profits as a reserve fund for composting work. According to this plan, the city government can receive 1 billion yuan per month and completely solve the city's sewage problem. The formal matter of contracting for the sewage will be decided at the next meeting.

### Occupational Group Representatives Return to Shanghai: Yan Yilin Talks About the Petition Process

[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Xiaohua, Wu Xiangxian, Yan Yilin, Ding Jiwan, Chen Cunren, Shi Zhifu, and other 30 representatives of Shanghai's occupational groups went to Beijing by train on the evening of the 6th to petition for an increase in the number of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators. They returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited the representative Yan Yilin to inquire about the petition process. According to the report, the petition of Shanghai's occupational groups this time coincided with the opinions of occupational groups across the country. After the representatives arrived in Beijing, they went to the National Defense Supreme Council to petition, and Zhang Daofan received them. The representatives put forward their opinions and requested that the ratio of the number of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators be increased to 36% (the National Defense Conference passed it as 18.4%). If this is not possible, the minimum should be 33.3%. The number decided by the Legislative Yuan this time is only more than 7%, which is extremely disappointing. Zhang immediately expressed sympathy and promised to convene a National Defense Conference specifically for the request of representatives of occupational groups to increase the number of seats within days, so as to reply after the decision. The representatives then went to the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and other agencies to petition.

According to the petition representatives, if the government still does not accept the request this time, the representatives of the occupational groups will refuse to participate in the National Assembly and serve as legislators.

### The Tongji University Strike Wave Expands: Allegations of Organized Conspiracy in Soldier Assault on Students; Three Demands Presented for Petition to City Government and Police Department Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, at 2 PM, a school bus from Tongji University in this city, originating from the Faculty of Law in the new city district (the faculty's address is adjacent to the Third Battalion, Seventh Company of the Second Transport Regiment, sharing a common entrance through the university's museum), was departing when soldiers, unable to board the bus, initiated a dispute, resulting in injuries to eight students, including Li Boqin. This sparked outrage among the entire student body. Since yesterday, both the Faculty of Law and the Freshman Academy have been protesting through a coordinated strike. The strike wave is steadily growing, and over three thousand students from the university's Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Faculty of Medicine are striking today to show their support. Three demands have been put forward: (1) The stationed troops must immediately withdraw from the university area. (2) The responsible authorities must severely punish the officers and soldiers responsible for this incident. (3) The military authorities must issue a public apology in the newspapers and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

President Dong Urges Resumption of Classes

Yesterday at 2 PM, the Student Union convened an emergency meeting of all representatives at the Faculty of Engineering and invited University President Dong Xifan to report on the negotiations following the incident. He stated that the cause of the incident stemmed from the soldiers' attempt to board the school bus. The school buses are extremely crowded, making it impossible to allow soldiers to ride. Furthermore, the Public Utilities Bureau had repeatedly warned that non-students were strictly prohibited from boarding the school buses. The resulting conflict was regrettable. After the incident, he had visited the Garrison Commander, the Port Commander, and Chief of Staff He, all of whom expressed their deepest apologies and pledged a thorough investigation to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again. He added that the soldiers' troublemaking was undoubtedly wrong and would be dealt with severely after verification. President Dong also stated that since the university had already intervened and achieved considerable progress, he hoped that the students would resume classes from tomorrow to avoid wasting their studies. As for the museum, it originally belonged to the university, and the city government has already returned it for the university's use. The stationed troops should therefore withdraw as soon as possible, and the university is currently negotiating this matter.

Students Refuse to Yield

After President Dong left, representatives from various faculties rose to report on what they had witnessed on the day of the incident and their experiences of being insulted. They unanimously believed that the matter had not been thoroughly resolved and that the promises were merely verbal. This has happened before, and soldiers often failed to comply. Moreover, the current collective assault by soldiers clearly indicated an organized conspiracy. In the past month, similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Student Lin Wei was previously shot and wounded by stationed troops, and Chen Daxin was later run over by a military vehicle. This time, the blatant assault on students from the Faculty of Law was considered intolerable. Unless a thorough resolution is reached, they will not resume classes. The Student Union has scheduled representatives to petition the city government and the Garrison Headquarters this morning. If a satisfactory outcome is not achieved, they will stage a large-scale demonstration and call upon all universities in the city to respond and take united action.

### Labor and Management in the Private Shipping Industry Reach Agreement; Mediation of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Factory Dispute Yields No Result

[Report from Our Newspaper] Labor and management in the private shipping industry have reached an agreement. The key points agreed upon are: (1) Seamen's wages are 320,000 yuan per month for short voyages and 330,000 yuan per month for long voyages, with food expenses to be borne by the labor side. (2) The hatch opening fee will be 75 yuan per ton, effective from April 1st of this year. Wage adjustments will also be implemented from April 1st.

A woolen dyeing and weaving factory at No. 31, Lane 98, Xujiahui Road, Yude Road, due to poor business and inability to weave on its own, has decided to provide commissioned weaving services as a means of covering expenses. Ninety-four employees expressed their willingness to support this, while forty-four opposed it. The factory has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to dismiss the forty-four uncooperative employees.

Employees of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Factory have presented ten demands to the management, the main ones being: (1) Employees who have reached the age of sixty should be allowed to retire and receive retirement pay equivalent to one month's salary for each year of service. (2) Piecework should be based on a seven-hour workday. If there is no work and the workday is less than seven hours, the management should provide a subsidy of one jiao per hour based on the basic salary. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation, but no agreement was reached.

### Paying Respects at the Battlefield: Luo Zhuoying Visits Luodian

Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, visited Luodian yesterday morning to pay respects at the anti-Japanese battlefield and survey the site for a memorial park for fallen soldiers.

### Major Industrial Project: Building Seven Factories to Produce Rayon, US Experts in Shanghai to Discuss Technical Assistance Agreement

[Report from Our Newspaper] In an exquisitely decorated room at the Cathay Hotel, a reporter had a long conversation with a representative from an American rayon company lasting over an hour. From this conversation, it was learned that the rayon industry may soon be established in China. The visitor, Ralph Coe, Secretary of the American Osgoe Koe Company (pictured), has been in China for nearly ten days with the mission of negotiating with a major industrialist in China, hoping to sign a factory construction contract in the near future.

According to Coe, there are plans to build as many as seven rayon (the new term for artificial silk) factories in China. These will include three categories: (1) three 5-ton rayon factories, (2) one 5-ton and one 10-ton staple fiber factory each, and (3) two 1-ton cellophane factories. The factories will be located within approximately 200 miles of Shanghai. The exact location will depend on the quality and quantity of the water source. The amount of capital involved is substantial. According to the expert's estimate, the total capital required for a 5-ton factory is as high as 10 million US dollars. The total number is enormous, as can be seen from this figure. However, Mr. Coe emphasized that the capital is entirely borne by Chinese investors. His company in the United States will only provide comprehensive technical assistance. This system is called the Single Contract System, which includes five tasks: (1) selecting the factory site, (2) delivering the necessary machinery, (3) constructing all the required components, (4) selecting all the technicians needed for the factory to be trained at Coe's company in the United States, (5) dispatching experts from Coe's company to China to provide guidance until all seven factories are successfully operational and manufacturing. As of yesterday, the terms of the contract were still under negotiation, but two items are practically resolved. He believes that the contract can be signed smoothly when he leaves China on the 25th of this month. After signing, the company can guarantee in writing that the factory will officially start production within 18 months. Coe declined to identify who he was negotiating with, only saying that three people had visited the United States for negotiations in the past, and the Chinese Embassy in the United States had also facilitated this in many ways.

He repeatedly pointed out that running this kind of industry in China is very profitable. In the United States, it costs only 65 cents US dollars per pound to manufacture rayon, but it sells for 3.50 US dollars in the Chinese market. The demand for Chinese rayon, before the war, had imports of 35 tons per month, not including smuggling, The accurate estimated need is 75 tons a day. Judging from China's area and population, the future of the rayon industry is unlimited. The difficulty of establishing a rayon factory is the large amount of capital needed, but this industry has a wide range of uses and may surpass the textile industry in the future.

The Osgoe Koe Company is the largest rayon enterprise in the United States, founded in 1909 by Osgoe Koe, who is the father of this visitor. This company owns 64 rayon factories, only five of which are in the United States, with the remainder overseas, mostly in Japan. The rest are distributed in South America and Europe, and recently have developed into Africa. Because of the wide distribution of its business, the company suffered considerable losses in this war. After the war, with the "Faustian" spirit of Americans in industry, they are developing to every corner of the world, and after Egypt and India, they have now found China.

### Suspects in Seymour Road Fire Case: Four Firefighters Interrogated Yesterday; Defendants Deny Looting During Fire; Sentencing Set for the 15th; Shenqing Bail Denied

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying, four firefighters who were derelict in their duties during the Seymour Road fire, are suspected of entering the residence of victim number 27 while the fire was still smoldering and stealing towels, handkerchiefs, cotton undershirts, and other items. Prosecutor Shen Zushou of the District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against them on charges of banditry. The other nineteen individuals, including team leaders Huang Baoqi, Li Xun, and Zhu Qinglan, are being prosecuted in a separate case on charges of public endangerment and theft. At 10 AM yesterday morning, Judge Mei Erhe of the Eighth Criminal Division of the District Court interrogated the four defendants charged with banditry. After the debate concluded, sentencing was scheduled for the 15th of this month. The nineteen defendants facing charges of public endangerment and theft are scheduled to be tried on the 15th.

After Judge Mei called the roll, he conducted separate interrogations. According to Shang Zhikui's testimony: He is the police chief of the Yichang Road Fire Brigade. On the evening of January 22nd of this year, a coppersmith's workshop at 452 Wuding Road caught fire, spreading to the entire Lane 660. He, the defendant, was ordered to lead his subordinates Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying to the fire scene to extinguish the flames. At that time, because there were still smoldering embers at number 27, he ordered Cai Zhiying to go upstairs to put out the fire, and Dai and Li also went upstairs to assist. Later, Cai left first. Shang testified that he has been a firefighter for twenty-one years and has never engaged in any misconduct. The allegations of stealing property are completely false. The three defendants, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying, also denied looting during the fire, claiming that the victims, after suffering from the disaster, had nowhere to vent their grievances and therefore fabricated false accusations. The court then summoned witness Zhou Qifang (nephew of Zhou Xiuzhen, the owner of house number 27), who testified that at around 8 AM on the 23rd, while the embers were still smoldering, he was concerned about his home and managed to borrow a ladder to climb in through the window to check. He saw the four firefighters rummaging through boxes and cabinets, looting property. They made no attempt to hide their actions and even ordered him to open boxes for them to search. He identified Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, and Dai Guangrong in court as the ones who were looting at the time. He was less certain about whether Cai Zhiying was also present. After the interrogation was completed, the court announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Shen Zushou stood up to argue, requesting that the court severely punish the four defendants for banditry. The defendants' defense lawyer argued that taking items like towels and handkerchiefs was for wiping up water stains and could not be considered stealing property. It was impossible for the four firefighters to give irresistible threats for Zhou Qifang on the top floor, so it was not enough to constitute banditry. He also applied for bail, which was rejected by the court.

### The Ministry of Justice Specifies Precautions for Handling Cases Involving Accused Civil Servants

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court recently received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding precautions to be taken by judicial authorities when handling cases involving accused civil servants. The regulations are very detailed, and the main points are summarized as follows: (1) People who accuse or report civil servants are legally responsible, and the prosecutor should conduct a preliminary investigation and sincerely explain this. (2) When the prosecutor conducts an investigation, he should pay attention to both favorable and unfavorable circumstances for the defendant. Unless necessary, the defendant should not be summoned for questioning in advance. (3) For cases where the most severe punishment is detention or a fine, the court or prosecutor should allow the defendant to appoint an agent to appear on their behalf, unless there is a necessary situation. (4) In cases where a civil servant is the defendant, the court or prosecutor should not notify the relevant superior officer when summoning or detaining the defendant, unless it is deemed necessary. However, if the defendant is a current military personnel or military dependent, the relevant superior officer should be notified of the detention warrant to assist in its execution. (5) After the court or prosecutor detains or arrests a civil servant, they should notify the relevant superior officer and pay attention to the defendant's physical health and reputation. (6) The court may question the plaintiff and collect or investigate evidence in a non-public manner before the first trial date. If it is discovered that the case is a civil matter or is using the private prosecution procedure to intimidate the defendant, the court may advise the plaintiff to withdraw the prosecution. If the court believes that there is insufficient evidence or no crime was committed, it may reject the prosecution. (7) The defendant should be questioned with a sincere attitude and not through violence, coercion, bribery, deception, or other improper methods. After the defendant has been questioned, the court or prosecutor should not detain them unless it is deemed necessary under the circumstances specified in Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (8) If the defendant has legal grounds for detention but detention is not necessary, the court or prosecutor may directly order bail, bail with guarantee, or restricted residence. (9) In cases where a detention fine should be imposed or where a verdict of pardon or acquittal should be made, the court may render a judgment in absentia without waiting for the defendant's statement if the defendant has been legally summoned and fails to appear in court without justifiable reason. (10) If the court or prosecutor knows of any possible false accusation when handling cases involving accused civil servants, they should immediately report it. (11) The outcome of the trial may be notified to the relevant superior officer, depending on the circumstances.

### Dispute Over Right of Way on CaoBao Road: City Council Mediation Yields No Result

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the dispute over the right of way on CaoBao Road, the City Council convened a meeting yesterday at 3 PM, bringing together the responsible parties from both sides, along with several councilors and representatives from the Public Utilities Bureau, to review the points of contention. The meeting concluded without a final decision, as both sides maintained their positions. According to the report from Gao Liansun, the representative of the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Company: (1) The company was established in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], and the road construction subsidy totaled 65,000 yuan, payable in three installments. The first two installments were already paid in full, and the third installment was due on August 14th of the 26th year, but was suspended due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, and was only paid this year with an additional 20 million+ yuan. (2) The inability to open the road to traffic immediately is due to the lack of a traffic permit. (3) The company has not received an order to open the road to traffic by a certain deadline and cannot be held responsible. (4) The Transportation Committee proceeded to open the road to traffic without the permission of the Public Utilities Bureau, which seems inappropriate. (5) The company hopes for formal mediation.

From the Transportation Committee side, Chai Zifei provided the following explanation: (1) The Shanghai-Minhang Company's contract is incomplete. (2) The CaoBao Road land price has not been finalized, and the road rights cannot be determined. (3) The local intention is to use the traffic surplus for local public welfare. (4) The local side does not deny the Shanghai-Minhang Company's past losses. Subsequently, Zhang Rentao, the Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, expressed his views: (1) The traffic permit was not issued because the company's subsidy had not been fully paid. (2) The supplementary subsidy of 20 million+ yuan is provisionally collected because the multiple has not been confirmed by the central government. (3) Regarding the payment of the land price, the municipal government had no clear regulations in the 26th year.

### ### Reader Consultation: Legal Inquiries

Yin Bingsan asks: I am a businessman. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], due to financial difficulties, I mortgaged 2,060 shi of wheat to the Bao Ying Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank for 13,400 yuan, with a one-month term. Later, due to the extraordinary times, I was unable to repay on time. To maintain my credit, I added 355 dan of wheat and 750 yuan (with a receipt). The following spring, the bank transported all the mortgaged goods of all customers. Now the bank has resumed operations in Bao Ying. Can I, according to legal procedures and banking regulations, settle this matter with the bank?

[Attorney Mi Xitong answers:] You should study the clauses and regulations stated in the mortgage agreement with the Farmers Bank at the time of the mortgage.

### Delayed Marriage Arrangement

Tang Dihua asks: My girlfriend, Miss Jia, got engaged to Mr. Yi at the age of eighteen. Mr. Yi is suspicious and fears that Miss Jia is having an affair, so he often tests her. Later, the War of Resistance broke out, and Mr. Yi disappeared. After the victory, Mr. Yi sent a letter to Miss Jia, but after Miss Jia replied, he disappeared again. Now I have several questions to ask: (1) Jia and Yi have been engaged for ten years. The woman's youth is fading due to adherence to the marriage agreement, but Mr. Yi continues to delay. What procedures should be followed to terminate the engagement? (2) If the woman proposes to terminate the engagement, should she be liable for compensation to Mr. Yi? (3) If the woman cannot give a written notice, is it effective to publish a notice of termination of the engagement in the newspaper? (4) If the woman legally terminates the engagement, what legal methods can be used to deal with Mr. Yi if he deliberately harasses her?

[Attorney Mi Xitong answers:] (1) You should ask a lawyer to legally terminate it. (2) The party without fault can request compensation from the party at fault for the damages suffered as a result. This is the provision of Article 977 of the Civil Code. (3) There is no regulation that legally publishing a notice in the newspaper is effective. It is best to publish it in three local newspapers. (4) If the termination is legal, Mr. Yi must not deliberately harass her, otherwise, Mr. Yi will violate criminal law.

### National Mongolian-Tibetan College to be Reorganized and Established in the Short Term

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The Ministry of Education plans to convert the National Beiping Mongolian-Tibetan School into a National Mongolian-Tibetan College, and has made a record of it today. However, this plan can only be realized after the Mongolian-Tibetan School is thoroughly enriched and reorganized. It is learned that the Mongolian-Tibetan School was founded in the second year of the Republic [1913]. At the beginning of the victory, it was taken over by the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission. Recently, it was ordered by the Executive Yuan to be transferred to the Ministry of Education, and Chen Kefu was appointed as the principal. Mr. Chen has already come to Beiping to take office. Currently, the school is of a secondary school nature, with six junior and senior high school classes, and a preliminary class is set up for students from Mongolia and Tibet who come to Beiping for the first time. There are 333 students in total, including 215 Mongolian students, 18 Tibetan students, and 100 Han students. Girls account for less than two-tenths of the entire school, a total of 60 people, including 35 Mongolian students, 2 Tibetan students, and the rest are Han students. Most of the Mongolian and Tibetan children are sent by Mongolian and Tibetan nobles. Among them, three Tibetan students are from Lhasa, sent by the office in Tibet from afar. The Han students are children of border affairs personnel, or those who aspire to the border areas. The curriculum, in addition to Mongolian, Tibetan, and Mongolian-Tibetan history and geography, is no different from ordinary secondary schools. However, in order to accommodate border youths, the standards are slightly lower. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the number of Mongolian and Tibetan students receiving public funding is 100. Recently, many students from the border areas have sought education, reaching 230 people, so there is quite a problem of too many monks and too little porridge. In order to provide border youths with advanced study opportunities and cultivate border cadres, the Ministry of Education plans to convert the school into a Mongolian-Tibetan College with a specialized nature in the short term.

### Jiaotong University Anniversary Celebrated Grandly Yesterday: Naming of Gongchuo Hall and Key Presentation of Zhesheng Hall

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 51st anniversary of the founding of National Jiaotong University. The entire faculty and students held a grand anniversary celebration ceremony in the Wen Zhi Hall of the university in Xujiahui, this city, at 9 AM.

Wu Baofeng Delivers Speech

The ceremony began with a speech by President Wu Baofeng, who stated that the 51-year history of Jiaotong University is closely related to the history of modern China. Celebrating the anniversary should give credit to the founder Sheng Xuanhuai. Jiaotong University has always focused on science, engineering, and technology, and students are not interested in politics. In the future, it should be more practical and cultivate a diligent and simple spirit. President Wu especially put forward the school motto: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt, power and force cannot subdue, poverty and lowliness cannot move," as the traditional spirit of Jiaotong University for 50 years, hoping to maintain it forever.

Dong Xifan Delivers Speech

Then, Dong Xifan of the Ministry of Education delivered a speech, stating that the progress of Jiaotong University over the years is organic and is in constant growth. The development of Jiaotong University over the past 50 years can represent the development of China, and the progress of Jiaotong University is a symbol of the progress of China.

Ling Hongxun Delivers Speech

Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, delivered a speech, saying that both the Ministry of Communications and Jiaotong University have a long history and hope to cooperate closely in the future. He also said that the most important thing after the great war is reconstruction, and the revival of transportation is undoubtedly above all else. He hopes that Jiaotong University will meet the needs of the trend and serve as the vanguard of transportation industry thinking!

Zhang Jia'ao Delivers Speech

Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, praised that among the universities in the country that can be integrated with national undertakings, only Jiaotong University! After a long period of resistance and fire, the four characters "Jiaotong University" can still stand alone, which symbolizes that China will eventually live forever. During my reception of the Northeast, I deeply felt the lack of talent. I hope that the students of Jiaotong University will serve the society with the spirit of one person resisting three!

Wu Guozhen Delivers Speech

Mayor Wu Guozhen also delivered a speech, stating that today, celebrating the 51st anniversary of Jiaotong University, recalling the dark history of China in the early years of the school, we must bitterly scold the previous generation for their unfinished responsibilities. Knowing the mistakes of the previous generation and working hard ourselves, then China can still be saved. What we fear is that our generation will be scolded by you in the future, and even you will let the next generation scold, then China will never have hope. Why is the country getting worse and worse? - Because there is no stability. Years of war and chaos make it impossible to talk about progress. Therefore, if young people want to make progress, they must first seek national stability. I hope that the students of Jiaotong University will inherit its traditional spirit and work hard in their own positions, enriching their own knowledge through research, and becoming the starting point for the construction and development of China tomorrow.

Zhao Zengjue Delivers Speech

### Random Notes on the Basketball Court

The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament opened last night. The US Navy Columbia and the All-Stars faced the Hua team Green Forest and Peer. The Municipal Gymnasium was only 40-50% full.

The All-Stars' game against Peer revealed their true strength for the first time. Although they are only a mid-level team, they excel in quick movements and seamless teamwork, but their shooting is not accurate. Only Luo Kasi is somewhat satisfactory. Their defense is also not tight. Their four-point victory over Peer was entirely due to their dominance under the basket.

Green Forest is the runner-up of Group A2 in this year's Basketball League. Columbia has received good reviews in several friendly matches against the Oil Team, Hualian, and Renyu. They are a team whose defense is better than their offense. Only center Ash is agile and a good shooter. Last night, Green Forest failed to stop Ash's activity in the first half, falling behind by five points.

At the beginning of the second half, Green Forest switched to an offensive strategy, but their fast passes and attacks were ineffective. They then switched to a slow attack, seeking opportunities to find openings and shooting near the basket, gradually narrowing the gap to a score of 26-20. However, due to the disparity in height, Green Forest had good coordination in reaching out and intercepting the ball during their offense, but when the ball was under their own basket, Columbia won it eight or nine times out of ten. Green Forest's Shu Jiayi performed well. The whole team tried their best, but the lack of experience and psychological factors had a negative impact when stepping onto the big stage for the first time. (Changnian)

### Minister Yu of Finance Hosts Press Conference; Elucidates Fiscal and Financial Issues; Strives for Popularization in Selling US Dollar Bonds, Absolutely No Apportionment; Relevant Parties Will Surely Curb Rising Prices in Shanghai

[Our Reporter] Minister Yu of Finance hosted a press conference for the local press at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Minister of Finance's office in the Jianghai Customs Building on the Bund. He provided extensive answers to various financial and economic questions raised. The main points are summarized as follows:

(1) Regarding US dollar bonds: (A) Regarding the promotion of the new bond sales, he believes that the purpose of this bond issuance is to absorb idle funds, so the issuance should strive for popularity and openness, penetrating into various regions and levels of society. In particular, the premise of free subscription must be strictly adhered to, and no apportionment will be imposed. (B) The government's issuance of bonds in US dollars is not a new creation; there is precedent for this. The purpose is simply to bring back legal currency, stabilize finance, and balance prices, with no other intention. (C) Because of various conditions, the bonds issued this time are extremely unusual. The fund guarantee is also extremely strong, and the powers of the Fund Supervisory Committee are independent. For example, the foreign exchange fund guaranteeing US dollar bonds must be allocated to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping six months before the US dollar bonds mature for repayment. In addition, if state-owned enterprises guaranteeing short-term treasury bills are sold, the proceeds from the sale must be transferred to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping. Therefore, the creditworthiness is solid, and it is believed that the promotion will be smooth. (D) The bonds will be sold in installments on a monthly average basis, and there is no intention to achieve results overnight. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the fact that the total amount of savings deposits in banks and firms nationwide is only several hundred billion yuan, and how it will be able to underwrite such a large amount of bonds. (E) Regarding the use of the bonds, the government is willing to consider anything that can help the government achieve the purpose of issuing public bonds. (F) The bonds will be considered for listing after the official bonds are printed.

The Government Will Surely Maintain Creditworthiness

(2) Regarding the handling of old debts, he believes that the government can effectively fulfill its obligations to repay various old debts issued before and during the war, without delay. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the same now and in the future. The government's bond measures always aim to take into account the interests of the state and the people, in order to maintain creditworthiness.

(3) Regarding the repayment of bank deposits from before the war, he said that this matter is currently being carefully studied by the Supreme National Defense Council. This matter must take into account the rights and interests of both creditors and debtors, so it must be considered carefully. Once the method is approved, it will be announced immediately.

Rectify the Tax System and Balance Revenue and Expenditure

(4) Regarding the opening of new tax sources and the levying of special business tax, he said that the Ministry of Finance is currently promoting tax administration, focusing on adjusting the tax system, simplifying institutions, and rectifying the conduct of tax officials. Therefore, rather than calling it opening up new tax sources, it is better to call it reorganizing old taxes and levies. As for the Special Business Tax Regulations, they have been drafted and are awaiting the completion of the legislative process before being implemented.

(5) Regarding this year's government revenue and expenditure budget, which is slightly larger than in previous years, he believes that since the implementation of the new Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the government has been reorganizing tax revenue on the one hand and actively cutting expenditures on the other. All unnecessary expenditures have been temporarily suspended. On the revenue side, as a result of the reorganization of the tax system, based on the tax revenue situation in the past few months, this year's tax revenue will definitely be greater than expected. At the same time, the government will also use material policies to sell surplus materials at home and abroad, and speed up the disposal of enemy and puppet industries, distribute state-owned production enterprises to private ownership, issue new bonds, and receive compensation from Japan, all of which are huge sources of income for the government. Therefore, with the cooperation of various financial and economic policies, the government's revenue and expenditure will gradually achieve balance.

(6) He declined to comment on the US $500 million in new loans from the United States, as it was not yet time to disclose any opinions.

(7) The recent rise in the prices of rice, cooking oil, and cloth is being closely monitored by relevant parties, and effective measures will be taken to curb it.

Maintain the Direction and Overcome Difficulties

(8) Regarding how the government will maintain a balance of revenue and expenditure while the domestic war continues, he said that while the government continues to strive for peace, it will further seek various methods in economic policies, based on recent central decisions, to stabilize the economy and finance. Our country has suffered frequent wars and overcome countless difficulties. We hope that we can endure this once again, adhere to our beliefs, maintain our direction, and then the difficulties will not be difficult to overcome.

(9) Any government, when implementing foreign exchange management policies, will inevitably also manage import trade. However, the government will provide as much foreign exchange as possible for essential industrial inputs. The government currently has sufficient foreign exchange funds to supply the foreign exchange needed for essential imports.

Manage Securities Trading to Promote Development

(10) Regarding whether overdue bonds will be repaid at double the value, he said that the government has not yet made a decision on this matter. (11) Regarding the business of the securities exchange, he believes that it should be strictly managed on the one hand, and it needs to be developed smoothly within the legal scope on the other hand. (12) After the establishment of the National Bank's discount committee, there are concerns that banks and firms may not be able to obtain equal benefits due to the different sizes of their capital and business scope. He said that this is a matter for the banks and firms themselves, and the authorities cannot mediate. The authorities' discount guidelines for the banks and firms do not differentiate between large and small banks.

### US Dollar Bond Fund Supervisory Committee Established; Li Fusun Elected Chairman

[Our Reporter] The inaugural meeting of the Fund Supervisory Committee for the 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds was held at noon yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. Minister Yu of Finance personally attended and presided over the meeting. Committee members present included Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Bingzhang, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Li Fusun, Ouyang Lun, Shen Rixin, Xu Yongzuo, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, Li Guangqian (represented by Chen Weilong), Zai Kangpei, and Yang Mianzhong. Minister Yu first gave a speech, stating: "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Fund Supervisory Committee for the 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds. The government is establishing this committee to demonstrate its great credibility. The powers of the supervisory committee are particularly important. According to the organizational rules, the Fund Supervisory Committee has the right to independently exercise its powers within the scope of supervision. And before all the interest is paid off, its supervisory powers cannot be changed. Therefore, the supervisory committee has been granted special powers by the government to consolidate government creditworthiness and protect the rights and interests of bondholders. The supervisory committee, in handling the fund and exercising its powers, I believe will be able to be absolutely open and practical, and truly meet the expectations of the government and the people."

Next, President Zhang of the National Bank gave a speech, stating: "The government's issuance of bonds this time is truly a major touchstone. This can test whether the people have faith in national bonds. The National Bank will manage the bond fund in accordance with the regulations of the Fund Supervisory Committee."

Then, Li Fusun gave a speech, stating: "In recent years, the people have eagerly hoped to cooperate with the government. Now the government is issuing new bonds, indicating its determination to start anew with the people. Since it has been stipulated that certain assets and foreign exchange funds will be used as collateral for the bonds, it is hoped that a detailed list of the collateral will be sent to the Fund Supervisory Committee for record."

Finally, Li Fusun, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, and Chen Bingzhang were elected as standing committee members of the Fund Supervisory Committee, and Li Fusun was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m. After the meeting, Minister Yu and President Zhang jointly hosted a banquet for all members of the Fund Supervisory Committee and the Sales Committee at the Cathay Hotel, which ended happily around 2 p.m.

[Another Report] The Standing Committee of the Fund Supervisory Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at the National Bank at 4 p.m. today. At that time, the organizational rules of the Fund Supervisory Committee and detailed rules of procedure will be discussed.

### Price Evaluation Council; Oil, Sugar, and Other Groups Hold Meetings; Collect Opinions for Reference by the General Assembly

[Our Reporter] Various prices have fluctuated again this week. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau decided to convene the Price Evaluation Council general meeting earlier on the 10th. Yesterday, the council's cooking oil, rice, and sugar groups held separate meetings to exchange opinions, in order to provide reference for price negotiations at the general meeting.

Cooking Oil

The group, attended by Zhang Chao and others, was chaired by Section Chief Ji. It was decided to provide the general meeting with actual costs, including: (1) Soybean oil: Private oil mills, based on a soybean price of 98,000 yuan, have a cost of 435,000 yuan. Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on a soybean price of 91,000 yuan, has a cost of 393,500 yuan. (2) Sesame oil: Private oil mills, based on the Shanghai sesame market price, have a cost of 411,000 yuan. Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on the wholesale price in the production area, has a cost of 383,300 yuan. (3) Peanut oil: Private oil mills, based on the Shanghai peanut market price, have a cost of 465,000 yuan. Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on the Qingdao peanut wholesale price, has a cost of 384,500 yuan. Section Chief Ji also instructed the manufacturers to collect all relevant evidence and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau before 12 p.m. today for compilation and provision to the general meeting. All manufacturers hope that the price negotiation will be flexible and not rigidly stipulated.

Rice

The group was also chaired by Section Chief Ji. Attending rice merchants reported market prices in the production areas and exchanged opinions. It was decided to collect data and calculate costs to provide the general meeting as a price negotiation standard.

Sugar

The group was chaired by Section Chief Shao. Sugar merchants and South Goods businesses present all hoped that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation could increase the supply quantity without interruption. Regarding prices, because the price of local sugar in other cities is higher than that in Shanghai, the impact is that incoming goods are scarce. Moreover, exports have now expanded to Lanzhou, Northeast China, and other places, while the Shanghai price decision was made between September and October last year and has not been changed since then. Given the current situation, it may be appropriate to make adjustments, which will be decided at the general meeting on the 10th.

### National Economic Commission Discusses Price Issues in Beijing and Shanghai

[Our Reporter, Nanjing, 8th] The Price Committee of the National Economic Commission is scheduled to convene on the 10th to discuss the recent soaring prices in Beijing and Shanghai. Governor Zhang Jia'ao of the National Bank and Mayor Wu Guozhen, both committee members, have been invited to Beijing to attend.

### Slight Fluctuations in National Bonds

The bond market was even more mediocre yesterday, with many small transactions in between. National Bond C opened at 11,700 yuan, with a high of no more than 12,200 yuan and a low of 11,500 yuan. As a result, A, B, and D all fell by 200 yuan compared to the previous close, while C rose by 500 yuan, and E also rose by 200 yuan. About 4 million yuan worth of transactions were completed.

### Three Types of Public Bonds Drawn for Principal Repayment

The drawing for the repayment of principal for the 25th Year National Public Bond C, the 27th Year National Defense Public Bond, and the 30th Year Construction Public Bond Phase III, issued by the Ministry of Finance, is scheduled to be held at 9 a.m. on April 10th at the Central Trust Bureau, 4th floor, 74 Renji Road.

### Xinguang Shareholders' Meeting Approves 8 Bonus Shares for Each Old Share

Xinguang Underwear Company held a shareholders' meeting yesterday. More than 500 shareholder representatives attended. Mr. Fu Liangjun, chairman of the company, presided over the meeting, reported on the business situation and the account summary for the 35th year. The capital increase plan was immediately discussed. The company's original capital of 210 million yuan will be increased to 3.8 billion yuan. The method is that in addition to each old share being able to subscribe for 6 shares in cash, the factory invested 300 million yuan and the Jianye Banking Group invested 2.33 billion yuan in a joint venture to invest in the Xinda Weaving Factory. The shareholders' meeting approved the full acquisition of the factory, that is, the Jianye Banking Group's investment amount will be added to the company as shares. After the capital increase, 650 million yuan of new shares will be allocated as the value of the acquisition of the Xinda Factory. The remaining 1.68 billion yuan will be distributed equally to the company's old shareholders, with each old share receiving 8 bonus shares.

### Increased Buying Interest from Northern Traders; Chinese Stocks Continue to Improve

Yesterday, the buying interest from young traders of the Northern faction and others increased. Yong yarn continued to improve. After most of the profit-taking bulls exited Meiya, it appeared relaxed, and as the settlement date approached, there were frequent small transactions in between. Except for Yong yarn deliberately being lowered in the morning, all others were higher. Near noon, selling from numbers 218, 213, 145, 231, 89, and 4 caused a fallback to 2,800 yuan and change. Before closing, the steady support from numbers 198 and 155 maintained stability. Bids after closing continued to rise. As a result, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya and Xinhua fell by less than half a percentage point, Qinheng and Xinguang were flat, and Zhongfa rose by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. In deferred delivery, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, and Huafeng was flat. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi, Datong, and Cement rose by half a percentage point, and the remaining ones had mixed fortunes.

In the afternoon, numbers 235, 198, 97, 185, 179, and 95 were successively sold. After the opening of deferred Yong yarn, it gradually decreased to below 2,760 yuan. Numbers 61, 117, and 223 took advantage of the low to maintain support, enabling it to stabilize. Then, due to the frequent activity of number 152, there were occasional inversions of spot and deferred prices, gradually becoming stable. Later, numbers 35, 94, 99, 226, 89, 4, 198, and 152 jointly absorbed, gradually pushing it up to 2,870 yuan. Xinhe and Meiya also rebounded. Numbers 97, 85, and 77 sold at high prices, causing a slight decline. As a result, Qinheng was flat compared to the previous close, Meiya, Xinguang, and Xinhua fell slightly, Yong yarn, Huafeng, and Xinhe rose slightly, and Zhongfa rose by slightly less than 10%. In deferred delivery, Yong yarn and Xinhe rose slightly, Meiya and Xinguang fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and among the cold stocks, Yonggong rose by 10%, Cement, Tongyi, and Datong each rose by half a percentage point, Rongfeng Matches fell slightly, Guohuo Xinya was still flat, and the remaining ones rose slightly. The prices of various stocks outside the market continued to rise.

### Bond Sales Proceed Smoothly; Exceeds US$10 Million; President Zhang Hires Experts to Form Design Committee

[Our Reporter] According to reports from those in charge of various agencies involved in the sale of 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds, the total amount has reached US$12.2 million as of yesterday. Among them, public bonds account for US$5.7 million and treasury bills account for US$6.3 million. In addition, various agencies have sold several thousand US dollars through retail sales, and sporadic sales by various commercial banks are also not small. It is understood that among those who subscribed from the National Bank, China and Communications Bank each subscribed for US$3 million, Agricultural Bank subscribed for US$2 million, and China Trust Bureau subscribed for US$1 million. Among commercial banks, Zhejiang Industrial Bank subscribed for US$1 million and Shanghai Bank subscribed for US$1 million.

The Shanghai Sales Committee has not yet completed its internal organization due to time constraints. It is reported that it has been decided to establish four groups under the Secretary-General: General Affairs, Sales, Statistics, and Propaganda. The General Affairs and Propaganda groups will begin operations today.

No Public Auction During Promotion Period

[Another Report] In order to promote bond sales, the Central Bank hired 19 experts yesterday to form a design committee. Vice President Chen Jian'an was appointed as the convener. Diao Minren from the Joint Treasury, Wang Zishuang, Li Tisheng, Chen Yanzuo, Gao Fang, and Wu Zhitou from the Central Bank, Xu Guangchi, Cai Gongchun, Pan Jiufen, Shi Jiujing, and Lin Xuru from the Bank of China, Li Daonan, Zhuang Shuhou, and Zhu Tongjiu from the Communications Bank, Li Renzai from the Farmers Bank, Wang Botian and Zhou Jiyao from the China Trust Bureau, and Gu Chunfan from the Postal Savings Bureau were appointed as committee members. The first meeting was held at 10 a.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank. Vice President Chen chaired the meeting and discussed the following three points: (1) strengthening bond sales, (2) target audience for sales, and (3) sales techniques. The meeting adjourned at 12 p.m. Someone raised the question of whether the bonds should be auctioned on the exchange. After repeated discussions, it was concluded that since the bond sales were proceeding smoothly, there was no need to open an auction. Moreover, at the beginning of the issuance, the people may not fully understand the benefits of the bonds, and it is not appropriate to open an auction at this time. After deliberation, it was decided to postpone the auction.

Preparation for Using Bonds as Reserve

It is understood that the Central Bank has agreed to the request of commercial banks in Shanghai to use bonds to pay up to 50% of their deposit reserve requirements with the National Bank, as stipulated in the US Dollar Bond Regulations that bonds can be used for guarantee reserves.

### Regarding Daily Price Fluctuations, Commander Xuan Issues Statement: Rising Prices Impact Security, Garrison Command to Take Action

Our Central News Agency reporter, noting the significant impact of price fluctuations on people's livelihoods and public security, made a special visit yesterday afternoon to Commander Xuan Tiewu of the Garrison Command to inquire about his views and whether measures would be taken to stabilize prices. Commander Xuan stated: Since the Economic Supervisory Group concluded its work, economic investigation efforts have continued secretly, primarily focusing on investigation and not directly addressing price issues. However, considering the recent situation, if rising prices affect the stability of public security, the Garrison Command will directly intervene. In addition to already ordering personnel from the "Economic Investigation Network" in various locations to investigate and prosecute those with evidence of speculation and manipulation, Commander Xuan also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday, hoping to persuade various industries not to raise prices arbitrarily and to immediately level out the prices that have been raised in recent days. The original letter stated:

Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urging No Price Hikes

"It has been observed that prices in our city have been fluctuating again in recent days, and since yesterday, there has been a general upward trend. This not only poses a significant threat to ordinary people, but also places unbearable pressure on the livelihoods of military and police personnel. The repercussions will lead to those responsible for maintaining public security being unable to sustain their duties. The detrimental consequences caused by a few speculative merchants will be unimaginable. Witnessing this crisis, this Command cannot bear to see the security of Songhu undermined by speculative merchants. Therefore, this letter urges your esteemed Chamber to instruct all industries not to arbitrarily raise prices under the pretext of supply and demand. The prices that have been raised in recent days should be immediately leveled out to appease the public and reassure the community. We earnestly hope for your cooperation."

Speculative Mentality Resurfaces

After receiving Commander Xuan's letter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to various trade associations on the same day, instructing all members to strictly comply and warning them "not to act rashly or test the law." According to Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the main reason for the recent price fluctuations is the resurgence of speculative mentality, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. The government is soon to issue US dollar bonds, and those with floating capital can certainly invest in purchasing these bonds, which would benefit both the country and themselves. To hoard goods as a means of making profit, only to face severe legal sanctions, is unwise. He predicts that after the release of Commander Xuan's letter, prices may return to stability within a day or two.

Zheng Jiemin Stays in Shanghai to Monitor

General Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the National Defense Ministry, came to Shanghai on official business last week and was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night. However, due to the rising price trends in the city, he temporarily halted his departure and decided to stay in Shanghai to find ways to stabilize prices. General Zheng has already issued orders to the economic investigation network yesterday, intensifying their monitoring of the market. He has declared that any unscrupulous merchants found manipulating prices or monopolizing the market will be severely punished. The supply of rice has decreased, and rice merchants, constrained by price limits, are not selling goods, creating a rather serious situation. The economic inspection authorities are closely monitoring this situation. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Economic Section of the police received a confidential report from Commander Xuan regarding the hoarding of rice and ordered an immediate investigation. Chief Xu immediately dispatched officers to investigate 5011 Fuyou Road, based on the confidential report, where a large quantity of rice was suspected to be hidden. The investigation confirmed the presence of over 120 bags of rice. However, the wife of Ren Zuoqing, the owner of the premises, evaded responsibility, denying ownership of the goods. Police officers further learned that Ren Zuoqing frequently visited Yixing Company at No. 1 Tongde Lane. After a discreet investigation at that address, Ren Zuoqing was located. According to Ren, the rice did not belong to him but was stored there by his friend Zhang Zhuming. Zhang Zhuming, who resides at No. 14 Fuyou Fang, Fuyou Road, is in the business of importing and exporting straw hat materials. After questioning by the police, Zhang claimed that he had purchased the rice some time ago and had no intention of hoarding it. The police ordered Zhang Zhuming and Ren Zuoqing to post bail, and the case has been submitted to the Garrison Command for handling.

Social Affairs Bureau Mobilizes to Thoroughly Investigate Unscrupulous Merchants

The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the recent surge in commodity prices is unreasonable. As the bureau responsible for managing commodity prices in the city, it has an unshirkable duty to stabilize prices and has decided to mobilize all staff members of the Property Rights Management Section for a thorough investigation. If any unscrupulous merchants are found manipulating prices, regardless of their identity or background, they will be brought to justice without leniency. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the price of rice in the city is affected by the production areas, and the high prices in the production areas are due to large-scale purchases for transportation to the north. Fluctuations in oil prices are also due to exports to Hong Kong and other places in the south. The city is allocated 8,000 tons of soybeans for oil extraction, which should be sufficient for self-sufficiency. However, due to exports to foreign countries in the south, foreign exchange is earned to purchase luxury goods, which are then smuggled back into the country. The director has already met with Mayor Wu to request that measures be taken to stop this practice immediately. The transshipment of edible oil was not originally restricted by the Executive Yuan, but due to the current needs, Mayor Wu is requested to petition the Executive Yuan to ban the transshipment of edible oil. If these two loopholes can be closed, it is believed that the price surge can be curbed. The Social Affairs Bureau is prepared to sell rice at any time when necessary. Mayor Wu has also requested the Ministry of Food to allocate 50,000 tons of rice to the city, which has been approved.

### Japan Under Control (III)

— Chen Xunyü

Military Occupation and Repatriation of Prisoners of War (Part 1)

Since the signing of the Instrument of Surrender on the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945, General MacArthur, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, issued General Order No. 1, instructing Japanese forces in various regions to surrender to the following Allied commanders:

(1) All Japanese forces in China (excluding Manchuria), Taiwan, and Vietnam north of 16 degrees North latitude (including all land, sea, air, and support units) shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Supreme Commander of China.

(2) Japanese forces in Manchuria, Korea north of 38 degrees North latitude, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Far East.

(3) Japanese forces in the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Burma, Siam, and Vietnam south of 16 degrees North latitude, Malaya, Sumatra, Java, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Ceylon, Ambon, Kai, Aru, Tanimbar, and the Arafura Islands, and the islands of Dutch New Guinea shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia Command.

(4) Japanese forces in British Borneo, British New Guinea, Bismarck, and the Solomon Islands shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of the Australian Army.

(5) Japanese forces in the Japanese-mandated islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other Pacific islands shall surrender to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet.

(6) Japanese forces in the Japanese mainland and its adjacent small islands, Korea south of 38 degrees North latitude, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippine Islands shall surrender to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Army Forces in the Pacific. In total, these regions contained approximately 7 million Japanese soldiers. They were to be completely disarmed, and ships, weapons, and ammunition were to be preserved as is and handed over to the aforementioned Allied commanders.

The advance units of the US Army began to enter Japan on August 28, 1945. On August 30, General MacArthur arrived in Tokyo. The US Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Eichelberger, immediately established its headquarters in Tokyo, garrisoning the main areas east of Hamamatsu to Hokkaido. The Sixth Army, led by Lieutenant General Krueger, established its headquarters in Kyoto, garrisoning the key areas west of Hamamatsu and Kyushu. In addition, the US Far East Air Forces, led by Lieutenant General Whitehead, and the Navy, led by Vice Admiral Griffin, Commander of the Far East Fleet, entered various naval ports. The total strength reached 400,000 men. The garrison areas of the Army and Navy at that time were as follows:

(1) Under the Eighth Army: (A) The Tenth Corps stationed in Yokohama; (B) The Fourteenth Corps stationed in Sendai; (C) The Ninth Corps stationed in Etajima.

(2) Under the Sixth Army: (A) The Fifth Amphibious Force stationed in Sasebo; (B) The Second Marine Division stationed in Nagasaki; (C) The Fifth Marine Division stationed in Sasebo; (D) The First Corps stationed in Osaka; (E) The Twenty-Fourth Corps stationed in Kyoto.

Later, on January 31, 1946, General MacArthur announced the conclusion of an agreement with the United Kingdom for British troops to enter Japan. British troops, led by Commander Brian, began to enter Japan in February. After the British troops entered, the US occupation forces felt that their numbers were excessive and transferred the entire Sixth Army back in April. The garrison areas of the various occupation forces were also adjusted once. (See table below)

Since the Allied forces occupied Japan, their primary task was to destroy the foundation of Japan's war-making capabilities and concentrate all efforts on the repatriation of Japanese soldiers. Under the guidance and supervision of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the Japanese government established the "Bureau for Liaison with the Termination of War" on August 26, 1945. It comprised four departments: Political, Economic, Construction, and Repatriation. Katsuo Okazaki, Director of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the Director of the Bureau. Later, Kenketsu Kodama succeeded him as President and reorganized it into six departments: (1) General Affairs, (2) Political, Military, Public Security, and Cultural Education, (3) Finance and Banking, (4) Land, Sea, and Air Transportation and Communications, (5) Army Reorganization, (6) Repatriation of Foreign Residents in Japan. Subsequently, Kodama was placed on the purge list and dismissed by order of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. Shigeru Yoshida, the former Foreign Minister, took over. This was the third reorganization, after which it was divided into only five departments: Political, Economic, Transportation, Construction, and Management. In addition, Japan established eight local liaison offices in accordance with its administrative divisions.

On October 15, 1945, the disarmament of Japan was completed under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters. At that time, General MacArthur announced the details of the dissolution of the Japanese army in a broadcast speech to the world. On August 23, the Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council was abolished. On September 13, the Japanese Army and Navy General Headquarters were abolished. On October 15, the General Staff and Naval General Staff of the Japanese Army and Navy were abolished. On November 30, the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries were abolished. On December 1, the First Demobilization Ministry and the Second Demobilization Ministry were formally established, the former responsible for the demobilization of the Army, and the latter responsible for the demobilization of the Navy. On April 1, 1946, the Demobilization Ministries were also abolished, and a Demobilization Agency was established within the Cabinet, headed by former Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida. The Demobilization Agency had a First Demobilization Bureau (responsible for Army demobilization) and a Second Demobilization Bureau (responsible for Navy demobilization). On October 1, the Army Officer School and other similar military schools were abolished. On October 10, operational units, such as the Combined Fleet Headquarters, were abolished. Other organizations and laws, such as the National Volunteer Corps (August 20), the Conscription Law (October 17), and the First Department of the Cabinet Information Bureau, which specialized in Army and Navy intelligence work, were also abolished one after another.

In his broadcast speech, General MacArthur also announced to the world that the four million invading Japanese troops within the Japanese mainland had been completely disarmed, including 57 army divisions with 2.5 million men, 1.2 million men in the navy, including 200,000 airmen in the army and navy.

Thus, the Japanese military organization, which had been established since January 17, the first year of Meiji (1868), for 77 years, was declared completely dissolved.

### The Democratic Train Has Started (Middle)

— Chen Guyuan

The regulations for the elections of various special units are indeed in compliance with the instructions of the Constitution, and the main purpose of these regulations in the Constitution is none other than to protect the weaker parties in the elections. In the election of representatives to the National Assembly, 168 representatives are elected by women's organizations, and each county or city with a population exceeding 500,000 will elect one additional representative for every additional 500,000 people, and among these additional representatives, there will be one female representative; among the 450 vocational representatives, there are 72 female representatives. In addition to the allocation of female representative quotas in other special elections, this accounts for a total of 10%. In the election of legislators, regardless of the type of election, there is one female representative for every ten or fewer legislators, and one female representative should be elected for every additional ten, which is also close to 10%. In the election of supervisors, each province has five representatives, one of whom must be a woman. No other explicit regulations have been made for other electoral districts or units, but although it is not 20%, it is even closer to it. In addition, the nomination of female candidates only requires 200 signatures in the case of legislators, a ratio of one to fifteen compared to men; in the case of supervisors, there is no limit to the number of signatures required. At the same time, since women's votes are calculated separately, if the required number of female representatives is not met, or if there are no female candidates running, or if a vacancy occurs after the election and there are no female alternates, the vacancy will be left unfilled, which can be considered as doing everything possible to protect the weaker parties in the election. Some in the women's community may hope that 20% should be the starting point across the board, gradually reaching 50% before it can be considered fair, but I hope that future election laws will no longer have special provisions for women, which would be ideal. Because by then, women and men will compete equally and with confidence, and the women's community will no longer want such provisions.

There is considerable theory behind vocational elections in political science, but they are used to replace regional elections, not to coexist with them; and they must belong to special political organizations, which cannot be adopted by modern general democratic countries. Since the Constitution lists vocational representatives, everyone should abide by it, but the number is authorized by law. Since the number of representatives to the National Assembly is large and they do not directly interfere with practical politics on a regular basis, it is acceptable to maintain 450 representatives, about one-sixth, in response to the demands of vocational groups. However, since the total number of legislators cannot be too large, the number of representatives elected by provinces and special municipalities stipulated in the Constitution is nearly 600, and the number of representatives elected by Mongolians, Tibetans, overseas Chinese, and indigenous peoples totals 57, so the number of legislators elected by vocational groups cannot be increased, which is one reason. At the same time, legislative affairs should take into account the interests of the entire people. If the number of legislators in vocational fields is high, it is very likely to affect the mission of legislation. For example, if the majority of legislators are capitalists, then laws to regulate capital and support labor will be very difficult to pass. Moreover, the organization of existing vocational groups is not yet widespread, and the number of members in some cases is as few as several hundred. Regional elections can produce one legislator for every million people, so if the number of legislators from vocational groups is large, it would be extremely unfair. Regional elections are not elections for unemployed groups. Members of vocational groups can rely on their various excellent conditions to engage in activities in the regional sphere, and allow the agricultural and industrial sectors to occupy more of the quotas allocated by vocational groups, so as not to lose the original intention of establishing a separate electoral unit for vocational groups, which should still be to protect the weaker parties in the election.

(3) Want Equality, Want Freedom, and Want Openness

Everyone has a profession, but not everyone needs to join a vocational group, and members who join vocational groups all have a residential area. At the same time, some people join two vocational groups, and some people establish a secondary domicile outside their place of origin. For the sake of equality, whether it is the election of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators, it is stipulated that each voter has only one vote. Those who have more than two votes in various elections are limited to participating in one, and the voter must declare this when registering in the voter list. The election of supervisors by overseas Chinese groups also has this restriction. Based on the same reason, a person with the right to be elected shall not register as a candidate in more than two elections. This can not only give each person with the right to be elected an equal opportunity to compete in the election, but also avoid the complicated procedures of having to resign from one of the two positions if elected in both places.

In European and American countries, candidates are nominated by political parties, or they register as candidates by paying a certain deposit. This is to prevent too many candidates, which would waste time creating lists and increase many meaningless and cumbersome procedures. The practice of registering as a candidate by paying a deposit is not feasible in China, and since it is a free election, there should be no restrictions on the registration of candidates in terms of money. In addition to being introduced by a certain number of voters, the nomination of candidates for representatives to the National Assembly and legislators adopts the method of party nomination. Although there are countless political parties in China today, like bamboo shoots after a rain, and it is not entirely certain whether they are truly political parties, opening this door seems excessive. However, there are not many political parties that are recognized by society. If a certain group truly has the nature of a political party, it is difficult to restrict it from putting forward candidates according to the general practice of democratic countries. At this time when the democratic train is starting, it is inevitable to create rules, and we cannot abandon it for fear of choking. The party nomination is only a demonstration in China at present, and it is not limited to the method of party nomination alone, so the proportional representation system is difficult to implement. In other words, the proportional representation system cannot be used for the majority of voters who have no party affiliation, which is the case in China today.

Since the main purpose of the party nomination method is to establish a system, it is necessary to adopt the method of voter signature nomination in order to meet the actual needs. To nominate a candidate by voter signature, 500 or more signatures are required in the case of representatives to the National Assembly, with each voter limited to signing for one person, which applies to all special unit elections. In the case of legislators, 3,000 or more signatures are required. However, if the candidate is from a vocational group, the number is reduced to 500 or more signatures. If the candidate is a woman, the number is reduced to 200 or more signatures. Each voter is limited to signing for one candidate. The number of signatures required for representatives to the National Assembly is smaller because there are more representatives, so there should be more candidates; and the electoral districts of counties and cities are small, so if the number of signatures is large, it would be tantamount to depriving the right of candidates to compete. The number of signatures required for legislators is larger, which is naturally due to the small number of legislators and the large electoral districts, and it is also a reason to restrict candidates from the number of signatures required, as legislators need to be talented and often elected. The number of signatures for vocational group candidates is reduced to 500 because vocational groups have fewer members and it is easier to nominate candidates. The number of signatures for female candidates is further reduced to 200 because female legislators are not elected by women's groups, but rather the female quota is allocated among various elections, so special protection is given.

In the case of supervisors, the nomination of each candidate only requires the signature of five or more voters in each province, city, and Mongolia and Tibet, because the provincial and municipal councils or Mongolian and Tibetan local councils sometimes have only a dozen or so members, so the number of signatures cannot be increased. In the case of elections by overseas Chinese groups, the nomination of candidates should be co-signed by 30 or more voters; in the case of elections by the representatives of each banner council of the joint electoral district before the establishment of the Mongolian local council, the nomination of candidates should be co-signed by 30 or more citizens with electoral districts outside the council. The number of signatures is still not too high. The number of signatures for female candidates is even unrestricted. In the case of the President and Vice President, candidates are nominated by 100 or more representatives to the National Assembly within the time limit determined by the Assembly, and each representative may only nominate or co-sign one decision. The reason why 100 signatures are required is to prevent frivolous people from considering it an honor to be nominated as a candidate for President or Vice President, which must be seriously restricted.

Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives to the National Assembly in the electoral district where they are located. This is stipulated in Article 28, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution. Because it is of great importance, Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law makes a special provision. Article 13 of the Legislative Member Election and Recall Law adopts this intention and stipulates that incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district where their office is located in their jurisdiction shall resign five months before the election. The purpose of this regulation is nothing more than to exclude the manipulation of special forces, so that everyone has the opportunity to compete openly. By extension, it is even more appropriate that members or supervisors and staff of the election organization should not be candidates for representatives to the National Assembly or legislators in the area or group where they handle the election. Although there are no similar provisions in the election and recall of supervisors, there is no doubt that the supervisors and staff who handle the election should not have the qualifications of candidates, and there will be supplementary regulations in the implementing regulations in the future. However, the Election and Recall Law for Supervisors stipulates that each provincial and municipal councilor elected as a supervisor is limited to one person, also to prevent manipulation by the electoral college. And so.

Incidentally, I would like to mention the election organization here: Originally, I wanted to set up election supervisors in various election offices according to past practice, but later, people from various parties and factions believed that the election organization should accommodate participation from all parties, so that all parties that participated in the constitution-making had the opportunity to jointly promote the election administration. Therefore, except for the Mongolia and Tibet Election Office and the election of supervisors, the organization of the election office uniformly adopts the election committee system. The reason why the election of supervisors does not use the election committee system is because the procedure is relatively simple, and a by-election must be held after the recall case is passed. It is also too difficult to organize an election committee for the by-election of one person, so the provincial and municipal administrative heads are the election supervisors. Some people advocate that the speaker of the council should be the election supervisor, but in this way, the speaker's right to be elected is implicitly deprived, which is not appropriate. The election of the President and Vice President is handled by the National Assembly according to law, and it is a presidium system rather than a speaker system, so there is no issue of election organization.

(4) How to be Elected? How to Fill Vacancies?

Whether it is a representative to the National Assembly or a legislator, they are all elected in order according to the legal number of seats, based on the number of votes obtained. According to pure theory, the plurality voting system is not without its shortcomings: it is easy to be elected, and those elected may not be what the public wants, which is one. Since the election is not by the largest majority, it cannot encourage people to vote enthusiastically, which is two. Candidates are also lazy to engage in large-scale election activities, and there is no way to cultivate the strength of political parties in the election, which is three. Therefore, some people advocate that candidates should be elected if they get more than half of the total number of votes, and if the number of votes is insufficient, another vote should be held, and then the plurality should be elected. Although this ideal is high, in China today, when universal suffrage is just beginning, the majority of the people lack the habit of voting. If the absolute majority voting system is adopted, any electoral district will inevitably have two votes, which is time-consuming and inconvenient, and is not suitable for today's situation. Not only the election of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators adopts the plurality system, but also the election of supervisors. However, the election of the President or Vice President is based on obtaining more than half of the total number of representatives' votes; if no one reaches this number of votes, the top three candidates with the most votes will be re-voted, and if there is no result, a third vote will be taken: If no one reaches this number of votes in the first vote, the top two candidates with the most votes will be voted again, and the candidate with the most votes will be elected; if the number of votes is the same, another vote must be taken and decided by the plurality. The procedure is cautious, but also cumbersome, and cannot be widely applied to the election of other candidates. As for the election of the President and Vice President, they should be held separately, first the President and then the Vice President. Whether it is an absolute majority election or a plurality election, there is no necessary connection between them. The reason why these two elections are held separately is that those who run for President and lose can still have the opportunity to be candidates for Vice President.

Whether it is a representative to the National Assembly or a legislator, if there is a vacancy, it will be filled by the alternate in order; the alternate is produced by electing the full number of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators according to law, and the other candidates who get votes are in order according to the number of votes, and if the number of votes is the same, it is determined by drawing lots. Some people believe that this method is not as reasonable as a by-election, and when it is carried out in parallel with the recall system, it will inevitably induce the alternate to use the recall to seek a vacancy, and to act whenever there is an opportunity, and the country will have more troubles from now on. However, by-elections must be formally held; vacancies occur from time to time, and elections are always in progress, which is ultimately not suitable for the current situation in China. However, because it does not adopt by-elections, the number of alternates is set at three when there are two or fewer elected in each electoral district or unit; when there are more than two elected, the number of alternates is the same as the number of elected, which is to prevent too few alternates and the trouble of having to hold elections again when there are no alternates to fill the vacancy. The alternate system is used only when it is unavoidable, so the by-election for the successor is adopted when a supervisor is vacant, and the date of the by-election is determined by order. The successor supervisor will serve until the original term expires. When the President is vacant or removed from office due to recall, the Vice President will succeed to the office until the original President's term expires; therefore, the Vice President is essentially a presidential candidate. When both the President and Vice President are vacant, in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution, in addition to the President of the Executive Yuan temporarily acting in their capacity, the National Assembly will be convened for a temporary session to elect the President and Vice President, whose terms will be to make up for the unexpired term of the original President, which can also be said to be a kind of by-election.

(5) Prudent Use and Abuse of the Right of Recall

The recall system is being implemented for the first time in China. Article 133 of the Constitution only stipulates that "those who are elected may be recalled by the original electoral district according to law." It takes a lot of consideration to make effective regulations in law. We must not narrow the scope and restrict it because it is being tried out, so that the people have the name of recall but not the reality. It is also a mistake to carelessly broaden the scope and fall into abuse, so that politics is often in a state of unrest. Therefore, in the four election and recall laws, the provisions on recall must be carefully written to seek perfection.

According to the precedents of several countries that have adopted the recall system, those who have been in office for a short time should not be allowed to apply for recall. This is to prevent the abuse of the right of recall. In theory, it is difficult to determine whether the elected person is virtuous and competent without a considerable period of time; if a considerable period of time is not set, it would be almost child's play to elect today and recall tomorrow. Moreover, recall does not require legal reasons. Although the reasons should be stated in the recall petition, this is only to gain the sympathy of the recall voters. Even if there are no sufficient reasons objectively, the purpose can still be achieved as long as the recall case is passed. Therefore, in order to slightly restrict the temporary likes and dislikes of the recall petitioners, it is even more necessary to do so. The National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law stipulates that voters in the original electoral unit may not file a recall petition against the elected representative until six months have passed. For example, if the representatives are elected before September of this year and the meeting is held on December 25, then six months after the representatives are elected, they have already performed their duties, and they can be recalled due to their poor performance or other circumstances. But if there is no such restriction, it would be difficult for them to be representatives if they are recalled at any time after being elected without even having attended a meeting. The Legislative Member Election and Recall Law and the Supervisor Election and Recall Law have the same provisions, giving a period of six months to observe the results. The recall of the President and Vice President has a greater impact on the political situation, so representatives to the National Assembly may not apply for the recall of the President and Vice President who have been in office for less than twelve months. Some people say that although this avoids the frivolous filing of recall cases, which affects the prestige of the President and Vice President, what if the President and Vice President commit serious crimes of internal strife and foreign aggression within twelve months of taking office? It should be noted that if the President and Vice President have such behavior, the Control Yuan can file an impeachment, which is not subject to this provision. In other words, when the Control Yuan files an impeachment case against the President and Vice President with the National Assembly, the National Assembly can decide on the recall of the President and Vice President, which is not subject to the twelve-month period restriction.

### A DEPARTMENT STORE SALESGIRL'S DIARY

— Li Li

Our office used to be a department store. In my office drawer, there were still many receipt books left behind. In one of the receipt books, I found a diary. Opening it, the handwriting was still delicate.

March 3rd

Sitting at the counter, bored, I took out the colorful and dazzling little things one by one to play with. Looking at myself in the closed round mirror, fastening a brooch, putting on earrings, and clipping on a hair clip, I felt a bit self-pitying. Then, opening the powder boxes one by one to look at myself, Mr. Director walked over. I picked up my favorite powder box and said to him:

"Give it to me!"

"Okay, just issue a receipt!"

He was just saying that. If I issued a receipt, who would I ask to collect the money?

March 8th

In the afternoon, Peng said it was Women's Day. I secretly slipped out to have some refreshments across the street. After eating, we agreed that I would go first, return through the side door, and Peng would pay the bill and then return through the front door. As a result, no one knew we went out together.

Today, I felt a bit of spring in the air.

March 11th

I was playing with various toys in the toy department. Peng walked over. I picked up a wooden gun and aimed it at his heart. He trembled with fright; I think he was pretending.

March 20th

I went to Peng's counter to buy powder. To my surprise, Peng said the powder was not suitable for me.

I said, "What right does a salesperson have to refuse a customer?"

He said, "I'm doing it for your own good because your skin is too warm, and the powder will block your skin's breathing."

"My heart is very cold," I said.

"That's not right, because the freckles on your face prove that your heart is very warm."

I was very angry.

March 21st

After lunch, coming down from upstairs, I saw Mai leaning on Peng's counter, chatting and laughing. What reason did she have to be so close to Peng? She is already the mother of a ten-year-old girl. I quietly walked up to her. She was startled and embarrassedly returned to her stocking counter.

March 22nd

Peng wanted me to treat him to candy.

I said, "I won't, because there's no sweetness between us."

March 24th

Mai bought a raw cucumber from the food shop next door and was eating it. I thought she was too crude, but Peng seemed to like her. I really don't understand what men are thinking.

March 26th

After lunch, Mai suggested buying peanut candy to eat, and Peng agreed.

Eating again right after finishing lunch is unsanitary and costs money. Although I didn't agree, I had to submit to the majority. It is said that this is "democracy."

March 30th

Peng stroked Mai's hair and said, "Miss Mai's hair is combed so well, high in the front and pulled back on both sides."

I immediately went to the mirror to look at myself. My hair droops down on one side. I think it looks much better than Mai's hair.

April 1st

Today is the company's first anniversary. There's a week-long sale. Customers are flooding in like a tide. The sound of ringing bells and pencils tapping on the counter is chaotic. One colleague was so anxious that she was hitting the counter with an abacus. - It's extremely lively!

April 3rd

We eat in three shifts. I eat on the third shift, the time is one o'clock. Today, business was so good, the sound of ringing bells was so loud, that I was too busy to hear the meal bell. When I looked, it was already 1:20. I wondered why lunch hadn't started so late. When I asked, the third shift's lunch had already started. I was very anxious. Peng wanted to treat me to lunch, but I refused because I knew he liked Mai. In the end, Mr. Director treated me, and the dishes were very good.

April 5th

The powder box I loved was bought by a customer. When I issued that receipt, my heart ached, no, my heart was broken! After issuing the receipt, I picked up the powder box for one last look.

"What a beautiful powder box!" I said.

The customer gave a smug smile.

April 7th

A customer wanted to buy white sewing thread. I searched in the counter for a while but couldn't find it. I told her the white one was sold out. She seemed very disappointed. So I took a spool of light blue thread and asked her, "Is this okay?" She took it and looked at it, but didn't like it very much. She searched the counter herself for a while and pointed to a spool, asking me to take it out. When I looked, it was also light blue and difficult to take out. I said, "That's light blue. Take it out and see!" "Taking it out will also be blue." She insisted that I take it out. I had no choice but to follow the customer's wishes, move out all the spools of thread, and then take out the spool she pointed to and give it to her. She took it, looked at it, smiled, and gave it back to me. I was extremely angry at that moment.

April 8th

Today is Mai's birthday. She's treating us to noodles tonight.

After getting off work, Mai sat on Peng's bicycle and went back first. Mr. Zhao, Mr. Liu and I took the tram. The location was chosen by Mai, and we weren't familiar with it. It took us a lot of time to find it. It turned out to be a dirty and small noodle shop. It's embarrassing to say.

As soon as I went in, I saw Mai and Peng sitting opposite each other eating noodles, with a bright scarf on Mai’s head. I had nothing to say.

April 9th

I received a notice that I issued the wrong receipt and had to pay more than ten thousand yuan in compensation.

What good is the company's good business to me? There are drawbacks. I should do less business in the future! One item is divided into many item numbers and many prices. Customers' selections are overwhelming. How can I keep things clear?

I heard that the peach blossoms in Longhua have withered. This year's spring is over!

After work, Peng again asked Mai to sit on the back of his bicycle and send her back. Hmph, they're still pretending to be serious in front of me! ...

James Metlew Barrie (1860), a veteran in the British drama circle, is a very witty person. Once, many people visited him and asked about the process of his work's success. He interestingly replied: A journalist is two bags of tobacco equals one hour, two hours equals one idea, one idea equals three news stories, and three news stories equals a leader. But a novelist is eight bags of tobacco equals one ounce, seven ounces equals one week, two weeks equals one chapter, twenty chapters equals one pen nib, and two pen nibs equals a novel. The great writer Galsworthy once quoted these words when lecturing on his own writing experience.

### APRIL

— Li Baifeng

April——

The leafy trees of the city

Bloom with neon lights.

This big tree

Will take root in the Huangpu River

Twin trunks

(Nanjing Road and Linsen Road

Branches with many flowers…)

Bees and butterflies are ecstatic

Neon lights are their pride.

However

The impoverished city will become even more impoverished

Compared to the dry branches and those full of

Neon-lit branches

The face of the city

Looks even paler.

NURSING CARE Jian Hui

Emerging from the purulent, bloody neighborhood,

Still dressed in pure white.

Let the patients draw a grateful cross,

Inlaid in red on your chest.

Be a mother to the masses,

Your children are ageless;

Eighty-year-old patients,

Also need your comforting milk!

Nameless doctor,

A warrior fighting gently against disease;

You are constantly close to death,

But protect people towards life day and night,

MORNING FLOWERS Lü Zhuang

Last night, hoisting scarlet sail shadows

Pouring hair in the total morning breeze

This morning, coming into the world without seeing the sunlight

But falling into the flower girl's bamboo basket

SHADOW Jiao Ben

When clear,

Like the fire before your eyes;

When blurred,

Like the smoke in a dream;

Ten years of Long March,

How much sorrow is weighed down

How much dust!

### WINDOW AND OTHERS

— Zhang Mianzhi

WINDOW

I've been living at the end of this small suburban village for half a year now. Although the room I occupy is just one, half bedroom, half guest room, it's still a home. To reduce the temptation for passing food peddlers to give to my children, I always keep the front door tightly bolted, so the house is also deeper. On the contrary, there are very few acquaintances here, and it's rare for distant guests to come. Fortunately, there's a clear glass window, otherwise I would be even more depressed and suffocated. It is my eyes, my source of light.

Today, the children are napping and haven't woken up yet. There is an unusual silence in the room. It is trembling in bursts, constantly making creaking sounds.

The wind is blowing, still containing some sand. The fields and the sky are hazy with a turbid yellowish-brown color. The clouds are also so gray and yellow, boundless. In front, there is a continuous line of rolling hills of earth mounds, no grass can be seen. The half-covered, forked tree branches, although interspersed with a few low-lying evergreen trees, dotted in the corners of the exposed old village houses, also appear dark and blurred. Behind that, a newly built triangular ice storage house made of straw stands like a pyramid in the wind and sand.

I stood woodenly by the window, intentionally or unintentionally looking at these scenes. I slowly noticed the faint, swaying shadows of kites in the tree branches. They are so dashing and otherworldly, within sight but out of reach. They wove the dream of my hometown fields;

The wheat waves are already turning in the wind, and there are also the mating calls of pheasants among them. The broad beans are also squeezing their charming eyes, butterfly-like eyes. The wild children, under the guise of picking vegetables, escape the adults' supervision and chase each other in the fields. Some lie there, lying in the sound of the wind wheel. The wheat fields have already been weeded with hoes. On windy days, the adults mostly hide in their houses, hoping for the eighth rain in February, so the wheat fields can be nourished and there will be noodles and fish to eat. Don't you hear? The sound of the wind is roaring, the sound of the loom creaking in the houses with closed doors. Those familiar faces, one by one, appear before my eyes. My two children who lost their mother are studying in the village school. Should they be a little cold? Did they bring more clothes?...

A wave of sorrow. In the distance, there are still continuous rolling hills of earth mounds. I also think that there are few cheerful smiling faces in my hometown, and few complete meals. They are all wearing tattered clothes, lighting bean oil lamps at night. There are often gunshots, and it is rare to hear dogs barking. My hometown has become so thin that only bones remain. Thousands upon thousands of people have fled to other places. What kind of world is that?

I can't bear to think anymore. There are no more traces of vegetable vendors on the main road. Occasionally, there are those selling sugarcane or learning bird calls, their shoulders covered with wind and sand, trudging back to their temporary residences.

Today, the days are unusually long, every minute and every second is heavy.

The wind is blowing harder and harder, and my window is also creaking louder and louder. A sound of machinery whizzed by. I heavily opened the glass window, letting the wind blow in, blowing on my burning cheeks, even though the dust and sand sealed the table under my windowsill.

NEWSPAPER

Is a drifter, unable to make a living, shouldering the burden of four children, including a nursing infant. I don't know how I got through so many days before, and I'm even more at a loss as to how to spend the many days to come.

Even the green-clothed people appear indifferent, passing by indifferently, not coming in. The newspaper delivery man has become my only guest. I wait for him every day, like a stone thrown into a shallow, calm stream. It brings me warmth and tears, encouraging me and also deeply tormenting me. Seeing him is like family members facing each other, exchanging intimate heartfelt words. Being away from him for a day leaves me with no place to turn. Heaven, it entangles me so much, grabbing my soul and refusing to let go.

What I can't forget the most is the quiet rain night. Alone, I gently sat before the lamp, reverently opening the accumulated daily newspapers, page by page, clipping out the texts and woodcuts that I enjoyed reading. It was no different from the heartfelt joy of an old friend coming in the wind and rain. Of course, the sounds of civil war and the soaring prices constantly plagued me, but precisely because the tension was so intense and prolonged, any slight relaxation was particularly precious.

PAWN

When I was a child, when I read lines like "Returning from court, I pawn my spring clothes every day," I thought that the matter of pawning seemed to have some elegance to it.

When I haggle with pawnshop clerks with a timid heart, I feel that it is completely different from what I imagined when reading poetry.

Several times, I saw short-dressed heroes, in the cold weather, taking off their cotton-padded or velvet shirts. Their expressions were so calm and unrestrained. I felt that my trembling appearance was simply the behavior of a weak person. It's not good, not good!

Recently, calculating the value of currency, it can be said that high interest loans no longer exist. However, after running around for several times to extend the deadline and add interest, seeing the pawnshop that looks like a government office, I really have some respect and distance. Sometimes I even pretend not to see it, and quickly stare at other shops or vehicles to reduce that kind of silent threat. But thinking about the faces of relatives and friends who have ways to help, they may not be as pleasant as the clerks, so I have some longing.

### PREFACE TO MOURNING WENG TONGSHI

— Wang Hanxian

It has been ten years since I parted with Weng Shanweng in the capital; two years ago, I returned east from Sichuan, and inquired about him in Shanghai, but no one knew. Later, brother Chong told me that he lived in the Heyi Village on Yongjia Road, so I hurried to visit by car, but Weng was out; so he came to see me the next day, and told me about his recent situation, saying that his wrist strength had not weakened, and his calligraphy had improved, and he wanted to wield the brush in front of everyone to express his accumulated feelings. I also planned to invite him to a banquet, but it didn't work out. After that, I rarely visited due to work, and suddenly the news of Shanweng's death arrived, and in shock and grief, I mourned him with a poem.

Returning east, I bitterly remember the old Shanweng, but I only knew that he made Shanghai his home; Several times I passed through Heyi Village, but my old friend was in this village

Happy to see old friends like new rain, meeting with sorrow and joy feels like a different world; Alas, now truly separated by worlds, Cultivating literature and answering the summons, so hurried

Swallows fly west, returning again now, unbearable these ten years of changing seas; How many old travels have fallen away? One old man left, a miserly act of the Creator

I said myself, wielding the brush, my strength is not yet painful, wanting to enjoy Qing pleasure together; How is this destiny ultimately unfulfilled, broken paper and silk, I ask if there are any

Love combined with teacher and friend, following closely, a bond that fits like moss and cypress, not by chance? Accompanying in the history bureau, together morning and evening, Crazy and unrestrained, stirring up mist for more than twenty years

### LOVE LETTER AFTER MARRIAGE

— Qian Fanfu

You accepted my invitation, and we went to the theater together. In fact, we ourselves are also playing a drama - you may not understand the content of this script very well, but I understand it from beginning to end.

Here is the whole truth:

The first summer we met, when I was still an uninhibited boy, I developed a good feeling for you. However, you had other close friends at that time, and I could only secretly extinguish the passion in my heart with tears… Later, I also met a young lady, understood each other, and got engaged. However, I still can't forget you. Recently, I learned that you and that friend have no special friendship, so every time when the night is deep and people are quiet, I often have fantasies: Do I still have the right to express my feelings to you at this moment?

You now understand the whole process. My words are frank and fearless. I believe that only human beings who can control their behavior with character and emotion can understand the happiness of life.

Emotion is lovely and terrible. It is definitely not a sin, and it cannot be restrained. However, I have decided to change this impossible love into respect for you. Because: A husband's love should all belong to his wife.

Goodbye! Wish you happiness.

### ONE INCH OF MOUNTAIN, ONE INCH OF RIVER, ONE INCH OF BLOOD

— Ye Feng

During the Republic of China's 17th year, after the successful Northern Expedition of the National Army, on the southwest outskirts of Shanghai, there was such a group. The location was originally a large family's ancestral hall, later they themselves renamed it "Bai Ren Zhuang."

This small group, up until now, has only had about twenty people. It is said that the leading figure of this group is an old man in his sixties, and the whole group calls him "Old Man Juechang." Shanghai's Bai Ren Zhuang is just a temporary residence for recruiting talents. The original birthplace is still in a natural paradise on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, in the remaining veins of West Tianmu Mountain. That is a large valley, with screens of towering cliffs on all sides, titled "Da Jue Valley."

This Old Man Juechang, having experienced the dangers of officialdom and the vicissitudes of the world, was unwilling to give up on himself; so he chose this deep mountain valley and implemented his "Utopian Ideal." He said that China is an agricultural country, and the most ideal way to strengthen the country is through new village education. He knew that there were not a few people with the same ideals in the same era. Apart from most of them being willing but unable to act, there were indeed a few people who implemented this ideal. However, among these people, some had incomplete plans, only telling people to take off their bare feet and go to the fields, letting leeches bite them, while they themselves wore Western-style trousers with four neatly ironed lines, taking artistic photos on the side, preparing them for fundraising advertisements. There were also some unorthodox textbooks of some sort, saying they were rural education.

He also knew that some people were incredibly resourceful and actually had the ability to raise a huge amount of donations from home and abroad, hiring third- or fourth-rate gilded doctors, masters, and bachelors, saying they were agricultural and forestry experts, spending the huge sums raised on improving pigs and chickens, while they themselves took those improved foreign chickens and ducks, smoked and roasted them to eat as French cuisine.

Old Man Juechang, however, did not use this method. He first opened an experimental new village in Da Jue Valley, counting it as one unit. In this unit, he recruited a few buried practical agricultural and forestry talents, and tried to use Western methods suitable for Chinese soil and human nature as much as possible, cultivating and raising livestock. He also sent some cultivable youths to various foreign countries to study practical subjects on site, to return and assist in development.

Regarding education, it was not just about recognizing a few basic characters; they used the latest educational weapons from abroad; movies, wireless radios, slide projectors, group lectures, dramas, music, etc., etc., allowing the people in this new village to absorb various new knowledge.

In this new village, there was only one creed: to be loyal to the country, to fulfill all the obligations that citizens should fulfill? To love humanity, to seek all the happiness that humanity should seek.

In addition to developing knowledge and morality in the village, Old Man Juechang especially emphasized the health of everyone's physique. For ordinary sports, both new and old, they had various gymnastics, ball games, competitions, swimming; the old ones were special; because Old Man Juechang himself was proficient in the art of nourishing life, internal and external exercises, and various martial arts. Therefore, everyone in the village, at a minimum, had practiced your family's ancestral secret editions of the Eight Brocades and the Yijin Jing. As for those with suitable physique and similar temperament, they were trained in internal and external martial arts and specialized skills according to their individual qualities, such as Chin Na hand, Damo Palm, Toad Gong, One Finger Zen, etc. There were also several particularly advanced ones who could even use "Tai Chi Zen Gong Empty Strength." …

"You're making it sound too good!" Seeing Zheng Yan's report, I felt strangely enlightened and extremely excited, but it seemed like I was listening to a fairy tale, and I couldn't quite believe it.

"No, Captain; your subordinate dares not fabricate a single word of rumor; I only regret that I can't speak clearly enough..."

### DUBOU MAN TALK

— Wang Cong

A dock worker, exhausted from labor during the day; wants to sleep peacefully at night, but in his dreams, he is still doing heavy work, and the next day he is still exhausted.

A person who has eaten vegetarian food for decades, if one day he suddenly has a whim and indulges in eating pork. This is proof that this person will not live long.

People originally follow the normal trajectory of life habits to find every peaceful and stable tomorrow. The elasticity of life cannot tolerate the collapse of ideals and practice at the same time.

Therefore, I think the sudden marriage of monks or nuns is more terrifying than the debauchery of playboys.

If human psychological complexes cannot find appropriate sublimation and are only barely suppressed; the consequences are unimaginable.

To pretend to be great in order to forgive others, their own sins must be unforgivable.

And the great souls that are regarded as floods and beasts; because of their prescience, they must suffer - this is an unavoidable law. They are nailed to the cross, forgetting the slander of the small groups and their own bleeding, but embracing a heart full of compassion; calling out to humanity the way to eternal life, seeing how the ocean of selfishness has submerged many small boats of inspiration,

This great misfortune is not an "expression," nor a "posture," but "truth," "goodness," "beauty," and a small drop in the world's drunkenness.

Forgiving enemies requires more generosity than benefiting friends.

Moreover, what Christ asks of us is to save our enemies!

"Returning evil for good" is truly an extremely difficult act.

Medicine is for treating patients. If you inject penicillin into the arm of a dead person, it is unnecessary. Some people like to send the dead to the funeral home for grooming. This kind of "face-saving" prank is far less interesting than burning paper money in the underworld. If you open the chest of a dead person and put in shark fins and bird's nests, even if the dead person doesn't vomit, how can the living bear it? The ways to seek fame are many.

Precisely because medicine cannot be recklessly given to the dead to seek healing. By the same token, "returning evil for good" has its corresponding limits; I dare not imagine some of the virtues that my countrymen call virtues. Therefore, I dare to make this argument.

### Shanghai People's Wallets

— Qi Lou

In the past half-month, Shanghai people's spring outings can be described as reaching a state of infatuation. The number of tourists in Longhua is like , and the crowding at the North Railway Station has led to news of injuries and deaths of women and children daily. The fact that Shanghai people have money in their wallets is a testament to this. When these wealthy Shanghai people go to the countryside, their lavish spending and generosity are somewhat reminiscent of the American sailors who flocked to this place from Shanghai after the end of the Pacific War. Their demeanor seems to say, "As long as you name a price, we can afford it; everything you have can be bought with money, and we can also buy everything you have!" These five large characters in quotation marks, although a jarring cliché, are enough to depict the ravenous appearance of Shanghai people in front of the villagers.

A foreign journalist once said, "The whole country is starving, but Shanghai is dancing." Seeing the joyous spring outings of Shanghai people in the past half-month, as well as the poverty of compatriots in the interior, it can be seen that this statement is indeed not wrong. But on the other hand, the so-called "whole country," whether in words or in reality, includes Shanghai, which is dancing. Among Shanghai's nearly four million people, more than half are struggling to survive on the brink of starvation. Therefore, if we were to change the foreign journalist's words to "Shanghai is starving, Shanghai is dancing," we wouldn't be wrong either.

My point is not only that some people in Shanghai are secretly starving while others are dancing, but also that the same starving person is dancing, and the same dancing person is hungry in their stomach. So, changing the above statement to "Shanghai people are starving, Shanghai people are dancing" wouldn't be wrong either. The wallets of Shanghai people on spring outings to the countryside are full, but do you know where their money comes from? Many people take one spring outing, preparing to live in darkness for a month. But knowing that the next month will be dark, they still cannot help but participate in the lively spring outing. This is the Shanghai people's "drink today's wine and be drunk today" philosophy of life. Their enjoyment is built on the brink of starvation. Villagers see Shanghai people's gorgeous clothes and extravagant behavior, assuming that they eat delicacies and live in high-rise buildings, but they don't know that they often live in attics, eat salted rice porridge, and are uncertain about their future. On the contrary, looking at the villagers, they seem to be frugal everywhere, but in fact, they are steady and grounded, living in their own three thatched cottages, wearing simple clothes and eating simple food, without having to worry every day.

Shanghai is like a factory described in Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle." The small amount of wages earned by the workers day and night is consumed in the factory's affiliated bars and gambling dens. You see how happily they indulge in these entertainment venues, but you don't know how pitiful their happiness actually is.

### Petition to the Ministry of Education

— Qian Yongfa

On April 1st, the Ministry of Education revised Article 2 of the three articles of the academic regulations for schools above the vocational level: "Graduates of vocational and normal schools must serve for four years before being allowed to further their education." When students of our vocational schools saw this, they didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Four years is not a short time. The Ministry of Education especially stated that they can only further their education after four years, it would be better to say frankly that students graduating from vocational schools are not allowed to further their education. If we are lucky enough to find a job and serve for four years, some of the geometry and algebra in our mind will have long been forgotten. If the Ministry of Education says, "You can work hard to review during the four years of service," then can the Ministry also definitively say, "During your service, there will definitely be enough free time for you to review the subjects for the entrance exam."

The Ministry of Education did not explain the reason why vocational and normal schools cannot immediately further their education. I think, normal school students probably received the "grace" of the Ministry of Education's free education. But we vocational school students did not receive that kind of "grace." We also paid a large stack of tuition fees every semester, just like other schools. If the Ministry of Education says, "Your purpose of entering vocational school is to seek employment, why do you want to further your education?" This statement is originally correct, but can the Ministry of Education guarantee that students with secondary education can definitely find a job in the current depressed society? If we cannot find a job, and the Ministry of Education does not allow us to further our education, are we really supposed to be parasites at home?

The Ministry of Education's regulations are really unreasonable. Vocational school students are neither incompetent nor clumsy. We not only have to cope with the professional courses in school, but also have to cope with the general subjects that cannot be taught in school when we further our education. Therefore, we request the Ministry of Education to abolish this unreasonable regulation, otherwise the future of our vocational school students is worrying.

### Moving Backwards

— Xu Xiaoting

It is said that there is still no definite plan for the printing of national standard textbooks. In order to prevent further price and labor increases, and fearing that costs will increase again, it is reported that many bookstores have begun to print the old pre-war approved editions in order to supply them as autumn sales books. Whether these books are suitable for the needs of the present era is truly a question. Moving backwards with textbooks is indeed an unreasonable and bad phenomenon. (Editor's note: It is not known whether this news is true or not, we hope that the bookstores will give us an answer.)

### Reading "Miscellaneous Notes from a Ladderless Building"

— Feichen

This is a piece of reportage literature that has been hammered and is full of combativeness. Under the lamp, I received the author's full and unrestrained emotions, and almost couldn't control myself!

Collected in this collection are a total of thirty-five articles, all of which are emotional pickings left behind by the author, Mr. Bu Shaofu, in the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. Precisely because Mr. Bu Shaofu is a warrior who has dedicated himself to journalism for more than twenty years, therefore, after the hammering of emotions and the tempering of the Anti-Japanese War, the eloquent articles that he regurgitates all shimmer with emotional sparks and flaunt the author's boundless talent.

When I quietly read his descriptions of Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, Liuzhou, and Funing, I seem to hear the sound of his wind and waves, and I seem to see the clear and gurgling long stream. In the description of Chongqing during the "Bombing," the author writes:

"...After the bomb fell to the ground, it rushed up a burst of smoke and flames, a burst of sparks, and then slowly disappeared... The river water of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers flows gurglingly, the green flowers and trees sway with the color and fragrance of summer, and my emotions are immersed in this sticky, resilient, strong, durable, and obstinate atmosphere of the centipede."

In this short fragment, he has already painted for us how "Fighting Chongqing" stood firmly at the forefront of the bombing smoke lamp during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War.

"Walking in the Hospital" and "Ten Thousand Gold" write about the hardship and difficulty of a journalist's life during the Anti-Japanese War; writing about characters includes "Remembering Ying Yin," "Remembering Lu Shaofei," and "The Four Great Generals"; discussing drama and painting includes "Apricot Blossom Spring Rain Jiangnan," "Transformation," and "Requiem"; "Shen Tieru's Painting Exhibition," etc.

Among the thirty-five articles, there are epic reportage literature, essays, sketches, reading notes, character interviews... It contains such a wide range and diversity, and it shows its boldness and torrent in the midst of brightness and clarity.

This is a recommended masterpiece in the new spring of April.

### On the Imperial Examination, a Fine Tale

— Mutao

Mr. Yu Quyuan, after being dismissed from his position as the education commissioner of Henan, spent his leisurely years writing about the past in the Chunzai Hall. Therefore, Zeng Wenzheng once said to my late father: I have two students, one is Li Shaoquan, who desperately imitates officials, and the other is Yu Quyuan, who desperately writes books. The so-called Chunzai Hall was the topic of the examination poem in the Gengxu Dynasty Examination, which was "Light Clouds, Sparse Rain, and Falling Flower Day." Wenzheng appreciated his first sentence, "Flowers Fall, Spring Always Remains," and placed him first (that is, Chaoyuan), so Mr. Qu used Chunzai to name the hall. This is similar to Yuan Suiyuan's saying "The distance between people is like the Milky Way," which was appreciated by Yin Wenduan, both being fine tales of the imperial examination. However, Suiyuan had children late, while Quyuan had grandchildren early. Historian Jie Qing, with the title of annotating yuan and filling the post of doctorate disciple, was a high scorer in the Jimao township examination, and passed the palace examination with the title of Tan Hua, which was Mr. Qu's most proud thing in his later years. Therefore, he made a couplet himself: "The old man is old and has a collection of tens of thousands of books, arranges thousands of books, and writes hundreds of books; What does the young man know? He is the first in the college examination, the second in the township examination, and the third in the palace examination." The second line is also a fine tale of fame, and the first line is that without Mr. Qu's identity, there would be no such tone. I say that the gains and losses of abolishing the imperial examination are another matter, but it is inevitable that it spoils the scenery, because the anecdotes and stories of the imperial examination era, which are passed down by word of mouth, are really interesting. For example, when Ruan Wenda took the government examination, he accidentally broke off a branch of apricot blossom in the courtyard after handing in the paper, which was seen by the prefect, who gave a pair: "A small scholar, secretly hiding the spring color in his sleeves." Wenda immediately replied: "A dignified prefect, clearly observing autumn hair in his eyes." It can be said to be extremely ingenious. Also, when Wenda was the education commissioner of Zhejiang, he once served as the supervisor of the township examination, and made a couplet: "Writing thousands of words, it is the time when the locust seeds are yellow, the osmanthus fragrant bag, leaving the door with a smile, watching the full moon in the West Lake, and the tide coming in the East Zhejiang." The excitement is high and the atmosphere is grand, which is also a fine tale of the imperial examination.

### Art and Literature Scene

The "Rixin Literary Series" edited by Hu Shanyuan has been issued by Rixin Publishing House, including Hu Shanyuan's "Early Love" "My Writing Life," Zhongyuan's "Calamity," Tang Xianhua's "Transformation," Zhang Luo's "Hazy," Fang Peiyin's "Birth," Cheng Yuzhen's "Sound of Nature," Shen Ji's "Two Generations Map," Shi Qi's "Street Art," Xiao Qun's "On the Border," and other ten kinds, in this period of literary publishing decline, it is no less than a strong shot in the arm, all those who love literature and art should be eager to see it first, and it is sold in all bookstores.

Wang Jinshan's "Mountain Residence Sketches" is a collection of essays and thoughts written by the author during the war. Among them, "Ode to Flame" "Imitation Love Letter" "Mountain Residence" "Autumn Rain" and other articles, not only reflect the life of the literati in the rear, but also have many timeless writings, which have been widely circulated for a time. The book has recently been published by Zhengzhong Book Company.

The "Semi-Monthly Drama" edited by the owner of the Plum Blossom Pavilion was founded in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the sales were smooth. It was once suspended after the war. It was resumed at the end of last year. The content is more substantial than before. The third issue of the sixth volume has just been published. It costs 3,000 yuan. The general distributor is the Semi-Monthly Drama Publishing House at No. 10, Lane 434, Section 2, Zhongzheng South Road, this city.

### Record of a City in Crisis

— Chunshou Ou

Nearly ten years of selling her life has not worn away Jin Aili's loyal and honest nature. Hearing Lao Zhu say it so nakedly, she felt embarrassed on her face.

Lao Zhu looked at her very carefully.

"Aili, you are a good person! It's a pity you didn't study for a few more years."

"You don't want to teach me!" It was a reply that was both resentment and gratitude.

She also finished the cup of soy milk in front of her. Obviously, she thought that what Lao Zhu said was very reasonable, and felt that her problem had been solved, and she felt a lot more relaxed.

"If you're not angry, I'll give you the five hundred U.S. dollars now." Her hand gently covered Lao Zhu's hand, conveying a silent emotion.

Lao Zhu was not angry, but couldn't help but laugh.

"Aili, I won't be angry with you. But, I don't need money! I also have money!" He said as if coaxing a child.

"You also have money?" Jin Aili was a little surprised, but not very surprised. Because Lao Zhu was really a mystery to her. She never saw him doing any business or colluding with any officials, but she never saw him wearing ragged clothes or borrowing money from others; even a few times, she did know that Xiao Shen had borrowed money from Lao Zhu. Therefore, she simply had no idea what Lao Zhu's life was like and what his economic situation was like.

Lao Zhu nodded to her again, indicating that he did have money.

"Then why don't you leave?" The woman couldn't help but ask again.

The man knew that she wouldn't understand even if he explained, so he said vaguely:

"Many friends are together, I'm embarrassed to leave first."

"You have a conscience, I know!" Jin Aili felt a lot of emotion.

Lao Zhu felt that there was nothing to talk about, so he continued to eat heartily, and at the same time persuaded Jin Aili to eat more.

"I heard that your good friend Mrs. Hu hasn't left yet, aren't you thinking of a way for her?" Jin Aili couldn't eat anymore, and had a lot of things to say in her heart, and first mentioned .

"Old friend, not a good friend. Aili, don't say that! Friends are all the same." Lao Zhu smiled bitterly. "They really want to leave, but they can't get a car, so there's nothing they can do. Maybe they'll go to the train station again tonight to try, but a wife with two children may not be able to get on."

"Aren't you very resourceful?" Jin Aili challenged.

Lao Zhu was asked by her like this, and a belly full of complaints welled up. (38)
