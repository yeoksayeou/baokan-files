### On the Method of Voting at the Peace Conference with Japan: The US Will Consult with Us; Invitation to the Eleven-Nation Conference Temporarily Suspended

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Following China's decision to cooperate with the Soviet Union and insist on using the great power veto in the preliminary eleven-nation peace conference with Japan, the US intention to issue invitations to hold the eleven-nation conference has been abandoned. The US originally intended to issue invitations within a few days, but China's position has hardened over the past week, making it virtually necessary to hold Sino-American consultations to seek some agreement on this issue.

Britain, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and India have all expressed their willingness to hold this eleven-nation conference, adopting a two-thirds majority vote as the method of voting and prohibiting any country from using the veto.

Before China's surprising move, Britain and the US decided that, due to the urgency of the issue, it was worth ignoring the Soviet Union and proceeding with a risky conference, while hoping that the Soviet Union would change its mind at the last minute. Observers in this area, who have close contact with the situation in the Far East, have diverging opinions on the motivation behind China's decision.

One opinion is that China was stimulated by Wedemeyer's criticism of the central government and was deeply disgusted by the US's failure to provide economic assistance and its public criticism of Chinese politics, so it "shifted all its weight to the other side," reminding the US that China has a pivotal influence on decisions regarding the Far East in the Far Eastern Commission and other agreements.

Another opinion is that China's action this time is intended to bargain with the US to obtain economic assistance. The highest-level officials here admit that they lack definite indications of China's ultimate goal. They hope that in the next two weeks, with the help of talks with Foreign Minister Wang and Chinese Ambassador to the US Dr. Wellington Koo, the situation can be clarified.

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued a statement yesterday at the request of the International News Service, clarifying our country's attitude towards the peace conference with Japan. Wang stated that the resolutions of the conference should be adopted by a majority vote, but must include the unanimous vote of the four major powers (China, Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union), rather than just a two-thirds majority vote as suggested by the US.

### Wedemeyer's Report Temporarily Not to be Released

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] People here predicted today that the results of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's six-week on-the-spot investigation in China and Korea would not be released immediately. After returning to Beijing, Wedemeyer told welcoming personnel that the special envoy's report, along with recommendations, had been drafted and would soon be submitted to the State Department for review, but he remained silent on the content. He also said with a smile that any questions could be directed to Mr. Watson, the group's spokesman.

[This Newspaper News] New York, 21st Broadcast: Officials in Washington issued opinions today stating that the US is extremely willing to assist China, even to a greater extent than in the past. However, until some undesirable elements in the National Government are removed and administrative reforms are made, there is little hope for the success of further US assistance to China. General Wedemeyer has solemnly pointed out this point. If China has the sincerity to reform, it will definitely be able to accept the meaning contained in Wedemeyer's statement.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] Government commissioners stated today that the rumors that the National Government might be forced to seek rapprochement with the Soviet Union unless the US provides immediate assistance to China are absolutely untrue. This view is only the result of the growing impatience of some people with the US's failure to adopt a firm policy towards China. China has neither changed its foreign policy nor intends to do so. The biggest problem at present lies in the nature of the "supervisory" conditions attached to future US aid. Generally, officials do not object to normal supervision of the use of funds, but instinctively express concern about the concept of foreign supervision. The US must further understand this psychology of the Chinese people.

### President Zhang Inspects Anshan; Departs Today for Changchun, Then Turns to North China

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] President Zhang went to Anshan at 8:00 am on the 21st to personally inspect the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant. He was guided by Xie Shuying and Shao Yizhou of the National Resources Commission. Many provincial and municipal leaders from Shenyang followed along. The special train passed through Liaoyang at 9:00 am and stopped for ten minutes. Zhang got off the train and met a person in charge of the station, inquiring about traffic and telecommunications conditions. Arriving at the steel city at about 10:00 am, smoke filled the air. The number of departments in operation had greatly increased compared to before. Of the nine steelmaking furnaces standing tall, one with a capacity of 400 tons has been repaired and can start steelmaking in early October. The rest are being repaired and welded. One furnace in the steelmaking plant has already started smelting. All factories for rolling steel and casting machines are in operation, tense and busy, which is exciting. Of the 17 rows of coking furnaces in the coking plant, one row has been repaired. The coking whole furnace coke seems to be poured with water into the car box, forming a red-hot piece. The output of coke by-products, such as fertilizer powder and petroleum, is also high. At the steel primary rolling plant, President Zhang cut the ribbon to resume operations. A five-ton red ingot was repeatedly rolled and cut into steel blocks of various sizes. The roar of the machines was thrilling. Zhang repeatedly wished the employees success. Returning to Shenyang at 4:45 pm, Chen Cheng, concurrently director, and Chen Yanting, special commissioner of the Northeast External Affairs Department, and Sun Yueqi, vice chairman of the National Resources Commission, who returned to Shenyang on the 21st, accompanied him to visit the National Resources Commission's locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plant. After that, President Zhang discussed Northeast industrial and mining issues with Sun Yueqi, Xie Shuying, and others. At 8:00 pm, he attended a reception for provincial and municipal leaders. Zhang is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 22nd, then turn to North China for inspection.

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 21st] The Changchun Provisional Consultative Council sent a special telegram to President Zhang Qun, welcoming him to Changchun for inspection.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] President Zhang said after returning to Shenyang from Anshan on the afternoon of the 21st that his impressions were threefold: First, he admired the Japanese construction; Second, he regretted the demolition and destruction; Third, he was delighted with the working spirit of the factory employees.

### Song Ziwen Takes Charge of Guangdong; Welcomed by All Sectors in Guangzhou and Hong Kong; Luo Zhuoying Prepares to Hand Over

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] Since the news of Song Ziwen taking charge of Guangdong was released, the reaction from all parties here has been quite positive. It is generally believed that Song will have detailed plans for economic reform, financial stability, overseas Chinese investment, and industrial construction in South China. Chairman Luo Zhuoying, in preparation for the handover, convened a symposium of responsible persons under his jurisdiction. Luo read a telegram from Chairman Chiang, which stated, "It is proposed to invite you to serve in Nanjing. Comrade Song Ziwen is appointed to take over as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. The personnel of the Provincial Government will remain as they were, with no major changes. Please inform them to continue to serve diligently." Luo Min was deeply moved by the Chairman's concern for his subordinates and then stated: "I have always believed that public servants should only work hard in their positions and should not have the idea of political territory. Personal changes in work positions are irrelevant to the overall provincial administration. As for the handover, it should be done quickly and accurately, and there should be no negligence, especially regarding money and public property."

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th, United Press International] All Chinese newspapers in Guangzhou unanimously welcomed Song Ziwen's appointment to Guangdong. These newspapers pointed out that first, Song has always maintained prestige in Guangdong; second, Song is an ideal figure to oversee the long-promoted five-year construction plan for Guangdong; third, Song is an ideal figure for foreign negotiations, as Song is from Hainan Island and is very interested in the development of South China. In 1936, he had consulted with the British to assist in the development of South China, but Japan entered South China in 1938, causing Song's overall plan to fall through. However, a subordinate of Song's recently resumed negotiations with the British, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also participated in the talks.

### Shao Lizi's Talk Denies That He Will Be Appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union

[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, stated today: "The rumors that I will be appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. I am very grateful to the press for giving me such an important position, but I have not heard anything about it myself." According to diplomatic sources here, Shao has past experience as an envoy to the Soviet Union, and it is still very possible that he will be reappointed this time.

### Chen Zhiping Asks Overseas Chinese to Support the Government in Suppressing the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] The General Chamber of Commerce of our overseas Chinese here and several other overseas Chinese public associations held a banquet last night to welcome Envoy Chen Zhiping, who is going to Nanjing to report on his work.

He also said that the political situation in the motherland can indeed affect the status of overseas Chinese, so he emphasized that our overseas Chinese have the responsibility to support the suppression of the rebellion and the revival of the country, and our government also has absolute confidence in defeating the Communist Party, but all Chinese people should obey their leaders and do their best to fulfill their patriotic duties.

### Four Supervisory Committee Members Return to Nanjing After Investigating the Use of Foreign Exchange; Generally Satisfied, No Discrimination Against Foreign Businesses; Drafting of Report to Begin Today

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] He Hanwen, Du Guangxun, Wang Guanwu, and Gu Fengxiang, the four Supervisory Committee members who went to Shanghai to investigate the government's use of foreign exchange and the applications for foreign exchange by Yangtze, Fuzhong, and other companies, have completed their work after two weeks of investigation in Shanghai. They returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 21st, and in the afternoon, they went together to visit President Yu to report on their findings. They decided to hold a meeting on the 22nd to discuss drafting the report. With the assistance of all parties, the four Supervisory Committee members were able to work smoothly and obtained a great deal of information, collecting a large number of files. Because all parties are very concerned about this case, they plan to submit the report within a week.

He and his party went to Shanghai on the 7th. During their stay in Shanghai, they worked very hard and refused unnecessary social engagements. The focus of the investigation was on the application, approval, quota allocation, and import of foreign exchange. They successively went to the China Trust Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other agencies related to the supply of materials for investigation. They also investigated the various foreign exchange materials of the Central Bank's Import and Export Commission and other agencies, as well as the issuance of permits. In order to understand the actual situation, they also went to the customs and the wharves of Gonghexiang and other companies for inspection. Finally, they went to Yangtze, Fuzhong, China Construction, Jialing, Nanyang Enterprise, and other related companies to review files. Some of their accounts are being checked by two officials from the Ministry of Audit who are still staying in Shanghai. They will also be able to return to Nanjing next week.

According to a Supervisory Committee member who went to investigate, the most profound impression of this trip to Shanghai was that the government's past management of foreign exchange was too lax, and there was indeed waste. It is said that the government originally had about 800 million US dollars in foreign exchange, but by the end of last year, more than 300 million US dollars had been spent, which is a pity. Until recently, the control has been too tight. Since the issuance of self-supplied foreign exchange import permits was suspended on the 18th of last month, many materials have been stockpiled at the wharves and cannot be extracted. Among them are many necessities or production raw materials, which will definitely affect production. When they were in Shanghai, they went to visit a certain wharf and saw that there were more than 300 cars that could not enter due to non-compliance with procedures. If combined with other wharves, the number would be five or six hundred. It is heard that the total value of these materials is as high as 100 million US dollars. Since Shanghai cannot transport them in, it seems possible that they will be smuggled into the country through Hong Kong, which would be another loss to the country. The economic circles in Shanghai hope that a reasonable solution can be found. The Supervisory Committee members will also make suggestions on this.

The Supervisory Committee members stated that they are generally satisfied with the current foreign exchange policy, in addition to making suggestions on the above-mentioned phenomena. At the same time, this investigation of foreign exchange is the third investigation in recent years. The suggestions that were made before will not be raised again this time, and any suggestions will be based on new materials. Chinese and foreign merchants have complained about the foreign exchange policy, but some of them have not handled the necessary procedures in accordance with the law, and they cannot be held fully responsible. As for the use of foreign exchange by foreign merchants, a certain Supervisory Committee member said in a solemn tone: "It can be said that there is absolutely no discrimination against foreign merchants in our country's foreign exchange policy today." If individual units are considered, the amount of foreign exchange applied for by foreign merchants is often greater than that of Chinese business circles. However, our country's foreign exchange is limited, so not everyone can be satisfied. This situation should be pointed out to correct international perceptions. The investigation of Yangtze and Fuzhong will be combined into one report, rather than preparing a separate report.

### Shanghai Municipal Council and University Presidents Express Their Opinions on Wedemeyer's Statement; US President Expresses Concern and Asks the Consul General in Shanghai to Forward the Message

[Central News Agency, this city news] After Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement on the difficulties in China was released, the presidents of eight universities in this city, including St. John's, Shanghai University, Soochow University, Aurora University, and Datong University, jointly sent a telegram to US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and other authorities on August 31, expressing their position on the educational sector. On September 5, leaders of seventeen industrial and commercial groups, including the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Banking, Finance, and Textile Industries, jointly sent a telegram to the US authorities, expressing their opinions from their own perspectives. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, has successively received telegrams from the US President, instructing him to convey to the eight universities and seventeen groups that the US government attaches great importance to the opinions expressed after receiving the telegrams. The full text of the US Consul General's two messages is translated below: "(Titles omitted)" The statement jointly sent to President Truman and other US officials by your society and sixteen other groups on September 5 has been received. I am now instructed by the government of my country to assure you, on behalf of President Truman and other officials, that great attention is paid to the opinions in the statement, and that separate replies have been sent to the sixteen other groups who signed the statement. Davis, September 19 (The letter to the presidents of the eight universities is similar in meaning, so it is omitted).

### Prohibition Involves Too Many People; A Reasonable Solution Should Be Sought

[Another Telegram] In addition to investigating the use of foreign exchange, the four Supervisory Committee members, including He Hanwen, were also ordered to investigate the "June 7th Project." It is also heard that while in Shanghai, they also investigated some of the current social problems in Shanghai and will submit proposals. According to Committee Member Wang Guanwu, the most concerning social phenomena in Shanghai are: (1) The gap between the rich and the poor is too wide. The extravagant spend hundreds of millions without hesitation, while the poor live a subhuman life whose suffering is unimaginable. Although they have no complaints against the country, the result of the evolution is enough to affect social harmony. (2) Shanghai's population is too dense and the air is polluted. Methods should be developed to disperse the population. (3) Refugees from northern Jiangsu, western Anhui, and southern Shandong gather in Shanghai, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, which is enough to stimulate prices. Good policies should be sought. (4) Although the ban on dancing is a government order, it involves too many people and cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. A reasonable solution should be sought.

### Xinjiang Incident Will Not Expand; The People All Aspire to Peace; Government Committee Member Bao Erhan Arrives in Nanjing for the First Time to Talk

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Government Committee Member Bao Erhan flew to Nanjing at 4:00 pm on the 21st, accompanied by Yi Min, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Construction. Zhang Zhizhong, Yu Dawei, and many others went to greet him. Bao looked energetic and happy. After getting off the plane, he said to Yu Dawei, "It's been ten years since we last met," and then got into a car to his residence. Bao came this time to take office as a government committee member. When reporters asked why he had come to Nanjing to take office so late, he said, "Since I was appointed as a member of the National Government, I have been preparing to come to Nanjing, but I asked for a three-month leave due to illness, and it was not until today that I was able to make the trip." Bao is scheduled to visit President Chiang on the 22nd to report on the political situation in Xinjiang and make suggestions to the government based on his observations. On the evening of the 22nd, Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet at his residence to welcome him and introduce him to the government committee members and key government officials. Bao is a Tatar. This trip is his first time in Nanjing.

When reporters asked Bao Erhan about the recent developments in the Xinjiang incident, he said, "My opinion is similar to that of Director Zhang Zhizhong. I believe that if it can be resolved peacefully, there will be no problem. As for Yining's response to Director Zhang, it is because the responsible persons in Yining have gone to the Tianshan Mountains for summer vacation. Currently, transportation between Yining and Dihua is normal. I firmly believe that the incident will not worsen. If they return to Yining, there will definitely be a possibility of continuing negotiations. The people of Xinjiang still very much desire peace. To seek stability in the borderlands, Xinjiang must be made Chinese territory forever." According to Bao's entourage, Bao studied in Germany in his early years and was a classmate of Yu Dawei. He can read German, Russian, and Chinese. He had previously translated the Three Principles of the People from Chinese into Uighur to introduce the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People to the people of Xinjiang. He is currently writing a dictionary that translates between Russian, Uighur, and Chinese, which is about to be completed and is planned to be published in Nanjing. This will be a great help in promoting cultural exchange between Uighurs and Han Chinese. Bao said that within an hour of their arrival in Nanjing, they felt that the environment was beautiful and very suitable for writing. Bao then introduced Yi Min, the director of the Department of Construction who came with him. Yi cannot speak Mandarin and was translated. He said that the purpose of this trip was to solve the livelihood of the people of Xinjiang, because Xinjiang is an economically backward borderland. Currently, he is starting to make suggestions, starting with water conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and transportation. Last year, a five-year plan was drafted, but it has not yet been fully completed. There are two reasons for this: (1) Economic difficulties; (2) Lack of talent. With regard to the former, the National Government has allocated 5 billion new currency (equivalent to 25 billion legal currency). It has now been decided to use 2 billion to develop agriculture and animal husbandry, 1 billion to establish an iron and steel factory, and the remaining 2 billion to purchase machinery and recruit talent.

### Xinjiang Provincial Iron and Steel Factory to Be Completed in Two Months, Says Yi Min, Director of the Department of Construction

The iron and steel factory is scheduled to be completed in two months, after which it can produce ten tons of iron per day. Regarding the issue of talent, the National Government has approved the dispatch of various talents to Xinjiang. Director Yi Min came to Nanjing this time to invite technicians to go there. Thirty people are needed in the construction sector and twelve in the health department. Finally, Yi hopes that the funds provided by the National Government next year will be increased again.

### Scope of Freedom of Speech to Be Broadened; Publication Law to Be Amended; Draft Has Been Finalized and Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] As constitutional government is approaching, the scope of freedom of speech will be further broadened. The current Publication Law was amended in July of the 26th year of the Republic of China and is no longer in line with the current political environment. The relevant authorities have decided to amend it. The Ministries of Interior, Judicial Administration, Foreign Affairs, and Propaganda have repeatedly consulted on this matter and drafted an amendment to the Publication Law, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. It is reported that some of the main provisions of the draft amendment to the Publication Law are very different from the current Publication Law. The important ones are as follows:

Regulations on the Publication of Publications by Foreigners in Our Country | The current Publication Law does not have any regulations on this. The draft amendment adds a separate article in Chapter 1, General Provisions, stipulating that "Foreigners may apply for the publication of publications in accordance with the provisions of this Law and comply with all laws and regulations of China regarding publications. However, if the publication laws of the foreigner's home country discriminate against the people of China, they shall not enjoy the treatment granted by this Law." Simplification of Registration Procedures | The draft amendment stipulates that the deadline for provincial and municipal governments to approve registration and for internal authorities to issue registration certificates is "within ten days" (the original stipulation was "within twenty-eight days"). The original method of "copying the registration application form to the Central Propaganda Department for registration" is cancelled, but the draft amendment adds "Purpose of Publication" to the items that should be stated in the registration application form.

Reduction of Government Interference | The draft amendment deletes all articles in the current Publication Law regarding the interference of the competent government authorities in publishers. A total of two articles are deleted: Article 12, "If a newspaper is engaged in the business of publishing news dispatches, the local competent government authority may, when necessary, send personnel to inspect its social affairs group and distribution status." Article 20, "Political leaflets or slogans may not be printed or distributed without the permission of the local competent government authority."

Changes in Restrictions on Matters to Be Published | A total of three points are changed in the draft amendment: (1) Article 21, the original text was "Publications may not contain the following statements or propaganda: 1. Intending to undermine the Kuomintang or violate the Three Principles of the People. 2. Intending to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China. 3. Intending to disrupt public order." It is amended to: "Publications may not contain the following statements or propaganda: 1. Intending to subvert the government or endanger the Republic of China. 2. Harming diplomatic relations. 3. Intending to harm public interests or disrupt social order." (2) The draft amendment adds the following two articles: 1. "Publications may not contain statements that harm the reputation of the heads of state of our country or friendly countries." 2. "Publications may not contain statements that harm the reputation or credit of others." 3. The original Article 23: "Publications may not publish debates on prohibited public litigation cases." The draft amendment adds: "Publications may not criticize events that are in the process of litigation."

Amendment of Punishment Methods | A total of three points are amended in the draft amendment: (1) The original Article 34 stipulates that "If the statements in a publication, in addition to violating the provisions of the Criminal Law, shall be handled in accordance with the law, and if they violate the provisions of Article 22 and the circumstances are more serious, the Ministry of Interior or the local competent government authority may, after submitting to the Ministry of Interior for approval, prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary." The draft amendment changes it to "and may seize it when necessary, or impose a fine of up to 10,000 yuan." The original text of the same article was "If the publication in the preceding paragraph is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a period of time." It is amended to "If the publication in the preceding paragraph is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a period of time for the first offense, and its publication may be permanently suspended for the second offense." (2) The amount of fines for publishers and editors, originally stipulated as no more than 100 yuan, 30 yuan, and 20 yuan, is changed to no more than 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and more than ten times but less than one hundred times the price of the publication. (3) All eleven articles in Chapter 6, Penal Provisions, of the current Publication Law are deleted. The draft amendment only adds one article at the end of Chapter 5: "If the provisions of this Law are violated, in addition to the penalties imposed in accordance with the preceding articles, if the crimes stipulated in the Criminal Law are violated, they shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law, but the publisher, editor, author, and printer shall be treated as accomplices."

After the above amendments, the current Publication Law, which has seven chapters and fifty-four articles, has been reduced to six chapters and forty-six articles.

It is said that they are all wronged ghosts buried by the Communist bandits themselves. The market in Shucheng has not yet fully recovered. The Communist bandits extorted 150 million yuan from the local area during their initial ten-day occupation, and then looted the residents. Although the houses survived, nine out of ten homes are empty. Even children express bitter hatred when mentioning the Communist bandits. When the Communist bandits occupied and fled the Shucheng County government, even the cooking pots were looted, showing the extent of their poverty. Currently, a certain division of the Nationalist troops is stationed in the city, and the people are returning one after another, resuming their original occupations. However, the disaster has been so great that relief and assistance must be provided quickly. In addition, the bridges on the Shucheng-Hefei highway and the long-distance telephone lines between Anqing and Hefei were all destroyed by the Communist bandits. The Anhui Highway Bureau and the Hefei Telecommunications Bureau quickly repaired them in a very short time, and traffic between Shucheng and Hefei has returned to normal.

[Another Telegram] Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian led relevant personnel from the provincial government to Shucheng today to convene a meeting with local agencies, giving instructions on relief and mobilizing civilian self-defense, and returned to Hefei in the evening.

### Liu Weichi Talks About Overseas Chinese Universal Suffrage, Adopting the Free Election Method, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Negotiating with Opposing Countries

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese participating in universal suffrage, this reporter asked Liu Weichi, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who came to Shanghai for official business, on the 21st. He said: The countries in North and South America are holding friendly attitudes towards our overseas Chinese compatriots participating in universal suffrage, so the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese in those countries can be carried out as scheduled and in an orderly manner. It is regrettable that some countries in Southeast Asia oppose this move, which is obviously unaware of the truth. At present, the hope of our government is that the governments of these countries can understand the intention of our move and give us the same friendly assistance as the countries in North and South America. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently negotiating with the opposing countries, hoping that this wish will eventually be realized. However, if those countries still do not understand, then our country can only adopt other methods to remedy the situation, because overseas Chinese compatriots should be treated the same as domestic compatriots, which has always been the consistent policy of our government, and their civil rights should be effectively guaranteed. As for what method will be adopted for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese, Liu said: The Minqing parties recently expressed the hope that political parties would nominate for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese, but overseas Chinese in various places hope to exercise their free will, so it has been decided to adopt the method of free election for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese.

Editorial

### An Appeal for the Global Situation!

The Second United Nations General Assembly opened at Lake Success in New York. In less than a week, the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union delivered speeches one after another, sharply contradicting each other. This not only caused waves on Lake Success but also made the growing trend of the world dividing into two major blocs even clearer. French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, who took it upon himself to bridge the gap between the Anglo-American and Soviet blocs, also expressed despair about the success of the United Nations. He said, "The conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, and the situation is very serious; it seems impossible to promote compromise between the two sides." Judging from these few words of Foreign Minister Bidault, it is clear that the current global situation is almost like "the mountain is about to be stormed by winds from the approaching rain." Those of us who have suffered the scourge of two world wars should rise up and appeal to the great politicians for the sake of the global situation.

Before the opening of the Second United Nations General Assembly, people had long anticipated the difficulties ahead, believing that the diplomatic war between the United States and the Soviet Union might inevitably "come to a showdown" in the meeting place. After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall, in order to strive for the success of the United Nations, first launched a diplomatic offensive. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to advocating strict restrictions on the exercise of the veto power, he formally proposed to the Assembly the establishment of a 55-nation standing committee, which would meet regularly to specifically study issues concerning peace and security. At the same time, he pointed out that there are seven major issues that urgently need to be resolved: the veto power issue; the issue of increasing the power of the General Assembly; the Korean issue; the Greek civil war issue; the atomic energy issue; the disarmament issue; and the Palestinian issue. Secretary of State Marshall's series of speeches not only acknowledged the failure of the Security Council but also marked the first shot in the United States' diplomatic war against the Soviet Union.

Soviet representative Andrei Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th. The sharpness of the wording was far beyond our expectations, and international etiquette and diplomatic language were almost completely disregarded. He bluntly pointed out that Secretary of State Marshall's proposal violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The main points of his speech can be summarized as follows: The United Kingdom and the United States are implementing political measures outside the United Nations framework, disregarding the interests of the United Nations. This policy threatens the existence of the United Nations; Among all the activities of the United Nations, the most unsuccessful is the prolonged delay in the disarmament issue, and the United Kingdom and the United States, which have no intention of disarming, should be held responsible; The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe are far from the principles of the United Nations. The United States is attempting to adopt a dictatorial policy toward other countries; The United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to utilize Germany's heavy industry, and especially want to make the Ruhr region the economic base of the United States in Europe; The United Nations should take action regarding the presence of British troops in Greece and Transjordan, the presence of American troops in China, Argentina's non-compliance with the United Nations resolution on the Spanish question, and South Africa's failure to submit a trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa; The Indonesian incident can only be described as an act of aggression; The Iranian issue should not be included in the Security Council's agenda; The accusations against Greece's northern border neighbors are without factual basis; Marshall's submission of the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion violates the declaration on the Korean issue that was previously agreed upon by the foreign ministers of the three nations in Moscow; He opposes Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation standing committee, pointing out that its purpose is to circumvent the Security Council. In his speech, Undersecretary Vyshinsky even unceremoniously placed the label of "war-mongers" on the heads of some American politicians, which naturally aroused the opposition of the American government and public. As House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said, "The final confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable. Today's world must make a choice between two mutually exclusive and irreconcilable philosophies of life as soon as possible. The Soviet Union's open goal is to conquer the world by force, so the United States should maintain its leading position and responsibility in the United Nations at any cost."

From this, it can be seen that both the United States and the Soviet Union are tending toward extremes and are indeed on the verge of breaking apart. The outcome of this conference seems to make it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union to go their separate ways. Whether we are considering our own interests or the interests of the entire world, we ultimately feel that the post-war world should be united rather than divided, and that the United States and the Soviet Union should compromise rather than break apart. There are certainly many factors that have caused the current stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the most important one is that post-war international politicians and diplomats are often blinded by their own interests and cannot use their political wisdom to transcend narrow national concepts and selfish psychology. Totalitarian ideology and power politics are still at play. Whether it is a foreign ministers' conference or a United Nations General Assembly, the great powers are still engaged in empty dreams, not only failing to solve any problems but also deepening the rifts between nations. Therefore, the most important thing to do now is to eliminate the suspicions between the great powers. If the representatives of all countries can speak truthfully and act with sincerity, treat each other with sincerity, and be willing to compromise with each other, and if everyone prioritizes world peace, then the United Nations will not be afraid of failure, and the existence or abolition of the veto power will not be a major issue at all. In short, at this point in time, the world has reached a stage of division or unity, and the United Nations is also at a critical juncture of success or failure. We hope that the politicians of all countries will appeal to the conscience of mankind when discussing current international issues. We believe that the inherent conscience of mankind will be able to overcome any divisions and obstacles in current international issues.

### New Measures in Postal Service

At a time when administrative efficiency is generally low, we find the daily progress of China's postal service particularly commendable. The postal service in our country has always adopted a policy of "supporting the postal service with the postal service." Before the War of Resistance, prices were stable, and it was able to be self-sufficient. However, during the War of Resistance, prices soared, but the increase in postal rates lagged behind prices. Recently, the government has also stopped subsidizing state-owned enterprises, so it is not difficult to imagine the economic difficulties of the postal service. However, despite the economic difficulties of the postal service, innovative measures continue to emerge, which is truly worthy of praise.

The Directorate General of Posts works day and night, and the various branch offices have no holidays. If it is inconvenient for citizens who live far from the post office to travel, there are mobile post offices that drive by on time. As long as they wait by the roadside, they can send letters or remit money. In terms of delivery, it has become even faster since the implementation of the district numbering system. At the same time, a campaign to eliminate "dead letters" has been launched. Therefore, the postal service in Shanghai today can truly be described as "stable," "cheap," and "fast."

This rare achievement in the postal service is not only praised by public opinion but also cherished by the people. Facts are the best publicity, so there is no need for us to say more. However, recently, as the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the postal authorities have issued a special order prohibiting postmen from soliciting "festival money" and encouraging people to report such incidents in order to change customs and habits. This enlightened measure deserves our support even more.

The postal authorities are not only doing their best to improve the postal service so that it fully serves the people but also want to further change the social atmosphere. Its significance is particularly significant. We hope that citizens will work together to help, and we hope that other public utilities will respond to this call.

### UN General Assembly to Discuss Holy Land Issue; British Cabinet Agrees on Countermeasures; Mandate over the Area May Be Relinquished; Willing to Consider New UN Proposals

[Our Dispatch] London, 21st – The extent to which British troops in Palestine will withdraw or be reduced will depend on the outcome of the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue.

[Our Dispatch] New York, 21st – US Congressman Martin expressed his views today, stating: A consensus among the majority of nations in the UN on the Palestine issue could lead to an early resolution of one of the most difficult problems in the world. He hoped that a resolution could be reached soon, as the issue has been delayed for too long, causing significant suffering to both Jewish and Arab peoples.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Britain has decided that unless the United Nations can soon propose a viable plan for Palestine, Britain will relinquish its mandate over the Holy Land and withdraw its troops stationed there. Reliable sources believe that although a special meeting of the British Cabinet has decided on the principle of troop withdrawal, any new proposals put forward by the UN will still be considered by the British government. Today's special cabinet meeting was the first time that the entire cabinet discussed the proposals of the UN Special Committee on Palestine. Prime Minister Attlee convened this meeting for two reasons: one, to obtain cabinet members' opposition to the majority and minority proposals of the UN Special Committee; two, to decide on the position that the British delegation to the UN General Assembly should take during next week's debate on the Palestine issue. Colonial Secretary Creech Jones rushed back to London from the West Indies Conference in Jamaica to attend, and he will travel to New York to personally present Britain's views on the Palestine issue to the UN General Assembly. It is understood that the main points of discussion at today's special meeting of the British Cabinet included: Acknowledging that the UN is unlikely to come up with a solution for Palestine at this stage that Britain can implement alone or with the assistance of other countries; Acknowledging that the continued presence of 100,000 British troops in the Holy Land is contrary to Britain's principle of disarmament to replenish the workforce needed for economic recovery and industry; Although British troops are stationed in the Holy Land, the situation there continues to deteriorate, making it impossible to maintain the area in a dangerous state.

### Austin Delivers Speech; Rebuts Vyshinsky's Views; Denies US Plotting War Against USSR

[United Press, New York, 20th] The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Warren Austin, delivered a speech tonight at the United Nations Association of the United States, criticizing the speech delivered by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly the other day.

It is said that this kind of speech, with its wanton accusations and absolute slander of the United States' motives, and defamation of individuals and groups, has dismayed the majority of Americans who firmly believe in the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions. This kind of speech may be effective for the Soviet people, frightening them and making them believe that the United States intends to attack the Soviet Union by force. But in the United States, the opposite is true. The American government and people firmly adhere to the principles and policies of the United Nations, regardless of external provocations. We do not believe that Mr. Vyshinsky intends to damage our country's honor. The United States still believes that peace is the unanimous goal of all countries and peoples. We believe that those who follow the Soviet Union have impure motives and are prone to hatred and war, rather than affection and peace. On the contrary, we have guaranteed our full support to the United Nations, hoping to spare our children and grandchildren from the ravages of war, because the United Nations is an instrument of peace.

### Lie Urges Major Powers to Coordinate

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie delivered a speech tonight at the United Nations Association of the United States, criticizing the major powers for their responsibility in the world organization's stalemate. He said that the world is aware that the United Nations is facing a serious test, and that the differences between the major powers are clearly responsible for this. Heated debates on these differences have now begun in the United Nations General Assembly, and the people of the world are frightened and uneasy to see the major powers who led the establishment of the United Nations now clearly confronting each other. Lie's remarks seem to be indirectly urging the major powers to coordinate their differences.

### US Submits Application for Italian Membership to Security Council

[United Press, New York, 20th] The United States formally proposed tonight that the Security Council re-discuss the issue of admitting Italy to the United Nations at its next meeting. Italy's application was previously vetoed due to Soviet opposition, which argued that no action could be taken until the peace treaty came into effect. Now that the Italian peace treaty came into effect on Monday, this obstacle has been removed. News from Moscow suggests that the Soviet Union may be prepared to vote in favor of Italy's membership, but only if the Security Council also approves the admission of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] Finland officially applied to join the United Nations as a member today. The Allied peace treaty with Finland was ratified and came into effect a few days ago.

### Stimson Does Not Believe Soviet Union Wants War; Argues US Should Maintain Strong Military Power

[Reuters, New York, 21st] Former US Secretary of War Henry Stimson delivered a speech here today, expressing his strong belief that no Soviet politician or citizen truly wants war. But at the same time, he argued that the United States should maintain a strong military power to prevent the possibility of Soviet leaders resorting to war when forced to do so. Stimson said, "Regardless of the theoretical basis of Soviet policy, we believe that at least some Soviet leaders are serious about facts rather than illusions. I served as Secretary of War during the isolationist era and again during a period of courageous and generous action. I have experienced the adverse effects of restricted action and the vast power of full action. I know that the United States is capable of coping. We should immediately tell the Soviet Union that a non-aggressive Soviet Union need not fear us, and we should also make it clear that the non-communist countries of the West must survive in economic and political stability. If we do so, the Soviet leaders will gradually change their minds."

### British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Paris to Preside Over Final Meeting of European Economic Conference; Unlikely to Attend UN General Assembly in US

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin arrived at Orly Airport in Paris this afternoon from London to preside over the final plenary session of the 16-nation European Economic Conference on Monday. After disembarking from the plane, Bevin drove directly to the British Embassy. Bevin told reporters that he was pleased with the agreement reached at the Sixteen Nations Conference and with the agreement of US Undersecretary of State Clayton.

He also believes that the US government will understand the urgency of Europe's financial needs and will quickly take measures to implement the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. Bevin could not specify how many days he would stay in Paris, but indicated that he was unlikely to attend the UN General Assembly in the United States. He also expressed his views on Marshall and Vyshinsky. In addition to Bevin, other leaders from various countries who have arrived in Paris to attend Monday's final conference include Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera, Italian Foreign Minister Carlo Sforza, and Austrian Foreign Minister Karl Gruber. Dutch Foreign Minister Eelco van Kleffens is also scheduled to arrive here on Monday morning.

### All Professional Dancers in Shanghai: Petition Madame Chiang Kai-shek: Hoping for Reconsideration on the Dance Ban

[Our Reporter] Since the central government's ban on dancing order reached this city, dance industry workers have become increasingly panicked. It is reported that the dance industry union has decided to convene another general meeting at New Sen Lin at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, and after the meeting, petition the Municipal Council to request that the council consider the special circumstances of this city when discussing this proposal and extend the deadline appropriately. Furthermore, the dancers in this city feel that the dance ban deadline is imminent, so they specially launched a collective signature campaign and submitted a letter to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The full text is excerpted as follows:

"Your Excellency Madame Chiang: This time, the government has decided to ban dancing in order to vigorously promote frugality. Although we, as weak women, use dancing as our profession and have shallow knowledge, we also know how to love ourselves and our country. We are determined to abandon extravagance and practice frugality. However, in order to struggle against hunger and prolong our ant-like lives, we dare to offer our sincerity regarding the prohibition of commercial dancing, and respectfully request that Your Excellency act as a patron. In our opinion, commercial dancing itself is not extravagant; those who consider it extravagant are using the convenience of dance halls to engage in the sale of other luxury goods or luxury-related supplementary businesses. If the goal is frugality, it is sufficient to abolish the aforementioned luxury goods sales or luxury-related supplementary businesses to achieve the goal. Moreover, all dance halls have already automatically stopped selling various foreign wines and expensive drinks to cooperate with the authorities' frugality efforts and only offer tea and music for people's entertainment. Since there is no violation of frugality, there is no need to ban it. It is like restaurants and automobiles; only limiting luxury dishes or limiting the use of excessive gasoline is the target of frugality, and the operation of restaurants or the use of automobiles are not fundamentally prohibited. Although the nature is different, the meaning is the same. Moreover, there are already more than 5,000 of us who are only dancers, and countless others, directly and indirectly, rely on this for a living. Once their livelihoods are cut off, the resulting tragedy will be indescribable. Among us professional dancers, there are those who have lost their parents in childhood, are lonely and destitute, those who are young widows with mouths to feed, those whose parents are disabled and cannot work, or those whose parents are unemployed and have no means of support. Although their backgrounds are different, their suffering is the same. All of them use their dancing income to support their families. Who does not have parents, and forget shame? Who is a daughter, and willingly make a career in holding? Who can bear to have their unclean bodies and minds be despised by others? However, driven by life, they have to force a smile to cover the pain in their hearts and earn a living. Every time they think of their tragic experiences and miserable fates, they cannot help but cover their faces and weep. How can they have the heart to pursue luxury, be intoxicated, and live extravagantly? The family burden of professional dancers is already heavy, so there is no need for government supervision. They are striving for frugality at all times and in all places. Even if there are a few who forget their roots, they should not be seen as the whole. If the government only sees dancing as extravagance and does not understand the hardships of dancers' lives and suddenly bans it, it will not only cut off the livelihoods of our weak women but also leave the majority of related personnel with no way to survive. Because in the short term, there are neither opportunities for career change nor the ability to change careers. The ending of their tragic fate will inevitably lead to becoming a scourge of society, and the harm will be ten or a hundred times greater than dancing. This is definitely not the goal of the authorities banning dancing for the sake of frugality. Therefore, we dare to make this appeal with tears and respectfully request Your Excellency to show the virtue of God's love for life and pity the dying lives of weak women. Please turn to the government authorities and make a national suggestion to reconsider the ban on dancing so as not to let thousands of people be cut off from their livelihoods and all means of survival. With respect and fear, we await your order. The entire body of Shanghai's Allied Dance Women."

### Please Eat Government-Priced Mooncakes

The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching in the blink of an eye, and food stores are competing to make mooncakes for the market. The prices are exorbitant, which is staggering. It is reported that the municipal government, in order to cooperate with the frugal consumption movement, believes that mooncakes are non-essential consumer goods and should be restricted. It is currently drafting measures to set mandatory prices for Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes.

### China Tanker Company Hosts Guests to Tour the Yong Hong Tanker: Oil Tanks Composed of Multiple Isolated Units: Equipped with Steam and Other Equipment to Prevent Fires

[Our Reporter] The China Tanker Company's Class A tanker, Yong Hong No. 201, has recently been repaired and specially invited guests to visit yesterday. Chairman Weng Wenhao also attended in person. The only thing that set this reception apart from the rest was the strict prohibition of smoking.

The Yong Hong was manufactured by the American Northwest Bridge and Iron Company in 1921. The ship is 481 feet 2 inches long, 60 feet wide, and has a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It has a gross tonnage of 8,206 tons and a deadweight of 11,900 tons. The ship has a total of 18 oil tanks and 10 side ballast tanks.

### Following Li Ze: New New Company's Acting General Manager: Xiao Zongjun Accused of Aiding the Enemy: Investing in Building Ships and Selling them for Enemy Military Use

[Our Reporter] The case of Li Ze, General Manager of the New New Company, being accused of being a traitor is still in the High Court for retrial. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another has risen. Xiao Zongjun, the acting general manager of the company, has also been accused of communicating with and aiding the enemy. He was summoned for questioning some time ago, but Xiao claimed to be ill and did not appear in court. His lawyer filed a petition for postponement. It is rumored that the details of the case are quite complicated. The main points of the accusation are as follows: Xiao is from Guangdong, 42 years old, and the brother-in-law of the economic traitor Shen Changqing. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, Xiao and his cousin Xiao Xichang used the strong financial resources of the Longchang Shipyard, Xingren Enterprise Company, Xingren Real Estate Company, and China Industrial Bank, and also used the financial power of his wife's brother, Shen Changgeng, to invest in building ships and selling them to the enemy army for the enemy's military material transportation. More than 20 enemy ships were funded one after another, one of which was built exclusively by Xiao's private investment and sold to the puppet Anhui Provincial Government, specifically for the transportation agency jointly established by the puppet government and the enemy military liaison department.

At that time, it coincided with the period when Luo Junqiang and Lin Baisheng were in charge, so a part of the ship price could not be settled. Xiao repeatedly entrusted Ye Xuesong, Cai Meishun, and Li Weiqi to negotiate and collect the money. All the officials during the tenure of Luo and Lin, as well as senior employees in companies such as Longchang and Xingren, knew about this process. A little investigation can prove it. At the same time, there are ledgers of Longchang, Xingren, and Xiao himself, as well as bank and money house checks of each company, which can be thoroughly investigated. Also, during the enemy-puppet period, Xiao colluded with Cai Yichengren, an important member of the enemy's military intelligence agency, and the enemy chief Major General Yoshino. When Xiao secretly went to Hong Kong and Guangdong, he brought a large number of valuable Western medicines to ingratiate himself with the enemy chief. After returning to Shanghai, he was ordered to purchase a large amount of food and military supplies and transport them to Guangzhou to aid the enemy. The person in charge of this matter in Guangzhou was Sha Ji Liang Qiuji. An investigation will reveal the truth. The judicial authorities believe that the case is quite serious and are paying close attention to it. They will conduct a thorough investigation and expect surprising developments in the coming days.

### New Generator Installed in Pudong: Power Generation Increases by 2,000 Kilowatts

The Pudong Electric Company has installed a new mobile generator that can generate 2,300 kilowatts at night and 2,000 kilowatts during the day. However, the highest efficiency has not been achieved due to some cooling equipment that still needs to be improved. The generator was officially put into operation on the company's second anniversary of its resumption of business the other day. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, was invited to visit and delivered a speech to all employees, stating: "Each power generation company in this city is currently operating independently due to regional relationships. However, the power supply in this city must have a comprehensive plan for unified allocation. I sincerely hope that the company will be broad-minded and participate in the joint electric company organization to implement this plan."

### Rickshaw Driver Killed Under the Wheels: Jeep Causes Accident and Flees: Found Based on Paint Marks: Romanian Driver Arrested

[Our Reporter] At around 0:25 AM yesterday morning, a rickshaw puller, Wang Zhongxing (from Funing, 25 years old), was driving past the entrance of No. 134 Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road when he was suddenly hit by an American military jeep. The rickshaw was destroyed, and the driver died. At the time, the American soldier responsible for the accident drove away at full speed to escape punishment. Afterwards, the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, after being notified, urgently ordered team leader Gu Qiwen and Shui Quan and others to lead officers to investigate. As a result, broken traces were found on the red paint behind the rickshaw. Based on this, officers were dispatched to investigate several locations, including the Racecourse, Jiangwan, and the Broadway Building. At 3:00 AM, the Jeep card (identified as National Shanghai 1456) that caused the accident was found inside the American Military Resistance to Japan Storage Office in the Racecourse. It was determined that the front bumper was stained with red paint, and the driver was identified as a Romanian named George. He was arrested at No. 2, Lane 339, Linsen Middle Road and taken to the police station for interrogation. The body of the rickshaw driver who was killed was sent to the Changde Road autopsy room to await the District Prosecutor's Office to send personnel for examination.

### Rapid Oil Tanker Transportation

The difference between the structure of an oil tanker and an ordinary transport ship is that the oil tank is composed of several compartments. Oil loading and unloading is done using oil pumps, which is extremely fast and safe. Because the ship's hold is composed of multiple compartments, even if there is danger during navigation, the ship can still maintain buoyancy under normal circumstances and will not sink.

As for the main fire-fighting equipment of an oil tanker, each oil tank and side tank has a steam pipe connected to the boiler room. In the event of a fire, steam is put into each oil tank where the fire is to remove the air inside the tank, thereby reducing the oxygen in the air and extinguishing the fire. In addition, there are fire hoses and foam fire extinguishers installed on the deck and in necessary places to prevent fires in various parts of the deck.

### Opening of Long-Distance Shipping Routes

According to the person in charge of the company: After the China Tanker Company was established in February of this year, it began to receive oil tankers. However, most of the oil tankers received needed to be repaired, especially the Class A tankers, which were severely damaged. They were actively repaired while simultaneously being put into operation. The 16 Class B tankers were repaired long ago and are sailing in inland rivers and along the coast. After the Class A Yong Hong ship is repaired, it will open up long-distance shipping routes, sailing to Iran to load crude oil. If the first trial voyage is successful, then the remaining three Class A ships will continue to operate on long-distance routes in order to increase the import of crude oil. In total, from February to July, the company was entrusted by the China Petroleum Corporation and foreign companies such as Asiatic Petroleum, Socony-Vacuum, and Texaco to transport 94,000 tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil from Shanghai and Taiwan to Nanjing, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin.

### A Record of Obtaining Treasure from a Mine: The Owner Talks About the Discovery of the Giant Diamond: Like a Page of a Twisted Legendary Tale

[Our Reporter] Since the news that a rare diamond was stored in the safety deposit box of a certain bank in this city spread, all parties have paid close attention to it. People from the United States are even more interested in this matter, and they have been inquiring with this newspaper about the truth and price every day. Because the owner of the diamond, Mr. Li, is currently in Taiwan, this newspaper specially cabled our reporter stationed in Taiwan to conduct an on-site interview. We have now received a detailed report. Mr. Li personally recounted his experience, which is like a page of a twisted and confusing legend. According to Mr. Li, "I am from Anhui Province and am a businessman. I went to Singapore to make a living in 1938. When the Pacific War broke out in 1941, I fled to Sumatra and took refuge in a small village called Donggang. I raised chickens and ducks and lived a hard life. I occasionally did small transactions with the local Malay aborigines, which gradually made me familiar with the aborigines and others."

Miner Finds Stone in Deep Mountains

He claimed, "There was a certain temple person in Donggang who was a miner. Thirteen years ago, while transporting a stone in a deep mountain mine, he suddenly found a rattling sound inside the stone. After opening it, he found this crystal clear stone, shaped like a goose egg, with a layer of rough film on the outside. Driven by curiosity, the aborigine planned to split the stone with an axe. Unexpectedly, the stone was very hard, and only a small piece was cut off (the photo taken on the 16th of this newspaper is the missing part on the front). Later, because he could not break it, he stored it at home."

Bought for 700 Dutch Guilders

Later, because I had been living with the aborigines for a long time, I occasionally heard about this from them. As a result, after much bargaining, I bought it for 700 Dutch guilders. In September 1945, I was falsely accused of being a political suspect by the Japanese invaders and detained in a concentration camp in Jambi. I was not released until October of the following year. Before being arrested, I had buried the stone and other important items in a cigarette can under a tree near my residence. After being released, I returned to the area, dug it up, and took it to Singapore. In 1946, I returned to Shanghai and stayed in Nanjing and Shanghai for a week before going to Taiwan to take a job."

Sent to the United States for Research

Mr. Li claimed: "When I was in Nanjing and Shanghai, I did ask friends to find ways to test it everywhere, and some friends even sent the crushed stone to the United States for research, but there has been no formal response. Some said it was a gem, others said it was quartz, but some people also believed that it was indeed a diamond. After coming to Taiwan, I gave one of the pieces that had been crushed by the aborigines to Dr. So-and-so, a professor at National Cheng Kung University, to ask him to test it. It has been more than a month, and there is still no definite conclusion."

### Emits Pale Green Light at Night

This reporter then asked about the details of the diamond. According to Mrs. Li (from Ningbo), the stone is completely transparent. If it is placed in the hand and slightly tilted, it has a very strong reflection. When placed in water, it is as if there is nothing there. In a dark place at night, it emits a pale green light. It can crack a thick glass cup when used. The report says that it weighs 400 carats. She replied that it has not been weighed by a machine that calculates carats, but only weighed by a Chinese market scale, which weighs a total of 4 taels and 5 qian.

### Post-War Reconstruction Advancement Association Issues Opinions on the Peace Conference

The Shanghai branch of the China Post-War Reconstruction Advancement Association yesterday issued the following opinions on the Japanese peace conference: 1. Prerequisites for the Japanese Peace Conference: The holding of the Japanese peace conference should be based on the principle that all Allied countries participating in the war against Japan should participate. If one country does not participate, the significance of the peace conference will be lost. The highest principle of the Japanese peace treaty should be based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Treaty. The Japanese Emperor is a feudal idol of the Japanese nation and the original main force in launching aggression. He should be listed as a war criminal before the peace conference and put on trial. 2. Matters needing attention in the Japanese peace treaty: The level of Japanese industry should not exceed the current situation in China. In the Japanese compensation, our country should receive 50% of the total. As for the items originally plundered from our country by Japan, they should be regarded as returns and not included in the compensation amount. Compensation goods should be mainly industrial equipment, not its products. The treaty should stipulate that after the signing of the treaty, the four major powers, the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, should continue to occupy Japan for 20 years. The Ryukyu Islands and the Penghu Islands originally belonged to China and should be clearly stipulated in the treaty to be returned to China. 3. Issues regarding the resumption of Japanese commerce: Commerce with Japan should adopt a policy of protecting domestic trade. All domestic products should be restricted or prohibited from import. Materials used in industrial production should be allowed to be imported. Prevent any form of smuggling. Establish a specialized organization for Japanese commerce to handle and study all plans and implementations regarding commerce with Japan.

### Seeking Peace, Yet Not Peaceful - A Full-Scale Brawl at the Sanduo Bathhouse

The Sanduo Bathhouse at No. 14, Qunyu Lane, West Road, was opened by Qian Xianchu after the victory, employing dozens of war workers, and the business was not bad. On the 13th of this month, it happened to be the 30th day of the seventh lunar month. Workers Ma Qingyong, Jiang Guolin, Wu Zhengmou, and Zhu Liangsheng initiated a collection to hold a Taiping Gong Jiao (offering to the gods for peace). Each worker at the bathhouse donated 10,000 yuan, the foreman donated 30,000 yuan, and the bathhouse owner donated 200,000 yuan, totaling 1 million yuan for the expenses. That evening, Taoist priests were hired to hold a ceremony. At that time, several workers, including Zhu Shiben, Wang Guiyuan, and Lu Zhusan, expressed their unwillingness to participate, but because the majority agreed, they could not refuse. However, they were very dissatisfied in their hearts and expressed complaints. Around 11:50 the night before last, the bathhouse was closing, and while they were cleaning up, Zhu and others questioned Ma Qingyong and others, demanding to see the accounts. Disagreement led to a mutual fight. Dozens of workers nearby, each according to their closeness, stepped forward and joined the melee. The owner of the bathhouse learned of this and reported it to the local police station, which dispatched officers to suppress the situation and took the troublemakers to the station for investigation. As a result, manager Qian Xianting, workers Wu Zhengmou, Zhu Liangsheng, Wang Guiyuan, and Ma Qingyong were all injured and went to the hospital for bandaging. During the fight, the bathhouse equipment was damaged, including a piece of glass in the Victory Hall door on the second floor, a piece of glass on a coffee table in the Peace Hall on the second floor, three pieces of glass in doors and windows, and a rectangular purse containing 3.58 million yuan in cash was lost, with a total value of approximately 15 million yuan.

### Through Deng Hanxiang, a Glimpse into Sichuan Politics

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 16th] Sichuan Province has a remarkable figure, and that is Deng Hanxiang. From the time General Liu Fucheng presided over Sichuan's administration until General Deng Xihou truly assumed the chairmanship of Sichuan Province, a full twelve years, he almost solely held the position of Secretary-General of the Provincial Government.

It is certainly no easy feat for a Guizhou native to achieve such prominence in Sichuan. In his early years, he graduated from the Baoding Military Academy and was a true military talent. Recalling his experience, the mere fact that he served as Secretary-General to General Duan Qirui is enough to frighten younger generations. After General Duan Qirui stepped down, he lived in seclusion in Beiping. Coincidentally, General Liu Fucheng sent a representative, Ji Zuyou, there. In the eyes of Northerners, Sichuanese and Guizhou people are like fellow villagers. Deng Hanxiang fulfilled his role as host and warmly entertained Ji Zuyou.

### Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Government

Recent photo of Deng Hanxiang (Sent by Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

When Ji Zuyou returned to Chengdu, General Liu Fucheng asked him about his observations during his trip to the north. He strongly recommended Deng Mingjie to General Liu, saying, "Deng Mingjie is a great talent." When General Liu invited Deng Hanxiang to Chengdu for a visit, he wanted to offer Deng a few lucrative tax positions as a reward. However, Deng politely declined. General Liu Fucheng then felt that "this Mr. Deng is indeed an upright person." Later, without Deng Hanxiang's consideration, he was appointed as Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, while Liu himself focused on military affairs. Today, although General Liu Fucheng has passed away for nearly eight years, his

military power

cannot be underestimated. This is due in no small part to Deng Hanxiang, who served as Secretary-General for several terms. He prevented General Liu from worrying about political matters. He established a strong formation for the Sichuan political situation.

In 1936, he presided over the Sichuan Provincial County Government Personnel Training Class and various cadre training classes in Chengdu (including: financial training, social training, teacher training, water conservancy training, prohibition training, and Baojia cadre training classes). The County Cadre Class was held for three sessions, graduating more than 1,020 students. That is why most of the current county magistrates, section chiefs, secretaries, bureau chiefs, division chiefs, and a small number of commissioners in Sichuan call Deng Hanxiang "teacher." However, what is surprising is that the more than 900

County Training Students

(several dozen have died) scattered throughout Sichuan still do not have a clear organization to this day. The social relationships of the various cadre training classes are even more complex, with more than 10,000 people participating in the training. The various cadre training classes once had an organization called the "Graduate Investigation Office of Various Cadre Training Classes." During the tenure of General Liu Fucheng, General Wang Zanxu, and General He Guoguang, they received subsidies. This situation continued until General Zhang Yuejun concurrently served as Chairman of Sichuan Province before it was cancelled.

Mr. Deng Hanxiang is tall and strong, with bright eyes. He loves to wear Chinese clothing all year round. He is calm and unruffled and is sixty-one years old this year. It is said that he has "never held grudges" in his life. To "not hold grudges" while living in a complex political vortex certainly requires a superior skill. When General Liu Fucheng passed away and General Wang Zanxu acted as Chairman, Deng Hanxiang's position as Secretary-General remained unshaken. However, when the order for General Wang to truly assume the chairmanship was published in the newspaper, an

unexpected event

occurred. The resourceful Deng Hanxiang and General Wang Zanxu had an unpredictable conflict. He angrily left Chengdu and came to Chongqing, where General Zhang Yuejun was serving as Director of the Chongqing Xingyuan (Provisional Headquarters) and invited him to be Director of the Second Office of the Xingyuan.

He did not feel wronged in Chongqing for long. In the middle of 1940, one day, military police were added to every street in the city, and soldiers with live ammunition from the suburbs were attempting to pour into the city from the surrounding counties. The situation was extremely urgent. Deng Hanxiang flew back to Chengdu. As a result, General Wang Jixu volunteered to go to Sichuan to fight the enemy, and Chairman Jiang concurrently served as Chairman of Sichuan, in the capacity of the head of the country. However, it was not until General Zhang Yuejun, in his capacity as Director of the Chairman's Chengdu Xingyuan, concurrently served as head of Sichuan's administration that Deng Hanxiang

stepped back into

the door of the Provincial Government. From Director of the Finance Department, concurrently serving as General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank, and then concurrently serving as Director of the Sichuan Provincial Land Tax Administration Office, all the way to today's Secretary-General. How many people have fallen, yet he still stands firmly.

If anyone is concerned about and speculates on the Sichuan political situation, the first figure they cannot ignore is him: Deng Hanxiang. [Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun]

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Launches Standard Reclamation Household Competition Movement

### Manufacturing Plant Disease and Insecticides - Chengdu Chemist Promoted from Trainee to People's Factory Director

[This Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] Zhou Delong, director of the Plant Disease and Insecticide Demonstration Factory of the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, is a young chemist. After graduating from the Department of Chemistry of Wuhan University in 1937, he came to Rong to work as a trainee at the factory. He has risen through the ranks of technician and section chief to become the current factory director. New members of the Chengdu New Establishment visited the factory and praised him as a "people's director." Unlike general administrative heads who only handle formal documents such as "in accordance with instructions," anyone who visits him will always find him working hard in the laboratory. His full beard and torn work pants often make first-time visitors doubt whether he is the director. The pharmaceutical factory has been established for a total of eight years. When it was first established, it was difficult to promote business. The provincial government distributed various insecticidal drugs to villages free of charge. When farmers believed in the effectiveness of the drugs and purchased them automatically, a slight cost price was charged. Especially in tobacco-producing areas such as Shiqi, Jintang, Nanxi, and Yibin, commissioners are sent every year to purchase bactericides. Director Zhou told reporters: The factory has indirectly increased rural production. Mr. Zhou is currently writing a book on agricultural chemistry. With his ten years of practical work experience, it can be predicted that this will be a valuable scientific reader. (Chun)

### Huaihe River Swimming Bandits - Stab Boatmen to Death

[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 19th] Swimming bandits have been discovered in the He Xia area, appearing on the water surface at night and taking the opportunity to stab boatmen to death.

### The Textile Industry Association Continues to Hold Its General Membership Meeting; Public Associations in Various Districts Report on Their Work

[Our Newspaper Report] The second general membership meeting of the Joint Textile Association was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Chairman Liu Jingji, along with representatives from the Textile Industry Association and public associations in various districts, gave detailed reports on their work. First, Wu Meijing, representing the Textile Industry Association, reported on the association's work over the past two years, stating that the motivations for the association's establishment were: 1. To plan for the takeover of Japanese-owned yarn mills; 2. To plan for the dismantling of Japanese-owned yarn mill equipment after the victory; 3. To plan for the takeover of the [missing] Japanese goods market before the war; 4. To cooperate with the government's five-year industrial construction plan. The work completed after the establishment was: 1. Cooperating with the Forestry Department to send cotton [seeds] to Zhengzhou after the victory; 2. Investigating cotton production nationwide; 3. Investigating and compiling statistics on rear-area yarn mills and yarn mills nationwide, with the latter work still to be completed; 4. Establishing textile industry associations in various districts; 5. Raising funds for an independent cotton industry; 6. Purchasing a [address] for the Textile Industry Association on Di [missing] Road, Jing'an Temple Road; 7. The issue of the number of National Assembly and Legislative Yuan seats remains to be resolved.

Next, representatives from the cotton spinning industry associations in various districts reported on their work. First, Shi Fengxiang, representing the Second District, reported on the difficult situation of the factories in Shaanxi during the war.

Luo Yangzhi, representing the Third District, reported on the situation of the yarn industry in the Kunming area, stating that there was a local need for coarse cloth, and the factories were all spinning 10-count yarn, but the supply of raw materials was extremely inadequate. The work efficiency of the workers was low, and wages were low. However, the electricity supply was abundant, and all the factories' spindles were running.

The Northeast Yarn Industry Faces Many Difficulties

Xi Yu[missing], representing the Sixth District, reported on the situation of the textile factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, listing figures to prove the rapid recovery. However, this has caused Shanghai to feel a shortage of electricity, which has not yet been resolved. The supply of fuel is also a difficult problem. The workers' problems and the overall situation are still satisfactory. The most urgent issue to be discussed at present is the reasonable setting of yarn prices, otherwise the yarn mills will not be able to resume production smoothly. It is unreasonable to suppress yarn prices while raw material and labor costs are rising.

Yang Yizhou, representing the Seventh District, reported on the situation in the Tianjin area, stating that state-owned yarn mills accounted for approximately 80% of the area, with the remainder being privately owned. After the establishment of the association, it negotiated with the tax bureau to reduce and exempt taxes and resolved the labor unrest problems in various factories. This year's cotton [missing] is one-third more than last year, but transportation is blocked. A proposal was made to the conference to study the plan of using the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade to transport cotton. In addition, the northern region was occupied by the enemy for the longest time, and the yarn mills suffered the greatest losses. It is hoped that the government will give special consideration and support.

The representative of the Ninth District reported on the yarn industry in Qingdao and Shandong, stating that there are more than 30 yarn mills in the area, concentrated in the two cities of Qingdao and Jinan. Due to the CCP's occupation, both cities are like isolated islands, so there are many difficulties. It is hoped that the central government can [missing] more cotton loans to purchase raw cotton. In addition, the quota for coal is too small and must be improved. The metal materials required by the yarn mills are usually purchased from Tianjin and Shanghai, which is also difficult. Wages have increased by an average of 80,000 times compared to before the war, but there are still many labor disputes.

Finally, the representative of the Northeast District reported that during the enemy and puppet era, the Northeast yarn mills had 540,000 spindles and 10,000 looms, but now, due to various reasons, only 100,000 spindles and 5,000 looms can operate. In terms of raw cotton, the cotton fields are all located in southern Liaoning, and today's production is only one-third of that in the enemy and puppet era. The Japanese used various means to force the promotion of cotton fields, reaching up to 700,000 mu. Today, the price of food is higher than the price of cotton, and farmers have switched to growing food crops, resulting in a sharp decrease in the area of cotton fields. This year's maximum cotton production is 200,000 dan. In the future, the [missing] release of cotton goods and the promotion of cotton fields are important issues. The supply of coal in the Northeast is also insufficient. In terms of electricity, since the CCP's five offensives, the Xiaoman power has been cut off, and the yarn mills were shut down for a month at that time. The electricity currently used is the excess electricity from the factories of the Resources Commission, which is only one-third of the past electricity volume. Therefore, if there is no development in the military, the future of the yarn industry is extremely difficult. After the representatives of various districts finished reporting, the secretariat reported that it had received congratulatory telegrams from all parties and 72 proposals. The general assembly declaration was passed, and Dong [missing] Zhang Wu Meijing Wang Qiyu and others were elected as seven drafting committee members. The general assembly [missing] and the meeting was dispersed at midnight.

The Main Proposals Have Been Reviewed

The subcommittee meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to review the proposals, and the important proposals at that time were reviewed. The main ones included: 1. Taiwan's [missing] coal has been overproduced and measures should be taken to improve its supply to the mainland. 2. In the future, when establishing new factories, the government should strictly designate areas. 3. The yarn mills in the southwest and northwest suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance and the government should give preferential treatment. 4. The number of representatives of the yarn industry should be increased to four, and the number of legislative members should be increased to two. 5. The transport of raw cotton should be assisted by the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade. 6. It is difficult to obtain machine parts at home and abroad and a factory should be set up domestically to manufacture them. 7. After the war, textile technology has advanced in various countries and a study delegation should be sent abroad for investigation.

The Shipping Industry Union Hosts a Banquet for the Representatives

At 7:00 PM in the evening, the Shipping Industry Union hosted a banquet for all the representatives at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Du Yuesheng, Shu [missing], Xu Xueyu and others successively delivered [speeches], all strongly [emphasizing] that the textile industry and the shipping industry are two key industries for our country's national economy and people's livelihood. Especially today, when we are striving for the Nanyang market, we cannot earn foreign exchange without cloth, and we will not be able to compete with the powerful enemy Japan without local [missing] shipping. Therefore, the joint struggle of the two industries is necessary. The general assembly will continue this morning to pass the proposals, and the meeting will be closed after the election in the afternoon.

### Kerosene Supply Is Scarce and Prices Are High

Although China-America Petroleum Company has been supplying kerosene to the market recently, the quantity is small. The market demand is strong, and the supply is still insufficient. The opening price continues to rise. Recently, the price of high-grade barrel oil has risen to 1.723 million yuan for sale. Mobil's cans are traded among peers at 210,000 to 15,000 yuan, and transactions have been made. The market price is 4,500 yuan per can, and 5,000 yuan per full jin, it is said.

### The Industrial Association Hosted the Press Yesterday

The Shanghai Industrial Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Tian Heqing reported on the association's limited quota of raw materials distributed by weaving.

### The Food Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax

The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, Grain Merchants Association, and Bran Industry Association stated that the central government's continued exemption of business tax for the food industry for one year will expire at the end of September. Now, due to the endless civil strife in various places, [missing] back, traffic jams, [missing] food supply is affected by the world food shortage and has not been smooth. The market associations and grain merchant groups of seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, previously went to Beijing to petition the authorities, but were not approved. They are now launching a second expanded petition. The association decided to take a consistent step. As the fourth general assembly of the Municipal Council is scheduled to open today (the 22nd), it specially submitted the proposal to the council yesterday, requesting that it be discussed at this general assembly. It also sincerely appealed to the central and municipal authorities to approve the restoration of the exemption of business tax on food.

### New Medicine and New Drugs, Edited by Shanghai Medical Association, My Views on the Nanjing Municipal Hospital Incident

— 幵里

The Nanjing Municipal Hospital surgeon, Qian Ming, because of his loyalty to his duties and his wholehearted service to patients, was actually accused of professional negligence and sentenced to imprisonment. This unfortunate news fills us scientific medical practitioners with extreme indignation! I previously read the eulogy by Mr. Liang Junqing in this publication, and recently I praised the declaration of our Medical Association. I deeply feel that the injustice and depression in my chest caused by this case have been fully vented on our behalf. However, there are still a few points that have not been mentioned, which seem to stick in my throat, and I have to express them quickly. Therefore, without considering my own clumsiness, I will borrow a corner of this publication to discuss this case with those who care about it.

First, according to hospital practice, before surgery, a consent form must be signed by the patient's family or responsible relatives, stating that in the event of any unforeseen circumstances during or after the surgery, there will be no objection. This kind of consent form should have absolute legal effect. Now, let us put aside all the academic disputes related to this case for the moment. If the patient's family has indeed signed a consent form, and complications still arise afterward, it is tantamount to the patient's family going back on their word and betraying their trust, and they should bear the primary responsibility for this. How can the facts be erased, and the doctor involved be blamed for the crime? I sincerely do not know if, at the beginning of this case, before Dr. Qian performed the surgery, the patient's family went through the procedure of signing a surgical consent form? Because the distance between Nanjing and Shanghai is quite far, and inquiry is not easy, for a moment there is no way to guess. It is possible that Dr. Qian was innocently implicated, and the patient's family's going back on their word and betraying their trust is also related. Second, accidents during anesthesia that lead to death are medically termed anesthesia death. Since the advent of anesthesia, various medical literatures at home and abroad have detailed records of this, and it is by no means a unique case created by Nanjing Municipal Hospital. According to current research, the causes of this kind of anesthesia death are no more than two: poisoning and shock. Poisoning is caused by excessive dosage, and of course there will be toxic phenomena, which can be proven in the corpse. Shock is entirely due to physical constitution, especially in constitutions like thymic-lymphatic constitution, which are most prone to anesthesia death, but this can also be proven in the corpse. Now, if we want to investigate why the patient operated on at Nanjing Municipal Hospital had an accident, if the corpse is dissected, it will not be difficult to find out the truth. It is regrettable that this was not considered during the forensic examination! Third, judges value freedom of conviction, and losing impartiality and fairness by following others' opinions. But in fact, what is allowed for free selection is limited to the scope of etiquette, customs, and human emotions. If they encounter problems related to science, and disregard the principles of contemporary knowledge and insight, arbitrarily influencing decisions will inevitably lead to endless jokes. For example, modern scientists have proven that the earth is spherical. If legal references are needed, the theory of a round earth should naturally be followed. It is not possible to change the theory of a spherical earth just because the ancients had the theory of a flat earth! The medical issues involved are of course a kind of science. Taking anesthesia as an example, the anesthetic drugs used during anesthesia fundamentally have the distinction between general anesthesia and local anesthesia. General anesthetics act on the central nervous system, such as ether and chloroform. Local anesthetics act on the peripheral nerves, such as cocaine and procaine. Although these two types of drugs have the same anesthetic properties, the pharmacology of each drug is different. Not only can the properties of ether and chloroform not be confused with the properties of cocaine and procaine, but there is also a great distance between ether and chloroform, and between cocaine and procaine. For example, the side effects of ether are less stimulation to the heart and more stimulation to the respiratory system. The side effects of chloroform are more stimulation to the heart and less stimulation to the respiratory system, which happen to be opposite properties. Also, cocaine's side effects can excite the medulla oblongata and constrict blood vessels, so it can indirectly affect respiration and the heart. However, procaine has no effect on the medulla oblongata or blood vessels, standing in opposition to cocaine. Therefore, if someone wants to judge the advantages and disadvantages of anesthetics, they must carefully understand the personality of anesthetic drugs. If they speak in general terms, they will inevitably point east and say west, resulting in contradictions with scientific principles. I always feel that these elements have been incorporated into the case of Dr. Qian's implication.

Fourth, I also read the public notice from all the doctors of Nanjing Municipal Hospital, which included an excerpt from the judgment, stating, "The above-mentioned anesthetic is only applicable to those with normal heart, lung, kidney, and nerves, and especially not suitable for those with heart disease." I don't know if there was a typo? Judging by the literal meaning, it seems to be quoting a medical theorem. Now, in order to find this theorem, I have searched through all the reference books at hand, whether pharmacology, surgery, surgical textbooks, or surgical manuals, and I cannot find any similar clause. Especially the word "kidney," I don't know what it refers to? Thinking about it from the perspective of pathology that I have studied before, I cannot imagine what deep relationship procaine has with the urinary system that must be avoided. To put it more broadly, those with abnormal kidney function most often exhibit arteriosclerosis. Even if patients with arteriosclerosis need anesthesia surgery, there is no need to hesitate too much. Of course, like cocaine, which constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure, but for the purpose of anesthesia, the time is fixed and the dosage is limited. Even if it is used, it will not cause danger. Other anesthetics that have no stimulating effect on blood vessels at all have no need to be avoided, so I still think this kidney word is a typo.

### Trauma Can Worsen Old Illnesses

— Liang Junqing

In summary, a 53-year-old man who had never been ill before suffered an external injury on November 26th of last year, with his chest heavily impacted against a hard surface. After entering the hospital, he seemed to have recovered, but suddenly vomited blood and had a slight fever. Twenty-four days after the injury, he had irregular fever, and on the thirty-ninth and fortieth nights after the injury, he had severe chills and high fever. On an X-ray taken sixty days after the injury, a clear onset of miliary tuberculosis could be identified. However, an X-ray taken ten days after the injury showed no signs of anything that could potentially develop into miliary tuberculosis. A photo taken twenty-six days after the injury only showed a suspicious congestion phenomenon. The patient died eighty-six days after the injury.

The patient's body was dissected, confirming miliary tuberculosis and indicating that it was caused by a sudden recurrence of a dormant old tuberculosis lesion due to the injury.

Reasons: The starting point of the miliary tuberculosis was the calcified lesion in the hilum of the lung, especially the calcified lesion in the lower lobe of the right lung was more obvious. The distribution of lymph nodes was very wide and peculiar, also in a miliary state (all of the above are based on the autopsy report). This can prove that the deterioration is consistent with the clinical symptoms of chills and high fever. There was a fibrous adhesion state the size of a silver dollar on the fifth rib near the heart on the right lung, which was a sign of adhesion between the pleura and the lung, that is, where local pleuritis (Pleuritis epifocalis) had occurred. The healing condition here was very thick, with a lot of connective tissue, which was undoubtedly an old tuberculosis lesion. There were several obvious hemorrhagic reactions nearby. This was of course because he had vomited blood not long ago. The early tuberculosis lesions of pneumonia had long been calcified, which could be said to be completely unrelated to the occurrence of miliary tuberculosis. His hemoptysis had nothing to do with the old lesions, because according to the autopsy, the old lesions had no cavities or caseation, and it could be said that hemoptysis would never occur. On the contrary, his hemoptysis can be determined to be related to the injury. According to the autopsy, we can determine that he had pleuritis, and the adhesion site was damaged and bled due to external impact. Because the adhesion site in the lower lobe of the right lung was not easy to move when injured (the unadhered part could of course move), bleeding and tissue damage occurred. As a result, tuberculosis bacteria entered the blood vessels from the old lesions and evolved into acute miliary tuberculosis. (Detailed in the Swiss Medical Weekly, No. 24, 1947, written by Prof. Lofler)

According to the above records, we can know that a dormant, and can be said to be cured, disease suddenly worsens in a certain accidental situation (i.e., trauma), especially dormant tuberculosis is more prone to this change. (Loffler has described another case, but it is not recorded due to length).

Therefore, my belief has changed, and there are so many unexpected accidents in the world. Isn't it? I once read a piece of news in the newspaper that one person jokingly punched another person, hitting him in the upper left abdomen. As a result, the person fell to the ground and died. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had malaria before his death, and his spleen was abnormally enlarged. He died from rupture of the spleen and bleeding due to the blow.

If he had never been punched in his life, then he might have lived to be seventy or eighty years old, but this blow was his fatal injury, ending his entire life.

Therefore, I say that trauma can worsen old illnesses. (To be continued)

### Looking Forward to the Future Scientific World

— Gang Ren

Will the power of atomic energy eventually end the era of coal and oil and replace them? Many scientists already believe that it is just a matter of time. There are many organizations in the world, under the leadership and cooperation of many excellent scientists, working hard in this area. The Americans, with their vast resources, are eager to get ahead of others and are building great power plants in Hanford and Oak Ridge to replace the 7,100 gallons of gasoline and 38.5 tons of coal consumed every hour today.

Here, the biggest difficulty lies in how to isolate the dangerous radiation. Scientists are concentrating all their efforts on finding a material that is more solid, lighter, and more effective than lead and concrete. Perhaps a new plan for reflecting and concentrating those rays instead of absorbing radiation energy with the laborious old method, like lead sheets.

Because there is no lightweight atomic energy barrier, atomic energy can at most only be used as a power plant, train, or unmanned aircraft.

No one knows yet whether atomic energy is more economical than the current power. In any case, this is not only good news for areas without coal and oil production, but it will also solve the increasingly severe coal shortage problem, allowing tomorrow's aircraft to circle the earth several times without refueling.

Therefore, mankind will never use the old clumsy method of putting an internal combustion engine on a four-wheeled carriage, that is, forcing it to suit modern machinery. Possibly, atomic energy can be directly converted into electricity without going through that most inefficient thermal cycle. Dr. J.A. Hutchson of Westinghouse Research Laboratory pointed out that the method of using the battery effect of injecting electricity into metal sheets may be a new one.

Furthermore, our atomic energy now comes from splitting heavy atoms, using the heaviest raw materials, uranium-235 and second-class tin; while the ancestor of atomic energy, stars, at least the sun, its radiant light comes from the combination of oxygen into helium. This was the method that Germany was desperately researching during the war and was destroyed by the Allied countries. If humans can achieve this in the future, then atomic energy will be even more convenient and inexhaustible. This may have hope of success under the efforts of the cosmic ray research work in the United States and the atomic energy research institute in the Soviet Union.

The future power world has an infinitely beautiful future.

The progress and reform of aircraft design will enable mankind to achieve the ability to control the speed driven by explosive force, to exceed the speed of sound, and to achieve the goal of space navigation.

On Earth, the Arctic navigation research in Alaska in the United States will use improved aircraft to go to lands that no one has ever been to and develop those rich resources.

In the new developments in broadcasting, even more brilliant prospects can be seen. Because the sky is very wide, enough for our radio waves to travel back and forth.

Won't it be too far? Wireless telephones, televisions, and ultra-shortwave networks are covering the world, and many broadcasts, telephone communications, telegrams, telephoto transmission, and movies are being transmitted silently.

### A Brief Discussion of Metals

— You Ding

There are many types of metals, but there is no one that is omnipotent and sufficient for human application in all aspects. Aircraft engineering requires a metal that is as strong as steel, as light as wood, as resistant to corrosion as gold, and also easy to melt, press, and pull. Fishermen want metals that sink well, while light bulb manufacturers want a metal that does not melt at a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. Looking at this, we know that it is impossible to have an omnipotent metal that can meet the needs of any aspect. Now, let's briefly discuss several kinds of metals.

Lead—Everyone knows that lead does not rust and can withstand hundreds of years of climate change and wind and frost. Lead tubes can be used to contain sulfuric acid because 75% concentrated sulfuric acid cannot dissolve it. However, in micro-instruments, sulfuric acid can be advanced from 90% to 100% concentration, and this concentrated acid can immediately dissolve lead. In dilute acid, the surface of lead is covered by a thin layer of lead sulfate, and lead sulfate is insoluble in water, so the lead sheet can be prevented from being dissolved. Lead cylinders and lead containers are mostly used to hold dilute sulfuric acid.

Aluminum—Aluminum is not afraid of sulfuric acid or nitric acid, but it is afraid of strong bases. Aluminum nitride usually does not react with acids, so it can be used as a fine saucepan. The chemical industry uses aluminum to contain acids but not bases. The density of aluminum is 2.7, and its weight is like glass shards. It is generally believed that aluminum is very light, which is because it is compared with other (other metals. Most metals are 6.5 to 11 times heavier than water. But if compared with plastics, wood, and ordinary fluids, aluminum is a bit too heavy.

Magnesium—Magnesium is just the opposite of aluminum. It is not afraid of tests. In the test, magnesium is wrapped in a layer of hydrated magnesium, and it is isolated from water and hydrogen. Strong bases that can dissolve strong metals such as platinum cannot touch magnesium, but it is often corroded by weak acids such as fruit acid or plant acid. Although magnesium is afraid of acids, there is one strange thing, that is, magnesium is not afraid of highly corrosive concentrated hydrofluoric acid. This is because magnesium fluoride is insoluble in hydrofluoric acid. The density of magnesium is 1.74, which is a little heavier than the heaviest wood, but much lighter than aluminum. Magnesium is a good metal, coarse, hard, strong, and resistant to corrosion; and, in some situations, magnesium is the only dominant metal, unmatched by other metals.

Lithium—Lithium is the lightest of all metals and can float on gasoline; but unfortunately, lithium is a very pampered and delicate daughter. It dissolves almost as soon as it sees oxides or hydrides. It is the most active metal, and it corrodes almost as soon as it comes into contact with humid air. Lithium and its companions sodium, potassium, and rubidium are really light and so soft that they can be kneaded with both hands or two fingers.

Beryllium—The density of beryllium is 1.85, slightly heavier than magnesium. Although it is light, it is as hard as steel. Its melting point is very high, like heavy metals such as steel; it has strong corrosion resistance. However, beryllium also has its shortcomings. Its pure beryllium or most beryllium alloys are hard and brittle, and beryllium is difficult to extract from its attached ore, and the reserves are not concentrated.

Others—Iridium can resist all chemical attacks, unlike other metals that require special conditions to resist corrosion. The density of iron is eight, and it is not soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid because it is covered by insoluble iron sulfate. Caesium and Stromtium are cousins of beryllium, extremely active and fragile, and have no use at present. Although platinum is the most resistant to erosion, it is still afraid of sooty names, because soot is carbon, and platinum can react with carbon in some way. Also, sodium carbonate cannot be dissolved in platinum crucibles, otherwise sodium carbonate will dissolve platinum.

### Submarine Long-Range Ears

— Zhao Nan

The U.S. Navy invented a deep-sea long-range ear during the war, named Sofar. If translated into Shanghainese, it means "Listen Far." This kind of submarine long-range ear uses the principle of sound transmission and the geometric triangular calculation method to be able to measure distant ships in distress, downed airplanes, and isolated and helpless lifeboats. When the driver encounters danger, they simply drop a depth charge into the sea. The bomb will automatically explode when it sinks to 4,000 feet, thus generating a huge explosion sound, which can make the submarine long-range ears within 3,000 miles work, thereby determining the location of the accident. This measurement is very accurate, with an error of less than one mile.

### New Wood Products

— Tang Yao

Thermoplastic: In 1941, when conducting the above-mentioned chemical drying test, a wood drying expert at the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory accidentally immersed a 1/4-inch standard wood in a concentrated urea solution. When heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the wood piece became as soft as leather and could be bent and twisted arbitrarily. When the wood cooled, the shape of the bend could be kept unchanged. Mr. Luo also used a layered saw test, which could also be flattened and pasted into a thin plate by itself. After further research, three types of urea-heated molding wood (Uralloy A.B.C) have been manufactured. Therefore, this new property of wood, which was accidentally discovered, has opened a new era in wood utilization.

Compreg: The U.S. manufacturing of compressed wood originally came from the research on preventing the expansion and contraction of wood. Mr. Stamm injected several kinds of synthetic resins into the wood; when heating (Heat-ancreasin Process), the wood was found to be in a plastic state that was soft and bendable and could be subjected to pressure to make it shrink. He used light wood, and when it was compressed to 1/3 of its original volume, its strength could be compared to soft steel. After detailed research, this technology can be applied to ordinary wood and molded to Destined Shape; or use bonded wood (that is, already sliced into thin sheets and glued into layers) to make the required size and shape, and take and demand according to the strength. Compressed wood is water-resistant and resistant to erosion by alcohol and mild acids. It has been used in the manufacture of aircraft propellers. It is said that a company in Michigan, USA, uses this method to mold propeller tail wheels and struts. Although the manufacturing cost is not expensive in heavy affairs; but it seems that it is still to be studied to reduce its cost for general construction. However, it is possible to mold industrial gears, pulleys, etc.

Staypak: The latest product of refined wood invented by the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in recent years. Its advantage is that no synthetic resin is needed during the compression and heating process, so it can be regarded as an improved compressed wood. According to the U.S. Wood Products magazine in January 1945, the manufacturing technology is mainly to avoid the re-expansion of wood after compression when it encounters water. Mr. Si is well versed in the principle and technology of preventing wood from expanding and contracting. He believes that if the wood material that binds the cell walls of the wood body can be used during the processing period to make it fluid, it is possible to prevent the generation of stress on the cell walls. However, although this situation can be achieved at high temperatures, the wood is also scorched at the same time. Therefore, the focus of the technology is to solve the problem of reducing the temperature at which the dual wood material is in a fluid state. After multiple tests, it was found that "water" can promote the fluidity of wood material and is a very good plasticizer, so the manufacturing technology was solved. When manufacturing compressed and shrunk wood, the moisture content must be larger than that of compressed wood. If it is compressed to the appropriate time at a relatively high temperature, the wood can be compressed to a specific gravity of 1.6 or 1.4. The wood used is usually 1 1/2 times thicker than the body, or thin wood (Veneers) that has been bonded into layers with synthetic resin; therefore, no more resin needs to be injected except for the synthetic resin needed to bond the plywood.

The color of compressed and shrunk wood is darker than that of ordinary wood. The compressed surface is smooth after grinding and has a gloss similar to that of compressed wood. It can be cut freely with metal tools. Under the same moisture content and specific gravity, the longitudinal and transverse compressive strength of compressed and shrunk wood is smaller than that of compressed wood; but the longitudinal tensile strength and flexural strength are 25% larger than that of compressed wood. According to records, the tensile strength and flexural strength of compressed and shrunk wood with parallel grains are 40,000-45,000 pounds per square inch, which is about twice that of American yellow cards and three times that of American western spruce. The toughness of compressed and shrunk wood is twice that of compressed wood. After processing, the strength of light poplar and fir wood can exceed that of the strongest commercial wood. The expansion of compressed and shrunk wood in the atmosphere is very slight, but it will gradually weather like ordinary wood; therefore, it does not need to be painted outdoors, unlike compressed wood.

The manufacturing cost of compressed and shrunk wood is lower than that of compressed wood, and the quality is also more tough; it is of great value in the post-war improved small aircraft, as well as the handles, columns, pulleys, silent gears, and other applications that require strong toughness and no deformation.

The above is a brief description of the known refined wood products; however, many new technologies are not detailed due to industrial secrets and cannot be described in detail. However, the transformation of the properties of wood is nothing more than: 1. Making synthetic resins with low molecular weight and affinity for wood form in the fine structure of wood cells, so that water cannot enter or exit; 2. Using the plasticity of the wood material itself. 3. The heat-forming properties of wood after treatment with urea, etc. (that is, the wood can be bent freely when it is hot, and it remains unchanged after cooling). Therefore, the new technology of synthetic resin bonding to wood can be said to have promoted a new revolution in the application of wood by the bitter people. At present, my country's metal industry has not yet been weeded out and developed. How to improve my country's wood and utilize wood chips and other waste materials is what my country's material scientists should urgently eliminate.

Those who are interested are welcome to inquire. We hereby make corrections and express our apologies!

### Chemical Saw

— Germany

The Stalin Factory in the Soviet city of Gorlovka has recently invented a new method for cutting hard metals. It is a hybrid of electricity and mechanics. The saw used in this method is a smooth, thin disk with a diameter of one foot. The setup of the disk is no different from that of an ordinary saw, rotating at about 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions per minute. It is connected to the positive terminal of a generator, while the metal being cut is connected to the negative terminal. When activated, a special electrolyte is produced in the part being cut. Due to the electric current, chemical decomposition occurs, and the balancing action forces the saw to work. The electric current rapidly separates the metal as it passes through the electrolyte.

### Rocks That Fell From The Moon

— Liu Dade

Mr. H.H. Nininger believes that Moonstone is not a gemstone, but rather a rock that fell from the moon. He says this type of stone is called Tektite and was broken off from the moon by large and fast meteorites. Mr. Nininger is an American authority on the study of meteorites, so any statement he makes on this subject will attract widespread attention.

It is a fact universally recognized by astronomers that the Earth and other planets in the solar system are constantly bombarded by meteorites. The Earth's surface has a layer of air that protects it from the impact of meteorites. Therefore, when a meteorite rushes towards the Earth at high speed, it will inevitably generate friction as it passes through the atmosphere, thus heating up to a white-hot state and burning up.

The moon, however, is different. Its surface does not have a layer of air, so meteorites can easily reach the moon without burning up. In fact, some astronomers believe that many of the craters on the moon are the result of meteorite impacts.

Regardless of whether we accept this theory or not, the following facts are certain: when a high-speed meteorite strikes the moon, it will generate tremendous heat. When the meteorite collides with the moon, all of this heat will be converted into steam. At this time, a terrifying explosion will follow, and some of the rocks on the moon's surface will be shattered and thrown into the air. These rocks will be immediately melted by the heat generated during the collision. If they fall to Earth, they will become round, glass-like stones called Tektites.

Although most of the rocks thrown out from the moon will fall back, a small portion may still escape the moon's range because the Earth's gravity is greater than the moon's. If a piece of melted rock enters the Earth's gravitational range, it will fall to the ground.
