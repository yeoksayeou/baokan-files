### Three Principles Decided by Our Country's State Council for Participating in Trade with Japan: Stipulation Not to Hinder Our National Economy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The issue of opening trade with Japan was the subject of heated and thorough discussion at the State Council meeting on the 1st, and concrete conclusions were reached. First, Premier Zhang explained the proposal drafted by the Executive Yuan, and the commissioners spoke separately. It was generally agreed that our country, being a victorious nation, should not engage in mutual trade with Japan, a defeated nation. That is, we should not purchase Japanese goods, but only import Japanese reparations materials. Therefore, it cannot be called "opening up," but rather restoring private trade. After discussion, the original proposal was not agreed upon, and three principles were decided separately: (1) The government and the economic sector will jointly negotiate and form a private delegation to Japan for investigation. (2) The import and export of goods for trade with Japan shall be based on the principle of not harming China's national economy. (3) China's required materials for Japan should be extracted from the reparations materials as much as possible. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters invited our private businesses to resume trade with Japan, while our country adopted a commercial control policy. Therefore, the current trade is under free trade conditions, taking control measures. The proposal was immediately passed, and the trade measures and organization will be drafted by the Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] After the State Council passed the conditional opening of trade with Japan in the morning of the 1st, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated: The ministry is prepared to execute all tasks required for the established national policy, including instructing the delegation stationed in Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters for permission for the investigation delegation to enter the country, so that the delegation can arrive in Japan as scheduled and begin work.

[United Credit Reporting Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] At the State Council meeting on the morning of the 1st, it was decided that trade with Japan would be restored soon. It is understood that our country is preparing to export tea, tung oil, bristles, camphor, sugar and a portion of surplus materials, hoping to obtain railway sleepers, machines, instruments, transportation tools, kiln wood, etc. from Japan. It is also planned that the value of materials exported to Japan will be twice that of imports. Furthermore, in order to protect our country's Nanyang market, the government authorities are planning to adopt a disguised subsidy method for goods sold to the region, in order to reduce costs.

### Executive Yuan Spokesperson Talks About the Establishment of the Trade Case: Delegation to Japan Negotiates and Organizes with the Economic Sector

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] This reporter recently inquired with the Executive Yuan about the establishment process of the trade case with Japan. The Executive Yuan spokesperson explained in detail as follows:

Since the case was raised by the Supervisory Committee, the Executive Yuan has held two meetings to discuss it. The first time, it was originally resolved to participate, but due to suggestions from the resident members of the National Political Council and opinions from groups such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the China National Industrial Association, it was raised again at the second meeting. Although a resolution to participate was made, it was still submitted to the State Council to merge the Executive Yuan's resolution with the National Political Council's proposal for discussion, which shows that the government's handling of this case is very cautious.

The reporter requested the spokesperson to explain the reasons for participation in detail, so that the public can understand the truth. The spokesperson continued: Our country's participation in trade with Japan did not begin after this case was decided. Last year, the Central Trust Bureau had already traded with Japan through barter trade. Comparing imports and exports to Japan last year and this year, they are generally balanced. The State Council's decision to organize a business delegation to Japan is just a slight expansion of the Central Trust Bureau's work on trade with Japan. This kind of business delegation, whose number and candidates are negotiated and organized by the Executive Yuan and the economic sector, can be said to be a kind of controlled trade, not completely free private trade. In addition, the misunderstanding of this matter by the general public is that the so-called opening of trade with Japan this time is the same as the usual opening of trade. In fact, this opening method only allows Allied delegations to be sent to Japan, and Japan cannot send business delegations or private individuals to China (or other Allied countries) for trade. Japanese businessmen who trade with Allied delegations must also be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, the so-called opening of trade with Japan this time has extremely strict restrictions.

The reporter further asked whether, after our country participates in trade with Japan in the future, Japan can use its consumer goods or other items that harm our national economy to seize our country's foreign exchange. According to the spokesperson's response, our country has various restrictions on foreign trade, especially on the import side, and there is an Import Management Committee to carry out management. The second item of the State Council's resolution more solemnly stipulates that the types and quantities of inputs and outputs in trade with Japan must be based on the standard of not harming China's national economy. Under this restriction, and with the business delegation being composed of members selected by the government, the dumping of Japanese goods in our country is absolutely impossible. As for foreign exchange, trade with Japan is the same as trade with other countries, and is still subject to the general method of foreign exchange management. These foreign exchange control measures are necessary measures to protect our country's industry and commerce. Moreover, the third item of the State Council's decision is that our country should obtain the materials it needs from the reparations materials as much as possible. At present, the reparations issue has not been fully agreed upon due to the relationship between national opinions. Therefore, there is no formal decision on the entire reparations issue with Japan. However, after the decision on the early dismantling method, our country can continue to negotiate to include Japan's future production as part of the reparations, hoping that our country can obtain as much of the materials it needs as possible from the reparations, so that our country can reduce a portion of the burden on the materials it needs from Japan.

The reporter also asked, some people advocate that trade with Japan must be after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, because when signing the peace treaty, reasonable restrictions can be made on Japan's trade with our country. Now, without waiting for the signing of the treaty, trade is carried out immediately, and various restrictions are added. What is the basis for this? The spokesperson continued: The opening of Japanese trade, which our country participated in, was announced in the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan, allowing it to participate. President Chiang stated in his broadcast after Japan's surrender that he would take lenient measures. Therefore, the Allied Headquarters' opening of Japanese trade and our country's participation are based on these three documents. Moreover, according to the basic policy set by the Far Eastern Commission, it is stated that during the occupation period, under appropriate control and under the condition of prioritizing the needs of the people of the countries that participated in the war against Japan, Japan may import from abroad the raw materials and other goods needed for peaceful purposes. It can be seen that participating in trade with Japan is actually to meet the requirements of both parties, but with the condition that satisfying the needs of the people of the countries that participated in the war against Japan is prioritized. Therefore, it can be said that our country's participation in trade with Japan is mainly to meet our country's needs. Based on the above reasons, the State Council made this decision.

### Dr. Bu Nerong Talks About American Perceptions

[Our Newspaper] Dr. Bu Nerong (pictured), an expert on Far Eastern issues who came to China for investigation, is an overseas Chinese who grew up in the United States, and his ancestral home is Jilin Province. Dr. Bu is a professor, writer, and speaker. He teaches at Harvard University in the United States, has written many books, and writes for the "Modern Historical Materials" magazine, which is quite famous. Dr. Bu told reporters recently: "I had originally scheduled to go to Beijing next Monday, but Speaker Pan invited me to a banquet, so I changed it to Tuesday. I plan to travel and investigate extensively in China, and will possibly visit North China and the Northeast; in addition to meeting with key government officials and leaders from all walks of life, I also plan to go deep into the countryside to inquire about the living conditions of the people and ways of reform. The expenses for my trip to China are entirely self-funded. I hope to obtain a true understanding of the motherland and bring it back to the United States so that its people can have an accurate understanding of China. Because the observations of ordinary Americans on our country are not very accurate. Regarding our country's political situation, they only know that Chairman Chiang is indeed a loyal and great figure, but he is isolated and helpless, surrounded by some stubborn elements, and the various reforms of the current government are not thorough enough. In a nutshell, Americans still lack trust in Chinese officials. These opinions have a great impact on the government's decision-making. The visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer this time is to investigate whether the above rumors are true. If he finds that our government is indeed sincere in reforming, I firmly believe that the US government will not only be willing to lend money, but will also further assist China with all its strength." Dr. Bu Nerong also said: "The general American public's perception of the CCP mainly comes from the books of left-wing writers such as Snow and Hot, who regard the CCP as a progressive party that is fighting for the interests of the people. When I return to the country this time, I will decide to conduct field investigations without relying on others, so as to investigate the truth of the motherland and provide it to my American friends." Dr. Bu is scheduled to return to the United States in mid-September.

### Zhonghe Party Hosts Press Conference, Expresses Declaration on the Current Situation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The China Zhonghe Party hosted a press conference in Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 1st, reporting on the party's history and revolutionary process, and issuing the Zhonghe Party's declaration on the current situation. According to the discussion, the party was founded on the National Day twenty-three years before the founding of the Republic of China, and has always regarded the realization of China's national politics as its consistent proposition. It also joined the Tongmenghui led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time to jointly overthrow the Manchu Qing and establish the Republic, and then participated in the Northern Expedition and jointly resisted the war. The party advocates that the democratization of politics must take the "nationalization of the army" as a prerequisite and the "democratization of the economy" as the actual guide. In its declaration, the party pointed out its propositions and urgent measures for the current situation: (1) Emergency propositions for domestic affairs: 1 Support the government's general mobilization order to suppress the rebellion and build the country. 2 Quickly seek currency stability and currency system reform to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis. 3 Rural relief should immediately thoroughly formulate a plan and quickly implement it. 4 All political parties in the country should eliminate differences and cooperate with friendly parties that can truly implement the Three Principles of the People.

### Chiang Chairman Sends Telegram of Condolence to Yu Zailin's Family

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram of condolence to Yu Zailin's family, saying: Jinzhou, Condolences to the family of the late Director Yu and to Mr. Yu Zailin's family: According to reports, Director Zailin died heroically in the Beipiao Coal Mine, which is shocking. Our country is extremely lacking in coking experts, and social training is not easy. The government has been protecting him, but the common bandits are inherently cruel and murdered him lightly, which is a great loss to the country. The general assembly's painful mourning is truly felt. In addition to instructing a generous pension to comfort his heroic spirit, a special telegram of condolence is sent.

### Chen Cheng Hosts Banquet for Provincial Chairmen

### Authoritative Sources Reveal News: Currency System May Be Reformed Within the Year

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Office recently quoted news from authoritative sources as saying that China may issue a new "managed currency" within this year. It is understood that Minister of Economics Chen Qitian has suggested to the Wedemeyer delegation that issuing a new currency can be a panacea to stop inflation. The Four Banks Joint Office continued that issuing a new currency will cause a major reaction, so the government will proceed cautiously. If it is said that adopting the gold standard, it cannot be implemented in China, because this must be accompanied by free foreign exchange. This would almost cause funds to escape China. As for whether to obtain US loans to support this new currency to be issued, it is still impossible to accurately ascertain whether the government and the Wedemeyer delegation are negotiating. A minister of the National Government told a reporter of this agency that the only difficulty for China to issue a new currency is the lack of funds. Another senior official replied to a reporter of this agency's inquiry about how much capital China needs to support the new currency, saying that it requires 500 million to 1 billion US dollars.

### Liu Handong and Others Resign, Chairman Sends Special Telegram to Retain

### Banking Law Temporarily Postponed for Promulgation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Banking Law was completed by the Legislative Yuan some time ago, and three months have passed, but it has not yet been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. The Legislative Yuan has repeatedly urged its promulgation. After the State Council raised it for discussion on the 1st, it believed that the law stipulates a wider scope for the establishment of banks, which should be applicable in peacetime. After the promulgation of the general mobilization order, it may be incompatible with the economic reform plan for controlling finance, which will be promulgated and implemented soon. It was resolved to temporarily postpone promulgation.

### Li Zongren and Others Return to Beiping. Discussion of the North China Situation is Expected to Improve. Wang Hongshao Has Resigned to Run for Legislative Committee

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] Li Zongren, accompanied by the newly appointed Deputy Director of the Xingyuan Office Wu Qiwei and Chief of Staff Xu Qiming, flew back to Beiping from Beijing at 12:30 noon on the 1st. Li said that there would be no changes in the military and political institutions in North China, and the statement that another bandit suppression organization would be established was inaccurate. In the future, more national troops will be transported to the north, and the situation in North China is expected to improve. Li denied that he would run for vice president or the chairman of Gui-Wan, and denied that he had been persuading people. He continued that Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao had resigned due to running for the Legislative Committee, but the statement that he would be appointed as deputy director was inaccurate. Wu Qiwei met with reporters and said that he had retired and is now wearing military uniform again. He came to the ancient capital seventeen years ago, and is very happy to revisit the old place.

### Coal Production Increase Meeting Opens; Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian Explains the Meeting's Purpose

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Coal Production Increase Conference, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase coal production, officially opened in Nanjing on the morning of the 1st. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian personally presided over the meeting, attended by fifty-two representatives from various agencies and units. Minister Chen delivered a speech first, explaining the purpose of convening the meeting, briefly stating: Due to the situation in the north, transportation to the north and south is obstructed. The Ministry, in view of this and as a precautionary measure, specifically convened this meeting, hoping to bring together those responsible from various regions to jointly discuss how to increase production in terms of capital, equipment, foreign exchange, transportation, and safety, so that the supply of coal for civilian, public, and industrial use in the Yangtze River basin will not be disrupted. Furthermore, it aims to accumulate coal reserves, enabling the continued development of industry. This is the first purpose of convening this meeting. If the Yangtze River basin can become self-sufficient in coal and no longer rely on North China, it will not only give hope for the independence of industry in Central China but also allow the surplus coal from North China to be exported. This is the second purpose. Again, the government's control over coal has been much more relaxed after the war than during the War of Resistance, but there are still areas that need to be reviewed to benefit both the public and private sectors. This is another purpose of convening this meeting. Finally, the problem of coal is not only about coal itself; transportation is also of great importance. For example, 300,000 tons of coal are stockpiled at Kailuo but cannot be transported out, while other regions feel a shortage of coal. How to facilitate smooth sea and land transportation so that surpluses and shortages can be mutually supplied is also a major purpose of this meeting. Chen concluded by saying: Among power industries, nothing is more important than coal. Gentlemen, imagine what would happen if the coal supply were cut off, and water, electricity, and transportation in the Shanghai-Nanjing area came to a standstill. He sincerely hoped that all attendees would focus on self-sufficiency in coal, especially in the Yangtze River basin.

Afternoon Session Continues; Production Increase Figures for Each Mine Determined

After Chen's speech, he read President Zhang's address and invited Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee and Director of the Coal Industry Administration Bureau of the Committee, and Gu Yuquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, to deliver speeches, which were full of encouragement. Subsequently, Wang Chongzhi, General Manager of the Beikai Coal Mine, Xu Weiman, Assistant Manager of the Huainan Coal Mine, and Lu Zidong of the East China Coal Mine reported on the situation of their respective mines and their hopes for the government. The speakers described in detail the difficult situation of each mine in recent years and hoped that the authorities would provide more assistance in foreign exchange and transportation to achieve the goal of increasing production as soon as possible, thereby reducing the unnecessary foreign exchange expenditure of the country due to the purchase of foreign coal. Finally, the proposal by Gu Yuquan for the assembly to send a telegram of condolences to the family of Yu Zailin, etc., was passed. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00.

The meeting continued at 3:00 PM, chaired by Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Zhang Zizhu. The representatives made the following decisions regarding the figures for the increase in production that should be made by each mine in the Central China region. After the first phase of production increase, the daily output by the end of the 36th year will be: Huainan 3,500 tons, East China 2,000 tons, Zhongxing 500 tons, Dazhong 200 tons, Jiangnan 200 tons, Xiangjiang·Zhongxiang·Huxiang 1,000 tons, Xiangnan 600 tons, Liling 200 tons, Ganxi 200 tons, Changyu 100 tons, and the Tianhe Guanyintan joint mines of Huimin Shouyi, etc. 500 tons, totaling 9,000 tons, i.e., 270,000 tons per month. After the second phase of production increase, the daily output by the end of June of the 37th year will be: Huainan 5,000 tons, East China 2,500 tons, Zhongxing 1,000 tons, Dazhong 400 tons, Jiangnan 500 tons, Xiangjiang·Zhongxiang·Huxiang 1,500 tons, Xiangnan 1,200 tons, Liling 400 tons, Ganxi 500 tons, Changxing 200 tons, and the Tianhe Guanyintan joint mines of Huimin Shouwu, etc. 800 tons, totaling 13,000 tons, i.e., 390,000 tons per month. As for the capital required by each mine, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will request the Executive Yuan to allocate special funds for turnover. The amount requested by each factory will be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun's Address: Increasing Production and Transportation are Equally Important

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At the opening session of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Coal Production Increase Conference, President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun delivered an address, stating: "Coal is the driving force of industry and transportation. Especially in our country, which lacks petroleum resources, whether the implementation of industrial construction plans can achieve the planned progress depends critically on the coordination of coal supply and planned progress. At the same time, now is a period of active suppression of the communists militarily, and the production of coal must especially be coordinated with the requirements of military transportation in order to quickly quell the unrest. Currently, increasing coal production is naturally quite difficult. Most of our country's important coal mines are in the provinces of North China and Northeast China, and these areas are the regions where the communist bandits are most rampant. In the areas occupied by the communist bandits, all coal mines have been completely destroyed. Therefore, the existing coal production throughout the country cannot meet the current needs of industry and railway and shipping transportation. The shortage for this year is approximately six million tons. In today's national financial difficulties, it is still necessary to spend a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase this type of material, which is abundantly stored domestically. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon that must be thoroughly improved in a short period of time. The purpose of our planning for increased production today is not only to meet the current required quantity but also to coordinate with the progress of the country's future construction plans for progressive increases in production. The planning for increased coal production naturally faces many difficulties due to the instability of the situation and the obstruction of transportation. Moreover, many problems are not inherent in the increase in production itself. For example, last year, hundreds of thousands of tons of stockpiled coal could not be transported out due to transportation obstructions. In order to supply the needs of various industrial areas, 500,000 tons were purchased from Vietnam, Australia, and Canada. From this, it can be seen that the current problem is not only increased production; transportation is equally important. The only way to remedy the problem of the disconnect between supply and demand is to focus on regional supply methods. However, the regions with developed industries are not necessarily the regions with abundant coal production. For example, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are the most developed industrial areas, but coal production is not abundant. All of these problems need to be discussed at length by coal mining entrepreneurs and experts. Expanding equipment, improving technology, and improving the lives of workers can all compensate for natural deficiencies. I sincerely hope that everyone will base their discussions on experience and understanding to quickly produce effective methods for increasing production and supply."

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Peiping for Inspection; Delivers Remarks and Seeks Political and Economic Intelligence; Scheduled to Meet with Hu Shi and Other Cultural and Educational Figures Today

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 1st] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived in Peiping at 6:40 PM on the 1st, flying from Nanjing. More than a hundred senior military and political officials and personnel from the US Consulate went to the airport to welcome them. Wedemeyer, wearing a blue suit with white dots, stepped off the plane with a smile. He was introduced by US Consul General in Peiping, Freeman, and shook hands with Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, He Siyuan, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Bojin, and others. Immediately afterward, at the request of reporters, he took a photo with Li Zongren and Chen Jicheng at the airport. When the reporters were taking photos, Wedemeyer repeatedly called out in Chinese, "Too hot, too familiar." He also spoke with Mayor He. He said: Nanjing is too hot; Peiping is cooler. He hoped that Wedemeyer would stay in Peiping for a few more days. Wedemeyer said: I was in Peiping the year before last, but it is a pity that Mayor He was still in Shandong, so we did not meet. I am very happy to meet you today. After the photography, Wedemeyer immediately went to the US Consulate in Dongjiaominxiang in a specially prepared blue car with the number 10050, accompanied by Freeman and Li Zongren, to rest. Today is US Air Force Day, and the US military in Peiping is holding a commemorative evening party and invited the entire special envoy delegation to participate. Wedemeyer, feeling tired from the long flight, was afraid that he would not be able to attend. He will have dinner at the consulate tonight and exchange opinions with the US personnel in Peiping after the meal. Wedemeyer is scheduled to visit Li Zongren at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, Sun Lianzhong at 10:00 AM, and Mayor He at 11:30 AM. In the afternoon, he will meet separately with cultural and educational figures such as Hu Shi and Liang Qiushui. At 8:00 PM, Freeman will host a banquet to entertain the special envoy delegation and invite more than a hundred people from military, political, and educational circles to accompany them. Li Zongren will host a banquet for the Wedemeyer delegation at noon on the 2nd. On the same day, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Mayor He will host a dinner at the Summer Palace and enjoy the moonlit scenery of Kunming Lake. According to Wedemeyer's news officer, Watson, Wedemeyer does not plan to go to Zhangjiakou or Dalian. Liang Qiushui, the person in charge of the reformist faction of the Democratic Socialist Party in the north, has also published his open letter, "Contribution to Special Envoy Wedemeyer," asking Wedemeyer to pay attention to the lives of the Chinese people.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st] Upon arriving in Peiping on the 1st, Special Envoy Wedemeyer issued a written statement from the special envoy delegation at the airport, stating: "Some of the information collected by the delegation in ten days is extremely valuable and can reconfirm the information we have obtained in the past. This is what the special envoy delegation urgently needs. New information provided by various parties, including official and civilian personnel, has proven to be useful. The materials provided by private individuals and representatives of various groups have greatly assisted the delegation in its collection and are greatly appreciated. The number of letters sent by patriotic Chinese citizens in their private capacity is also large and constructive. We will continue to study and discuss the information they provide and meet with individuals. After our trip to Peiping, we will also go to Shenyang and various cities in North China and Northeast China. We hope that the original information we obtain on this trip regarding the actual political and economic situation in these two regions will be effective. Our time in the north is very short, so we must devote all our efforts to 'truth-seeking' and 'analysis' work. We will stay in Peiping for three days. Future plans are still under consideration and will be announced when a decision is made."

### Mission Completes Sorting Data Obtained in Shanghai

### Accounting for Fifteen Years of Blood Debt; Excavating Remains at Pingdingshan

[Central News Agency, Pingdingshan, 30th] Today, your reporter participated in the excavation of the remains of the dead at Pingdingshan, the site of the first mass slaughter of our innocent people by the Japanese invaders. Pingdingshan is located six kilometers southeast of Fushun. Before the September 18th Incident, Fushun miners built houses on the hillside and lived there, about 500 households. On September 15th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Deng Tiemei and Tang Juwu, leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army, led their troops to attack Fushun at night, entering the mining area from the Pingdingshan area. The Japanese were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. In a fit of anger, they falsely accused the residents of Pingdingshan of "colluding with bandits" and collectively slaughtered the old, weak, women, and children in the area. Afterward, they poured oil on the corpses and cremated them, burying the remains at the foot of the mountain. At that time, more than 2,700 people were killed, and only 50-odd people survived. The dead have been wronged for fifteen years. Today, Yue Chengan, President of the Military Tribunal of the Northeast Headquarters of the Executive Yuan, went to Pingdingshan to exhume the bones and collect evidence in preparation for accounting for this great blood debt. More than ten workers held hoes and excavated at the foot of both sides of the mountain. Only two feet into the ground, white bones were visible, mixed with more than ten silver dollars, hairpins, and glass smoking pipes. All the excavating workers burst into tears because they were either relatives of the dead or survivors who had personally experienced the scene at that time. Therefore, they were overwhelmed with grief at the sight of the objects.

The situation in Jinan has now entered the stage of mopping up and cleaning up. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing the Communist bandits who fled north from Linqu in the areas on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway.

### On the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan; Our Country Takes a Cautious Approach; Formal Conference Should be Held in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on the 1st that our country's reply to the United States' invitation to convene a preliminary conference on a peace treaty with Japan was submitted as early as July 17th, but the full text of the reply will not be released at this time.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] China hopes that the conference on a peace treaty with Japan will be held within China and insists on a voting method that prevents the Soviet Union or any country from hindering the proceedings of the conference. According to diplomatic circles who have exchanged views on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, experts from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intend to submit the following preliminary wishes: (1) The formal peace treaty conference should be held within China, approximately in Shanghai. (2) All countries involved in the war against Japan should attend the conference, not limited to the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. (3) The voting procedure of the formal conference must be approved by more than half of the attending representatives and three-quarters of the four major powers. This procedure is especially effective when any country attempts to obstruct the conference. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reporter to the United Press, China is taking a completely cautious attitude toward the issue of a peace treaty and is not in a hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan. China, which has fresh memories of the Japanese invasion, will never allow itself to forget the danger of new aggression. We must be sure that the peace treaty can guarantee that China and other countries in Asia will no longer be harmed by Japanese ambitions in the future. China's proposed voting plan will be presented for the first time at the preliminary meeting to be convened by the United States soon. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun to notify the US government that China is willing to cooperate in preliminary exchanges of views on a peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese government, due to the ongoing civil strife and economic insecurity, fears that the treaty, even if it does not allow Japan to restore its military position in the Far East, will be a precursor to its economic recovery.

### If the Soviet Union Obstructs the Peace Conference, It Will Re-Energize Japan

American Reporter Kern Returns to the United States and Reports

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] According to Kern, the international editor of Newsweek who returned here from Japan, if the Soviet Union implements a policy of opposing the convening of a peace conference with Japan and continues to use its "obstruction" tactics, the United States will revitalize Japan. Kern stated in the latest issue of Newsweek: "If the Soviet Union opposes the peace conference with Japan, it will be unable to obstruct the United States except by inciting strikes in Japan. However, in order to have effective strikes, the communist-controlled unions will inevitably be public and may encounter suppression by the occupying authorities." Kern stated that if the Soviet Union takes other more dangerous measures, such as providing increasing and overt assistance to the Chinese Communists, it is not entirely impossible that the United States will not only revitalize Japan industrially, but also militarily.

### Northeast Rice Seedlings Grow Luxuriantly; Autumn Harvest May Be Bountiful

### UNRRA to Intensify Protection of Water Conservancy Projects in Various Areas

[Our Newspaper Report] During this summer and autumn flood season, engineers from UNRRA and the Ministry of Water Conservancy are intensifying the protection of water conservancy projects throughout the country undertaken by UNRRA. In the Yellow River area, under the guidance of Chief Engineer Todd, they are making every effort to prevent possible floods. However, their efforts can only be effective if military operations along the river are stopped and the safety of the levee repair workers is guaranteed. Since the government notified UNRRA that it could not guarantee the safety of levee repair personnel, UNRRA's participation in repairing and strengthening the river dikes has come to a halt. However, if the Yellow River were to burst its banks, the people of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei would suffer unprecedented disasters. The UNRRA Central Committee has repeatedly appealed to President Chiang Kai-shek, and UNRRA Director General Major General Rooks formally wrote to the President on July 28 to discuss the matter, requesting the President to provide UNRRA's levee repair personnel with appropriate facilities and issue necessary formal instructions to the leaders in the area. This matter is currently being discussed in Nanjing. In addition to the Yellow River project, there are seven other UNRRA-sponsored water conservancy projects. In the Huai River area and the Grand Canal area, there are four UNRRA experts under the guidance of a Dutch engineer, ready to deal with rapid water level rises at any time. In the Huai River project, UNRRA has supplied 800,000 sandbags to prevent possible dike collapses, and 160,000 have also been supplied for the Grand Canal water conservancy project. The Huai River project, which had been suspended in the past due to high water levels, has now resumed. UNRRA and CNRRA are providing personnel, flour, cash, and equipment. It is hoped that this project will be completed by the end of this year.

### Editorial: Expedite Fuel Self-Sufficiency!

To bring up the issue of our country's fuel self-sufficiency today may seem impossible. However, fuel self-sufficiency should be our national policy from now on - we must move in this direction. Needless to say, we rely on foreign countries for liquid fuels. Even for coal, we must rely on foreign countries. Coal from Vietnam's Tonkin and the Dutch East Indies' Sumatra is still being imported to supply our markets, even though we lack foreign exchange funds today. How can we not feel hidden pain or worry! All our efforts from now on must be focused on seeking our self-sufficiency. One of the main projects is undoubtedly fuel self-sufficiency. In this sense, we welcome the convening of meetings such as the Coal Production Increase Conference. According to reports, the convening of this conference is aimed at remedying the interruption of coal sources in North and Northeast China. Its purpose and the goal of fuel self-sufficiency are far apart. However, it must be said that it is gratifying that the government can convene this conference at this time to conduct a planned review and comprehensive plan for increasing coal production.

Originally, most of China's coal mines that had already been operated and had a considerable scale were concentrated in North China and Northeast China. The Kaiyuan, Zhongxing, Jingxing, Jiaozuo, and Beipiao mines were all in North China. Needless to say, Fushun, which is world-renowned. However, Changxing in Zhejiang and Pingxiang in Jiangxi were also famous coal-producing areas in the country. Among them, the coal in Pingxiang, together with the iron in Daye and the steel in Hanyang, formed Hanyeping, whose important position in our country's economic history was comparable to that of the Ruhr area in Germany. The Changxing coal mine in Zhejiang was a famous coal area in the southeast, and it was operated early with huge investments. What we don't understand is that, two years after the victory, at a time when our country is short of fuel, we have not heard of active operations of the Pingxiang and Changxing mines. Is this because the government lacks an overall policy on coal mine operations? Or are there other reasons?

It is true that the coal in Changxing and Pingxiang may have problems in production and transportation. But can these problems not be solved at all? We believe that the main problem is still a matter of policy and efficiency. Since the establishment of the Resources Commission, all mineral resources in the country, even if not completely operated directly by the Resources Commission, must be subject to the commission. This cannot but be said to be a considerable blow to the people. It is said that the shutdown of the Pingxiang coal mine was due to the fact that the iron smelting part of Hanyeping was changed to state-owned, which was affected as a result. The problem here is: If the entire Hanyeping is to be changed to state-owned, why can the shutdown of the Pingxiang coal mine be allowed? Is this still the government's lack of policy? Or is it the decline in administrative efficiency? As for the Changxing coal mine in Zhejiang, it took a lot of effort to operate in the beginning, and a railway was built to facilitate coal transportation. At this time when coal is urgently needed, sitting idly by and letting it be abandoned, we don't know what the reason is.

The convening of this Coal Production Increase Conference cannot but make people feel like they are putting out a fire. However, even to put out a fire, we hope that they can come up with a solution. Moreover, what is valuable about the solution is not only that it can be produced, but also that it can be actively implemented and implemented effectively. What we hope even more is that, due to the convening of this Coal Production Increase Conference, we can expedite fuel self-sufficiency, and we can only achieve our goal when we can stop relying on imported fuels.

### Opening of Trade with Japan

The issue of opening trade with Japan has been approved by the State Council yesterday. The discussion phase of this case has ended and will enter the stage of how to open it.

There are naturally many areas that should be studied here, and the two most urgent ones are: (1) the types of goods to be imported and exported to Japan, and (2) the selection of personnel for the inspection team to Japan.

We believe that imported goods should be limited to things that our country does not have or produces very little of. The key is that they can meet our urgent needs without competing with domestic goods and hindering the survival of domestic factories. As for exports, we should mainly focus on what we have in excess and do not need to use ourselves. As for whether it is raw material or finished product, this is a secondary matter.

Secondly, regarding the selection of personnel for the inspection team, in addition to the competent authorities related to trade with Japan, we should select and assign personnel who have purple research. We should also send more representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, and it is appropriate to have people who are actually engaged in industry, who are knowledgeable, and experienced. Our opinion is that these personnel should preferably be nominated by domestic manufacturers themselves, because they know the advantages and disadvantages most clearly, and only they are more concerned. As for those pro-Japanese elements who specialized in doing business with Japan in the past, and ordinary street politicians and trendy bureaucrats, I am afraid they have other functions and may not necessarily plan everything on the premise of national industry.

Many people are worried that once trade with Japan is opened, goods from Japan will pour in continuously, gradually returning to the pre-war phenomenon of Japanese goods dumping. This seems to be an overstatement in today's era of strict control over import and export trade. However, foreign goods smuggling is rampant today. Hong Kong, as a transit port, is a major loophole in current controlled trade. After the opening of trade with Japan, we earnestly hope that the authorities will take further strict measures to prevent the limited import from becoming an informal unlimited opening.

### Corpse Resting for Too Long: Fees Can Be Appropriately Reduced

### Two Fires on Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Trains; Extinguished Early Morning, Fortunately No Injuries; Arson Suspect Arrested

The 23rd first and second class express train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou at 6:45 AM yesterday. At 9:15 AM, while the train was passing Jiaxing Station, a fire suddenly broke out in the fourth first-class carriage behind the locomotive. The conductor noticed it and used the emergency signal to stop the train. After an emergency brake and rescue efforts, the fire was extinguished. Fortunately, no passengers were killed or injured. After the carriage was detached, the train continued to Hangzhou, with a slight delay.

Train No. 54 on the Beijing-Shanghai line was passing Danyang Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning when thick smoke suddenly billowed from a fourth-class carriage, followed by raging flames. Passengers panicked and fled, causing great disorder. Fortunately, the railway police on board discovered it and quickly used fire extinguishers to put out the fire, averting a major incident. While fighting the fire, the railway police noticed a passenger named Wang Cunhua, wearing a blue short shirt, acting flustered. While the police were extinguishing the fire, he suddenly threw a glass bottle out of the window. The railway police broke the bottle, immediately questioned him. The suspect stammered evasively. Suspecting him of serious wrongdoing, the railway police immediately took him to the Danyang Police Section. Under strict questioning, the suspect only claimed to be an ordinary passenger returning to Beijing from Shanghai, citing facts to prove his claim. The railway police retrieved the glass bottle he had thrown away from the railway track for confrontation. At this point, the suspect's face suddenly changed, but he still denied setting the fire. He was then taken to Nanjing for further strict questioning. Realizing he could no longer deny it, the suspect admitted that the fire source belonged to him and that the glass bottle contained "ether" and nitric acid. He also admitted to being a drug dealer and that the items he carried were raw materials for making drugs, and the burning paper package on the train contained nitric acid. Police Chief Wang Zhaohu believed that the suspect's confession was contradictory and that he had set the fire while the railway police were unprepared, attempting to disrupt the security of the two lines. However, based on his statement that the fire source he carried was raw material for drug production, experts are currently being consulted for research. At the same time, further investigation is being ordered to uncover the truth of the case.

### Smuggling Black Market Gold; Three "Dan Bang" Confess Without Reservation

[Our Report] Regarding the case of the police局 cracking down on a large-scale smuggling of black market gold gang published in this newspaper yesterday, the Administration Office of the Bureau has issued the following account of the cracking of the case: On the 31st of last month, the Economic Section of this office received a tip that three gold smugglers had flown from Hankou to Shanghai on the 27th aboard a China National Aviation Corporation passenger plane, using their specially made vests to bring a total of 75 gold bars, weighing approximately 750 taels. They had sold them in batches on the black market in Shanghai through the broker Ku Bingyan. Part of the proceeds were remitted to Hankou through the Shanghai Trust Company. The three were preparing to leave Shanghai for Hankou on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an轮 at noon that day. Section Chief Xu Youzuo immediately dispatched officers to the wharf and arrested the three in the dining room of the steamer. Three specially made vests and remittance receipts from the Shanghai Trust Company worth 800 million yuan and odd checks worth over 100 million yuan were seized on the spot. After strict interrogation at the Bureau, they confessed without reservation. An immediate search was launched for the black market organization and broker Ku Bingyan who had sold the gold for them. Ku was arrested by yesterday morning, but his confession was cunning, and he remained uncooperative until late at night. The police局 has notified the Central Bank to urgently telegraph the Hankou bank to stop payment of the remittance from the Shanghai Trust Company. In addition, it has been learned that the number of gold bars smuggled by the three was 35 by Chen Kechang and 40 each by Hu Zhengshan and Wu Xingwen. The remittance receipts worth 800 million yuan seized by the police局 at the time were from the sale of Chen Kechang's gold bars. The funds of the other two are still under investigation.

### Hong Weilie Murder Case; Vendetta More Likely Than Love Affair

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, stars glittered in the grand auditorium of the China Funeral Parlor on Haig Road. Jin Yan, Liu Qiong, Pei Chong, Bai Lu, Wang Renmei, Han Langan, and dozens of other film industry practitioners, including the great directors Fei Mu and Wu Yonggang, mourned the famous photographer Hong Weilie, who was shot dead on the night of July 29th. The vast auditorium, with only forty-odd people, appeared even more desolate. Since abandoning film to engage in business ten years ago, Hong Weilie had drifted apart from his friends in the film industry. His old friends have no opinion on the occurrence of this unfortunate event, other than hoping for an early resolution of the case, and cannot provide any clues. However, judging from Hong Weilie's personality, family, and economic environment, it is more reasonable to say that this is a vendetta than a love affair, because Hong Weilie is already 47 years old this year and has seven children.

Hong Weilie's involvement in the film industry began in the silent film era. He studied in Japan, studying in the army, but usually loved photography, and had a lot of research on photography. After returning to China, he raised funds to set up a film company. After that, he joined the Lianhua Company as a photographer, and his reputation gradually increased. When he made films, he paid special attention to the light source, with unique ingenuity, making ugly things beautiful, and dull things lively, creating a new era in the history of Chinese film photography. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, he joined "China Electric", and his first film "Secret Code" was a sensation. His photography was again re-evaluated. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he edited and shot battlefield newsreels. "Children of China" and "Long Sky Thousands of Miles" are his masterpieces, and also his last works. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, "Long Sky Thousands of Miles" was released, and he left the film industry at that time, because the family burden made him look for a job that was more profitable than photography.

He came to Shanghai to engage in commerce after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. He followed General Fan Shaozeng to Shanghai and lived in Fan's mansion at No. 11 Dumei Road, but his family remained in Chongqing, Shangqing Temple, the former residence of General Fan, and was not brought to Shanghai. His acquaintance with General Fan was not too long. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, "China Electric" retreated from Wuhan to Chongqing, and there was no photography studio. General Fan had an indoor tennis court, which could be easily transformed into an ideal studio. At the request of "China Electric", General Fan generously agreed to borrow it. Hong Weilie met General Fan at that time, because he often accompanied General Fan to play ball, the feelings gradually deepened. His bold, straightforward and righteous personality was deeply appreciated by General Fan, so after the victory, he worked in General Fan's Yuzeng Trading Company. Fan was also very sad about Hong's murder, and all the funeral expenses were handled by Fan himself.

More Silent Than Before; It is rumored that the cause of this tragedy was a romantic dispute, because Hong Weilie once lived with the dancer Shen Ying, but after the police局 investigation, no new clues were found on Shen Ying. His eldest son, Hong Wenda, happened to come to Shanghai from Chongqing shortly before he was assassinated to take the university entrance examination. Besides grief, he couldn't say anything about his father's sudden assassination. A relative of Hong Weilie said that the last time she met him, Hong Weilie was in a bad mood, saying that he was not feeling well, and he was more silent than before. This cannot be said to be his premonition of being killed. As for rumors that he borrowed a pistol from a friend a few days ago to defend himself, it is not possible to determine how much it is related to the tragedy before the police局's investigation is over. However, according to the speculation of most people, this case is complicated on the surface, but simple in reality, and there will be a day when the truth comes to light.

A still from a movie Hong Weilie made during his lifetime.

### Handover Ceremony Held for New and Old Police Chiefs; Mayor Wu Presided Over the Delivery of the Seal of Office

The handover ceremony for the new and old police chiefs of the Municipal Police Bureau was held at the Bureau's square at 9:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony, and all senior officials of the Bureau and the chiefs of various precincts attended on time. The ceremony was solemn. At the beginning of the ceremony, Mayor Wu led the outgoing Chief Xuan Tiewu and the incoming Chief Yu Shuping into the venue amidst music. Everyone stood up to pay their respects, and the atmosphere was very serious. Then the seal was handed over. Chief Xuan handed the seal to Mayor Wu, who then transferred it to Chief Yu.

Mayor Wu's Speech: Thank You, Commander Xuan

In his speech, Mayor Wu said: (1) Commander Xuan has been concurrently serving as the police chief for over a year and has been in charge of the handover work, which was very difficult. After the handover, he worked harder to maintain law and order, so that Shanghai could be stable under complex circumstances. I express my deep gratitude, which is also felt by the 4 million citizens of Shanghai. Commander Xuan has resigned several times due to health reasons. This time, the central government approved his resignation from the concurrent position, but Commander Xuan is still responsible for the important task of Shanghai's security, and we will still be able to cooperate in the future. (2) The new Chief Yu has assisted Commander Xuan in maintaining local security in the past, and has also been here for more than two years. He is familiar with the local situation, and will make greater contributions to the municipal administration work of this city in the future.

Two Wishes for All Police Officers

At this time of transition between the old and new chiefs, a police incident occurred. The central government has sent senior officials to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate, and it will definitely be handled in accordance with national law. However, after the occurrence of this case, the general public felt that confidence in Shanghai's security had been lost. I hope that all police officers in the various police precincts will pay attention to restoring public confidence. First, they must fulfill their responsibilities, and second, they must distinguish right from wrong. They must work hard in their own positions and maintain the glorious reputation of the past. Under the leadership of the new chief, they will have even more special performance.

Outgoing Chief Xuan's Farewell Speech

Then, outgoing Chief Xuan delivered a speech, recalling that in the past two years of his tenure, relying on the unified spirit of unity from top to bottom, he had achieved remarkable results in his work, expressing his joy and gratitude, and taking "Act with responsibility, be thrifty to cultivate integrity, be fair in dealing with affairs, and treat people with sincerity" as a farewell message. After that, Chief Yu delivered a speech, briefly stating that he felt ashamed for not having made any contribution to his work in the two years he followed Commander Xuan, and that in the future he would act in accordance with Xuan's. Under the guidance of the wise Mayor Wu, he will fulfill his duties loyally and be willing to encourage each other with his colleagues.

Handover Ceremony for New and Old Police Chiefs

After the ceremony was completed at 10:10 AM, the new and old chiefs handled the handover procedures in the club on the seventh floor of the Bureau, with Ge Kexin, a consultant of the Municipal Government, supervising the handover. Chief Xuan led the chiefs of the police局 to hand over, and Chief Yu ordered the chiefs to "return the original handover". After the handover procedures were completed, Xuan and Yu convened the chiefs of the various precincts on the eighth floor for instructions. At about 11:00 AM, Yu led all his subordinates to respectfully send off former Chief Xuan. Departed from the Bureau.

Police Chief Yu Announces Future Administrative Policies

After taking office, Police Chief Yu Shuping issued a written statement on his future administrative policies, which are as follows: (1) For future administrative policies, we should still continue to implement the administrative guidelines and the original work plan formulated by former Chief Xuan. (2) Former Chief Xuan's spirit of perseverance and sincere love has inspired us. In the future, we should follow his original intention and handle matters according to his wishes. (3) In order to strengthen the police force, on the one hand, we should improve the quality of police officers and continue to strengthen training, and on the other hand, we should rectify the discipline of police officers and improve service ethics. (4) The police system should be coordinated with the overall municipal administration. In the future, we should strive to strengthen the relationship between them in order to exert work efficiency. (5) At a time when prices are soaring and police officers are struggling to live, it is important to handle police welfare undertakings. (6) All the personnel of this bureau are comrades who have shared weal and woe for the past two years. I hope that they will maintain their original intentions and serve with peace of mind. (7) The unfortunate incident at the Jindu Theater has caused such a great loss to the police局. I deeply regret that I hope that the senior officials of the central government will make proper and reasonable arrangements in the shortest possible time. (8) The police work in this city is heavy and complicated. I am afraid that I am not capable of doing it myself. Fortunately, under the leadership of the wise Mayor and Yi Commander, I have inherited from them, and I hope that everyone will give me more assistance and encouragement, so as to avoid falling.

Also, the chiefs of the various bureaus and the chiefs of the various precincts of the police局 have not changed. The resignation of Xu Xu, the former director of the Personnel Office, has been approved, and the Municipal Government has transferred Wu Jie, the third section chief of the Personnel Office, to succeed him. He took office yesterday.

### Americans Look at Next Year's World Games Track and Field May Dominate Sweden and Finland are Two Strong Rivals

[Central News Agency, New York Airmail] Americans firmly believe that they can dominate the World Games to be held in London next year, with Sweden coming in second and Finland taking a close third.

American sports figures estimate that at the World Games: the United States will fail in long-distance track events, but in sprints and skill-oriented events, the United States can score enough points to make up for it. In short, the United States believes that they have too much strength in all aspects and are not easily defeated by any other country. The United States is confident of winning for another reason, which is that the participating teams from the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have all been greatly weakened due to the impact of the war. Whether the Soviet Union will participate is still in doubt, so judging from the current situation, the athletes of the United States only believe that Sweden may be a strong rival to the United States.

Amateur Athletic Union Games

From the performance of the American athletes who participated in the 60th anniversary games of the Amateur Athletic Union of America, we can get a glimpse of the strength of the American team participating in the World Games. In the above-mentioned games, the top American track and field athletes broke three records and tied two American track and field records. The best result was the javelin record created by Schumer of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, with a result of 148 feet, only ten feet short of the world record held by the Finnish representative. The other two record-breaking events were the 2,900-meter mixed relay, with a result of 7 minutes and 4.3 seconds, and the 400-meter relay, with a result of 40.9 seconds. (The winners were all from the St. Anthony Athletic Club) The two national records tied were Dillard's 200-meter low hurdles, with a result of 23.3 seconds, and the Los Angeles Athletic Club's 1,600-meter relay, with a result of 3 minutes and 15 seconds. American sports figures remember that the weakness of the American team participating in the World Games is long-distance running. They believe that the United States will have no hope of scoring points in long-distance track events from half a mile to the marathon. It is speculated that Swedish long-distance runners will dominate the long-distance running events from half a mile, and other European countries may also help. American sports figures know that Sweden has excellent long-distance runners who can create a 1,500-meter record in 3 minutes and 48 seconds, and Sweden has six more long-distance runners whose performance is within two seconds of this amazing record.

Strength of Athletes from Other Countries

Regarding the excellent athletes from other countries, according to American surveys: the Netherlands has one named Girikxius, whose 1,500-meter performance is 3 minutes and 50.4 seconds, and France has one named Han Baona, whose 1,500-meter performance is 3 minutes and 48.5 seconds. In the 5,000-meter event, three Swedish long-distance runners, British Woodson, Finnish Hanro, and Czech Chatobek all have world record-level performances. In the 10,000-meter event, Finnish Hanro and five Swedish long-distance runners have a controlling advantage. In the marathon, Sweden has many strong players. In addition, Finnish Hettonan and Korean Xu Yongfu have hopes of winning the championship. The American Amateur Athletic Union authorities are not very hopeful that the American women's team will win the track and field championship at next year's World Games. In the American Women's Amateur Advanced and Junior Games held in St. Anthony recently, there was not even one female athlete who could achieve anything close to the American record. Ferris, the secretary of the American Amateur Athletic Union, said: "American women's interest in track and field has greatly decreased. We lack large and fat girls, which other countries have." Despite the above-mentioned difficulties and strong rivals, the United States hopes to score more points in sprints and skill-oriented events so that they can win the championship in the World Games.

### China Youth Volleyball Main Force Battle Huayan Lost to the Soviet Union After the Replay, the Two Teams Re-Decide the Championship

In the China Youth Volleyball Tournament, the Soviet team avenged their previous defeat last night. After five hard-fought games, they finally defeated Cong and now the two teams have equal records. They will wait for the replay to be completed before re-deciding the champion. There were a total of three men's and women's games yesterday. In the women's group game, Jinde Bai vs. Fuhua was quite tense. As a result, Fuhua defeated Jinde Bai by two to one. In the second act, Huayan B from the second middle school vs. Zhi Team, Huayan B always took the upper hand and won two games to celebrate the victory.

The final act of the A-level game is related to the championship. Huayan has never been defeated since its debut. Yu Xunzhong once defeated the Soviet Union by three to two. If they win again in yesterday's game, the championship will be in their pocket. The Soviet Union has also only lost this one game, and their hopes for the championship are not completely lost. Yesterday, they met Huayan again, and the enemies met on a narrow road. At 7 PM, the two heroes took the stage. Huayan played quite smoothly in the first game, taking the lead with 21 to 18. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Soviet Union fiercely fought in the second and third games and turned the tide, 21 to 10, 21 to 18, and reversed the lead in two consecutive games. In the fourth game, Huayan was unwilling to lag behind and desperately fought. The effect was immediately visible. 21 to 9, they easily tied the game at two each. In the final game, both sides were at the critical moment of life and death, and the battle was fierce. Huayan was exhausted to cope, and their forces gradually showed signs of weakness, gradually falling behind. As a result, the Soviet Union won with 21 to 17 and avenged their previous defeat, with the scores equal for both sides. After Huayan and Yongsha Hong complete the replay, if Huayan wins, they will re-decide the championship. If Yongsha wins, the championship will fall into the hands of the foreign army. The results of each game yesterday are as follows:

(1) Fuhua wins Jinde Bai (Women) 21-12, 18-21, 21-11. (2) Huayan B wins the Zhi Team (Middle B) 21-11, 21-12. (3) The Soviet Union wins Huayan (Group A) 18-21, 21-10, 21-18, 9-21, 21-17.

### Various Industrial Trade Associations Strive for Raw Material Quota Allocation Rights

Scheduled to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing Next Wednesday

[Our Reporter] The Import Quota Raw Material Allocation Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4 PM yesterday. More than 50 representatives from various industrial trade associations, including Tian He and Pan Shihao, Wang Zhuyi, Gu Qiu, etc., passed the following proposals:

(A) Emergency Measures (1) Please ask the Import Control Committee to announce the first phase of quota allocation to Hejia and the amount of quota. (2) If various industrial trade associations have not won quotas, each will send representatives to negotiate with the Import Management Committee. (3) In addition to describing the reasons in detail in official documents to request quotas from the Import Control Committee, various industrial trade associations will also publicize in various newspapers the necessity of directly allocating industrial raw materials to factories.

(B) Should Continue to Send Personnel to Beijing to Promote (1) Rigidly stipulate the allocation ratio of quota raw materials between industry and commerce. (2) Order the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to jointly organize a review committee to review the import quotas for industry and commerce, and order the Import Control Committee not to allow any association to apply before the review. (3) Suppress importers manipulating the market and refusing to sign contracts. (4) Allow factories to freely handle foreign exchange and order raw materials from abroad when the quota raw materials are less than three months' worth. (5) Establish specialized institutions in the short term to supply the needs of various industrial raw materials?

(C) Fundamental Solutions (1) For the sake of maintaining industry, the government should provide special speed and convenience to factories that need raw materials to directly import from abroad and apply to the Import Control Committee for import licenses. (2) Factories that need raw materials should request the government to directly allocate quotas and then order from importers. In addition to obtaining legitimate profits, importers must not impose extra harsh conditions. Otherwise, factories should be allowed to directly order raw materials from overseas. (3) The government should directly supply the manufacturing factories with industrial raw materials ordered at official exchange rates to avoid waste caused by corruption. It is inconsistent with the principle for vendors to request quotas on the pretext of supplying factories outside Shanghai. The government should entrust the local branches of the Industrial Association to handle this matter. (4) Importers claim that the imported raw materials are also allocated to factories, but it is questionable whether importers can evenly supply various industrial factories with imported raw materials and not add various conditions other than profits. Therefore, the government should still entrust the industrial associations to centrally allocate various imported raw materials. And designate legal representatives to check whether the prices of the raw materials imported by importers exceed the legal prices.

During the meeting, it was decided that each industrial trade association would send one to two representatives to petition in Beijing on the 11 PM night train next Wednesday (6th), and after entertaining Nanjing newspaper reporters on the afternoon of the 7th, they would return to Shanghai at 3:45 PM that afternoon. [Another News] Representatives of various industrial trade associations expressed the following regarding the State Council's approval of the "partial" opening of trade with Japan: (1) Please ask the government to explain "partial" opening and determine its scope. (2) Approve of what is beneficial to our country's industry and commerce within the defined scope, and resolutely oppose what is harmful to the end.

### Multiple Large-Scale Supply and Sales Hua Shares Turn Weak at Closing

Shares struggled very hard yesterday. Yarn and cotton traders bought enthusiastically, but the actual goods chips of Guangdong traders and yarn factories were still flowing out in large quantities. High prices could not last, and finally fell at the close, ending in weakness. Except for Xinguang, which was determined due to buying factors, the second-hottest and miscellaneous shares were stable, and Yonggong's trading was limited and also rose. The situation was still loose and optimistic.

When the market opened in the morning, the report that trade between China and Japan was bound to open and that the increase in the cost of living index would not have much impact, it continued the momentum of the previous close and opened higher. After Di Yongs yarn opened as high as 235 yuan, Nos. 32 and 232 settled, falling slightly. Nos. 223, 154, 157, and 197 advanced again, and then rose to 231.6 yuan. Nos. 108, 142, 143, and 160 were supplied, falling to 230 yuan. Nos. 97, 104, and 76 still advanced, pulling up slightly. In the end, all sales were made for Nos. 143, 103, 219, 23, 8, and 224, gradually lowering to 228 yuan. Extending to 10:40 AM, Nos. 231, 154, 196, 65, 223, 153, 12, and 171 came to advance, and No. 190 also advanced Yongs yarn, and gradually rose again to 238 yuan. Guangdong traders vigorously sold Yongs yarn for Nos. 218, and Nos. 117, 172, 143, and 157 also sold, gradually falling to around 230 yuan. After 11:30 AM, Nos. 134, 12, 112, and 148 vigorously sold, and Nos. 157, 126, 172, 8, 152, and 232 also sold. At the close, Yongs yarn fell to 224 yuan to close the market. Yongs yarn fell to 226 yuan, and then ended at 228 yuan. Only Yonggong was still stable among the remaining shares. Xinguang was popular and then rebounded slightly, still showing stability. Jingfu Huafeng was not optimistic. After the close, Yongs yarn was lowered slightly by the supply from Nos. 73 and 76. As a result, compared with the previous close, that is, the delivery shares, Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing declined slightly, Xinguang and Xinhua rose slightly, Yonggong's transaction was sparse, and the price was raised by a small amount. Sino-French and domestic goods were flat, Shangwu Rongfeng fell by half, Zean Zhongfang Datong rose slightly, Jinglun Tongyi underwear declined slightly, matches rose by half, and Zhongsi also rose by a small amount. In the delivery shares, only Xinguang rose slightly, while Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Huafeng, and Jingfu declined slightly. Outside the market, the old shares were still flat and weak except for Zhongxing.

### Government Bonds Active Foreign Shares Stable

Government bonds were encouraged yesterday by the news that pre-war deposits and court rulings still required repayment a thousand times over, and people were excited. Tongbing opened at 10,300 yuan in the morning, and from 10,200 yuan, it gradually rose to 11,400 yuan, and then closed slightly at the boundary of 11,000 yuan. Rooms 552, 555, and 503 bought in, while Rooms 230 and 360 sold out. As a result, it rose by 1,000 yuan compared with the previous attack, while the others rose by 500 yuan to 800 yuan, and the transaction volume was more than 5 million.

Yesterday, Yisha British County Boiler was helped by the signing of the peace treaty with Japan and the hope of compensation, and it was shown to be excellent. The rest were just flat and weak. Security traders and money changers sold, while foreign merchants and Guohua Bank bought in. Yisha rose from 83,000 to 86,000 to close the market. Rubber shares have stabilized, and as a result, compared with the previous close, paper, fear of beer, and shipping were all flat, Huidefeng Yeguangji fell, and Yisha and British Union Steel both rose slightly.

### Narrow Fluctuations in Rayon Prices; Steady Factory-Operated Silk Goods Market

Because the allocation of rayon has not yet been confirmed, the market remains firm. Yesterday, the opening price for No. 120 Takayama rayon was 24.78 million yuan, with the highest reaching 90 million yuan, fluctuating within a narrow range of only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The final price in the afternoon was 4.8 million yuan. The sales of No. 150 Takayama rayon were slower, and the selling price was also lower. Yesterday, the transaction price for Jin San Ma brand rayon was 24 million yuan.

The factory-operated market was steady. Due to cost factors, holders were unwilling to sell at low prices. Yesterday, the asking price for C-grade Lan Fuhua rayon was 29 million yuan, and for E-grade, it was 28.5 million yuan, with only a few transactions. However, all payments were subject to five to seven-day terms. Separately, 28-branch raw silk was traded at 17 million yuan.

The silk goods market was stable yesterday. Dachang quilt cover closed at 20.4 million yuan for immediate delivery, with an additional 20,000 yuan for deferred delivery. The closing price for Huaqiang quilt cover was the same as the previous day. Transactions for checkered crepe were sluggish, with an asking price of 33,900 yuan, and 3,670 yuan was bid. The price of Chong Shili spun silk increased slightly. Yesterday's price in Shanghai was 280,000 yuan, and the prime quality was 290,000 to 300,000 yuan. The market prices for other goods remained unchanged.

### Sluggish Spot Cotton Transactions

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was sluggish, with very few transactions and a weak trend. It was difficult for holders to unload their goods. Due to the sluggish sales of cotton yarn, the appetite of yarn mills was weak. Most businesses had more outflows than inflows, and the fatigue did not seem likely to improve in the short term, so transactions were difficult to facilitate. In the afternoon, the opening price for Bai Luo to be delivered from the warehouse was 2.06 million yuan, Bao was 2.1 million yuan, and Huoji was 1.72 million yuan.

Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened weakly. Small-size cloth once fell to 421,000 yuan. Then, with the northern merchants slightly increasing their purchases of Wufu small-size cloth, local businesses also slightly absorbed the low prices. Moreover, because the Textile Construction Company's supply of cloth yesterday had few subscribers, the market supply became scarce, and prices became brisk. Finally, 12-pound Longtou small-size cloth rose to 432,500 yuan, an increase of 7,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Wufu Lan, Caiqiu, Yanghe and other small-size cloths also rose by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. The white plain cloth market also showed some profit. There were many spot goods of Shilin cloth 190 Ji and Taohuagong, falling by 10,000 yuan. The colored cloth and blue cloth market were stable. [Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Textile Association yesterday, totaling 677 bales, all allocated to manufacturers, with a total of 259 applications.

### Sparse Food Rice Transactions; Milled Rice Continues to Decline

Yesterday, a total of over 2,800 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market trend was that prices in the inland areas fell, causing public sentiment to be weak and transactions in the market to be sparse. Milled glutinous rice and indica rice gradually declined, falling by 10,000 yuan. However, Bai Yuan Yin Yuan rice was still firm due to scarcity. Over ten dan of new Pudong glutinous rice continued to arrive, divided into high and secondary grades, with prices unchanged. Xiang rice is currently in transit, and large quantities will be transported eastward from Hankou. Rice from Gan and Anhui is also arriving in Shanghai, and rice from Sichuan continues to flow. The situation for indica rice is temporarily less optimistic.

Flour dealers are still pessimistic. However, because raw materials are firm and expensive, factories are unwilling to sell easily due to cost factors, making it difficult for prices to fall sharply. Factory flour, mixed brand flour, and unified flour all fell slightly by over 1,000 yuan. However, imported flour is easy to sell and fragrant, rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran has not escaped its weak situation, falling by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake digestion is quite sluggish, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Yingkou cake is declining by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, with few buyers. Soybeans are declining step by step, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Sesame is stable. There are few arrivals of red sorghum, and distilleries are actively buying, soaring by 10,000 yuan. Corn is readily accepted by alcohol factories, and inquiries from Beiyang are gradually increasing, continuing to skyrocket by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans are slightly purchased by merchants from other provinces, and local businesses are also buying. Zhejiang continues to move, increasing by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

There is little fluctuation in the oil market. Crude oil was initially weak and then firm, soybean oil was initially firm and then declined, with no gains or losses. Clear oil is temporarily stable. Vegetable oil is fluctuating. However, sesame oil is abundant and weak, falling by 10,000 yuan.

[Our Newspaper Report] The Da Ying Company's Delaware ship sailed to England the day before yesterday, loaded with 845 tons of soybean oil to the Netherlands, 26 tons of pig bristles, and several cases of tea to London.

### Sugar Market Trend Flat and Weak

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and weak, with occasional small declines, and transactions remained sluggish, with no upward trend in sight.

### Export Management Committee to Discuss New Tea Purchase Prices Today

In order to develop tea exports, the government authorities, under the supervision of the Promotion Association, have entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to be responsible for purchases. It is learned that the Export Promotion Association is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting today to discuss issues such as the purchase price of this year's new tea. After the decision is made, the Central Trust Bureau will begin purchasing.

It is reported that tea merchants purchased approximately 60,000 dan of new tea from various regions and transported it to Shanghai, most of which was mortgaged to the China Farmers Bank. As of yesterday, the total amount of new tea mortgages at the bank was 30 billion yuan, all of which will be purchased by the government and exported. As for the old tea mortgaged last year, only Qimen tea has been purchased by the Central Trust Bureau due to its maturity, while the rest are still in dispute due to pricing issues, so a decision has not yet been made.

Tea Market Lively. Since various internal sales tea have been continuously purchased by local stores and merchants from various provinces, the market remained lively yesterday. Among them, low-end black tea in the Wuxi area was particularly popular, making the process smoother. The opening prices all fluctuated within a stable range. It is expected that there is still hope for further progress in the future. As for the foreign tea market, the situation remains quiet, and the trend continues to be calm.

### The Decline of "Sharkskin"

"Sharkskin" is a product that sells best during the hot summer. Initially, two sets of worsted suits were provided, but there are no sales this summer. Because the sellers did not order from the United States, and the buyers have no need. As a result, the local factory has not launched new products. Nowadays, more people wear plastic-coated Hong Kong shirts, resulting in the "sharkskin" sales being bleak, and are about to be eliminated.

Jinshan Twigs Weaken. Because Jinshan twigs continue to arrive recently, and the sales are sluggish, the price has weakened again. The market has fallen by another 100,000 yuan yesterday, and the production price may fall.

Lily bulbs are occasionally transported, resulting in an oversupply. The asking price has also continued to fall. The current market has entered the 800,000 yuan range, down by about one-third compared to the highest price. At 800,000 yuan, the profit is only meager, and the owners inevitably suffer losses.

Bank Communication Publication. The new 20th issue of the "Bank Communication" monthly magazine, which comprehensively covers economics and finance, was published yesterday, featuring works by Tan Bingwen, Zhang Baiyi, Yu Zengkang, Cai Zhihua, Lu Zhaohua, Zhu Youying, and others.

### Director of Qingdao Observatory Discusses Mysterious Flying Saucers with Our Reporter

[Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, Qingdao Air Mail] Wang Huawen, Director of the Qingdao Observatory, uses a scientific viewpoint to explain the mystery of "flying saucers." The so-called scientific method emphasizes evidence and analysis. Therefore, Mr. Wang said that no matter what, the so-called "flying saucers" discovered everywhere include misidentified "weather balloons," but he does not affirm that all of them are mistakes involving balloons. Because, as of now, there is really no definite evidence to prove the existence of the so-called flying saucers.

This matter was spread from one person to ten, and from ten people to a hundred. After being published in newspapers, it became a worldwide sensation. It is like the story of "Zengzi Killing Someone," where even if you don't believe it, you have to believe it. But in fact, there is no such thing at all. I think it is very likely that it is entirely a misidentification of balloons.

As far as the reporter knows, radio weather balloons were first designed successfully by the Germans. They contain a barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, each with a lead wire. When the three meters change, the lead wire triggers the attached electrical device, causing the oscillation frequency of the internal radio transmitter to change, which is received by a specially made receiver on the ground. It is not the general so-called transmitter. It transmits once every three or five minutes in rotation. The principle is simple, and the structure is also very easy. The report that a professor in Chengdu said it was dropped by an airplane seems to be incorrect. It is released from the ground to high altitude.

During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to find out the climate in Chongqing for bombing purposes, the Japanese often sent reconnaissance planes to release these instruments over Chongqing, still suspended by balloons, because the Japanese could not release them on the ground in Chongqing, so they used airplanes. Some were recovered by us. People were sent from the Military Affairs Department to study it. At that time, in general, little attention was paid to meteorology (even at the beginning of the war, weather forecasts were still made). After studying this box containing a "small light bulb," it was found to be a radio for meteorological reporting. We once wanted to imitate it. Everything was easy, even the vacuum tube as small as a finger was not difficult. The battery seemed to be a big problem. It was not easy for a dry battery as small as two mahjong tiles to emit 45 volts of electricity. This is a problem of Chinese industrial technology.

Most of the ones discovered in various parts of China now are released by Americans. Sino-American meteorology is a cooperative effort. The Sino-American Cooperation Organization included this part of the work in its anti-Japanese work. Such a box currently costs about ten to twenty US dollars. Chinese weather stations cannot afford to release them. If they don't release them, they don't release them, but if they want to release them, they must release them every day in order to obtain records. As for Shanghai and Chengdu, I can deeply believe that they are released by the US military. They do this work regularly. As for other places, they are mostly just balloons, as Mr. Wang Huawen said. Therefore, flying saucers are actually common, but they are not usually noticed.

(Above) The Qingdao Observatory was first compiled by Germans. This year marks the 50th anniversary. There are three major meteorological stations on the Chinese coast: Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, but this station is presided over by Chinese people.

The top is a balloon, and the bottom is a radio box, which houses meteorological, humidity, and pressure meters, as well as vacuum tubes and batteries, and other components.

### Flying Saucer: Mysterious Monster or Weather Balloon?

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao] Mr. Wang Huawen, Director of the Qingdao Observatory, at the request of our reporter, painstakingly wrote a manuscript detailing the shapes of flying saucers and weather balloons. The original text is recorded below:

Recently, people on both the eastern and western shores of the Pacific, in both China and America, have successively discovered aerial monsters – flying saucers or flying discs. Because this event is rare, and because the power of the atomic bomb has just caused people to be startled, and US-Soviet relations are delicate, with tensions running high, the widespread rumors of this monster in the American sky easily cause people to connect it with the atomic bomb, neglecting its scientific exploration and focusing on its military consequences. At the same time, after the incident at Beita Mountain in our country, Soviet planes assisted the Mongolian army in the invasion, stirring up public outrage. The Sino-Soviet "Treaty of Friendship" is being re-evaluated in the hearts of the people. Within our country, from Hong Kong and Guangdong in the south to Shenyang in the north, from Xi'an in the west to Qingdao in the east, flying saucers have been successively discovered in the air, further fueling speculation and unease among the general public. Based on recent news reports about flying saucers from various sources, opinions differ, and there is no actual data available for research. I dare not make arbitrary judgments to determine their authenticity. However, from individual news reports, one can imagine that some observers describe what they see as unimaginable mysterious monsters—flying saucers or flying discs. But it is also possible that some are weather balloons released by meteorological observatories, mistaken by people. Although the use of weather balloons in meteorology is widespread, it seems that people in our country lack sufficient understanding of them. Here, I will briefly explain the general phenomena of weather balloons, so that in the future, when similar mysterious objects are discovered in the sky again, the observers can enhance their ability to distinguish.

There are many methods for high-altitude weather observation, including airplanes, kites, and balloons. Among balloons, there are manned balloons, tethered balloons, meteorological balloons, cloud-measuring balloons, wind-measuring balloons, and radio sounding balloons. We collectively call them weather balloons. Among these types of weather balloons, manned balloons and tethered balloons are now almost entirely abandoned. Moreover, these either have observers accompanying their ascent or are tethered by ropes at a fixed height, floating in space with limited movement, making it unlikely for them to be mistaken for flying saucers or flying discs. Those that are most likely to cause misunderstandings are the remaining types of weather balloons. Among them, meteorological balloons and radio sounding balloons are very large, with a diameter of about two or three meters on the ground. They carry instruments for measuring high-altitude temperature, humidity, and pressure, respectively. They can ascend to the stratosphere, which is over 17,000 meters high. As the altitude increases, the air becomes thinner, and the atmospheric pressure decreases, increasing the size of the balloon. Eventually, the balloon bursts and falls back to earth. Because they drift in the air with the wind, their paths are inconsistent. The speed of horizontal movement depends on the high-altitude wind speed. After the meteorological balloon bursts, the instruments it carries fall to the ground. The self-recording curves of temperature, humidity, and pressure in the instrument are examined to obtain high-altitude exploration records. However, meteorological balloons often land hundreds of miles away from the release site and sometimes fall into lakes, seas, or wilderness, making them difficult to retrieve. Therefore, radio sounding balloons are often used instead. The instrument carries specially made temperature, humidity, and pressure meteorological instruments that can automatically transmit the above three meteorological elements from high altitude via radio signals. The ground can directly receive or plot them into graphs, which is safe and fast. Therefore, radio sounding balloons are now mostly used to replace meteorological balloons. As for cloud-measuring and wind-measuring balloons, the former explores the height of the cloud base, and the latter measures high-altitude wind direction and speed. The balloon size is smaller, with a diameter of about one meter on the ground. After ascending, its orientation is observed using theodolites. Cloud-measuring balloons aim to explore the height of cloud layers, so they are released in cloudy weather. The height at which they are visible from the ground is limited by the height of the cloud base and is generally not very high. Wind-measuring balloons can be observed to altitudes of over 10,000 meters in theodolites. In clear weather, they can be seen with the naked eye, even at altitudes of 7,000 to 8,000 meters, if observed carefully. Although meteorological balloons, cloud-measuring balloons, wind-measuring balloons, and radio sounding balloons differ slightly in size and ascent altitude, they also have some common points that can be summarized as follows:

(1) Color: Red, black, white, and silver-gray are the most common colors, depending on the color of the sky background to determine which to use. (2) Shape: Mostly spherical, but sometimes, due to uneven thickness of the balloon skin, the pressure is uneven after filling with hydrogen, resulting in an ellipsoidal shape. When viewed from the ground, only the cross-section is seen, resulting in a circular or elliptical shape. (3) Speed: The ascent speed is approximately from 100 to 300 meters per minute. Depending on the needs, it can be calculated from the weight of the balloon skin and the amount of hydrogen stored. The horizontal speed depends on the wind speed in the upper air. (4) Direction: The direction of the balloon depends on the high-altitude wind direction. Because high-altitude wind directions are variable, the direction of the balloon's movement is not only necessarily consistent with the ground wind direction, but also may not be the same at different altitude layers.

The above four are the common characteristics of weather balloons. What about flying saucers or flying discs? However, no one has directly obtained a flying saucer or flying disc to study it in detail. At most, one can only obtain some concepts from news reports. Based on the news materials obtained, the so-called flying saucers are:

(1) Color: White or silver-gray. (2) Shape: Circular, with a diameter ranging from four or five meters to twenty-five feet. (3) Speed: Some rise slowly, while others are as fast as shooting stars. (4) Direction: Some fly from northeast to southwest, while others fly southeast.

The above four points cannot be conclusively defined as the common characteristics of flying saucers or flying discs. Moreover, based on a single record, one cannot determine that the direction is always from northeast to southwest, or directly to the southeast, and the speed variation is too large. Those that are as fast as shooting stars can be definitely determined to be beyond the reach of weather balloons. However, in the case of those that rise slowly, even if their color, shape, speed, and direction are the same as weather balloons, it cannot be determined that those that conform to the above four common characteristics are weather balloons, just as "a horse is a four-legged animal, but not all four-legged animals are horses." Only when someone obtains this kind of flying saucer, with concrete evidence, can it be proven to be a meteorological exploration instrument.

Although the previously discovered flying saucers or flying discs may be a new and mysterious object, at the very least, at least some of them are weather balloons released by meteorological observatories, mistaken by people. Because the international situation is urgent, and people are mentally uneasy, it is easy to lead discerning people to discover miracles in space. Therefore, when the news of flying discs or flying saucers was rampant, when Professor Einstein stated that he had "no comments to make," the US Air Force searched the skies day and night. Their spirit of scientific exploration to get to the bottom of things is indeed admirable, but it can be asserted that their focus on exploring military effects far outweighs their interest in scientific research.

Currently, it is still impossible to determine what flying saucers or flying discs are, but it is not without reason that some of them may be mistaken for weather balloons. For example, according to the Ludong News Agency's Qingdao dispatch on the 18th, "An object similar to a flying saucer was discovered over the city (on the 18th) at 9:42 a.m., but it is impossible to provide more compelling evidence to prove that it was a flying saucer. When discovered, it was at an altitude of 2,000 feet, in the northwest direction, sometimes rising, sometimes falling. The object was round and luminous, flying from northwest to southeast. After about five or six minutes, it rose higher and flew away. The reporter was present at the time, and the general onlookers (about twenty people) discussed it, all wondering what it was." Although the author did not witness the object similar to the flying saucer at the time, after examining the Qingdao Observatory's weather balloon records for that day, the observatory released a balloon at 9:00 a.m. The balloon was milky white, rising at a speed of about 180 meters per minute. On that day, the wind at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 meters was from the northwest, with a very low speed of about seven or eight kilometers per hour. The balloon should have drifted from northwest to southeast with the wind. Therefore, the flying saucer discovered by Qingdao citizens seems to be related to the balloon released by the observatory on that day, in terms of time, altitude, shape, or direction of flight. However, we cannot determine that it must be a balloon and not a "flying saucer." This article only provides the above-mentioned points where balloons and so-called flying saucers or flying discs can be traced. As for what flying saucers or flying discs are, it remains to be observed further and analyzed before a determination can be made. In this autumn of knife-light sword shadows and bewildering international situations, the frequent appearance of flying saucers is indeed giving people considerable vigilance, fear, and unease, but careful examination and discernment are also needed for us to seek answers in calmness.

### Military Service Work in Various Places is Being Actively Promoted

Changshu [Special Dispatch] The conscription of new recruits here has already begun. The Military Service Association has appointed An Weifu, Zhao Mingjiong, and Wu Jianya as supervisors, Yu Jiuen, Xu Zuyin, and Ding Jianhui as welfare committee members, and engaged Ju Guanwen and others as physical examination doctors.

Wuxing [Special Dispatch] The County Military Service Association held its second meeting on the morning of the 30th, and decided to apply for exemption from military service, scheduled from August 1st to the end of the same month.

Xikang [Special Dispatch] The central government has approved the quota of conscripts for this province this year as 2,700. It started in June and will be completed in three months. Because the population of this province is sparse, and it is divided into Kang, Luo, and Han ethnic groups, the Kang and Luo ethnic groups are temporarily difficult to conscript due to special circumstances, while the total Han population is about one million, and the number of men of conscription age (20 years old) is small. The provincial government has requested the Ministry of National Defense to consider reducing the quota appropriately and to postpone the conscription to September.

### A Tragicomic Legend: Zhang Xiuhong Sells Herself to Bury Her Mother-in-Law, Wang Binglin Redeems His Beloved Wife

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao] Wang Binglin, who lives in the city of Jiaoxian, has a well-off family and both parents. He grew up with Zhang Xiuhong, a girl next door, and called each other brothers and sisters. After getting engaged, they became even more affectionate. On the eve of the "July 7th" Incident, Wang Binglin graduated from high school, and Zhang Xiuhong also finished junior high school. Wang Binglin and several classmates resolutely joined the army and went south with the army. Zhang Xiuhong, suppressing her sorrow, encouraged her husband to pursue his ambition and gave him a self-made exquisite handkerchief as a souvenir. Wang joined the military academy and soon went to war in the north and south. After the victory, he worked as a staff officer in a certain unit in Anhui Province. With no one to serve his elderly mother, his parents-in-law sent Xiuhong to Wang's house to serve her mother-in-law. Who knew that last year, the communists captured the city, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law fled to Qingdao together, living with relatives at No. 250 Shenyang Road in this city, depleting their resources. Because her mother-in-law was old and frail and suffered from panic, coupled with her longing for her son, she became seriously ill. Zhang Xiuhong borrowed money everywhere, but the medicine was ineffective, and her mother-in-law finally passed away. Unable to afford a burial, Xiuhong sold herself to the Cuixin Troupe in Pingkang Second Lane (under the alias Xiaoxi) and used the money to bury her. After the former Jiaoxian was recovered, Wang Binglin asked for leave to go home to visit his family and learned that his family had fled to Qingdao. After searching everywhere without success, he visited the red-light district and saw Xiaoxi in the Cuixi Troupe. He did not dare to recognize her rashly. The next day, he brought money to the Cuixi Troupe to redeem his wife Xiaoxi (Zhang Xiuhong). Zhang knew that it was her husband and hugged him crying bitterly. Xiuhong, feeling that her purity had been tarnished, had no face to serve the gentleman again and wanted to die to thank him for his kindness. Wang, feeling her chastity and integrity, persuaded her with kind words and decided to live together to repay her kindness of burying her mother. It is reported that Wang will take his wife back to Anhui to resume his duties within days. (29th)

### The Seven Days and Nights of Bloodshed in Teng County

Teng is a small country. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, should it serve Qi or Chu in diplomacy? Existing in the cracks between the two great powers, depending on others' moods and expressions, was really not an easy task. But no one could have expected that 2,500 to 600 years later, Teng County would become a key area for both sides in the military struggle for national resistance and suppression of rebellion. In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, the Japanese army's Seishiro Itagaki and Renkai Isogai attacked Xuzhou from the north and south. Our 24th Army's Commander Wang Mingzhang of the Deng Xihou Department shed his blood in the isolated city and died in battle in Teng County, sacrificing himself for the national resistance.

On July 12th of this year, the Communist Army's East China Field Army, under the command of Chen Yi and Ye Jianying, invaded Teng County. After seven days of fierce fighting by our 20th Division Commander Yang Gancai of the 24th Army of the Organized Army, they were dealt a head-on blow. The former sacrificed his life, and the latter succeeded. Both were from the 24th Army, leaving behind a glorious record in the process of resisting Japan and suppressing the rebellion.

Teng County is located on the front line of the Jinpu Railway, on the south bank of Nanliangjiang, and faces Fengpei across Weishan Lake in the west. In order to realize the plan of "capturing Teng County to welcome the upcoming counter-offensive," the Communist Army, led by Ye Jianying's 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns, launched a two-pronged attack on Tai'an from Xintai and Laiwu, along the highway north of the Ru River and Wen River, before pointing west to Feicheng and Pingyin; another route was led by Liu Bocheng, leading the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, crossing the river from northern Henan, attempting to encompass western Shandong and invade Jining from the east; Chen Yi personally commanded the main force of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 7th Columns, spying on Feixian, entering and leaving Yixian and Zaozhuang, vainly attempting to expand the Menglianggu encirclement operation against Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division, forcing Commander Li Yutang of our Xuyan Pacification District to fight on the inner line and annihilate it. Before the war began, Teng County was originally the seat of the Xuyan Pacification District Command. After the war began, the entire 20th Division took on the responsibility of defending Teng County.

Yang Gancai, the defending general of Teng County and commander of the 20th Division, was an old cadre of the Sichuan Army's 20th Army, who participated in the "1911 Revolution and the 1919 Resistance Against Britain." The initial leader of the 20th Army was General Yang Zihui (Sen), the current Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. During the Anti-Japanese War, he supported Shanghai, guarded Anqing, and fought in Hunan and Hubei to block the enemy in Guizhou and Guangxi. After the First Battle of Changsha, Yang Sen was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the 27th Army Group, and Yang Jichao (Hanyu) succeeded as Army Commander. In the spring of the 34th year of the Republic, Yang Jichao and Ding Zhipan, the current Qingdao Garrison Commander, were successively promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 27th Army Group, and Yang Gancai was promoted from Commander of the 134th Division and Deputy Commander of the 20th Army to Army Commander. After the Japanese surrendered, he was ordered to receive Guilin and Liuzhou and garrison Changsha. After being reorganized into the 20th Division last winter, he was transferred to southern Shandong. Division Commander Yang has a long face, high cheekbones, and a tall stature. He speaks pure Sichuan dialect, can write well, writes a good Diamond Sutra, and has a large capacity for alcohol. In terms of seniority, he is a clan nephew of Deputy Commander Yang Hanyu and a grand-nephew of Chairman Yang Sen. He is an outstanding young general in the "Yang Family Generals."

In this defense of Teng County, Division Commander Yang Gancai's entire 20th Division, with only a meager force of the 133rd and 134th Brigades, resisted the Communist Army's 40,000 to 50,000 troops, shedding blood for seven days and nights, killing and wounding nearly 20,000 Communist troops, creating a great victory comparable to General Chen Mingren's defense of Siping with the 71st Army. Originally, most of the soldiers of the 20th Division were robust men from Sichuan, who were always good at fighting mobile warfare in mountainous areas. This time, they were able to display the spirit of "defending with firmness" and fought a positional war to defend Teng County, shattering the Communist Army's dreams of cutting off Xuyan, encircling Xuzhou, and capturing Jinan, so that Lin Biao did not succeed in the Northeast, and Chen Yi was still frustrated in southern Shandong. Recently, although the Communist Army has the intention of rekindling the flames and staging a comeback to attack Teng County again, it is believed that with Commander Li Yutang of the Xuyan Pacification District and Commander of the 24th Army, relying on the command experience of the Third Great Victory of Changsha in the past and Deputy Army Commander Fang Xianjue's 47-day defense of Hengyang, coupled with the spirit of the 20th Division under Division Commander Yang Gancai, who fights ten battles and wins ten victories, the Communist Army flying moths into the fire is tantamount to self-destruction.

### On Hypertension and its New Therapies

— Liang Junqing

Sometimes, our doctors truly feel helpless when facing hypertension. Why? Because current therapies are often "comparative" rather than "absolute." We might cure one hypertensive patient with a particular method, but it could be completely ineffective for others. Conversely, we might cure a certain type of hypertension with another treatment, but it may not be applicable to a different type. Such examples are endless. In short, hypertension treatment is currently more "comparative" than "absolute." We also have the experience that lowering excessively high blood pressure often makes patients feel worse, causing dizziness, fatigue, and chest tightness, which only subsides when their blood pressure returns to its original level. Many famous old doctors in Shanghai also have high blood pressure and have tried numerous methods to treat it, but ultimately they can only let it run its course.

Of course, we also know that there are many causes of hypertension. For example, people who overuse their brains or overexert themselves can develop hypertension. People with kidney atrophy can also develop it. Additionally, there are hereditary hypertension, syphilitic, lead poisoning, chronic alcohol and tobacco poisoning, diabetes, and obesity, all of which can lead to hypertension. Our treatment methods naturally vary depending on the cause. However, regardless of the cause, the "goal" of trying to lower blood pressure is ultimately the same. Moreover, the various troubles that arise when blood pressure decreases from a high level (such as dizziness, chest tightness, general fatigue, and weakness) are still enough to trouble us. (For example, a doctor told me: "A patient came to the hospital for hypertension that persisted for a long time without any adverse symptoms. One day, the patient suddenly complained of discomfort, dizziness, fatigue, weakness in the limbs, and pallor. The doctor thought it was caused by excessive blood pressure and measured it, but it was only around 100 degrees. After repeated measurements, it was confirmed to be accurate. The doctor was very surprised and questioned the patient, who confessed to secretly swallowing a small amount of alum (a type of folk remedy). The doctor forbade him from continuing to take alum and treated him with other methods, but the patient's physical strength never recovered, and he eventually died.")

Indeed, many hypertensive patients, after undergoing various treatments with no results, adopt a laissez-faire attitude, with drinkers continuing to drink and smokers continuing to smoke, content to live one day at a time, and not thinking about the possible terrible consequences of high blood pressure.

Of course, many relatives and friends will certainly worry about the patient, fearing the risk of a ruptured blood vessel. But, strangely enough, they may not suffer a stroke. They have had high blood pressure for many years, yet they are still healthy and lively. This is truly an unsolvable mystery!

In recent years, the medical field has made significant achievements in vitamin research. Since it is beyond the scope of this article, I will only briefly mention it. However, those pharmaceutical experts have now extracted a substance from tobacco leaves that is somewhat similar to vitamin P. Its name is Rutin. It is the flavone of Quercetin. It can be extracted in large quantities from the leaves and flowers of buckwheat. Its function is to prevent blood vessels from becoming brittle (making them less likely to rupture) and to restore the elasticity of blood vessels to normal. (See the medical biological experiment report of Dr. Couch, Dr. Griffith, and Dr. Lindauer in 1944). Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. Med. 55, 228 (1944).

Based on this report, they (such as Shanno, Bridel & Beguin, etc.) have made continuous discoveries and progress in this area. Due to space constraints, I will have to omit it. However, we can all understand why many people with high blood pressure can continue to live safely without suffering a stroke. Because whether a blood vessel ruptures or not (i.e., whether a stroke occurs or not) seems to be related to high blood pressure on the surface, but in reality, it is not related at all. For example, a good car tire can be inflated to a high pressure of 45 or even 60 degrees and still be used normally without any problems. But if you use a tire that is already hard and brittle, it may rupture at any time when inflated to a pressure of 30 degrees. Therefore, whether a blood vessel ruptures or not is not a matter of the level of blood pressure, but a matter of the brittleness (fragility) of the blood vessel. In short, it is a matter of whether there is a lack of rutin in the blood vessel. If we have a sufficient amount of rutin in our bodies, then even if our blood pressure is high, there is no danger.

Good! Those of you who drink and smoke, you can reduce your worries from now on.

### Random Talks After Diagnosis (1)

— Wu Jihua

(1) The Economic Problem of Medication

The country is so impoverished, yet the people are still extravagant and wasteful, unaware of the need to be frugal and self-reliant, and to think about saving in order to preserve the nation's vitality. Thinking about this is truly heartbreaking. Since the victory of the war of resistance, the number of luxury cars on the roads has increased day by day, and the market is filled with luxury and consumer goods, such as famous cigarettes, famous wines, and expensive radios and refrigerators, which are dazzling to the eye. The enjoyment of these many wealthy families has certainly consumed huge amounts of foreign exchange; however, the poor's style is also no weaker. Men and women have a cigarette after a meal, students watch movies every day and learn to dance, and some even gamble mahjong all night long, which is especially absurd. The social atmosphere is so depraved, and the government has no measures to guide or correct it. Everyone only seeks to enjoy the present and doesn't care about tomorrow. To talk about the country's construction and revival after the war is truly a sigh.

The above is a general description of the wastefulness of our compatriots, which the author is very worried about. Without further ado, let's get back to the main topic. Speaking of the use of medication in our medical field, there are also many wasteful and uneconomical situations, which require the cooperation of both doctors and patients to save our resources and preserve our country's vitality. Now, let's list the market prices of several so-called expensive medicines as follows, as our target for review:

1. Eugon, 4,500,000 yuan per box (10 ampoules)

2. Padutin, 1,600,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)

3. Dolautin, 550,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)

4. Optarson, 680,000 yuan per box

5. Tonophosphan, 1,400,000 yuan per box

6. Spesminchering, 450,000 yuan per box

7. German-made "Baonuyong" injection, 700,000 yuan per box (1 ampoule)

8. Concentrated "Baonuyong" injection (Progynon B Oleosum), 2,400,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)

9. Schering Testoniron 10mg injection, 1,000,000 yuan per box (4 ampoules)

10. Schering Testoniron 25mg injection, 2,200,000 yuan per box (4 ampoules)

11. Calcium Ostelin "Glaxo", 400,000 yuan per bottle

12. Elbon tablets, 430,000 yuan per bottle (20 tablets)

13. Cossonol cough syrup, 120,000 yuan per 3 bottles (200cc)

14. Belladonna Neutralon, 460,000 yuan per box

Although the above medicines have considerable therapeutic effects, they are not life-saving magic drugs, nor are they unique medicines without similar substitutes. Therefore, it is simply irrational and wasteful to seek and purchase them at such high prices, creating opportunities for hoarding merchants to get rich. Although things are valued because they are rare, medicines are for treating diseases. They are not antiques and should not be sought after with an antique mentality to raise their value. If the price exceeds its deserved value, people will abandon it and not seek it. Can it raise its price on its own? If you go to the United States to observe or ask friends who have traveled to the United States, do people in that country seek out German-made or other scarce medicines at surprisingly high prices? They will definitely tell you that such foolish and wasteful behavior is extremely rare in the United States. Therefore, I believe that many unreasonable and ridiculed events in our country are caused by the shallow level of education, the lack of common sense among the people, the reluctance of highly educated people to teach their compatriots, and the arrogance of some compatriots who refuse to learn. Even regarding the waste of medication we are discussing now, I believe that the health bureau, doctors, and patients should all bear considerable responsibility, and hoarding merchants who raise prices should be punished. After I evaluate each of the above medicines and discuss how to replace them, I will explain why all three parties should be responsible.

### Sunlight and Health (Part 1)

— Yu Zhengxing

"Sunlight, the source of life," is praised in the pens of poets, on the papers of writers, and even in the mouths of literati for its greatness and sanctity. It not only brings light to humanity, but also brings strength.

Sunlight is the root of life for all living things. Human survival is inextricably linked to it. Without sunlight, there would be no life in the world. We should understand something that is so related to our lives.

The relationship between sunlight and humans and their health can be described in several points:

First, the relationship to human material metabolism: Human material metabolism is enhanced by the influence of sunlight. The most important phenomenon is respiration. If we use a device to calculate the carbon dioxide exhaled from the lungs during respiration and measure the degree of other material metabolism, we will know that respiration increases significantly after the body is exposed to sunlight, and the amount of metabolic products such as urine and sweat also increases.

Second, the relationship to the physical development of children: Sunlight has an even greater relationship to the physical development of children. Children develop better in summer than in winter. Therefore, we see that children in tropical regions develop significantly faster than children in colder regions. This confirms that sunlight can promote physical development and growth. Also, some children who cannot walk have pale complexions because they are often kept indoors and lack sunlight. In industrial and foggy areas, urban children are prone to rickets, all due to lack of sunlight exposure.

Third, the relationship to the physical development of the general population: People who live in dark places, such as basements, cellars, and deep valleys, are prone to mental fatigue and have withered appearances. It is very different for those who often run in the sunlight. Because light is energy, when it shines on the human body, tissues can absorb the energy of light and convert it into heat. Therefore, part of the heat in the human body is obtained from light and becomes the kinetic energy for the body's work, such as blood production and metabolism, which are mostly promoted by sunlight energy. The most obvious example is that after the human body is exposed to sunlight, the tyrosine contained in the skin is oxidized and converted into melanin. Melanin is deposited in the middle of the epidermis and dermis and has the function of protecting the body. Because melanin can absorb ultraviolet rays and prevent ultraviolet rays from entering the deep layers and destroying tissue cells, it can also absorb ultraviolet rays and convert them into heat, sending it into the body and stimulating the functions of various tissues. Therefore, dark skin is a symbol of "healthy beauty," but excessive sun exposure causes melanin to lose its protective effect, and the skin can also become inflamed.

Fourth, the relationship to patients or the infirm: In today's medical treatment, the sunbathing used for patients or the infirm is a treatment method that uses sunlight to allow its vitality to reach deep into the inner layers. There are many benefits to regular sunbathing, such as after the human body is directly exposed to sunlight, the skin absorbs ultraviolet rays and can produce vitamin D. Therefore, sunlight has the effect of preventing rickets. Many countries often hold summer camping trips, the biggest purpose of which is to take a lot of sun baths.

Fifth, the relationship to nerves: People's nervous systems can also feel the stimulation of light, especially the eyes, which can mediate the phenomenon of light and cause special psychological reactions. For example, living in a room with red light makes people feel very happy and always like to run around, unwilling to sit still. Also, walking in a vegetable garden, with the vegetable flowers like a golden carpet, coupled with the warm spring sunshine, makes one feel refreshed and extremely happy. On the other hand, living in a house illuminated by green light for a long time gradually makes people feel unhappy, their spirits become calm, and their movements are suppressed. Also, if the room is carpeted with blue felt, it feels larger than its actual area and feels empty and cold. These are all effects of sunlight on the nervous system.

Sixth, the relationship to killing microorganisms: Sunlight has a great effect, which is to kill microorganisms. For example, pathogenic bacteria such as cholera and typhoid fever die within a few hours of direct sunlight exposure. Even the most resistant tubercle bacillus dies within a few hours of direct sunlight exposure. It has now been proven that sunlight can treat bone tuberculosis and tuberculosis of the skin, glands, or internal abdomen. However, if sunlight treatment is used for pulmonary tuberculosis, it should be under the guidance of a doctor, otherwise, it is often very dangerous. Furthermore, according to the experimental research of scholars, in high mountains and deserts, the time it takes for sunlight to kill bacteria is three or four times faster than in plains and cities, because the air in those places is thinner, there is more ultraviolet radiation, and it is dry and clean!

Seventh, the relationship to the land: The place where we live should be dry, not humid, to avoid inducing disease, because sunlight can dry the land, which is most hygienic. (To be continued)

### Random Talks on Typhoid Treatment (Part 2)

— Shou Wuqing

(6) Treatment of Intestinal Hemorrhage

Intestinal hemorrhage is an important complication of typhoid fever, and it is often seen in clinical practice. It is caused by ulceration of the intestinal wall, extending to deeper layers and invading the blood vessel walls. The amount of bleeding is directly related to the patient's safety. In addition to surgical operations and blood transfusions, as well as hemostatic injections, internal administration of hemostatic tablets, hypnotics, and tranquilizers should be used. At the same time, patients should be encouraged not to panic, to stay in bed and stop eating and moving for at least 48 hours. Unless specifically instructed by the doctor, give one or two teaspoons of liquid food every two hours, and then gradually increase the amount.

(7) Treatment of Intestinal Perforation

In high fever of typhoid, the abdomen often swells like a drum. If gas (farting) is not smooth, there is a risk of intestinal perforation. The degree of perforation varies, with one or several holes of different sizes. If the body temperature suddenly drops, the complexion changes suddenly, the pulse is rapid, thin, deep, and weak, and the breath is like a gossamer, and there is severe abdominal pain, the occurrence of this symptom should be suspected. There is a great danger to life. Small holes can also be naturally filled and healed. If there is no occurrence of enteritis, the outcome is better. For most holes, surgical suture should be performed according to the condition. Although the risk is greater, it is better than leaving it untreated and dying.

In short, typhoid fever is a disease that changes in thousands of ways and should be dealt with flexibly, only in the ingenuity of the doctor. How can dozens of words give a glimpse of the whole picture? However, being precise, concise, and succinct is like one corner of an encyclopedia. Taking one example and extrapolating to others, I hope readers will use it well.

Jun Qing's Note: Sulfaguanidine should be added to the treatment of typhoid fever, because the author has used this medicine for typhoid patients, and the results have been very effective. Although this medicine is a specific medicine for treating dysentery bacilli, its bactericidal effect on typhoid bacteria is also very great. (End)

### Saving the Declining Morale of Students

— Shilang

We are not "revivalists" who must sourly advocate some kind of formal "respect for teachers" or restore the kind of pedantic "blind obedience" relationship between teachers and students from the past.

We believe that the modern teacher-student relationship should be more democratic, more intimate, and more friendly, with mutual cooperation, mutual research, and mutual discussion for academic ideas. Only this kind of teacher-student relationship can help the growth of academic science.

While we oppose that kind of autocratic, library-like, masked teacher-student relationship, we are truly chilled by the rudeness and violence of today's students towards their teachers.

We are very indignant to read that Jin Chengyang, a student at Tsinghua University, failed the Monetary Banking exam and actually used violence against Professor Zhao Shouxin, stabbing Professor Zhao with a dagger.

We should consider this kind of violent action a disgrace to the sacred land of academia.

However, cultivating an excellent "academic atmosphere" is not something that can be achieved overnight. In those "violent" and "arrogant" atmospheres, have students ever regarded the school as a "sacred place" of academia? Have they ever regarded teachers as respectable mentors? They only see the school as a "stepping stone" for "advancement." Under this circumstance, it is only natural for teachers to be "punched" and "insulted."

However, this "violent" spirit of the students must be corrected. Otherwise, this is nothing short of an insult to the Chinese medical academic community, and for the entire academic atmosphere, it will cause endless harm.

The Tsinghua student stabbing the professor with a knife is not the "cause," but the "consequence" of the declining student morale.

### Aung San and the Burmese Independence Movement

— Yifeng

Burma, on its way to striving for independence, suddenly experienced a bloody political assassination on July 19. The only young leader engaged in the Burmese independence movement, the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Burmese Provisional Government, Aung San, and seven of his cabinet members, unfortunately became the protagonists and victims of this assassination. This is naturally a very unfortunate sudden change in the process of the Burmese independence movement.

Aung San was born in 1914 and is only 32 years old this year. He received a completely British education. (Educated in Burma) In 1936, while still studying at Yangon University, he was enthusiastic about political activities. In that year, he was expelled by the school authorities for actively organizing student strikes. Since then, he has wholeheartedly strived to promote the independence movement of his motherland, so as to enable Burma to break away from British rule as soon as possible. Therefore, he gained power in politics very quickly and became the most intentional and outstanding figure in the political history of Burma in recent years.

In the early days of World War II, when Britain was losing in the West and had no time to look east, he had already emerged in Burma. During that period, he frequently maintained contact with Indian revolutionary leader Nehru and the leaders of the National Congress. At the same time, he also promoted contact between him and the Japanese, because at that time the Japanese were proclaiming that they would support the independence of the weak nations in the Far East. In 1942, Japan invaded Burma. Many Burmese who hated British rule expressed their willingness to cooperate with Japan, and Japan also nominally granted Burma independence. Aung San naturally stood on the side of cooperating with Japan at that time. He served as a minister in the Burmese government under Japanese protection and established the Burmese National Army. However, as he came into contact with Japan for a long time, he discovered that Japan's control of Burma was still completely imperialistic and had no sincerity in helping Burma achieve independence. He woke up, so he used his position as a cover to encourage the expansion of the resistance movement, making him the leader of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, a united resistance of all parties and strata in Burma, and the leader of the Burmese National Army. When Japan surrendered in 1945, the National Army he led worked closely with the British Indian Army and won the praise of Lord Mountbatten.

After the liberation of Burma, the British government announced that it would grant Burma dominion status, but did not specify a deadline for completing this step. He and the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League believed that the White Paper did not meet their political aspirations, so they refused to cooperate with Thomes Smith's provisional government. By the autumn of 1946, it was proven that the White Paper policy had completely failed, so Sir Lans replaced Thomes Smith and obtained the cooperation of Aung San and his leadership alliance, integrating the Burmese national movement with the reconstruction work. Aung San then joined the Executive Council, serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Foreign Affairs. The Alliance also became the only majority party in the Executive Council. The resolution of the Executive Council in November of last year demanded that British forces quickly withdraw from Burma, with economic and military measures being taken in tandem, strongly expressing Aung San's political will. At the same time, in order to adhere to the middle political line, he expelled the Burmese Communist Party from the alliance at the same meeting. At that time, he certainly obtained British Prime Minister Attlee's deeper understanding of the future of Burma's independence and issued a promise allowing the Burmese to freely decide their own future destiny. However, on the other hand, it aroused the jealousy of the old Burmese political parties. They formed the National Democratic United Front, standing in opposition to his alliance. The leader of this front is precisely the former Prime Minister U Su, who is now arrested as a suspect in the assassination case.

Therefore, the internal cause of Aung San's assassination is considered by British observers to be the fundamental conflict between the extreme left-wing anti-fascist alliance's political views and the opposition's jealousy, which is very likely. Naturally, Aung San's death is a great loss in the path of Burma's struggle for independence. The mourning and glory of his death can also show the Burmese people's respect and love for him. In particular, Attlee's statement that the British government will not change its established policy of allowing Burma to be independent due to the assassination proves that Aung San's efforts were not in vain.

### Japanese Spies

— Translated by Zhengming

A former operative of the Japanese spy network recently told this author that the vast network of the Japanese Communist Party in the occupied areas of China and Northeast China had been collecting important intelligence for the Chinese Communist Party until 1942 when it ceased operations.

This former Japanese spy operative had lived in Shanghai and the Northeast for many years, and since the end of the war, has written several very famous books about China. He was elected to the Japanese House of Councillors as a member of the Japanese Communist Party in April.

In early 1942, most of the Japanese Communist Party spies were discovered and arrested. Therefore, the various espionage activities carried out for the Chinese Communist Party were greatly reduced from that time onwards.

The spy group to which this spy operative belonged was composed of about thirty Japanese Communist Party members within the South Manchuria Railway Research Bureau. This South Manchuria Railway Research Bureau employed approximately one thousand staff and had representatives stationed in major cities in occupied China to collect economic data. These thirty Japanese Communist Party members formed their own organization within the Research Bureau because they could utilize almost all of the bureau's research work to provide intelligence to the Chinese Communist Party.

He himself was stationed in Shanghai, serving as an advisor to three major Japanese organizations, one of which was a secret espionage organization. He managed to transfer valuable intelligence regarding Japan's economic, political, and military plans in China to the New Fourth Army.

Later, this Japanese Communist Party spy group in China was discovered as an indirect result of a famous spy case that was broken. One of the personnel in that famous spy case was once a secretary to Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and also a secretary to the Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany. He was arrested on October 15, 1941, at which time the Japanese secret police discovered that they were all key figures in a spy center directed by the Comintern. They were all executed in prison.

Of the one hundred people arrested, twenty were executed. Five others died in prison; the rest were released after the war. Two people, including himself, were sentenced to life imprisonment in September 1945, after the end of the war, due to "forced confessions" and repeated extensions of the interrogation period. Therefore, they were all freed a few days later.

Now, he and other Japanese Communist Party spies who once risked their lives to help the Chinese Communist Party forces are engaged in writing and publishing articles about China and other less dangerous professions. (Translated from the original by Hugh Deane)

### Miscellany from America

— Xu Shuyuan

The Writers' Association of America

Every major city in the United States has organizations similar in nature to the Writers' Association, differing only in name, and slightly varying in their operations. Some are called Writers' Clubs, others Scribblers' Clubs, some are purely literary, others have a bit of a commercial bent. Purely literary writers' associations hold tea parties or dinners once or twice a week. Tea parties are held at members' homes, dinners at restaurants, and expenses are shared by the participants, paying on the spot. From a Chinese perspective, this seems quite stingy, because a tea party for thirty or forty people costs only ten-odd US dollars, requiring each person to chip in three or four dimes. In fact, it's a completely democratic approach, where everyone is a host. At tea parties or dinners, there are several items on the agenda, such as introducing new members, guest speeches, reading papers or poems. These papers are lengthy and tedious; good works have already been snatched up by publishing houses and published, not waiting to be read at the writers' association. Poetry is more relaxed, and is often bought by music publishing companies. Female writers like to print their proudest poems on New Year's cards and distribute them to relatives and friends, using it as self-promotion. Writers' associations also introduce members' works to small publishers for publication, and short stories to local newspapers for publication, but the fees are extremely limited. A female writer in Denver published four books through a publisher, receiving a fee of three hundred dollars for each, which, calculated at the black market exchange rate, is more than 12 million legal currency, enough to make Chinese writers stick out their tongues in amazement, but three hundred US dollars for a book is truly miserable in the United States. The American publishing industry has a big problem: it doesn't nurture the unknown, it only promotes established writers. Americans read books not for the content, but only for the author's reputation. Works like those of Mr. Lin Yutang and Emily Hahn will spread like wildfire in the United States, fully demonstrating Americans' "hero-worshipping" sentiment and herd mentality when reading. Famous writers do not join writers' associations, but those who join writers' associations are those whose works have no way out and want to use the meager influence of the writers' association to promote immature works. As a result, works sent to the writers' association are like stones sinking into the sea, and only after a year or six months are they published in newspapers in remote areas, truly making the writer laugh and cry.

Scientific Essay

### Lingzhi (Part 2)

— Jia Zuzhang

Now, emperors are long gone, and lingzhi is no longer offered as tribute. But history is a heavy burden for humanity, and the traditional superstition about lingzhi from over two thousand years ago still lies dormant in the depths of people's hearts, ready to stir. This year, especially, is a year when lingzhi is repeating its fate. In February, someone held a lingzhi charity exhibition to help students, and now there is another lingzhi charity exhibition to support education. However, I heard that the previous charity exhibition to help students did not have very good results. The reason for this is not difficult to guess because lingzhi was originally a treasure that the common people offered to the emperor, and the emperor had the right to demand contributions from the common people unconditionally. By extension, all wealthy and powerful people have the right to exploit those less fortunate than themselves as much as possible. Now, to go against this and make the wealthy pluck one or two hairs to help poor students is like seeking skins from a tiger. It is inevitable that good results will not be obtained, and what is the purpose of studying anyway? Now, in order to study, we are actually going to restore ancient superstitions, which is nothing more than pursuing the end and not choosing the means.

Although we know that it is always good to compliment others, "I love my teacher, but I love truth even more." Revealing the truth of the facts and reducing the elements of superstition is ultimately more important than merely flattering. The era of lingzhi's "spirituality" has passed, let it return to its original face. Lingzhi belongs to a type of fungus in the Polyporaceae family. The characteristics of this family are: fruiting bodies are membranous, leathery, corky, or fleshy, with or without stalks. The hymenium grows on the inner surface of the hymenial tubes under the fruiting body. The tubes are reticulately connected wrinkles or honeycomb-like pores, and a few are composed of ring-shaped lamellae. One lingzhi is one fruiting body. When it first emerges, it is slender like a pen, then the lower part becomes the stipe, and the upper part expands into a fan-shaped pileus. Like shiitake mushrooms, the stipe is attached to the center of the circular pileus, while lingzhi is attached to one side. The upper surface of the pileus is brown or reddish-brown, with concentric ring patterns; the lower surface is light yellow or white; the stipe is brown and shiny. The texture is hard, and it can be preserved for a long time when dried. The color can have variations in shade, with purple being the most common, so it is called purple lingzhi, which is a true description. Red lingzhi has also had scientific records, black lingzhi probably refers to those with particularly dark colors; white lingzhi and yellow lingzhi are probably due to the particularly prominent color of the lower surface of the pileus; green lingzhi seems to be impossible, or perhaps close to black!

The old records of the morphology of lingzhi, Wei Xi of the Three Kingdoms period, had a eulogy of divine lingzhi, which was meticulous, clear, and in accordance with the spirit of science: "In the first year of Qinglong (233 AD), divine lingzhi was produced in Xiyang of Changping. Its color was reddish-purple, its texture was radiant, its length was one foot eight inches and five points, the circumference of its base was three inches and three points, the upper part was divided into three trunks, divided into nine branches, scattered into twenty-six stems, and the circumference was one inch and nine points. The leaf diameter was two inches and seven points. The trunks were connected and interwoven, resembling the shape of coral. Its protruding twigs carried leaves, auspiciously bright and clean. Examining the patterns and documents, it is indeed more beautiful than what was heard in the past." But the stipe of this lingzhi is branched, which is what is called joined-stalk lingzhi. This is probably an accidental bifurcation of the stipe, or several lingzhi growing in the same place, and the stipes fuse together.

In addition to the teratoma of the stipe branching, there is also one stalk that simultaneously produces several pilei, as recorded in the History of the Song Dynasty: "In May of the sixth year of Xianping, Pan Ju, a resident of Daojiang County, grew lingzhi in three layers, yellow-purple in color, and about five inches in height."

Lingzhi parasitizes on the parts of trees close to the ground, such as plum, peach, fir, and bamboo. First, white hyphae spread under the bark, and then fruiting bodies sprout outward from the hyphae. The ancients did not observe the hyphae, so they said it "grows without roots" and thought it was very magical.

Now, on the stalls of itinerant medicine men and in the display windows of antique shops, we can see lingzhi. The uses of lingzhi are actually limited to these.
